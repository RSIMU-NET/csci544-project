The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) significantly changed federal welfare policy for low-income families with children, building upon and expanding state-level reforms. It ended the federal entitlement to assistance for eligible needy families with children under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, designed to help needy families reduce their dependence on welfare and move toward economic independence. The TANF block grant, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), makes $16.5 billion available to states each year, regardless of changes in the number of people receiving benefits. To qualify for their full TANF allotments, states must spend a certain amount of state money, referred to as maintenance-of-effort (MOE) funds.", "My testimony today will focus on three key issues: (1) the extent of caseload decline since welfare reform was implemented and the status of families who have left welfare, (2) the extent to which states are spending TANF and MOE funds for cash assistance and noncash services and how this compares to welfare spending in fiscal year 1995, and (3) the extent to which states are using TANF and MOE funds to provide services to low- income families not included in the welfare caseload reported by states to HHS. To address the first key issue, we used information from our 1999 review of state studies and more recent studies. To address the second key issue we analyzed information on spending by all 50 states. To address the third key issue, we visited 5 states (California, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin) and telephoned 20 other states. Together, these are the 25 states that receive the most TANF dollars. We conducted our work from August 2001 through March 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, as states implemented work-focused reforms during a period of strong economic growth, cash assistance caseloads dropped by more than 50 percent from 1996 through mid-2001. Our work and other studies have shown that most former welfare recipients who left the welfare rolls were employed at some point after leaving welfare, typically with earnings that did not raise them above the poverty level. This emphasis on work was accompanied by changes in welfare spending, with the focus of welfare spending shifting from monthly cash payments to services, such as child care and transportation to help working families. This shift reflects two key features of reform. First, many states have increased spending to engage more welfare families in work or work-related activities and to provide more intensive services for some of these families. Second, many states have increased their efforts to provide services to low-income families not receiving welfare. Services for these families include child care, case management, and job retention and advancement services for families who have recently left welfare for employment and for other low-income working families. In addition, some states provide a broad range of services to some low-income families, including family literacy and after school activities and substance abuse prevention services. While states have the flexibility under TANF to use their federal and state welfare-related funds to provide services to families not receiving monthly cash assistance, these families are not reflected in caseload data reported by states to HHS. As a result, TANF caseload data regularly used by program administrators and policymakers do not provide a complete picture of the number of families receiving benefits and services through TANF. In the 25 states that we studied, we estimated that\u2014at a minimum\u2014830,000 families received a service funded at least in part with federal or state welfare funds in addition to the 1.8 million families who received cash assistance. With the sweeping changes in federal and state welfare policies, it is important to look beyond the traditional measure of the TANF caseload to better understand the role of TANF in supporting the work efforts of low-income families."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["TANF was designed to give states the flexibility to create programs that meet four broad goals:   Providing assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;   Ending the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;   Preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and   Encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.", "The amount of the TANF block grant was determined based on pre- PRWORA spending on (1) AFDC, a program that provided monthly cash payments to needy families; (2) Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS), a program to prepare AFDC recipients for employment; and (3) Emergency Assistance, a program designed to aid needy families in crisis situations. To meet the MOE requirement, states must spend 80 percent or 75 percent of their pre-PRWORA share of spending on AFDC, JOBS, Emergency Assistance, and AFDC-related child care programs. States have considerable flexibility in what they spend TANF and MOE funds on. In addition to spending on cash benefits\u2014that is, monthly cash assistance payments to families to meet their ongoing basic needs\u2014states can spend TANF/MOE funds on services for cash assistance recipients or other low-income families. States are allowed to transfer up to 30 percent of their TANF funds to the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG).", "TANF regulations require states to report to HHS data on families receiving \u201cassistance\u201d under the TANF program. These reported families are referred to as the TANF or welfare caseload. Typically, these families are receiving monthly cash payments. Therefore, families who receive TANF/MOE-funded services but do not receive monthly cash payments are typically not included in the reported TANF caseload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Caseloads Declined by 50 Percent after PRWORA Implementation and Many Former Welfare Families Are Working", "paragraphs": ["The states\u2019 implementation of more work-based programs, undertaken under conditions of strong economic growth, has been accompanied by a dramatic decline in the number of families receiving cash welfare. The number of families receiving welfare remained steady during the 1980s and then rose rapidly during the early 1990s to a peak in March 1994. The caseload decline began in 1994 and accelerated after passage of PRWORA, with a 53 percent decline in the number of families receiving cash welfare\u2014from 4.4 million families in August 1996 to 2.1 million families in July 2001. Caseload reductions occurred in all states, ranging from 16 percent in Indiana to 89 percent in Wyoming. Between July and September 2001, however, the nationwide welfare caseload increased 1 percent.", "Between July and December 2001, the welfare caseload in many states increased, with a 5 percent average increase across 18 of 23 surveyed states. While economic changes and state welfare reforms have been cited as key factors to explain nationwide caseload changes, there is no consensus about the extent to which each factor has contributed to these changes.", "Given the large decline in the number of families receiving cash assistance in recent years, attention has been focused on learning how these families are faring. Studies show that most adults who left welfare had at least some attachment to the workforce. Our 1999 review on the status of former welfare recipients based on studies from seven states found that from 61 to 71 percent of adults were employed at the time they were surveyed. Studies measuring whether an adult in a family had ever been employed since leaving welfare reported employment rates from 63 to 87 percent. A 2001 review of state and local-level studies conducted by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) shows similar patterns. In addition, the Urban Institute, using data from its 1999 National Survey of America\u2019s Families (NSAF)\u2014a nationally representative sample\u2014finds that 64 percent of former recipients who did not return to TANF reported that they were working at the time of follow-up, while another 11 percent reported working at some point since leaving welfare. Studies also show that not all families who leave welfare remain off the rolls. For example, the Urban Institute study using 1999 NSAF data reported that 22 percent of those who had left the rolls were again receiving benefits at time of the survey follow-up.", "Although most adults in former welfare families were employed at some time after leaving welfare, many worked at low-wage jobs. Of those who left welfare, former recipients in the seven states we reviewed had average quarterly earnings that generally ranged from $2,378 to $3,786 or from $9,512 to $15,144 annually. This estimated annual earned income is greater than the maximum annual amount of cash assistance and food stamps that a three-person family with no other income could have received in these states. However, if these earnings were the only source of income for families after they leave welfare, many of them would remain below the federal poverty level. On the basis of additional information from the NSAF, a 2001 Urban Institute study estimated that about 41 percent of those who left the welfare rolls were below the federal poverty level, after including an estimate of the earned income tax credit and the cash value of food stamps and subtracting an estimate of payroll taxes. While some former welfare recipients are no longer poor, others can be considered among the working poor. Nationwide, about 16 percent of the nonelderly population lives in families in which adults work, on average, at least half of the time yet have incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Focus of Welfare Spending Has Shifted from Monthly Cash Payments to Services", "paragraphs": ["Prior to welfare reform, states focused their welfare spending on providing monthly cash payments.

Rather than emphasizing income maintenance among welfare families, under TANF, states are focusing their welfare spending on work support services that help both welfare families and other low-income families find and maintain employment.

During that same period, the percent of total welfare dollars spent on other benefits and services increased from 18 percent to 48 percent. Overall, welfare spending declined from fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 2000, in part because (1) states chose to leave part of their TANF block grant allotments for fiscal year 2000 as unspent reserves in the U.S. Treasury, as allowed under PRWORA and (2) MOE requirements for states are only 80 percent or 75 percent of states\u2019 pre-PRWORA share of welfare spending.", "Child care (State share)", "Note 1: Categories shown for fiscal year 2001 but not for fiscal year 1995 (such as tax credits) could have existed in fiscal year 1995 but been paid for with nonwelfare dollars not included in this chart.", "Note 2: The chart does not include the $8,625,779,575 (36%) of available TANF funding that was left unspent at the end of fiscal year 2000.", "Note 3: TANF funds transferred to the CCDF and SSBG may not have been expended in fiscal year 2000; rather, these funds may have been reserved in the CCDF and SSBG for future use.", "Also indicative of the shift from cash to service spending is that in fiscal year 1995, no state spent more than 50 percent of its welfare dollars on services or benefits other than monthly cash payments, compared to fiscal year 2000 when 26 states used more than 50 percent of their TANF/MOE expenditures for services. Nationwide, child care was the noncash service for which the greatest proportion of TANF/MOE funds were used.

For most states, our estimate only takes into consideration a single TANF/MOE-funded service being provided to low-income families who are not included in the TANF caseload. Usually, this single service is child care because states have extensive data on child care, and because child care is often the TANF/MOE-funded service that serves the most families not receiving cash assistance. Our estimate does not take into consideration many of the services offered by states to low-income families who are not in the TANF caseload because the states could not provide the type of data on those services that we needed to include them in our estimate.

This is because states often mix TANF/MOE funds with funds from other sources to provide a single service. Although TANF/MOE dollars may not have paid for 100 percent of the cost of providing a service, the TANF/MOE portion of the cost can be significant. For example, for states included in our review, the TANF/MOE portion of monthly child care subsidies averaged approximately $266 per family out of a total average subsidy of $499 per family.

These concerns included that (1) states lack the information systems that would be needed to fulfill additional requirements, (2) fulfilling additional requirements will increase administrative costs, (3) additional data collection requirements could deter states and service providers from offering services because they would not want the administrative burden associated with them, and (4) requiring all service recipients to provide personal identifying information for every service may deter some people from accessing services because of the stigma associated with welfare."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Since the Congress passed welfare reform legislation in 1996, states have taken steps to implement a work-based, temporary assistance program for needy families.

The increased emphasis on work support and other services for recipients of cash assistance and those not receiving cash assistance represents a significant departure from previous welfare policy that focused on providing monthly cash payments. While the goals and target populations of welfare spending have changed, the key measure of the number of people served remains focused solely on families receiving monthly cash assistance. Although this measure provides important information for administrators and policymakers, it does not provide a complete picture of the number of people receiving benefits or services funded at least in part with TANF/MOE funds.
