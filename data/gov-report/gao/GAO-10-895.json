The public transit agencies GAO surveyed also cited additional mechanisms for obtaining such information, including other public transit agencies. Further, in March 2010 TSA introduced the Transportation Security Information Sharing and Analysis Center (TS-ISAC), which is a subportal on HSIN focused on sharing security-related information with transportation stakeholders. Seventy-five percent of the public transit agencies GAO surveyed reported being generally satisfied with the security-related information they received; however, federal efforts to share security-related information could be improved. Specifically, three-fourths of public transit agencies reported being either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the information they received. Public transit agencies also reported that among the 12 most frequently cited mechanisms, they were the least satisfied with HSIN in terms of general satisfaction (19 of 33) and for each of six dimensions of quality--relevance, validity, timeliness, completeness, actionability, and ease of use. Twenty-four survey respondents also cited the need to streamline the information they received. GAO identified the potential for overlap between the PT-ISAC, the HSIN-PT, and the TS-ISAC, which all communicate similar unclassified and security-related information to public transit agencies. Federal and transit industry officials that GAO interviewed reported the need to streamline information sharing. Moreover, a greater proportion of survey respondents who were unaware of the PT-ISAC or HSIN were from midsize agencies, nonrail agencies, and those without their own police department. Federal and industry officials formed a working group to assess the effectiveness of information-sharing mechanisms, including developing options for streamlining these mechanisms. TSA officials stated that these options will also impact future outreach activities; however, no time frame has been established for completing this effort. Establishing such a time frame could help to ensure that this effort is completed. DHS and TSA have established goals and performance measures for some of their information-sharing activities to help gauge the effectiveness of their overall information-sharing efforts; however, they have not developed goals and outcome-oriented measures of results of activities for the mechanisms established as primary information sources for the public transit industry. TSA officials acknowledged the importance of establishing such goals and measures, but were unable to provide time frames for doing so. Establishing time frames for developing goals and outcome measures, once the working group effort is complete, could assist TSA in gauging the effectiveness of its efforts to share information with public transit agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS, among other things, (1) establish time frames for its working group to develop options for improving information sharing, including assessing opportunities to streamline mechanisms and conducting targeted outreach; and (2) establish time frames for developing goals and outcome-oriented measures of results.

The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11  Commission Act)\u2014assigned the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  responsibility for sharing information related to terrorism and homeland  security with its federal, state, tribal, local, and private sector homeland  security partners.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the federal government,  including DHS, has taken a number of actions to enhance the security of  transportation systems.  These actions include improving information  sharing with its critical sector stakeholders, which is highlighted in the  2008 Department of Homeland Security Information Sharing Strategy,  as well as the 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP).  To  help facilitate information sharing with the public transit industry, DHS  and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have created and  funded a number of mechanisms, including the Public Transportation  Information Sharing and Analysis Center (PT-ISAC), which is administered  by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).  The PT-ISAC  was created under the direction of the Department of Transportation  (DOT) in 2003 and is currently funded by TSA via DOT\u2019s Federal Transit  Administration (FTA).  In addition to DHS, other federal agencies, such as  the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  and FTA, have also taken action to enhance their efforts to share security- related information with public and private stakeholders, including public  transit agencies.", "Our prior work on information sharing with private and public security  stakeholders has shown that information sharing continues to be a  challenge for the federal government.  In January 2005, we designated  establishing effective mechanisms for sharing terrorism-related  information to protect the homeland a high-risk area because the  government had continued to face challenges in analyzing and  disseminating this information in a timely, accurate, and useful manner.   We reported that information is a crucial tool in fighting terrorism and that  its timely dissemination is critical to maintaining the security of our  nation.  This area remains on our high-risk list.", "As mandated by section 1410 of the 9/11 Commission Act, this review  assesses the role of the PT-ISAC and other related federal mechanisms for  sharing security-related information within the public transit industry.   Specifically, our report addresses the following questions:    What are the primary mechanisms established or funded by the federal  government to share security-related information with public transit  agencies?", "To what extent are public transit agencies satisfied with federal efforts  to share security-related information, and how, if at all, can these  efforts be improved?", "To what extent has DHS identified goals for sharing security-related  information with public transit agencies and developed measures to  gauge its progress in meeting those goals?", "To identify the mechanisms established or funded by the federal  government to serve as primary information sources for public transit  agencies, we reviewed and assessed relevant documentation, such as the  Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) Program Management  Plan and DHS\u2019s Information Sharing Strategy.  We interviewed officials  from DHS components including the Office of Infrastructure Protection  (IP) within the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), the  Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), the U.S. Coast Guard, and TSA,  as well as officials from FTA and the FBI to discuss the mechanisms they  use to share security-related information with public transit agencies.   We also conducted site visits, or held teleconferences, with security and  management officials from a nonprobability sample of 27 public transit  agencies across the nation to determine which mechanisms are most  routinely used by these agencies to obtain security-related information.", "These transit agencies were selected to reflect broad representation in  size, location, transportation mode, and law enforcement presence and  represent about 63 percent of the nation\u2019s total public transit ridership  based on information we obtained from FTA\u2019s National Transit Database.   Because we selected a nonprobability sample of transit agencies to  interview, the information obtained cannot be generalized to all transit  agencies.  However, the interviews provided illustrative examples of the  perspectives of various transit agencies about federal government  information-sharing mechanisms and corroborated information we  gathered through other means.", "To assess the extent to which public transit agencies are satisfied with  federal efforts to share quality security-related information and related  opportunities for improvement, in March and April 2010, we surveyed 96  of the 694 U.S. public transit agencies on their satisfaction with  information-sharing efforts.  The 96 public transit agencies surveyed  represent about 91 percent of total 2008 ridership.  For the purposes of  this survey, we defined the six aspects of quality security-related  information as (1) relevance (i.e., is the information sufficiently relevant to  be of value to a public transit agency?); (2) validity (i.e., is the information  accurate?); (3) timeliness (i.e., is information received in a timely  manner?); (4) completeness (i.e., does the information contain all the  necessary details?); (5) actionability (i.e., would the information allow a  public transit agency to change its security posture, if such a change was  warranted?); and (6) access/ease of use (i.e., is information available  through this mechanism easy to obtain?).  Out of the original population  of 96 transit agencies, we received completed questionnaires from 80  respondents\u2014a response rate of 83 percent; however, not all respondents  provided answers to every question.  To develop the survey instrument, we  conducted pretest interviews with four public transit agencies and  obtained input from our survey experts.  However, since we surveyed a  non-probability sample of public transit agencies, the results cannot be  used to make inferences about the entire population of public transit  agencies, but provided us with additional insights.  The survey document  and counts of responses received for each question are reproduced in an  electronic supplement we are issuing concurrent with this report\u2014 GAO-10-896SP.  To further address this question, we assessed relevant  documentation, including interagency agreements between TSA and FTA,  as well as marketing materials on the Transportation Security Information  Sharing and Analysis Center (TS-ISAC).  We also interviewed APTA, PT- ISAC, TSA, FBI, FTA, and DHS Office of Operations, Coordination, and  Planning officials to discuss efforts to streamline existing information- sharing mechanisms, oversee the results of the PT-ISAC, and conduct  outreach on various information-sharing mechanisms.  We compared these  efforts to internal control standards, as well as our previous work on the  need to consolidate redundant information systems and target outreach  efforts.  In addition, we interviewed select public transit agencies and  included questions in our Web-based survey of public transit agencies on  the various information-sharing mechanisms available to them.", "To assess the extent to which DHS has identified goals for sharing  information with public transit agencies and developed measures to gauge  its progress in meeting those goals, we reviewed the DHS Annual  Performance Report, Fiscal Years 2008 through 2010, TSA\u2019s  Transportation Security Information Sharing Plan (TSISP), and  available performance measures for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 related  to information-sharing efforts with public transit agencies and compared  them to leading management practices and our previous work on program  assessments.  We also interviewed relevant DHS and TSA officials to  obtain information on their efforts to revise and develop performance  measures and goals for this area of information sharing and to obtain  feedback from public transit agencies on their satisfaction with the  security-related information they receive.  In addition, we compared TSA\u2019s  efforts to evaluate their information-sharing efforts with guidance on  performance measurement contained in our previous reports.

Key modes of transportation include aviation, freight rail,  highway, maritime, transit, and pipeline.  The nation\u2019s public transit  system includes multiple-occupancy vehicle services designed to provide  regular and continuing general or special transportation to the public, such  as transit buses, light rail, commuter rail, subways, and waterborne  passenger ferries.  According to APTA, buses are the most widely used  form of transit, providing almost two-thirds of all passenger trips.  Light  rail systems are typically characterized by lightweight passenger rail cars  that operate on track that is not separated from vehicular traffic.   Commuter rail systems typically operate on railroad tracks and provide  regional service (e.g., between a city and adjacent suburbs).  Subway  systems, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s New York City  Transit, typically operate on fixed heavy lines within a metropolitan area  and have the capacity for a heavy volume of traffic.  Waterborne passenger  ferries provide a link across many of the nation\u2019s waterways and, in some  cases, present drivers with an alternative travel option.  Public transit  systems in the United States are typically owned and operated by public  sector entities, such as state and regional transportation authorities.  In  addition, while some transit agencies rely on their local police department  to secure their systems, others, such as the Bay Area Rapid Transit system  in San Francisco, have established their own dedicated police department.", "Mass transit and passenger rail systems carry a high number of passengers  every day and are open and fully accessible.  Multiple stops and transfers  lead to high passenger turnover, which is difficult to monitor effectively,  and a terrorist attack on public transit systems could result in a large  number of casualties.  While there have been no successful terrorist  attacks against U.S. public transit systems to date, terrorist attacks on  public transit systems around the world, such as the March 2010 subway  bombings in Moscow, Russia, and the recent plot to detonate explosives  on the New York City subway system, illustrate the potential threat to  public transit systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Stakeholders Have Responsibility for Sharing Security-Related Information with Public Transit Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Securing the nation\u2019s public transit systems is a shared responsibility  requiring coordinated action on the part of federal, state, and local  governments; the private sector; and passengers who ride these systems.

The PT-ISAC, which is implemented by APTA under a  cooperative agreement with FTA, was designed to serve as the one stop  shop for public transit agencies seeking to obtain security-related  information.  The PT-ISAC collects, analyzes, and distributes security and  threat information from the federal government and open sources on a  24/7 basis.  It provides public transit agencies with unclassified and open- source documents obtained from numerous sources, including DOT, DHS,  and DOJ.  According to PT-ISAC officials, this mechanism disseminates  this information through daily E-mails with attachments summarizing and  analyzing recent security and cybersecurity information, news, threats,  and vulnerabilities within the transportation sector.  In addition, the PT- ISAC has a searchable library of government and private security  documents, and PT-ISAC analysts hold top secret security clearances.  HSIN-PT is also focused on providing security-related information  pertaining to the public transit industry.  According to DHS officials, HSIN  was designed to serve as the department\u2019s primary information-sharing  mechanism for the larger homeland security community engaged in  preventing, protecting from, responding to, and recovering from all  threats, hazards, and incidents under DHS jurisdiction.  HSIN is  comprised of a network of communities, referred to as communities of  interest, such as Intelligence and Analysis, Law Enforcement, Emergency  Management, and Critical Sectors (CS).  Within HSIN-CS, each of the 18  critical sectors maintains its own site.  Under the transportation sector,  the public transit mode maintains its own subportal on HSIN.  According  to TSA officials, HSIN-PT is maintained and populated by mass transit and  passenger rail private and government stakeholders.  HSIN, including its  public transit subportal, is accessible via the Internet, but users must first  be vetted against established criteria to obtain a user name and password  from DHS to access the network and retrieve information.  As an  additional feature, HSIN users may elect to receive E-mail alerts that  include notices of ongoing events or direct the user to a particular location  within HSIN to obtain additional information.", "While the PT-ISAC and HSIN-PT are focused on providing security-related  information to public transit agencies, the agencies we surveyed did not  rely solely on these two mechanisms for their information needs.  Figure 1  below illustrates the 12 key information-sharing mechanisms, identified by  the agencies we surveyed, that disseminate security-related information to  public transit agencies.  These mechanisms were cited as sources of  security-related information by more than 40 percent of the public transit  agencies we surveyed.", "Forces (JTTF)", "Transit Security and Safety Roundtables  The information-sharing mechanisms described in figure 1 vary by  intended users of the mechanism, the type and source of information  offered, and how the information is distributed.  Table 2 provides  additional details on the 12 information-sharing mechanisms public transit  agencies cited most frequently as sources for security-related information.", "Although all of these mechanisms are used by some segment of the public  transit agencies we surveyed to obtain security-related information, access  to the information disseminated through the mechanisms illustrated in  table 2 may vary by, among other factors, whether the transit agencies  have a dedicated police department, the size of transit agency, and  accessibility of the information.  For example, some public transit  agencies with a dedicated police department receive security-related  information through their law enforcement representative on the local  JTTF.  According to FBI officials, public transit agencies that do not have  a dedicated police department are less likely to receive information from  the JTTF.  In addition, the Transit Security and Safety Roundtables are  specifically tailored for the nation\u2019s largest mass transit and passenger rail  agencies, typically those ranked within the top 50 or 60 by ridership.   Smaller transit agencies are less likely to receive information disseminated  through this mechanism since they are typically not invited to participate  in these roundtables.  Also, of the mechanisms identified by the public  transit agencies we interviewed and surveyed, all but one send information  directly to transit agencies instead of requiring users to log on to a system  to retrieve information (\u201cpush\u201d vs. \u201cpull\u201d).", "In addition to the information-sharing mechanisms identified in table 2,  TSA-OI implemented its TS-ISAC in March 2010 as another means for  sharing security-related information with the transportation industry,  including public transit agencies.  Specifically, TSA\u2019s vision for the TS- ISAC is to serve as the one stop shop to obtain TSA-OI reports and  documentation, such as SBU intelligence products and other documents  from other transportation security partners and stakeholders.  The TS- ISAC aims to enhance collaboration between operators, law enforcement  personnel, and security directors from all transportation modes.  Similar  to HSIN-PT, the TS-ISAC is a subportal of HSIN-CS, and therefore users  must have a HSIN password to access it.

Security officials at the public transit agencies we surveyed were not  always aware of the existence of the PT-ISAC and HSIN, particularly non- rail agencies, midsized agencies, and agencies that do not have their own  dedicated police department.  For example, of the 80 agencies we  surveyed, 23 indicated they did not receive security information from the  PT-ISAC and 8 did not know whether they used this mechanism.   Moreover, 15 of the 23 agencies that did not receive information from the  PT-ISAC had never heard of it (see table 5).", "According to FTA officials, the PT-ISAC is meant to serve as a valuable  resource for midsized and smaller public transit agencies.  However, our  survey results indicate that fewer non-rail and midsized agencies received  information from the PT-ISAC than rail and large agencies (19 of 41 non- rail and 35 of 65 midsized agencies, as opposed to 30 of 39 rail agencies  and 14 of 15 large agencies, respectively).  Moreover, nearly all of the  agencies we surveyed that had not heard of the PT-ISAC were non-rail  agencies (14 of 15), midsized agencies (15 of 15), or agencies without their  own dedicated police department (14 of 15).", "APTA conducts some PT-ISAC outreach through E-mails and newsletters  to its members and other stakeholders, and FTA officials stated that they  promote the PT-ISAC at Transit Security and Safety Roundtables.  Both  APTA and FTA officials agreed, however, on the need for additional  outreach to public transit agencies to increase awareness and use of the  PT-ISAC.  TSA did not provide information on any existing PT-ISAC  outreach efforts, but officials stated that the agency\u2019s future actions with  respect to the PT-ISAC, including outreach activities, will depend on the  proposed options that arise from the SCC/GCC Information Sharing  Working Group.  However, as noted above, there are no time frames for  this working group to draft or finalize its proposals for improving  information sharing, including who will be responsible for conducting  outreach activities for the PT-ISAC or what these activities will entail.   Conducting targeted outreach to agencies that are not currently using the  PT-ISAC\u2014particularly non-rail agencies, midsized agencies, and agencies  that do not have their own dedicated police department\u2014could help to  increase awareness and use of this mechanism.", "TSA and APTA officials also stated that not all public transit agencies are  aware of HSIN and those that are may not view the system as a valuable  resource.  The results of our survey are consistent with this view and  illustrate that public transit agencies\u2019 awareness of HSIN could be  increased.  For example, less than half of public transit agencies (34 of 77)  reported that they had log-in access to HSIN and had not lost or forgotten  their log-in information (see table 6).", "As with PT-ISAC usage, a greater proportion of large agencies, rail  agencies, and agencies that maintain their own dedicated police  departments indicated they had log-in access to HSIN and had not lost or  forgotten their log-in information (9 of 15 large agencies, 20 of 39 rail  agencies, and 17 of 29 agencies with dedicated police departments, as  opposed to 25 of 65 midsized agencies, 14 of 41 non-rail agencies, and 17  of 51 agencies without dedicated police departments, respectively).

DHS\u2019s Office of Operations, Coordination, and  Planning is generally responsible for conducting HSIN outreach, but DHS  officials from this office told us that outreach efforts for HSIN-CS,  including the HSIN-PT subportal, are under the purview of DHS IP.   However, DHS IP officials told us that they are deferring to APTA and TSA  (the sector coordinator and sector-specific agency for mass transit,  respectively), as described in the NIPP, to conduct outreach to public  transit agencies on the HSIN-PT subportal.  TSA has conducted some  outreach to the public transit industry about HSIN by including HSIN  reminders when it distributes security information via E-mail to public  transit agencies.  However, as table 6 illustrates, past outreach efforts have  not resulted in widespread HSIN awareness and use among public transit  agencies that we surveyed (particularly midsized agencies, non-rail  agencies, and agencies without a dedicated police department), and our  survey results suggest that access to HSIN remains a concern.  TSA  officials stated that the agency recognizes the need for additional outreach  to increase public transit agencies\u2019 awareness and use of the HSIN-PT  subportal and added that future outreach efforts will depend on the  proposed options that arise from the SCC/GCC Information Sharing  Working Group.

According to TSA data from April 2010, officials  from 46 public transit agencies had been granted access to the public  transit Web page of the TS-ISAC within the first 4 weeks of its operation.   However, we did not collect data from public transit agencies on their  awareness or use of the TS-ISAC because it was not implemented until  March 2010, after we developed our survey.

However, concerns among public transit agencies about HSIN\u2019s  accessibility may reduce its value as a source of security-related  information.  Industry officials characterized HSIN as a \u201cpull\u201d system that  requires users to log in and extract what is relevant to their agency.   Security officials at 11 of 27 public transit agencies we interviewed told us  they prefer security information to be \u201cpushed\u201d out to them (e.g., through  E-mails, phone calls) instead of having to log into a system to retrieve it  themselves.  APTA officials stated that public transit security personnel do  not have time to log into a \u201cpull\u201d system, such as HSIN, every day and sift  through excess information to extract what is relevant to their agency.  In  addition, when a HSIN password expires (which occurs after 90 days for  security reasons) users must call the HSIN help desk to obtain a new one.   However, the contact information for the HSIN help desk is not located on  the main HSIN log-in page, so users may not know how to get help if they  experience log-in challenges.  Of the 27 agencies we interviewed, 8  indicated they had experienced problems accessing HSIN.  In June 2010,  DHS implemented a new agency policy to identify HSIN users that have  not accessed the system in 180 days and notify them via E-mail every 3  months instructing them to contact the HSIN help desk to obtain a new  password.  DHS officials also told us that the phone number for the HSIN  help desk would be added to the HSIN log-in page, but the agency had not  done so as of August 2010.", "In addition to accessibility concerns, certain aspects of HSIN are not user- friendly, and the security-related information available on the HSIN-PT  subportal is not always valuable to public transit agencies.  Of the 11  agencies we interviewed that had access to HSIN and used it to receive  security-related information, 5 reported problems with using the system  once they logged in.  These problems included configuring E-mail alerts to  notify them when information is discovered or changed in a particular area  of HSIN (e.g., the HSIN-PT subportal).  We experienced similar problems  using these E-mail alerts.  After setting up alerts to notify us when  documents are discovered or changed on the HSIN-PT subportal, we  received multiple notifications on a near-daily basis with links to outdated  documents, such as job announcements last modified in 2007, a threat  advisory for the New York City subway system last modified in 2006, and a  map of power outages caused by Hurricane Wilma in 2005.  Further, we  found that security-related information on HSIN that could be useful to  public transit agencies was not always posted to the HSIN-PT subportal.   For example, in the days following the Moscow subway bombings in  March 2010, certain documents pertaining to the attack were available on  the HSIN-CS portal, but did not appear on HSIN-PT, despite their direct  relevance to public transit agency users.  The E-mail alerts we had set up  for HSIN-PT did not notify us of any of this information, which included a  document describing heightened security measures a large U.S. public  transit agency took in response to the Moscow attack.  This information  could have been of interest to other public transit agencies, but HSIN-PT  users would not have known about it unless they logged into the system  without an E-mail prompt, navigated to the HSIN-CS portal, and found the  information themselves.  Based on our survey results\u2014which indicate that  only 3 of 77 agencies use HSIN daily\u2014agencies may not have known that  information pertaining to the Moscow bombings was available to them on  HSIN.", "DHS and TSA agree that the HSIN-PT subportal is not widely used by the  public transit industry and that improvements are needed.  One such  improvement is related to DHS\u2019s efforts to develop a replacement system  for the HSIN platform, known as HSIN Next Generation.  This new system,  which DHS began to develop in 2008, is intended to provide increased  security and access to SBU information for public transit agencies and  other user communities, including law enforcement, intelligence,  immigration, and emergency and disaster management.  According to DHS  officials, the agency intends to move the subportals on HSIN-CS, including  HSIN-PT, to the new HSIN Next Generation platform during the last  quarter of calendar year 2010.

However, leading management practices emphasize  that successful performance measurement focuses on assessing the results  of individual programs and activities.  We have also previously reported  that without effective performance measurement, especially data on  program outcomes, decision makers may have insufficient information to  evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their activities.  While output measures,  such as those developed by TSA, are useful because they indicate the  quantity of direct services a program delivers, they do not reflect the  overall effectiveness of their activities.  We recognize and have previously  reported on the challenge of assessing the effectiveness of security-related  activities such as information sharing and developing outcome-oriented  measures, but have called on agencies to take steps towards establishing  such measures to hold them accountable for the investments they make.   Furthermore, developing such measures provides agencies with valuable  information for evaluating the effectiveness of their programs and the  extent to which they are meeting their goals.", "Furthermore, TSA has not developed specific performance goals or  outcome-oriented measures for the PT-ISAC or HSIN-PT, which were both  established as primary information-sharing mechanisms for public transit  agencies.

In  regard to HSIN-PT, TSA has developed an output-oriented performance  measure which tracks the number of users of this mechanism; however,  this measure provides limited information on which the agency can assess  the results and progress of this information-sharing mechanism.  TSA-OI,  however, has not developed specific goals or outcome-oriented  performance measures for HSIN-PT.

In addition, without taking steps to ensure that the  PT-ISAC fulfills its responsibilities and completes agreed-upon tasks, TSA  and FTA cannot be assured that this mechanism meets the security  information needs of public transit agencies.  Further, while DHS and TSA  are taking steps to improve information sharing with public transit  agencies, this effort will not be complete until the accessibility and user- friendliness of HSIN are addressed.

In  order to meet the full intent of our recommendation, DHS should establish  time frames for developing such goals and measures.", "Concerning our fifth recommendation that DHS develop a process for  systematically gathering feedback on public transit agencies\u2019 satisfaction  with the PT-ISAC and HSIN-PT, DHS stated that updates to HSIN will  enable the department to efficiently capture user feedback.  DHS also  stated that it would need to collaborate with TSA and DOT as well as  industry stakeholders to develop additional stakeholder feedback  mechanisms. DHS also noted that is will continue to obtain stakeholder  feedback through its survey on the TS-ISAC subportal.  While the  development of the customer survey on the TS-ISAC is an important step  in obtaining feedback on the satisfaction of this mechanism, DHS should  ensure that its process for gathering feedback on public transit agencies\u2019  satisfaction with the PT-ISAC and HSIN-PT is systematic, as we  recommended.  Taking such action is necessary to fully address this  recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Homeland  Security and Transportation, and the Attorney General.

(2) To what extent are public  transit agencies satisfied with federal efforts to share security-related  information, and how, if at all, can these efforts be improved? (3) To what  extent has the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) identified goals  for sharing security-related information with public transit agencies and  developed measures to gauge its progress in meeting those goals?", "To identify the mechanisms established or funded by the federal  government to serve as primary information sources for public transit  agencies, we reviewed and assessed relevant documentation, such as the  Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) Program Management  Plan, and interviewed officials from DHS components including the Office  of Infrastructure Protection (IP) within the National Protection and  Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Office of Intelligence and Analysis  (I&A), the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA), as well as officials from the Federal Transit  Administration (FTA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to  discuss the mechanisms they use to share security-related information  with public transit agencies.  We also conducted site visits, or held  teleconferences, with security and management officials from a  nonprobability sample of 27 public transit agencies across the nation to  determine which mechanisms are most routinely used by these agencies to  obtain security-related information.  These transit agencies were selected  to generally reflect the variety of transit agencies in terms of size, location,  transportation mode, and law enforcement presence and represent about  63 percent of the nation\u2019s total public transit ridership based on  information we obtained from FTA\u2019s National Transit Database.  Because  we selected a nonprobability sample of transit agencies to interview, the  information obtained cannot be generalized to the overall population of  transit agencies.  However, the interviews provided illustrative examples  of the perspectives of various transit agencies about federal government  information-sharing mechanisms and corroborated information we  gathered through other means.  Table 8 lists the public transit agencies we  interviewed.", "To assess the satisfaction of public transit agencies with federal security- related information- sharing efforts and related opportunities for  improvement, in March and April 2010, we surveyed 96 of the of the 694  U.S. public transit agencies as of 2008, by ridership statistics, on their  satisfaction with information-sharing efforts.  The 96 public transit  agencies surveyed represent about 91 percent of total 2008 ridership. For  the purposes of this survey, we defined the six aspects of quality security- related information as (1) relevance (i.e., is the information sufficiently  relevant to be of value to a public transit agency?); (2) validity (i.e., is the  information accurate?); (3) timeliness (i.e., is information received in a  timely manner?); (4) completeness (i.e., does the information contain all  the necessary details?); (5) actionability (i.e., would the information allow  a public transit agency to change its security posture, if such a change was  warranted?); and (6) access/ease of use (i.e., is information available  through this mechanism easy to obtain?).  To develop the survey  instrument, we conducted pretest interviews with four public transit  agencies and obtained input from GAO experts.  Out of the original  population of 96 transit agencies, we received completed questionnaires  from 80 respondents\u2014a response rate of 83 percent; however, not all  respondents provided answers to every question.", "The final instrument, reproduced in an e-supplement we are issuing  concurrent with this report\u2014GAO-10-896SP\u2014displays the counts of  responses received for each question. The questionnaire asked those  public transit officials responsible for security operations to identify the  modes of transportation they provide, the extent to which they house their  own law enforcement component, the mechanisms they use to obtain  security information, and their satisfaction with each of these  mechanisms.", "While we surveyed 96 agencies of the largest U.S. public transit agencies,  and thus our data are not subject to sampling error, the practical  difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce other errors in our  findings.  We took steps to minimize errors of measurement, nonresponse,  and data processing.  In addition to the questionnaire development and  testing activities described above, we made multiple follow-up attempts by  E-mail and telephone to reduce the level of nonresponse throughout the  survey period.  Finally, analysis programs and other data analyses were  independently verified.", "To further address this question, we assessed relevant documentation,  including interagency agreements between TSA and FTA, as well as  marketing materials on the Transportation Security Information Sharing  and Analysis Center (TS-ISAC).  We also interviewed American Public  Transportation Association (APTA), Public Transportation Information  Sharing and Analysis Center (PT-ISAC), TSA, FBI, FTA, and DHS  Operations, Coordination, and Planning Directorate officials to discuss  efforts to streamline existing information-sharing mechanisms, oversee the  results of the PT-ISAC, and conduct outreach on various information- sharing mechanisms.  We compared these efforts to internal control  standards, as well as our previous work on the need to consolidate  redundant information systems and target outreach efforts.  In addition,  we interviewed select public transit agencies and included questions in  our Web-based survey of public transit agencies on the various  information-sharing mechanisms available to them.", "To assess the extent to which DHS has identified goals for sharing  information with public transit agencies and developed measures to gauge  its progress in meeting those goals, we reviewed DHS\u2019s Annual  Performance Report, TSA\u2019s Transportation Security Information Sharing  Plan (TSISP), and available performance data and measures for fiscal  years 2007 through 2010 related to information-sharing efforts with public  transit agencies and compared them to leading management practices and  our previous work on program assessments.  We also interviewed relevant  DHS and TSA officials to obtain information on their efforts to revise and  develop performance measures and goals for this area of information  sharing, as well as their efforts to obtain feedback from public transit  agencies on their satisfaction with the security-related information they  receive.  In addition, we compared TSA\u2019s efforts to evaluate their  information-sharing efforts with guidance on performance measurement  contained in our previous reports.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 through  September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
