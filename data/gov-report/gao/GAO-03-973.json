However, within this framework, each of the 12 FHLBanks has independent authority to set advance pricing terms, which can result in several significant key differences among the banks. For example, due to differing costs and business strategies, FHLBank advance interest rates may differ and many FHLBanks charge lower interest rates based on advance size while others do not. Moreover, FHLBanks may set differing collateral requirements for their members. For example, one FHLBank allows its members to borrow up to 60 percent of the value of single family mortgages pledged as collateral to secure advances while another allows up to 85 percent. Among the FHLBanks' differing approaches to setting advance pricing terms, FHFB has not found that any practice results in significant violations of statute or regulation. However FHFB also collects collateral data from the FHLBanks that have questionable value in their current format for monitoring the System's safety and soundness. Because FHLBank officials do not have clear information about how FHFB would like the data reported, the FHLBanks use different reporting definitions and criteria, which limits the data's analytical usefulness.

Traditionally, each FHLBank made loans, known as advances, that were  secured by eligible collateral (e.g., single family mortgage loans) to  member institutions\u2014particularly thrifts\u2014located in its district to support  housing finance.  However, many large bank and thrift holding companies  now own subsidiaries located in various FHLBank districts.  Each eligible  subsidiary may join the FHLBank in which district its headquarters is  located, and may obtain advances from that FHLBank.  Thus, these bank  and thrift holding companies may, in effect, have access (through their  subsidiaries) to advances from multiple FHLBanks.", "Some observers have expressed concerns that these holding companies  can pressure the FHLBanks to compete with one another on advance  pricing terms\u2014such as interest rates and collateral requirements\u2014and that  this competition could impair the overall safety and soundness of the  FHLBanks, which were jointly and severally liable for $710 billion in debt  obligations as of June, 2003.  For example, the concern exists that a  holding company could shift assets at a subsidiary located in one FHLBank  district to pledge as collateral at a subsidiary in another district offering  more favorable advance terms.  Recently, these concerns have been  heightened as the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), the FHLBank  System\u2019s financial regulator, has analyzed the benefits and costs associated  with potential changes to the System\u2019s membership requirements that  would allow financial organizations to join more than one FHLBank district  (these potential changes to the System\u2019s membership rules are commonly  referred to as multidistrict membership). Supporters of multidistrict  membership believe that it is necessary to modernize the FHLBank  System\u2019s structure, while critics believe that multidistrict membership  would increase the potential for dangerous competition between the  FHLBanks.", "As discussed with your staff, this report provides an overview of advance  term pricing requirements and practices within the FHLBank System that  could be useful in assessing the extent of current competition among the  FHLBanks and the potential competitive impacts of multidistrict  membership.  Specifically, you asked that we  1. describe the laws and regulations pertaining to the terms that  FHLBanks can offer on advances;  2. provide information on whether key differences exist in current  advance pricing and other terms across the FHLBanks;  3. determine whether holding companies face any legal or regulatory  barriers in transferring assets among subsidiaries who are members of  different FHLBank districts; and  4. describe FHFB\u2019s safety and soundness oversight of the FHLBanks\u2019  advance pricing practices and review selected data that FHFB collects  to monitor safety and soundness practices within the FHLBank System.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and reviewed applicable federal  laws and regulations pertaining to the terms that the FHLBanks can offer  on advances.  We also interviewed the 12 FHLBank presidents, credit and  collateral staff from 7 of the 12 FHLBanks, and FHFB officials.  We sent a  set of structured questions to each of the 12 banks and reviewed their  credit and collateral policies.  In addition, we obtained and reviewed  applicable laws and regulations regarding the transfer of funds and assets  among holding companies and their subsidiaries, and interviewed  representatives from the Federal Reserve Board and a large holding  company.  The scope of our work included a description of FHFB\u2019s  examination program pertaining to advances but did not include an  analysis of the program\u2019s effectiveness.  However, we did analyze FHFB\u2019s  collateral reporting requirements for the 12 FHLBanks.

The 12 FHLBanks, along with the Office of  Finance (which issues debt on behalf of the FHLBanks), comprise the  FHLBank System.  The members of each FHLBank must buy stock in the  FHLBank as a prerequisite for obtaining advances and other FHLBank  services.  FHLBank System assets consist of advances and investments,  such as money market funds and mortgage-backed securities (see table 1).   In addition, FHLBank assets consist of acquired mortgages that the  FHLBanks purchase from their members under the Mortgage Partnership  Finance (MPF) program or Mortgage Purchase Program (MPP).  The  FHLBank-purchased mortgages consist of both conventional mortgages  and federally insured and guaranteed mortgages.", "The FHLBank System raises funds in the capital markets partially on the  strength of its ties to the federal government.  Due to these ties, investors  perceive an implied guarantee by the federal government on the System  debt based on the belief that the government would come to the rescue of  the FHLBank System rather than allow it to default on its obligations in the  event of severe financial difficulties.  The primary source of funds for the  FHLBank System is the issuance of debt securities known as consolidated  obligations, through its Office of Finance, which stood at $710 billion as of  June 30, 2003.  Consolidated obligations are the \u201cjoint and several\u201d  obligations of the FHLBanks and all of the banks may be required to cover  such obligations of another bank that defaults on its repayment obligations.   Under the joint and several structure, the potential for moral hazard exists.   That is, FHLBanks may have incentives to take financial risks knowing that  their losses would be covered by other FHLBanks or, ultimately, the federal  government.  Federal statutes and regulations as well as FHFB\u2019s oversight  efforts\u2014which are discussed in this report\u2014are designed to help ensure  that the FHLBanks conduct their business in a safe and sound manner.", "The FHLBank Act provides that an eligible institution may become a  member only of the FHLBank district in which its principal place of  business is located, or an adjoining district for convenience purposes and if  approved by FHFB. However, bank or thrift holding companies may own  subsidiaries in two or more FHLBank districts and each eligible subsidiary  may become a member of its district FHLBank.  To become a FHLBank  member, each subsidiary must be a separately chartered institution, such  as a national bank or state-chartered bank or thrift.  According to FHFB,  approximately 100 bank or thrift holding companies currently operate in  two or more FHLBank districts by having established separately chartered  subsidiaries in those districts.", "In 2000 and 2001, continuing a long standing trend, several holding  companies with subsidiaries that operated in two or more FHLBank  districts merged with or purchased financial institutions that were also  members of FHLBank districts.  These holding companies sought to  consolidate the merged or purchased institutions under one existing  charter and did not want to maintain separately chartered institutions.  For  example, Washington Mutual (WAMU)\u2014a thrift holding company with  subsidiaries in the Seattle, San Francisco, and Topeka FHLBank districts\u2014 purchased Bank United, a member of the Dallas FHLBank district, and  Dime Savings, a member of the New York FHLBank district.  WAMU chose  not to maintain separate charters for Bank United and Dime Savings for  business purposes and instead decided to merge the institutions into its  existing subsidiaries.  However, under FHFB regulations Dime Savings and  Bank United could no longer remain members of the FHLBank System and  could no longer obtain new advances or other services from the FHLBank  of Dallas and the FHLBank of New York.  Therefore, WAMU was required  to pay back Bank United and Dime Savings\u2019 outstanding balances under  their original terms.", "In 2000, the FHLBank of Dallas submitted to the FHFB an application  (which the FHFB subsequently treated as a petition) to grant approval to  WAMU\u2019s thrift subsidiary\u2019s application for membership in the FHLBank of  Dallas while maintaining its membership in the FHLBank of San Francisco  (the petition has been referred to as advocating multidistrict membership).   The Dallas FHLBank filed the petition under the \u201cdemanded by  convenience\u201d standard.  After the initial petition, FHFB received similar  requests from three other FHLBanks, requests to intervene, and comment  letters both in favor and against.  Given the controversy associated with  these petitions and their potential effects on the System (including the  potential for increased competition among the FHLBanks), FHFB did not  act on them and, in October 2001, requested comments from the public on  the petitions. In 2002, FHFB obtained a legal opinion from a law firm  stating that it had the legal authority, under certain conditions, to approve  multidistrict membership under its broad safety and soundness regulatory  authority and requested that the 12 FHLBanks answer questions related to  multidistrict membership, which the FHLBanks did by February 2003.   During 2003, FHFB staff, at the direction of the agency\u2019s chairman,  analyzed the benefits and costs associated with multidistrict membership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutes and Regulations Establish the General Pricing and Other Terms Each FHLBank Can Offer on Advances to Member Institutions", "paragraphs": ["The FHLBank Act, as amended by GLBA, and FHFB regulations establish  the general pricing and other terms that each FHLBank can offer on its  advances.

FHLBanks are allowed to differentiate  in advance prices based on the FHLBank\u2019s assessment of the credit and  other risk of lending to any particular member, or other reasonable criteria.", "Per FHFB\u2019s guidance, such differentiation could include providing  discounts to members based on the volume of the advance.  Each  FHLBank is to include in its member products policy standards and criteria  for differential pricing and is to apply its standards and criteria consistently  and without discrimination to all members.", "The FHLBank Act, as amended by GLBA, requires that FHLBanks fully  secure their advances with eligible collateral.  The eligible collateral, as  listed in table 2, ranges from whole single family mortgages to small  business and agricultural loans.  GLBA, which amended the FHLBank Act,  expanded the collateral that member institutions could use to secure an  advance. In particular, GLBA allowed CFIs, those FHLBank System  members that are FDIC insured depository institutions that currently have  $538 million or less in total assets, to pledge small business and agricultural  loans as collateral.  GLBA allowed CFIs to use the expanded collateral  categories because some small institutions lacked a sufficient quantity of  other types of assets\u2014such as mortgage loans\u2014necessary to secure  FHLBank advances.  GLBA also allowed all FHLBank members to make  greater use of ORERC\u2014such as commercial real estate loans and home  equity loans\u2014as collateral for advances.  The FHLBanks may restrict the  types of eligible collateral available to them as security, based upon the  creditworthiness or operations of the borrower, the quality of the  collateral, or other reasonable criteria.", "By fully securing advances with eligible collateral as required by the  FHLBank Act, FHLBanks can protect their interests should one or more of  their members fail.  Typically, FHLBanks make advances on what is known  as a blanket lien; that is, the FHLBank has the authority to take control of  all the assets that are eligible as collateral on a member\u2019s books.  In cases in  which an FHLBank determines that a member is experiencing financial  difficulty, the FHLBank may require the member to list specific assets that  are securing advances or may even require the member to deliver the  collateral to the FHLBank.  Should the member fail, the FHLBank can sell  the pledged collateral to ensure repayment of principal and the interest on  the advance.  Due in part to the collateralization requirements, the  FHLBank System has never experienced a loss on an advance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHFB Regulations Establish Additional Advance Term Requirements", "paragraphs": ["FHFB has issued several regulations that are designed to help ensure that  the FHLBanks make advances in a safe and sound manner.

FHFB regulations require that FHLBanks can reliably discount  the value of ORERC and small business and agricultural loans pledged as  collateral.  Under its regulations, FHFB also has the authority to require an  FHLBank to increase its standards for all forms of eligible collateral.

Our review of key advance pricing  terms\u2014advance interest rates, collateral requirements, advance borrowing  capacity, and capital stock purchase requirements\u2014identified several  significant differences among the 12 FHLBanks.  The FHLBanks may  charge different interest rates on advances with comparable maturities,  some may establish interest rates on the basis of advance size while others  do not, and the FHLBanks apply differing haircuts to the same type of  collateral, establish different borrowing limits, and  require members to  purchase FHLBank stock in differing amounts depending upon their levels  of advances outstanding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Advance Interest Rates May Vary Based on FHLBank Operating Costs, Business Strategies, and Competition from Other Sources", "paragraphs": ["The process of setting advance interest rates can depend on several key  factors, including cost of funds, operating expenses, business strategies,  and competition from other sources, and may differ from one FHLBank to  another.  In general, each FHLBank attempts to set advance interest rates  at a level that covers its costs\u2014including cost of funds and operating  expenses\u2014while allowing for the payment of a reasonable rate of return  (typically through the payment of dividends) to member institutions.   Although the FHLBanks generally have the same cost of funds because  they borrow through the Office of Finance, they may have different  operating expenses to administer their advance business.  Moreover, the  business strategies adopted by individual FHLBanks may also influence the  advance interest rates that they charge to members.  In particular,  FHLBank officials said that there can be a connection between the advance  interest rate that they charge and the dividend rate that they pay.  That is,  an FHLBank choosing to pay a relatively high dividend may need to charge  a relatively high advance rate to earn sufficient profits to cover the costs  associated with the dividend.  In contrast, other FHLBanks may decide to  provide value to their members through lowering their advance rates,  which may mean a decrease in their dividend.  Table 3 shows that some  FHLBanks consistently pay higher dividends than others.  For example,  Bank E paid an average dividend of 7.63 percent from 1997 through 2002,  which was 250 basis points higher than the average dividend of Bank L over  the same period.", "FHLBank business strategies involving other assets\u2014such as mortgage  purchase programs and other investments\u2014may also influence the interest  rate that they charge on advances.  For example, the potential exists that  the degree to which an FHLBank participates in the MPP or the MPF  program would affect its advance interest rate.  If an FHLBank commits  substantial resources to the MPP or the MPF program, it may use any  profits earned to offset the advance interest rate or it may use funds earned  from advances to support the MPP or MPF program.  Or, the FHLBank  could use the profits to pay a higher dividend and leave advance rates  unchanged or some combination thereof.  Available evidence suggests that  there is wide variation within the FHLBank System on the extent to which  individual banks participate in the asset purchase programs.  For example,  more than 46 percent of the assets at one FHLBank now consist of acquired  mortgages while the ratio is only 1.5 percent at another FHLBank.    Similarly, FHLBanks could also increase investments in other types of  assets, such as mortgage-backed securities, and use the income derived to  offset advance interest rates or pay a higher dividend.", "Some FHLBank officials told us that competition from other sources can  also influence the interest rates that they charge on advances.  For  example, officials said that they monitor other financial markets\u2014such as  the repo market\u2014to determine how competitive their advance rates are  with other funding sources.  In addition, some FHLBank officials said that  competition may also arise from the advance interest rates and other terms  offered by other FHLBanks.  The officials said that large bank or thrift  holding companies that have subsidiaries in multiple FHLBank districts  sometimes play one FHLBank against another in an attempt to obtain more  favorable advance pricing terms.  Some FHLBank officials said that they  will adjust their advance interest rates within established parameters to  ensure that their rates are competitive with other sources of funds.  An  individual FHLBank\u2019s willingness to compete with other fund providers  could influence differences in advance rates across the FHLBanks.", "Given the variety of factors that may be involved in setting advance interest  rates, we are unable to explain completely why individual FHLBanks  charge the rates that they do.  Nevertheless, limited available data indicate  that these factors result in sometimes significant differences in interest  rates on advances with comparable maturities.  Table 4 shows the advance  interest rates for eleven FHLBanks on June 10, 2003 (the other FHLBank  stated that its advance interest rate data were proprietary).  The  differences between the lowest and highest interest rates can be  significant.  For example, for an advance of 12 months, the difference  between Bank H and D was 36 basis points."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most FHLBanks Offer Discounts on Advance Rates Based on Volume", "paragraphs": ["Our review indicates that eight FHLBanks have established specific  programs that offer volume-driven advance rate discounts, while four  others have not established such programs (see table 5).  Under these  programs, also referred to as tiered pricing, the FHLBank may reduce the  standard interest rate charged on advances depending upon the size of the  advance.  The programs operate similarly as each passes on to members  the economies of scale the FHLBanks realize from high-volume  transactions. However, as table 5 illustrates, the number of pricing tiers at  each FHLBank varies; three banks have established two tiers, two banks  have established three tiers, two banks have established four tiers, and one  bank states that it provides volume-driven discounts.  The basis point  discounts that the FHLBanks offer on volume driven discounts can also  vary.  For example, one FHLBank reduces its advance rates 15 to 20 basis  points for advances over $25 million, while another FHLBank reduces its  advance interest rates 6 to 12 basis points.", "FHLBank officials said that their large members are the primary  beneficiaries of the tiered pricing programs because they have the capacity  to borrow in large volumes.  However, officials from two FHLBanks also  said that they will aggregate advance requests from smaller members so  that they can benefit from volume-driven rates as well.  Representatives  from several FHLBanks, including those that do not have tiered pricing  programs, said that they also periodically offer \u201cspecial deals\u201d on advance  rates to all of their members.  If a FHLBank, for example, obtains favorable  borrowing costs, it may pass these savings on to its members through  special deals that are announced by fax or e-mail.", "With respect to the four FHLBanks that do not have specific tiered pricing  programs, officials said that they preferred to offer the same advance rate  to all members.  Although these FHLBanks do not have specific tiered  pricing programs based on volume, they may differentiate in price in other  ways.  For example, one FHLBank offers standard rates on all advances  requested by telephone but offers specified discounts on advance requests  made through its secured Web site.  Officials from this bank said that more  than 98 percent of its advances are made through the Web site.  Banks that  do offer tiered pricing programs may also offer differing advance rates on  the basis of the creditworthiness of their members.  For example, one  FHLBank has established 10 separate categories that have different interest  rates and collateral requirements depending upon a member\u2019s  creditworthiness.  This FHLBank, as do other FHLBanks, establishes  members\u2019 creditworthiness through, among other steps, reviewing publicly  available financial information and conducting on-site visits to review  collateral management practices.", "We also note that analyzing the FHLBanks\u2019 tiered pricing programs was  difficult, because the programs are not fully transparent as some banks  \u201cnegotiate\u201d prices with larger members.  Some FHLBank officials said that  larger members periodically request advance terms that differ from posted  rates and that FHLBank representatives do have some authority to  customize deals.  For example, officials at one FHLBank said that its  representatives had the authority to negotiate the stated advance interest  rates.  None of the FHLBank officials we contacted said that they had  authority to negotiate based on collateral standards.  Some FHLBank  officials said that they notify their members of the terms of negotiated  transactions whenever they take place (for example, by e-mail).  Other  FHLBank officials said that they will make the terms of negotiated deals  available only when another member requests an advance with similar  features."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHLBanks Have Established Sometimes Differing Collateral Requirements for Securing Advances", "paragraphs": ["The FHLBanks may also apply differing haircuts to collateral pledged by  member institutions to secure advances.  Table 6 shows the haircuts that  the FHLBanks apply under their blanket liens to single-family mortgage  collateral, which is considered one of the most secure forms of collateral.    Several FHLBanks apply a range of haircuts to single-family collateral (for  example, FHLBank C) based on their assessments of the credit risk of the  collateral.  For those banks that apply one haircut to single-family  collateral, the haircut differences can be significant.  For example, a  member could borrow up to 85 percent of its pledged single-family  collateral at FHLBank L (which has a 15 percent haircut) but only up to 60  percent at FHLBank J (which has a 40 percent haircut).  We note that the  FHLBanks have established other advance borrowing limits for their  members, which are discussed in the next section.", "Our review also identified other differences in the FHLBanks collateral  standards.  For example, we found that several FHLBanks require or prefer  their members to pledge all of their single-family mortgages as collateral  before they will consider the use of other types of collateral\u2014such as  ORERC or small business and agricultural loans\u2014to secure advances.

These FHLBanks borrowing limits do not  include a specific limit on the ratio of advances to a member\u2019s total assets  as is the case at the other nine banks.  Of the nine banks with specific ratio  limits, the borrowing limits vary to some extent; for example, one FHLBank  sets total advance borrowings at 35 percent of a member\u2019s assets.

Because Section 23B exempts banks and thrifts  from its definition of affiliate, sister banks (those banks that qualify for the  exemption) are also exempt from the requirement that transactions  between insured banks or thrifts and their affiliates be conducted on an  arm\u2019s length basis.  According to the Federal Reserve, these exemptions  reflect the fact that, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal  Deposit Insurance Act, an insured depository institution is generally liable  for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of a  commonly controlled depository institution. All transactions between a  bank and its affiliates (including sister bank affiliates) are required, though,  to be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound  banking practices.  In addition, a bank may not purchase a low-quality  asset from an affiliate (including a sister bank affiliate) unless the bank or  its subsidiary, pursuant to an independent credit evaluation, committed  itself to purchase such asset prior to the time such asset was acquired by  the affiliate.  Although a Federal Reserve official could not provide specific  data on the number of insured holding company subsidiaries that qualify  for the exemption, he estimated that more than 90 percent do so.", "While Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W impose few legal restrictions  on holding companies selling assets among their insured depository  subsidiaries for securing advances from different FHLBanks, there can be  some bookkeeping and regulatory hurdles.  Officials from one large thrift  holding company with whom we spoke said that there are balance sheet  management hurdles associated with the sale of assets from one subsidiary  to another.   For example, the officials said that asset sales may involve  \u201cde-pledging\u201d assets pledged as collateral to secure advances at one  FHLBank and pledge them to another FHLBank.  Subsidiaries meeting the  sister bank requirements must also ensure that the sale of assets meets  bank regulatory agency capital requirements.  In addition, each FHLBank  has established membership stock purchase requirements, which would  require a subsidiary that received assets from an affiliate to purchase  additional capital from the FHLBank.  We note that the membership capital  requirements for each FHLBank can differ.", "We also note that it is difficult to determine the extent to which holding  companies transfer assets between their subsidiaries and whether any such  transfers result in competition between the FHLBanks.  Federal Reserve  officials said that they do not collect data on transfers of assets among  subsidiaries, although one Federal Reserve official said that such transfers  occur frequently.  FHFB officials commented that it was not clear that  holding companies had financial incentives to move collateral from one  subsidiary to another to obtain favorable advance rates.  The FHFB  officials said that if a subsidiary had sufficient cash to purchase collateral  from an affiliate, it already would have sufficient eligible collateral to  secure advances from its local FHLBank and would not need additional  collateral."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FHFB Has Not Identified Significant Advance Term Pricing Deficiencies, but FHLBank Safety and Soundness Data Reporting Can Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["FHFB is responsible for helping ensure that the FHLBanks follow statutory  and regulatory requirements in making advances and that competitive  pressures within the FHLBank System do not compromise the System\u2019s  safety and soundness.

During the  examination process, FHFB examiners review a range of activities at each  FHLBank, such as its asset and liability management, collateral  management practices, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.   Off-site monitoring is typically carried out by FHFB headquarters staff and  involves the review of financial data that provides information and insights  into the safety and soundness of the FHLBanks.  Regular off-site  monitoring between annual examinations is important because the  FHLBanks\u2019 financial conditions and risks can change significantly in a  short period.  Off-site monitoring can help target examination reviews  towards emerging risks at a particular FHLBank or across the System.", "In reviewing advance pricing term compliance, FHFB examiners are  responsible for determining whether the FHLBanks price their advances  above the cost of issuing debt, the FHLBank\u2019s member products policy  clearly outlines the standards and criteria for differential pricing, and the  FHLBanks apply these standards and criteria consistently and without  discrimination to all members.  In reviewing collateral compliance, FHFB  examination teams look at the policies the FHLBanks use to conduct their  collateral verification site visits and the agreements they use to perfect  their liens.  FHFB examiners also review the procedures that the  FHLBanks have established to ensure that they value their members\u2019  collateral frequently so that it is in line with the haircuts that they apply.", "FHFB did not identify significant problems in the FHLBanks\u2019 advance term  pricing practices in examinations completed in 2001 and 2002.

According to FHFB  examination criteria, a \u201cviolation\u201d represents a significant deficiency at a  FHLBank while a recommendation is less serious.  With the exception of  one violation for failure to perform advance collateral verification, FHFB  examinations regarding collateral contained only recommendations that  FHLBanks develop or expand policies.

On an  annual basis, FHFB has requested that the FHLBanks provide data on the  level of collateral securing advances. FHFB requests data on, among other  things, the total value of collateral securing advances, collateralization by  member type (such as commercial bank and thrifts), collateralization by  member size (such as members with $10 billion or more in assets), and the  use of eligible collateral by member institutions (such as the use of single- family mortgages and small business and agricultural CFI collateral).   According to the FHFB\u2019s 2003 request letter, these data are \u201cvery valuable  in exhibiting the System\u2019s safety and soundness and the extent to which  traditional types of collateral secure advances.\u201d  Additionally, FHFB stated  in the letter that the information would help FHFB ascertain the  acceptance and placement of small business and agricultural collateral by  CFIs.", "Although FHFB has identified such data as useful for assessing the  FHLBank System\u2019s safety and soundness, we found that FHLBanks do not  have clear information on how FHFB wants the data to be reported.   Several FHLBanks that we visited report specific collateral\u2014such as  individual single-family mortgages or CFI loans\u2014that has been pledged by  their members to support outstanding advances.   Officials at these  FHLBanks said that they had provided the data in the format requested by  FHFB.  In contrast, other FHLBank officials told us that they reported all of  the eligible collateral on the books of their members.  A senior official from  one of these FHLBanks said that since the bank has access to all the  eligible collateral with whom it has blanket lien agreements, there was no  need to report more specific loan-level data to FHFB.  Officials from one  FHLBank said that FHFB provided only general guidance on what  collateral data to report, which required each FHLBank to develop its own  reporting criteria.", "Table 9 illustrates the differing approaches that the FHLBanks use to report  collateral data to FHFB.  The table shows the total advances outstanding,  the reported collateral securing those advances, and the ratio of collateral  to advances at each FHLBank as of December 31, 2002.  The ratios at  FHLBanks B and K show that their collateral to advance ratios are 1.23 to 1  and 1.26 to 1, respectively.  These FHLBanks report to FHFB individual  collateral securing advances.  In contrast, FHLB E\u2019s ratio of 7.15 to 1 is  explained by the fact that the bank reports to FHLBank the value of all the  eligible collateral held by its members.", "Because certain FHLBanks may report all of the eligible collateral held by  their members, the data that FHFB receives on the acceptance and  placement of CFI collateral\u2014one of FHFB\u2019s stated reasons for collecting  the data---is difficult to assess.  As of December 31, 2002, the FHLBanks  reported to FHFB that there was $7.2 billon in small business and  agricultural loans securing advances by CFIs.  Of that $7.2 billion figure,  $3.6 billion\u2014or approximately 50 percent\u2014was reported by one FHLBank,  which reported the value of all the collateral on its members\u2019 books.  This  FHLBank reported the highest value of CFI collateral in the FHLBank  System.  However, an official from this FHLBank said that a small number  of its members secured advances with CFI collateral and estimated that the  total amount of such advances was $25 million.", "The Director of FHFB\u2019s Office of Supervison said that the agency planned  to review its current collateral data collection and reporting procedures for  the FHLBanks.  The Director said that the collateral data are currently used  to complement FHFB\u2019s safety and soundness supervision program and that  the data provided a broad overview of trends and anomalies.  However, the  Director also said that the collateral data did not substitute for FHFB\u2019s  annual examinations at each FHLBank, which we discussed earlier.   Although the FHLBank collateral data may provide some benefits for  FHFB\u2019s examination program, FHFB\u2019s decision to review current reporting  procedures appears to be appropriate.  The current data do not allow for  meaningful comparisons across the FHLBank System and the reported data  on the placement of CFI collateral are potentially misleading.  With better  collateral data, FHFB\u2019s ability to monitor the FHLBank System\u2019s safety and  soundness could be enhanced.", "FHFB\u2019s oversight of the FHLBank System could also be enhanced by  reviewing the extent to which competition may currently take place  between FHLBanks and its potential effects on the System\u2019s safety and  soundness.  Available evidence suggests that competition may take place  between the FHLBanks, including (1) key differences in advance term  pricing across the FHLBank System, (2) statements by some FHLBank  officials that holding company subsidiaries may play one FHLBank against  another to obtain more favorable advance rates, and (3) the legal authority  of holding company subsidiaries to transfer assets between one another  thereby creating the potential that collateral may be moved from one  subsidiary to another to obtain more favorable advance rates.  Although  there is evidence that competition between the FHLBanks takes place, the  evidence is largely anecdotal and has not been quantified.  Given FHFB\u2019s  oversight responsibilities for the FHLBank System, it could benefit by  collecting data necessary to better understand the degree of competition  within the System.  For example, FHFB could collect data on the advance  terms---including interest rates---that the subsidiaries of holding companies  obtain on advances and whether the eligible collateral at each subsidiary  has fluctuated over time.  By collecting such data, FHFB could identify the  potential effects that holding company subsidiaries have on competition  between the FHLBanks and whether such competition in any way has  affected the FHLBanks\u2019 underwriting standards.  Additionally, such data  could assist FHFB in assessing the potential competitive and safety and  soundness implications of multidistrict membership."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Within the framework established by statute and regulation, the FHLBanks  have independent authority to set advance pricing terms that meet their  business needs and the needs of their members.  As a result, advance  pricing terms vary across the FHLBank System as evidenced by sometimes  differing interest rates, tiered-pricing programs, collateral requirements,  borrowing limits, and advance activity capital requirements.  Because many  holding companies have multiple subsidiaries, each of which may be  eligible for membership in a different FHLBank, they have the opportunity  to obtain advances from those FHLBanks that offer the most advantageous  terms.  Under exemptions to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve  Act, moreover, the potential also exists that holding companies can transfer  assets from one subsidiary to another to obtain favorable advance pricing.   These conditions create the potential for competition on advance pricing  among the FHLBanks and any such pressures may be enhanced under  multidistrict membership.", "FHFB has a critical responsibility in helping to ensure that the FHLBanks  sometimes differing advance pricing terms are conducted within statutory  and regulatory requirements.  In particular, FHFB is responsible for  ensuring that the FHLBanks do not price advances below the cost of funds  and fully secure advances with eligible forms of collateral.  Although FHFB  has not identified any serious violations in advance pricing terms in recent  years, the agency has an important responsibility to ensure that any  competitive pressures do not threaten the FHLBank System\u2019s safety and  soundness.  However, the data that FHFB currently collects on collateral  from the FHLBanks is of questionable value in their current format for  understanding the System\u2019s safety and soundness.
