Partner governments expect to benefit from defined influence over aircraft requirements, improved relationships with U.S. aerospace companies, and access to JSF program data. Yet international participation also presents a number of challenges. For example, while international partners can choose to share any future program cost increases, they are not required to do so under the terms of negotiated agreements. Therefore, the burden of any future increases may fall almost entirely on the United States. Technology transfer also presents challenges. The large number of export authorizations needed to share project information, solicit bids from partner suppliers, and execute contracts must be submitted and resolved in a timely manner to ensure that partner industry has the opportunity to compete for subcontracts and key contracts can be executed on schedule. Transfers of sensitive U.S. military technologies--which are needed to achieve aircraft commonality goals--will push the boundaries of U.S. disclosure policy. While actions have been taken in an attempt to address these challenges, additional actions are needed to control costs and manage technology transfer. Finally, if partners' return-on-investment expectations are not met, support within their countries could deteriorate. To realize this return-on-investment, partners expect their industry to win JSF contracts through competition--a departure from other cooperative programs, which directly link contract awards to financial contributions. If the prime contractor's efforts to meet these expectations come into conflict with program cost, schedule, and performance goals, the program office will have to make decisions that balance these potentially competing interests."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is viewed by many within the  Department of Defense (DOD) to be a model acquisition program, as well  as a new model for cooperative development and production between  DOD and U.S. allies.

In March 1997, the Secretary of  Defense directed that DOD engage allies in discussions as early as possible  to determine the parameters of potential collaboration to meet coalition  needs and ensure interoperability between allied systems. DOD guidance  states that the department will give favorable consideration to transfers of  defense articles, services, and technology consistent with national security  interests to support these international programs. Finally, the AECA  further provides that when the United States enters into a cooperative  agreement, there should be no requirement for industrial or commercial  compensation that is not specifically stated in the agreement.

By doing this, the program moved away from the industrial  policies of other cooperative programs that have used work share  arrangements for participation in the development of military items.

For example,  cost estimates for the system development and demonstration phase have  increased on multiple occasions since the program started in 1996. During  that time, the expected cost for this phase went from $21.2 billion to  $33.1 billion as a result of scope changes and increased knowledge about  cost. According to program officials and documents, partners have not  been required to share any of these costs because the changes were DOD  directed and unrelated to partner actions or requirements.", "The MOU framework does require partners to pay for all development  costs related to meeting unique national requirements. For example, some  partners expect to use weapons that may not be included in the current  JSF operational requirements document and fully expect to bear the cost  associated with integrating them into the aircraft\u2019s design. In such a case,  the United States and other partners are not required to share costs  associated with meeting unique country requirements, unless they agree to  make these requirements part of the baseline aircraft configuration and an  adjustment is made to the baseline aircraft price.", "Historically, DOD has responded to cost increases by requesting more  funding, extending program schedules, reducing overall program  quantities and aircraft capability, or some combination of these. While  such actions can negatively affect the U.S. military services, the impact  may be more substantial for partners because they have less control over  program decisions and less ability to adjust to these changes. In the case  of the United Kingdom, the Ministry of Defence is developing a new  aircraft carrier, expected for delivery in 2012, which is planned to carry  JSF aircraft. According to United Kingdom officials, if the aircraft are not  delivered as expected, the carrier might not be able to support mission  scenarios. Further, most of the remaining partners also expect to receive  their JSF aircraft beginning in about the 2012 to 2015 time frame. Potential  program delays would affect the availability of the aircraft for partner  governments. Finally, if the unit cost increases as a result of DOD\u2019s  actions, the sales price could be higher than expected, and all partners  would be required to pay that additional amount. Current cost estimates  for the program assume that the United States will purchase 2,443 and  the United Kingdom 150 JSF aircraft.

If a partner refuses to share legitimate costs during  the system development and demonstration phase, the United States can  use future phase negotiations to recoup all or part of those costs. In  these instances, the United States could reduce levies from future sales,  refuse to waive portions of the nonrecurring cost charges for Level III  partners, or in a worst case, choose not to allow further participation in  the program.", "Partner representatives indicated that they intend to cooperate with the  JSF Program Office and Lockheed Martin in terms of sharing increased  program costs when justified. However, the continued affordability of the  development program and the final purchase price are important for  partners, and there is no guarantee that they would automatically  contribute to cost overruns, especially if the increase is attributable to  factors outside their control. Some partner representatives specifically  expressed concern over the tendency of U.S. weapon system requirements  to increase over time, which results in greater risk and higher costs.  Several partner representatives also emphasized that it is important for the  JSF Program Office to continue to use practices such as Cost as an  Independent Variable and iterative requirements definition to address  these concerns. While some partners could fund portions of cost overruns  from military budgets if requested, others told us that even if they were  willing to support such increases, these decisions would have to be made  through their parliamentary process, which could affect their overall  support for the program.", "DOD and the JSF Program Office expect that using a competitive  contracting approach, without prescribed work share for partner  countries, will also assist in controlling JSF costs. DOD officials stated,  and our past work has shown, that cooperative programs, such as the  Army\u2019s Medium Extended Air Defense System, have experienced cost and  schedule problems because such programs focused on meeting industrial  work share requirements rather than pursuing a cost-effective acquisition  strategy. Coproduction programs, such as the F-16 Multinational Fighter  Program, that employ traditional work share approaches often experience  cost premiums to the program in terms of increased manufacturing costs  associated with use of foreign suppliers. In contrast, the JSF approach is  expected to award contracts to the most competitive suppliers, and  therefore Lockheed Martin does not believe there will be cost premiums.

Therefore,  the JSF Program Office will ultimately have to make decisions to balance  partner expectations and program execution."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management of Partner Expectations Is Critical for Program Success", "paragraphs": ["Partner representatives generally agreed with the JSF competitive  approach to contracting, but cautioned that while it is too early to assess  results, their industries\u2019 ability to win JSF contracts and participate in  design and development is vital to their continued involvement in the  program. In addition, some partners stated that retaining political support  for the program in their countries will depend, in large part, on winning  contracts whose total value approaches or exceeds their financial  contributions for the JSF system development and demonstration phase.  In addition to the amount of work placed in a partner country, partners  have expectations about the timing of contracts and/or which companies  in their countries win contracts. If return-on-investment and other  expectations are not met, partners could decide to leave the program and  not purchase the aircraft. If a partner decided to leave the program, DOD  would be deprived of anticipated development funding and an opportunity  to improve interoperability among U.S. allies, while Lockheed Martin  could be faced with lower than projected international sales.", "Other cooperative programs provide for industrial participation  commensurate with the financial contributions of the partners. In contrast,  the JSF MOU provides that, to achieve \u201cbest value for money,\u201d DOD will  require contractors to select subcontractors on a competitive basis to the  maximum practical extent. To support this approach, Lockheed Martin has  taken the following steps to manage partner return-on-investment  expectations, identify opportunities for qualified bidders to compete for  JSF contracts, and provide visibility into the subcontracting process for  the program:    To manage partner return-on-investment expectations, Lockheed  Martin sent teams of engineers and business development personnel to  partner countries and assessed suppliers\u2019 ability to compete for JSF  contracts. In some cases, Lockheed Martin signed agreements with  partner governments and suppliers to document the opportunities they  would have to bid for JSF contracts, as well as the potential value of  those contracts. DOD and program office officials told us that these  agreements were necessary to secure political support in certain  countries because the U.S. government does not guarantee that the  partners will recoup their investment in the program through contracts  with their industry. In at least one case, Lockheed Martin has promised  an international contractor predetermined work that satisfies a major  portion of that country\u2019s expected return-on-investment. While  disavowing knowledge of the specific contents of these agreements,  DOD was supportive of their use during partner negotiations. DOD  officials conceded that the agreements contained in these documents  departed from the competitive approach, but expressed the hope that  the use of these agreements would not be widespread.", "In response to partner concerns about the slow pace of contract  awards, Lockheed Martin has stated that the bulk of the remaining  subcontracting with partner industry will come later in the current  phase or during the production phase, especially in countries where the  aerospace industry is less developed and contracts are more likely to  be awarded for build-to-print or second-source manufacturing.", "To provide visibility into the subcontracting process, Lockheed Martin,  the JSF program manager, DOD, or a combination of the three have  provided explanations of how sourcing decisions were made after  partner governments raised concerns on behalf of suppliers about the  results of competitions. These governments were told that suppliers  submitted bids far above the competitive range and thus were not  selected. In addition, DOD, JSF Program Office, and Lockheed Martin  personnel provided feedback to the partners concerning how to  approach future competitions.", "The award fee structure of Lockheed Martin\u2019s contract permits the  JSF Program Office to establish focus criteria applicable to specific  evaluation periods. To help ensure partner industries are provided  opportunities to compete for JSF subcontracts, the program office  established focus criteria concerning subcontract competition for the  evaluation period between November 1, 2002, and April 30, 2003.  Lockheed Martin was judged on its ability to (1) provide partners  regular insight into subcontracting opportunities, (2) encourage its  major suppliers to consider partner suppliers on a competitive basis,  and (3) acquire needed export authorizations in a timely manner to  support competitions. In response, Lockheed Martin has developed a  database to track contract opportunities, especially for international  suppliers and U.S. small businesses, and provides monthly summaries  of industrial participation to partner personnel in the program office.  These summaries include the names of suppliers, contracts for which  they will be eligible to bid, bid and proposal dates, status of contracts  awarded, and the status of supplier export authorizations. This  database will assist DOD in meeting MOU requirements to provide  visibility into JSF subcontracting efforts.", "Further, some partners have concerns about some aspects of the  competition, including delays in getting U.S. export licenses and  reluctance by a major supplier to provide opportunities to industry in a  partner country. If competition for contracts is not implemented in a  manner consistent with partner expectations, partners\u2019 continued support  for the program could be jeopardized.", "JSF industrial relationships are solely developed between U.S. contractors  and partner country industry. After deciding to award work to foreign and  domestic companies based on competition, instead of the share of  program costs contributed, DOD and the JSF Program Office have left  implementation of this competitive approach to Lockheed Martin under  the standard Federal Acquisition Regulation clause related to competition  in subcontracting. Lockheed Martin officials told us their approach for  supplier selection is based on factors such as a supplier\u2019s ability to  incorporate a management approach that is responsive to maintaining  JSF schedules, reducing design and production cost within acceptable  risk levels, developing a solid technical approach with opportunities  for technology improvements, reducing aircraft size and weight, and  increasing aircraft performance. They further told us that this approach is  being implemented without regard to a supplier\u2019s country of origin, with  U.S. and international suppliers competing equally. Lockheed Martin  concluded that awarding subcontracts in this manner would help  achieve program affordability goals and avoid pressure from partners to  guarantee contract awards consistent with their monetary contributions to  the program.", "Program officials told us that since the award fee emphasizes overall  affordability, program management, technical progress, and development  cost control, it should incentivize Lockheed Martin to perform  subcontracting activities on a competitive basis. If, during its regular  monitoring of contract execution, the program office identifies the need  for more emphasis in a certain area\u2014such as reducing aircraft weight or  providing opportunities to international suppliers\u2014it can address this  concern through the contract\u2019s award fee process. While the program  office has used an award fee focus letter to encourage Lockheed Martin to  provide a competitive environment, it has not evaluated whether  competitive results have been achieved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The JSF program is not immune to unpredictable cost growth, schedule  delays, and other management challenges that have historically plagued  DOD\u2019s systems acquisition programs. International participation in the  program, while providing benefits, makes managing these challenges more  difficult and places additional risk on DOD and the prime contractor.  While DOD expects international cooperation in systems acquisition to  benefit future military coalition engagements, this may come at the  expense of U.S. technological and industrial advantages or the overall  affordability of the JSF aircraft. Over the next 2 years, DOD will make  decisions that will critically affect the cost, schedule, and performance of  the program. Because Lockheed Martin bears the responsibility for  managing partner industrial expectations, it will be forced to balance its  ability to meet program milestones and collect program award fees against  meeting these expectations, which could be the key in securing future  sales of the JSF for the company. In turn, DOD must be prepared to assess  and mitigate any risks resulting from these contractor decisions as it  fulfills national obligations set forth in agreements with partner  governments. While steps have been taken to position the program for  success, given the size and importance of the program, additional attention  on the part of DOD and the program office would help minimize the risks  associated with implementing the international program. Toward this end,  DOD and the JSF Program Office need to maintain a significant knowledge  base to enable adequate oversight and control over an acquisition strategy  that effectively designs, develops, and produces the aircraft while ensuring  that the strategy is carried out to the satisfaction of the U.S. services and  the international partners. Tools are in place to provide this oversight and  management, but they must be fully utilized to achieve program goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide greater knowledge, which anticipates decisions needed as the  JSF program matures, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the JSF Program Office to ensure that the Lockheed Martin international  industrial plan  identifies current and potential contracts involving the transfer of  sensitive data and technology to partner suppliers;   evaluates the risks that unfavorable export decisions could pose for the    develops alternatives to mitigate those risks, such as using  U.S. suppliers.", "We also recommend that the Secretary direct the JSF Program Office to  ensure that information concerning the prime contractor\u2019s selection and  management of suppliers be collected, closely monitored, and used for  program oversight. This oversight should include identifying potential  conflicts between partner expectations and program goals, developing  focus letters that encourage Lockheed Martin to resolve these conflicts,  and making award fee determinations accordingly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. These  comments are reprinted in appendix III. DOD provided separate technical  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the JSF Program Office to ensure that the Lockheed Martin  international industrial plan identifies current and potential contracts  involving the transfer of sensitive data and technology to partner  suppliers, evaluates the risks that unfavorable export decisions could pose  for the program, and develops alternatives to mitigate those risks. DOD  did raise a concern about our suggestion that using U.S. suppliers was one  way to avoid the risks that unfavorable export decisions could pose for the  program. In particular, DOD stated it could undermine the program\u2019s  affordability goals. However, we believe that due to the level of advanced  technology on the JSF program, affordability goals must be considered in  the context of protecting some of the most sensitive U.S. technologies\u2014 those vital to maintaining U.S. technical superiority. This means that  technology transfer considerations must be part of the sourcing process. If  contracts are awarded without identifying and addressing technology  transfer issues, the protection of sensitive technology or the execution of  those contracts could be compromised. For example, if a contract is  awarded to a partner supplier, an export decision that subsequently  prohibits or places conditions on the transfer of controlled data or  technology to that company could adversely affect its ability to execute  the contract. If mitigation options have not been identified, the likely  outcome is pressure on the export control system to approve broader  export authorizations in support of program goals. In other cases where  technology transfer concerns have not been anticipated or addressed,  JSF contractors could be forced to re-source work, which could also  undermine not only affordability but other goals, such as meeting  program schedule.", "The international industrial plan referenced in our recommendation can  help alleviate these potential pressures by identifying alternatives, one  of which would be identifying potential U.S. suppliers in cases where  technology transfer is a concern. In its comments, DOD states that  mitigating risk in this manner could require the dual sourcing of specific  JSF contracts. This is not necessarily the case. Again, ideally, these  technology transfer issues would be anticipated before a development or  production contract is competed or awarded. With this knowledge, the  JSF Program Office and Lockheed Martin could suggest adjustments to  work packages or bidders\u2019 lists if the technology or companies in question  are likely to raise export control concerns. Regardless, the end result  could still be the selection of a single source\u2014one that advances  affordability and protects sensitive U.S. technology.", "DOD also concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the JSF Program Office to ensure that information  concerning the prime contractors\u2019 selection and management of suppliers  is collected, closely monitored, and used for program oversight. In its  comments, DOD stated that the JSF Program Office would work closely  with Lockheed Martin to achieve effective program oversight with regard  to partner expectations and program goals.
