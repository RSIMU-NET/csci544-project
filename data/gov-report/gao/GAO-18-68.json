Most consumers who purchase health plans through the exchanges receive tax credits to help them pay for their premiums. The value of a consumer's premium tax credit is based, in part, on the premium for the benchmark plan, which is the second lowest cost option available in the consumer's local area within the exchange's silver metal tier (one of four metal tiers that indicate the value of plans). Because plan premiums and plan availability can change over time, the benchmark plan in each local market can also change over time.

These consumers purchase health insurance for a  variety of reasons, including being self-employed or a small business  owner, or because their own employer does not offer insurance. Through  the exchanges, consumers can directly compare and select among health  plans based on a variety of factors, such as premiums and provider  networks. PPACA also established requirements for the benefits that  must be covered by health plans\u2014referred to as essential health benefits\u2014and required issuers to market their plans according to defined  categories (or metal tiers) that indicate the extent to which the plans  would be expected to cover the costs of consumers\u2019 medical care.", "Each year, there is an open enrollment period during which new  consumers may enroll for coverage and consumers who are already  enrolled in an exchange plan may re-enroll into that plan or choose a  different plan. Eligible consumers who do not make an active  re-enrollment selection are to be automatically re-enrolled in their existing  plan if it remains available. If that plan is no longer available, they are  generally automatically re-enrolled in a similar plan if one was identified,  or the consumers would have to actively re-enroll if a similar plan was not  identified. We refer to the similar plans into which automatic re-enrollees  were enrolled if their original plan was no longer available to them as a  \u201csimilar crosswalked plan\u201d throughout this report. According to guidance  from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the automatic re-enrollment  process was established to help ensure continuity in coverage. This  process can help ensure that continuity, but because the exchanges are  dynamic and plan availability and premiums can change from year to  year, some have questioned whether it could have unintended financial  consequences for consumers.", "PPACA includes a variety of provisions related to the exchanges that  could impact what consumers pay for their health insurance. For  example, most consumers purchasing health insurance through the  exchanges are eligible for premium tax credits that can reduce their  out-of-pocket payments for premiums. The amount of this credit is based  on the consumer\u2019s household income relative to the cost of premiums for  the second lowest cost silver plan available to the consumer\u2014referred to  as a benchmark plan\u2014even if the consumer chooses to enroll in a  different plan. A consumer who is eligible for the tax credit and enrolled  in a benchmark plan is responsible for paying a premium amount that is  limited to a certain percentage of his or her income, and the tax credit  generally covers the rest of the premium. If, however, the consumer  enrolls in a plan with a higher premium than the benchmark plan  premium, then the tax credit does not increase and the consumer must  make up the difference. In contrast, if the consumer enrolls in an eligible  plan with a lower premium than the benchmark plan premium, the tax  credit generally does not decrease and the consumer\u2019s payments would  be lower than if enrolled in the benchmark plan. Because plan premiums  and plan availability can change over time, the benchmark plan in each  local market can also change from year to year. Therefore, a consumer  enrolled in a benchmark plan in one year who is re-enrolled, either  actively or automatically, into the same plan the following year may find  that it is no longer the benchmark plan, and so may have to pay a lower  or higher share of income on premiums. Consumers who actively  re-enrolled in an exchange plan may have considered the financial  implications of remaining in the same plan or switching to a new plan.  Consumers who were automatically re-enrolled in an exchange plan,  however, may not have taken those considerations into account.", "You asked us to examine various aspects of automatic re-enrollment and  the potential implications for consumers. We examined:  1.  the extent to which plans identified as benchmark plans remained the  same plans or changed to different plans from year to year and how  premiums for those plans changed;  2.  the proportion of 2015 exchange consumers who were automatically  re-enrolled in the same or similar crosswalked plans, and how those  proportions compared to those for consumers who re-enrolled  actively; and   3.  the extent to which consumers\u2019 financial responsibility for premiums  changed for those who were automatically re-enrolled compared to  those who actively re-enrolled.", "To examine the extent to which plans identified as benchmark plans  remained the same plans or changed to different plans from year to year,  and how premiums for those plans changed, we reviewed relevant  guidance and analyzed data maintained by CMS. These data included  information about the qualified health plans and premiums available for  individual market consumers in 2,598 counties in the 37 states that used  the federal platform from 2015 through 2017. Specifically, we analyzed  data from CMS\u2019s Qualified Health Plan Landscape files and Plan  Attributes Public Use files to determine the plans and gross premiums  (exclusive of any premium tax credits) offered to consumers through the  exchanges during each year and to identify the likely benchmark plans by  county and year. We also analyzed data from CMS\u2019s Plan ID Crosswalk  Public Use files for the 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017 transitions to map  health plan and premium changes across years. For our analyses, we  selected six consumer categories that represented a broad range of  nonsmoking consumers who have shopped for individual market health  insurance each year. They included individuals, aged 21; individuals,  aged 27; couples, aged 30, with no children; individuals, aged 40, with  one child; couples, aged 50, with 2 children; and individuals, aged 60.  The premium amounts and supporting plan information in each data  source used were self-reported by each issuer, and CMS required each  issuer to comply with a data validation and attestation process.", "To determine the proportion of 2015 exchange consumers who were  automatically re-enrolled in the same or similar crosswalked plans, how  those proportions compared to those for consumers who actively  re-enrolled, and the extent to which consumers\u2019 financial responsibility for  premiums changed for those who were automatically re-enrolled  compared to those who actively re-enrolled, we examined analyses  conducted by HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  Evaluation (ASPE). Specifically, we examined analyses conducted as  part of ASPE\u2019s previously issued work on 2015 and 2016 enrollment data  from CMS\u2019s Multidimensional Insurance Data Analytics System (MIDAS),  as well as new analyses that built upon that work. At our request and in  accordance with specifications we provided, ASPE conducted additional  analyses and provided information on the percentages of consumers who  were automatically and actively re-enrolled in the same plans, similar  crosswalked plans, or other plans during the 2015 to 2016 transition and  the net change in monthly premiums, after the premium tax credit for  these consumers. This information was based on plan selections for  consumers enrolled in both 2015 and 2016 through exchanges using the  federal platform for enrollment and eligibility as of February 1, 2016\u2014the  day after open enrollment for health insurance in 2016 ended.", "To assess the reliability of the data on benchmark plans and premiums,  we conducted a series of manual and electronic tests to identify missing  data and other anomalies.

The actuarial values of these metal tiers are as follows:  bronze (60 percent), silver (70 percent), gold (80 percent), and platinum  (90 percent). If an issuer sells a plan on an exchange, it must offer at  least one plan at the silver level and one plan at the gold level. Issuers  are not required to offer bronze or platinum plans.", "Premium Variation and Plan Availability  As we have previously reported, the range of premiums for health plans  offered through the exchanges can vary widely across counties and  states, and the number and type of plans available in the health insurance  exchanges vary from year to year. Issuers can add new plans and  adjust or discontinue existing plans from year to year, or they can extend  or restrict the locations in which plans are offered. As a result, the options  available to consumers can change from year to year.", "PPACA requires that health insurance plans offered through the  exchanges be certified as qualified health plans, meaning that they must  provide essential health benefits, comply with cost sharing limits, and  meet certain other requirements. Essential health benefits include items  and services within ten categories. Some health insurance plans offered  through the exchanges include benefits above and beyond the minimum  requirements. For these plans, only the percentage of the plan premium  that covers the essential health benefits is considered when determining  the consumer\u2019s benchmark plan.", "Certain consumers purchasing health insurance through the exchanges  are eligible for and receive premium tax credits that may reduce their  out-of-pocket costs for premiums. To be eligible for premium tax credits,  individuals and families must generally have a household income of at  least 100, but no more than 400, percent of the federal poverty level  (FPL).", "Consumers who are eligible for premium tax credits and enrolled in the  benchmark plan are responsible for paying premiums that are generally  limited to a percentage of household income, such that individuals and  families with lower household incomes contribute a smaller portion of their  income toward the health plan premium than individuals and families with  higher incomes, and premium tax credits may be applied to only the  portion of the premium that covers essential health benefits. For example,  in 2016, the percentage of household income that consumers who were  eligible for premium tax credits and who lived in the United States were  expected to pay toward the portion of their premiums for their benchmark  plan that covered essential health benefits was 2.03 percent for those at  100 percent of the FPL, 8.18 percent for those at 250 percent of FPL, and  9.66 percent for those at 400 percent of FPL. A consumer\u2019s required  contribution to the premium is the amount of that benchmark plan  premium that is not covered by the premium tax credit. (See table 1.)", "Although consumers\u2019 premium tax credit amounts are determined in part  based on the cost of premiums for their local benchmark plan, the credit  can also be applied towards the premiums for other eligible exchange  plans. However, the premium tax credit available to consumers does not  increase if they enroll in exchange plans with higher premiums than the  local benchmark plan. In such cases, consumers are responsible not only  for their required contribution but also for the difference in premiums.  Similarly, if a consumer chooses to enroll in an exchange plan with lower  premiums than the local benchmark plan premium, then the consumer\u2019s  premium tax credit would also generally remain the same, so the  consumer would pay less for that plan. The tax credit cannot, however,  exceed the total value of the premium. Because most consumers  enrolling in exchange plans are eligible for premium tax credits, most  consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket premium costs are lower than the advertised  cost of premiums.

Eligible returning consumers may enroll in a health insurance  plan through the exchange each year during an open enrollment period.  Federally facilitated exchanges automatically re-enroll eligible exchange  consumers for the next year, unless their health insurance is terminated  or the consumer makes an active plan selection. Through automatic  re-enrollment a consumer is re-enrolled in the same plan for the next year  if that plan remains available to him or her; if the same plan is no longer  available (e.g., because the issuer decided to discontinue a particular  plan or to stop offering the plan in certain locations), then the consumer is  generally re-enrolled in a similar crosswalked plan. The criteria HHS  established for identifying appropriate similar crosswalked plans have  changed over time, but the similar crosswalked plan is typically the same  metal tier level as the original plan. During the 2015 to 2016 transition,  all similar crosswalked plans were plans offered by the same issuer as  the original plan. If that issuer no longer offered an exchange plan, there  was generally no crosswalked plan and automatic re-enrollment was not  an option. Starting with the 2016 to 2017 transition, if the original issuer  did not offer a similar plan, then automatic re-enrollment could be into a  health plan offered by a different issuer, with plan similarity determined  using established criteria.", "Both issuers and exchanges have had roles in informing consumers  about the enrollment process. For example, prior to the start of the 2015  and 2016 open enrollment periods, both the exchange and health plan  issuer were to provide current exchange consumers with general  information about the upcoming enrollment period, including key dates and information regarding eligibility for re-enrollment. In addition, some  consumers were also to receive special notices from the exchange that  provided more detailed information regarding their application status,  eligibility for enrollment and affordability programs, and potential effects  on enrollment if they had not updated information about their income or  eligibility or reviewed their re-enrollment options with the exchange prior  to the end of the open enrollment period. Consumers who were  automatically re-enrolled by an exchange were to receive an additional  notice with updated information about their re-enrollment status.  According to CMS officials, automatically re-enrolled consumers were  provided with information about their new premium amount and any new  advance premium tax credit amounts in a message confirming their  enrollment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "From 2015 to 2017, Most Plans Identified as Benchmark Plans Changed and Benchmark Plan Premiums Generally Increased", "paragraphs": ["In most of the nearly 2,600 counties included in our analysis, the plan that  we identified as the benchmark plan changed from 2015 to 2017. For  example, in 85 percent of the counties included in our analysis, the 2015  benchmark plans were not benchmark plans in either 2016 or 2017, the  other 2 years we studied. The benchmark plan was the same plan in all 3  years in only 3 percent of counties. (See table 3.)", "In addition, benchmark plan premiums were more likely to increase than  decrease from year to year, and increases were higher from 2016 to 2017  than they were from 2015 to 2016. Among all the counties in our analysis,  the median change in monthly premiums for the benchmark plans was an  increase of 11 percent from 2015 to 2016, and 28 percent 2016 to 2017.  As shown in figure 1, the gross premiums for benchmark plans increased  by more than 55 percent from 2016 to 2017 in 12.4 percent of the  counties in our analysis but did not increase by more than 55 percent in  any counties from 2015 to 2016. In contrast, although not particularly  common, relatively stable or even decreasing premiums from year to year  were more likely from 2015 to 2016 than from 2016 to 2017. Appendix I  provides examples of median benchmark plan premiums for 2015, 2016,  and 2017 for select groups of consumers. Because premium tax credits  limit eligible consumers\u2019 payments for benchmark plan premiums to a  percentage of their income, an increase in premiums may not increase  their financial responsibility. Instead, for eligible consumers, the amount  of the tax credit would increase. According to HHS, most exchange  consumers have been eligible for these tax credits; those who were not  eligible for tax credits would not have this protection from premium  increases. The premium increases for consumers who were not eligible  for premium tax credits, or for those who were eligible but who chose  plans that had higher premiums than their benchmark plan premiums,  could have had a more substantial financial impact, because premium tax  credits would not have offset, or fully offset, the higher premiums.", "Although gross premiums for benchmark plans were likely to increase  from 2015 to 2016 and from 2016 to 2017, we found that in many  counties, the implications for automatically re-enrolled consumers were  modest because net premiums\u2014after accounting for tax credits for those  eligible for those credits\u2014were limited. We compared the 2016 premiums  for plans that had been benchmark plans in 2015 to the 2016 benchmark  plan premiums, and we compared the 2017 premiums for plans that had  been benchmark plans in 2016 to the 2017 benchmark plan premiums.   To focus this analysis on the potential effects for those who were  automatically re-enrolled, we limited our comparisons to plans that were  available in both years, or plans for which a similar crosswalked plan had  been identified for the second year. For this analysis, we excluded plans  that were benchmark plans in one year and were also benchmark plans,  or were crosswalked to a benchmark plan, in the following year. We  found that in many counties, the new premiums for plans that had been  (but were no longer) benchmark plans differed only modestly from the  new benchmark plan premiums. For example, in 60 percent or more of  the counties in our analysis, the premium for the previous benchmark  plan was within plus or minus about 7.5 percent of the new benchmark  plan premium. This finding indicates that automatic re-enrollment from a  benchmark plan into a plan that was not a benchmark plan did not  necessarily result in substantially higher premiums compared to the  premiums for the new benchmark plans, and the same would be true for  consumers who actively chose their same or similar crosswalked plan.", "While modest premium differences were not uncommon in either year,  figure 2 also shows that some differences were substantial. (See fig. 2.)  Although consumers who were eligible for premium tax credits were  somewhat insulated from large differences in premiums, if they were  automatically re-enrolled in a plan with a premium that was higher than  their benchmark plan premium, no matter how great the difference, they  would have been be required to pay a larger share of their incomes on  those premiums. And, as already noted, the premium differences for  consumers who were not eligible for premium tax credits, or for those who  were eligible but who chose plans that had higher premiums than their  benchmark plan, could have had a more substantial financial impact  because premium tax credits would not have offset, or fully offset, the  higher premiums."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Thirty Percent of Consumers Who Re-enrolled in 2016 Were Automatically Re-enrolled, and the Remaining Consumers Actively Re-enrolled, Generally into Different Plans", "paragraphs": ["Among consumers who were enrolled in plans through the federal  platform in both 2015 and 2016, 30 percent (about 1.7 million consumers)  were automatically re-enrolled.

Changes in net monthly premiums varied  around these medians, however, with some consumers facing large  increases or, in some cases, large decreases in their net monthly  premiums.
