Executive approvals of key acquisition documents are about 6 months late--due in part to the complexity of navigating three agencies' approval processes. Delays in finalizing these documents could hinder plans to complete contract negotiations by July 2007 and could keep the program from moving forward in fiscal year 2008 with a new program baseline. The program office has also made progress in establishing an effective management structure by adopting a new organizational framework with increased oversight from program executives and by instituting more frequent and rigorous program reviews; however, plans to reassign the recently appointed Program Executive Officer will likely increase the program's risks. Additionally, the program lacks a process and plan for identifying and filling staffing shortages, which has led to delays in key activities such as cost estimating and contract revisions. Until this process is in place the NPOESS program faces increased risk of further delays. The methodology supporting a June 2006 independent cost estimate with the expectation of initial satellite launch in January 2013 was reliable, but recent events could increase program costs and delay schedules. Specifically, the program continues to experience technical problems on key sensors and program costs will likely be adjusted during upcoming negotiations on contract changes. A new baseline cost and schedule reflecting these factors is expected by July 2007. Development and testing of major NPOESS segments--including key sensors and ground systems--are under way, but significant risks remain. For example, while work continues on key sensors, two of them experienced significant problems and are considered high risk. Additionally, while progress has been made in reducing delays in the data processing system, work remains in refining the algorithms needed to translate sensor observations into useable weather products.

In 2003, we reported that  changes in the NPOESS funding stream caused a delay in the program\u2019s  schedule. Specifically, in late 2002, DOD shifted the expected launch date  for its final DMSP satellite from 2009 to 2010. As a result, the department  reduced funding for NPOESS by about $65 million between fiscal years  2004 and 2007. According to program officials, because NOAA was  required to provide the same level of funding that DOD provides, this  change triggered a corresponding reduction in funding by NOAA for those  years. As a result of the reduced funding, program officials were forced to  make difficult decisions about what to focus on first. The program office  decided to keep NPP as close to its original schedule as possible because  of its importance to the eventual NPOESS development and to shift some  of the program\u2019s deliverables to later years. This shift affected the  NPOESS deployment schedule. To plan for this shift, the program office  developed a new program cost and schedule baseline.", "After this new baseline was completed in 2004, we reported that the  program office increased the NPOESS cost estimate from about $7 billion  to $8.1 billion; delayed key milestones, including the planned launch of the  first NPOESS satellite\u2014which was delayed by 7 months; and extended the  life of the program from 2018 to 2020. The cost increases reflected  changes to the NPOESS contract, as well as increased program  management funds. According to the program office, contract changes  included extension of the development schedule, increased sensor costs,  and additional funds needed for mitigating risks. Increased program  management funds were added for noncontract costs and management  reserves.", "At that time, we also noted that other factors could further affect the  revised cost and schedule estimates. Specifically, the contractor was not  meeting expected cost and schedule targets on the new baseline because  of technical issues in the development of key sensors, including the  critical VIIRS sensor. Based on its performance through May 2004, we  estimated that the contractor would most likely overrun its contract at  completion in September 2011 by $500 million\u2014thereby increasing the  projected life cycle cost to $8.6 billion. In addition, we reported that risks  associated with the development of the critical sensors, integrated data  processing system, and algorithms, among other things, could contribute  to further cost increases and schedule slips\u2014and we noted that continued  oversight was critical. The program office\u2019s baseline cost estimate was  subsequently adjusted to $8.4 billion.", "In mid-November 2005, we reported that NPOESS continued to experience  problems in the development of a key sensor, resulting in schedule delays  and anticipated cost increases. At that time, we projected that the  program\u2019s cost estimate had grown to about $10 billion based on  contractor cost and schedule data. We reported that the program\u2019s issues  were due, in part, to problems at multiple levels of management\u2014 including subcontractor, contractor, program office, and executive  leadership. Recognizing that the budget for the program was no longer  executable, the NPOESS Executive Committee planned to make a decision  in December 2005 on the future direction of the program\u2014what would be  delivered, at what cost, and by when. This involved deciding among  options involving increased costs, delayed schedules, and reduced  functionality. We noted that continued oversight, strong leadership, and  timely decision making were more critical than ever and we urged the  committee to make a decision quickly so that the program could proceed.", "However, we subsequently reported that, in late November 2005, NPOESS  cost growth exceeded a legislatively mandated threshold that requires  DOD to certify the program to Congress. This placed any decision about  the future direction of the program on hold until the certification took  place in June 2006.

At that time, NPOESS exceeded the 25  percent threshold, and DOD was required to certify the program.  Certifying a program entailed providing a determination that (1) the  program is essential to national security, (2) there are no alternatives to  the program that will provide equal or greater military capability at less  cost, (3) the new estimates of the program\u2019s cost are reasonable, and (4)  the management structure for the program is adequate to manage and  control costs.

These revised milestones deviated from prior plans to have the first  NPOESS satellite available to back up the final POES satellite should  anything go wrong during that launch.", "Delaying the launch of the first NPOESS satellite means that if the final  POES satellite fails on launch, satellite data users would need to rely on  the existing constellation of environmental satellites until NPP data  becomes available\u2014almost 2 years later. Although NPP was not intended  to be an operational asset, NASA agreed to move NPP to a different orbit  so that its data would be available in the event of a premature failure of  the final POES satellite. However, NPP will not provide all of the  operational capability planned for the NPOESS spacecraft. If the health of  the existing constellation of satellites diminishes\u2014or if NPP data is not  available, timely, and reliable\u2014then there could be a gap in environmental  satellite data. Table 3 summarizes changes in key program milestones over  time.", "In order to reduce program complexity, the Nunn-McCurdy certification  decision decreased the number of NPOESS sensors from 13 to 9 and  reduced the functionality of 4 sensors.

As a result, the revised NPOESS system has  significantly less capability for providing global climate measures than was  originally planned. Specifically, the number of EDRs was decreased from  55 to 39, of which 6 are of a reduced quality. The 39 EDRs that remain  include cloud base height, land surface temperature, precipitation type  and rate, and sea surface winds. The 16 EDRs that were removed include  cloud particle size and distribution, sea surface height, net solar radiation  at the top of the atmosphere, and products to depict the electric fields in  the space environment.

This Program Executive Officer reports directly to the Executive  Committee. Subsequently, the Program Executive Officer and the Program  Director proposed a revised organizational framework that realigned  division managers within the Integrated Program Office responsible for  overseeing key elements of the acquisition and increased staffing in key  areas. In June 2006, the Nunn-McCurdy certification decision approved  this new management structure and the Integrated Program Office  implemented it. Figure 9 provides an overview of the relationships among  the Integrated Program Office, the Program Executive Office, and the  Executive Committee, as well as key divisions within the program office.", "Operating under this new management structure, the program office  implemented more rigorous and frequent subcontractor, contractor, and  program reviews, improved visibility into risk management and mitigation  activities, and institutionalized the use of earned value management  techniques to monitor contractor performance. Specifically, program  officials and the prime contractor now review the subcontractors\u2019 cost and  schedule performance on a weekly basis. The information from these  meetings feeds into monthly government meetings with the prime  contractor to review progress against milestones, issues, and risks.  Further, the Program Director conducts monthly reviews with each  technical division lead to review the divisions\u2019 achievements, risks, and  plans. Program officials note that these frequent reviews allow information  on risks to be quickly escalated from subcontractors to contractors, to the  program component level, and to the Program Director\u2014and they allow  program officials to better manage efforts to reduce risks. The program  office also reported that all division leads were trained in earned value  management techniques and were effectively using these techniques both  to monitor subcontractor and contractor performance on a weekly basis  and to identify potential problems as soon as possible.", "In addition to these program office activities, the Program Executive  Officer implemented monthly program reviews and increased the  frequency of contacts with the Executive Committee. Specifically, the  Program Executive Officer holds monthly program management reviews  where the Program Director and program division leads (for example,  those in charge of systems engineering or ground systems) provide  briefings on the program\u2019s earned value, progress, risks, and concerns. We  observed that these briefings allow the Program Executive Officer to have  direct insight into the challenges and workings of the Integrated Program  Office and allow risks to be appropriately escalated and addressed. These  meetings also provide an open forum for managers to raise concerns and  ask questions about operational challenges. For example, when NASA  officials expressed concerns that vibration levels used during testing were  higher than necessary and were causing damage to key sensor  components, the Program Director and Program Executive Officer  immediately established a forum to discuss and mitigate this issue. The  Program Executive Officer briefs the Executive Committee in monthly  letters, apprising committee members of the program\u2019s status, progress,  risks, and earned value and the Executive Committee now meets on a  quarterly basis\u2014whereas in the recent past, we reported that the  Executive Committee had met only five times in 2 years.", "While the NPOESS program has made progress in establishing an effective  management structure, this progress is currently at risk.

As of March 2007, the Program  Executive Officer has held this position for 16 months.

Program office staffing is especially important for  NPOESS, given the acknowledgment by multiple independent review  teams that staffing shortfalls contributed to past problems. Specifically,  these review teams noted shortages in the number of system engineers  needed to provide adequate oversight of subcontractor and contractor  engineering activities and in the number of budget and cost analysts  needed to assess contractor cost and earned value reports. To rectify this  situation, the June 2006 certification decision directed the Program  Director to take immediate actions to fill vacant positions at the program  office with the approval of the Program Executive Officer.", "Since the June 2006 decision to revise NPOESS management structure, the  program office has filled multiple critical positions, including a budget  officer, a chief system engineer, an algorithm division chief, and a  contracts director.

However, almost a year after the certification, the  program office still lacks a programwide process for identifying and filling  all needed positions. As a result, division managers often wait months for  critical positions to be filled. For example, in February 2006, the NPOESS  program estimated that it needed to hire up to 10 new budget analysts. As  of September 2006, none of these positions had been filled. Today,  program officials estimate that they only needed to fill 7 budget analyst  positions, of which 2 positions have been filled, and 5 remain vacant.

Specifically, the cost analysis group assessed two risks: (1) the uncertainty  of the health of the current polar-satellite constellation and (2) the  uncertainty of when the new satellite system could be delivered (including  the time needed to evaluate new satellites once in orbit). The resulting  analysis showed that the restructured NPOESS system could be delivered  and the first satellite launched by 2013 with a high level of confidence in  maintaining satellite data continuity.", "To determine specific costs, the group used the existing work breakdown  structure employed by the program office as the basis for performing its  work. This work breakdown structure consists of seven major elements,  including ground systems; spacecraft; sensors; assembly, integration and  test; system engineering/contractor program management; government  program management; and launch.", "The cost analysis group also took steps to ensure the validity of the data  that went into the estimate. For each element, the cost analysis group  visited all major contractor sites to collect program data including    schedule (including the original, rebaselined, and current schedules, and  risks affecting the current schedule);   current staffing profile by month;  the history of staffing used;  the qualifications of people charging the program; the program\u2019s technical approaches; the contractor\u2019s program legacy (a justification that the contractor has  worked on similar projects in the past and that the contractor should be  able to adapt that knowledge to the current work).", "The cost analysis group also compared this data with contractor labor  rates from the Defense Contract Management Agency and obtained  NASA\u2019s validation of the costs associated with the most significant cost  driver, the VIIRS sensor.", "Since schedule was the primary uncertainty factor in the cost analysis, it  also was the driver of overall costs.

These best practices are also  contained in a draft version of our cost guide, which is currently being  developed by GAO cost experts. We also assessed cost- and schedule- related data, including the work breakdown structure and detailed  schedule risk analyses to determine the reasonableness of the cost  analysis group\u2019s assumptions. We also interviewed cost analysis group  officials to obtain clarification on cost and schedule estimates and their  underlying assumptions. Further, we interviewed program officials to  identify any assumptions that may have changed.", "To identify the status and key risks facing the program\u2019s major segments  (the launch, space, data processing, and ground control segments) and to  evaluate the adequacy of the program\u2019s efforts to mitigate these risks, we  reviewed the program\u2019s Nunn-McCurdy certification decision memo and  other program documentation. We analyzed briefings and monthly  program management documents to determine the status and risks of the  key program segments. We also analyzed earned value management data  obtained from the contractor to assess the contractor\u2019s performance to  cost and schedule. We reviewed cost reports and program risk  management documents and interviewed program officials to determine  the program segments\u2019 risks that could negatively affect the program\u2019s  ability to maintain the current schedule and cost estimates. We also  interviewed agency officials from the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the  NPOESS program office to determine the status and risks of the key  program segments. Finally, we observed senior-level management review  meetings and attended conferences to obtain information on the status of  the NPOESS program.", "We performed our work at the NPOESS Integrated Program Office and at  DOD, NASA, and NOAA offices in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area  between July 2006 and April 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Overview of Satellite Data Processing Algorithms and the Calibration and Validation Process", "paragraphs": ["Algorithms are sets of instructions, expressed mathematically, that  translate satellite sensor measurements into usable information. In the  NPOESS program, government contractors are responsible for algorithm  development; the program office is responsible for independently  validating the algorithms. Scientists develop these algorithms, which are  then written as computer code to be incorporated into the interface data  processing system (IDPS) operational system. The NPOESS ground  system uses three primary types of algorithms:    Algorithms to develop raw data records \u201cunpack\u201d the digital packets  received by the antennas/IDPS (the ones and zeros) and sent from the  satellite, associate the data with the information about the satellite\u2019s  location and, finally, translate it back into the data it was when it started at  the sensor.", "Algorithms used to develop sensor and temperature data records allow the  on-ground users to understand what the sensor saw. It translates the  information from the sensor into a measure of the various forms of energy  (e.g., brightness, temperature, radiance).", "Algorithms used to produce the weather products called environmental  data records (EDR) are crosscutting. They combine various data records,  as well as other data, in order to produce measures useful to scientists.  Additionally, EDRs can be \u201cchained\u201d\u2014that is, the output of one EDR  algorithm will become an input into the next EDR algorithm. To illustrate,  cloud detection/mask is an important \u201cbase\u201d EDR because many EDRs,  like sea surface temperature, are only calculated when clouds are not  present. Figure 13 shows the flow of the data and algorithms.", "A corollary to algorithm development is the calibration and validation  process. According to a senior algorithm scientist, in this process, once the  satellite has been launched, scientists verify that the sensors accurately  report what ground conditions are. For example, one EDR from the  visible/infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS) is \u201cocean color.\u201d Once the  sensor is in orbit, scientists can compare the results that the VIIRS sensor  reports on ocean color with the known results from sensors on ocean  buoys that also measure ocean color in select locations. Then, if the  sensors do not accurately report the ground conditions, scientists can  calibrate, or \u201ctweak,\u201d the algorithms used to develop sensor, temperature,  and environmental data records to report on ground conditions more  accurately.", "According to an agency official, fully calibrating a simple sensor once it  has been launched can take approximately a year.
