The act mandated that GAO report on the program to Congress by January 31, 2004, 2007, and 2010. Two subsequent laws authorized an additional $1 billion in NMTC authority for certain qualified investments and extended the program for 1 year with an additional $3.5 billion of authority. This report (1) describes the status of the NMTC program, (2) profiles NMTC program participants, (3) assesses the credit's effectiveness in attracting investment by participating investors, and (4) assesses IRS and the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund compliance monitoring efforts.

CDEs that received allocations began making NMTC investments in 2003, and the program has continued to grow since then. Investors use two main investment structures to make NMTC investments: direct investments to CDEs and tiered investments, which include equity investments and leveraged investments, where a portion of the investment amount originates from debt and a portion from equity. Banks and individuals constitute the largest proportion of NMTC investors, though banks and other corporations have made the largest share of NMTC investment. CDEs that received allocations applied for allocations in a competitive selection process and, through fiscal year 2005, most investment from CDEs to low-income communities had been used for either commercial real estate rehabilitation or new commercial real estate construction. The results of GAO's survey and statistical analysis indicate that the NMTC may be increasing investment in low-income communities by participating investors. Investors indicated that they have increased their investment budgets in low-income communities as a result of the credit, and GAO's analysis indicates that businesses may be shifting investment funds from other types of assets to invest in the NMTC, while individual investors may be using at least some new funds to invest in the NMTC. The CDFI Fund and IRS developed processes to monitor CDEs' compliance with their allocation agreements and the tax code. However, IRS's study of CDE compliance does not cover the full range of NMTC transactions, focusing instead on transactions that were readily available, and may not support the best decisions about enforcement in the future. Moreover, IRS and the CDFI Fund are not collecting data that would allow IRS to identify credit claimants and amounts to be claimed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress established the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program in the  Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 as part of an ongoing effort to  address one of our nation\u2019s most persistent challenges\u2014the revitalization  of impoverished, low-income communities. Conventional access to credit  and investment capital for developing small businesses, retaining jobs, and  revitalizing neighborhoods is often limited in economically distressed  communities or in communities with large low-income populations. The  NMTC provides investors (individuals, financial institutions, other  corporations, etc.) with a tax credit for investing in communities that are  economically distressed or consist of low-income populations.", "Currently, the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI)  Fund in the Department of the Treasury is authorized to allocate up to  $19.5 billion in tax credit authority to Community Development Entities  (CDE) that manage NMTC investments in low-income community  development projects. CDEs are domestic corporations or partnerships  with a primary mission of serving or providing investment capital for low- income communities or low-income persons. Tax credit authority is the  amount of investment for which investors can claim a tax credit at rates  that total, over the 7 years they can claim the credit, 39 percent of their  investment.

We concluded progress was being made in implementing the NMTC  program, but we also recommended that Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  and the CDFI Fund work together to develop plans for designing and  implementing compliance monitoring processes. IRS and the CDFI Fund  agreed with our recommendation and have taken steps to design and  implement compliance monitoring processes.", "Based on consultations with staff at cognizant congressional committees,  this report (1) describes the status of the NMTC program; (2) profiles the  characteristics of NMTC investors, the CDEs that receive NMTC  allocations, and the businesses and communities that receive NMTC  investments; (3) assesses how effective the NMTC has been in bringing  new investment to low-income communities by the investors that have  participated in the program; and (4) assesses the steps that IRS and the  CDFI Fund are taking to ensure CDEs and investors are complying with  the NMTC and evaluates how effective these steps have been.", "To accomplish these reporting objectives, we met with officials from the  CDFI Fund and IRS. We collected documents on the program\u2019s status and  efforts to monitor NMTC compliance. We also analyzed data from the  CDFI Fund on the CDEs and their investment in low-income communities  and tax return data from tax years 1997 through 2004 for investors in the  NMTC program. We used these data to report summary statistics that  profile the participants in the program and to conduct statistical analysis  that measures the effect of the NMTC on investment by participating  investors. In our statistical analysis, we compared a stratified random  sample of taxpayers that did not make NMTC investments with investors  that did make NMTC investments using fixed-effects regressions and  comparisons based on other statistical methods to measure the effect of  the NMTC on corporate investors\u2019 growth in net assets and individual  investors\u2019 growth in wealth.

Once an organization  has been certified as a CDE by the CDFI Fund, it is then eligible to apply  for an NMTC allocation.", "Both for-profit and nonprofit CDEs may apply for and receive NMTC  allocations (once a CDE is awarded with an allocation, it is often referred  to as an allocatee). However, only a for-profit CDE can offer NMTCs to  investors. Therefore, when a nonprofit CDE receives an NMTC allocation,  it must transfer the allocation to one or more for-profit subsidiary CDEs  (referred to as suballocatees). NMTC applicants submit standardized  application packages in which they respond to a series of questions about  their track records, the amounts of NMTC allocation authority being  requested, and their plans for using the tax credit authority.", "The CDFI Fund staff and a group of external reviewers who have  experience in business, real estate, and community development finance  then review the applications and score them based on the following four  areas: (1) community impact, (2) business strategy, (3) capitalization  strategy, and (4) management capacity. The applicants can receive a score  of up to 25 points in each of the areas, and CDEs can obtain up to 10  additional \u201cpriority points\u201d for demonstrating that they have track records  of successfully investing in low-income communities and/or that they  intend to invest in unrelated entities. After being reviewed and scored by  three different reviewers (and, in some cases, a fourth reviewer if a  scoring anomaly exists), the applicants are ranked and NMTC allocation  awards are made in descending order of the highest aggregate scores to  applicants that met minimum thresholds in each of the four areas. The  CDFI Fund makes award determinations in this order until the allocation  authority is exhausted. The CDFI Fund also provides a written debriefing  to each CDE that does not receive an allocation in order to provide them  with reasons their application did not receive an NMTC award and to  provide the CDE with suggestions on how to be more competitive for  NMTC awards when applying in future rounds.", "As figure 1 shows, after the allocations are made to the CDEs, investors  make equity investments, by acquiring stock or a capital interest, in the  CDEs to receive the right to claim tax credits on a portion of their  investment. In turn, the CDE must invest \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the  proceeds into qualified low-income community investments (QLICI).  Eligible investments include, but are not limited to, loans to or  investments in businesses to be used for developing residential,  commercial, industrial, and retail real estate projects; and purchasing  loans from other CDEs.", "Once a qualifying investment has been made in a CDE and the CDE has  invested the funds in an eligible low-income community, the investor can  claim the tax credit over the course of 7 years. In addition, equity investors  may receive returns on their investments in the form of dividends or other  income that they receive from the CDE during the period in which they are  eligible to claim the credit. The NMTC investor is still usually allowed to  claim the NMTC for the full 7-year period even if the business that the CDE  provides investment to defaults on its loans or files for bankruptcy.  However, in the case of a business that receives NMTC funds going  bankrupt, the ability of the investor to recover its initial equity investment  in a CDE would depend on the assets and financial condition of the CDE  as well as the original agreement that the CDE entered into with the  investor.", "The NMTC is a nonrefundable tax credit, meaning that taxpayers do not  receive payments for tax credits that exceed their total tax liability. In  addition, taxpayers that are eligible to claim the tax credit may sell their  investment, along with the right to claim any remaining tax credits, to  another investor after the initial NMTC investment. For example, an  investor may make an equity investment in a CDE that would allow it to  claim the credit and then sell its equity share in the CDE to another  investor, thereby transferring the right to claim the remaining credits to  this investor. The original investor may choose to sell its equity share in a  CDE, and consequently its right to claim the credit, because it does not  have a tax liability for that year or other reasons, such as the timing of the  original investment.", "Once investors begin claiming the credit on their tax returns, three things  can trigger a recapture event (meaning that the investor will no longer be  able to claim the credit because the investment no longer qualifies for  NMTCs). The NMTCs can be subject to a recapture if the CDE (1) ceases  to be certified as a CDE, (2) does not satisfy the \u201csubstantially all\u201d  requirement, or (3) redeems the investment.

Currently,  regulations defining targeted populations have not been finalized.  However, the CDFI Fund and IRS have provided guidance for what  qualifies as a targeted population. These guidelines specify that the  targeted populations, which are individuals or an identifiable group of  individuals, must meet tests to qualify as low-income communities and the  businesses or entities receiving the investments must also meet certain  criteria.", "In IRS\u2019s recently provided guidance, the definition of GO Zone targeted  populations is similar to the definition for low-income targeted  populations with some differences. In cases where a business is located  within the GO Zone, it does not mean that it automatically qualifies for  NMTC investment dollars. First, the GO Zone targeted population need not  qualify as low-income individuals as defined above, but rather the  population must consist of individuals who lack access to loans or equity  investments because they were displaced from their principal residence or  lost their principal source of employment because of Hurricane Katrina.", "Second, the NMTC investment must serve targeted populations in census  tracts within the GO Zone that meet certain requirements, including that  they contain one or more areas designated by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) as flooded or having sustained extensive or  catastrophic damage as a result of Hurricane Katrina.", "Figure 2 illustrates the effect that recent legislative changes have had on  the census tracts that are eligible to receive NMTC investments. As the  figure shows, geographically, a large portion of the country qualifies for  NMTC investment, and there are eligible areas in every state.

Relatively few QEIs were made in 2003 when the program  was in its early stages, but the number of QEIs increased significantly in  both 2004 and 2005. This pattern of growth reflects increases in NMTC  allocation authority and increased time for CDEs to establish business  relationships with potential investors. In addition, more QEIs were made  in CDEs that received allocations in 2003 and 2004 than in CDEs that  received NMTC allocations in 2005.

NMTC  investors have used two primary investment structures when making QEIs  in CDEs: (1) direct NMTC investment and (2) tiered NMTC investments.  As of December 2006, about 54 percent of the $5.3 billion in NMTC  investments were made using tiered investment structures. In a direct  NMTC investment, an investor makes a QEI in a CDE that reinvests the  money in a low-income community. (See fig. 5 for a description of these  NMTC investment structures). In tiered investment structures, which  include both equity investments and leveraged NMTC investments,  investors provide equity or loans to a pass-through entity that combines  funds from several sources, and the pass-through entity makes the QEI in  a CDE. In both direct and tiered investment structures, equity investors in  a CDE are able to claim the NMTC on their tax returns and, after leaving  the equity investment in the CDE for the 7 years during which they are  eligible to claim the credit, they can redeem their original equity stake in  the CDE.", "In a tiered equity investment structure, the dollars invested in the  investment fund consist entirely of equity investments from multiple  investors. These investment structures accounted for about 13 percent of  NMTC investment as of December 2006. In a tiered leveraged investment  structure, a portion of the money being invested in the investment fund  comes from equity investors and a portion of the money originates from a  debt investment (loan). As of December 2006, about 41 percent of all  NMTC investment was made using the leveraged approach.", "The leveraged investment structure may make NMTC investment more  attractive to some investors because it allows investors to invest in the  CDE who may not be able to claim tax credits but could still benefit from  the economic returns. The investment structure can be used to separate  the tax benefits of the investment from the economic benefits of the  investment. For example, an investment fund partnership makes a             $1 million leveraged qualified equity investment in a CDE where $400,000  of the money comes from the equity investors in the partnership and the  other $600,000 comes from a bank as an interest-only loan to the  investment partnership with a balloon payment after 7 years. The CDE that  receives the QEI reinvests the money by loaning \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the  $1 million to a QALICB. In this structure, the economic and tax benefits  are separated: the bank receives interest payments on the loan to the CDE  and, after 7 years, the bank will also be entitled to collect principle  payments on the loan while the equity investors are entitled to claim the  NMTC for 7 years, totaling 39 percent of the total $1 million QEI\u2014not just  the $400,000 that was originally invested as equity. NMTC equity investors  may also receive a return on their investment, in the form of dividends or  partnership income, for example, during the 7-year period while they can  claim the credit. However, neither the investment fund partnership nor the  underlying investors can redeem any portion of the QEI during this period  and still remain eligible to claim the credit.", "The leveraged investment structure may also offer a more attractive  combination of risk and return than direct investment. From the bank\u2019s  perspective in the example above, this investment structure may be  attractive because the loan-to-value ratio is more favorable than it would  have been if the debt was not being combined with the investors\u2019 equity.  The more favorable ratio may compensate the bank for assuming a greater  degree of risk, most notably if the business that receives the loan from the  CDE defaults on its loan agreement. In that case, the bank\u2019s investment is  only secured by the equity in the original investment partnership ($400,000  in the example above). From the equity investor\u2019s perspective, if the  business defaults on its loan, they are still allowed to claim the full amount  of the credit\u2014as long as the business that receives the funds is a qualifying  business in the year the loan is made.", "As the NMTC program has grown, investors have used more complicated  investment structures, such as tiered investments. According to CDFI  Fund data, 81 percent of investors making NMTC investments through  December 2006 used tiered (including both equity and leveraged) NMTC  investment structures, with investors in more recent years being more  likely to use tiered structures. For example, 69.1 percent of investors  making QEIs in 2003 and 2004 used tiered structures, while 87.5 percent of  investors making QEIs in 2005 and 2006 used tiered structures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CDFI Fund\u2019s Data Collection Systems Are Operational", "paragraphs": ["The CDFI Fund uses four data collection systems to administer and  monitor the NMTC program.

This interest in low-income community  investment is also reflected in survey responses where 90 percent of  investors said the goal of improving conditions in low-income  communities influenced their decision to invest in the NMTC from a  moderate to very great extent. Most investors also indicated that they plan  to make additional NMTC investments.", "The survey responses indicate that in many cases, the credit alone may not  have been sufficient to justify the investment. The NMTC can also be  packaged with a number of other government incentives to make the  investment more attractive. About half of respondents combine the NMTC  with at least one other government incentive that can provide additional  tax benefits to the investor. As figure 9 shows, state and local tax  abatements are the most popular type of government incentive used. Some  respondents that packaged the NMTC with other government incentives  indicated that their ability to package the credit played an important role  in their decision to make the investments, which may indicate that in some  cases, the NMTC, in and of itself, is not a strong enough incentive to  encourage investment in low-income communities.", "Meeting other government regulations may also be an important incentive  for making NMTC investments.

Statistical analysis of  corporations that claimed the NMTC indicates that, in general, NMTC  investment funds are not new investment made from an increase in total  funds available. When combined with information from the survey, this  statistical result may indicate that corporations are shifting NMTC  investment funds from other uses. Statistical analysis of individuals who  invested in the NMTC indicates that in the aggregate, NMTC investment  funds represent, at least in part, an overall increase in investment levels.  Because corporate NMTC investment accounts for the majority of QEIs,  the increased investment associated with participation in the program is  likely to come primarily from funds shifted from other uses.", "Statistical analysis of corporations that claimed the NMTC indicates that  NMTC investment funds are not likely to represent new overall  investment. To assess whether NMTC investments represent new funds,  we compared the growth rate in net assets of corporations that made  NMTC investments to the growth in net assets of a similar group of  corporations that did not make NMTC investments over time. We selected  our comparison group using a stratified random sample of taxpayers  based on total assets at the end of the tax period. We drew the comparison  groups based on 2000 tax year data because this was the year before the  credit could be claimed and in that year we would not expect any changes  in behavior because of the credit. If NMTC investments represent new  investment funds then we would expect the net assets of NMTC  participants to grow faster over time than the net assets of corporations  that did not make NMTC investments. Using multiple specifications, our  results suggest that corporate claimants\u2019 net assets are not growing faster  than similar corporations that did not make NMTC investments.", "Rather than new investment, NMTC investment could represent a shift of  investment by participating corporations from high- or moderate-income  communities to low-income communities. This conclusion follows from  combining evidence from the survey of investors with evidence from the  statistical analysis. Because our analysis does not show a faster growth  rate for NMTC investors, it is possible that the credit has no effect on  investor behavior, but instead rewards investors for investment in low- income communities that would have been made in the absence of the  credit. However, the effect of the credit may also be to shift investment  from other low-income communities or from high- or moderate-income  communities. Although it contains some contrary indicators about the  effect of the credit, the survey of investors that benefit from claiming the  credit, indicated that most investments would not have occurred in the  absence of the credit and that NMTC investors had increased their  investments in low-income communities because of the credit. Therefore,  we infer that the most likely effect of the credit is that it shifts investment  by participating investors into low-income communities from higher  income communities. Further analysis of the components of net assets,  total assets, and total liabilities, which are discussed in appendix II,  produced inconclusive results regarding the source of the shifted funds.", "Shifted investment funds, in contrast to new investment funds, indicate  that investors are decreasing investment in another asset or assets by  some or all of the amount that they invest in the NMTC program. Investors  might choose to shift funds for a variety of reasons, including a higher rate  of return expected from the NMTC investment, a need to make an  investment eligible for meeting CRA requirements, or the ability to  establish new business relationships. Regardless of the reason, if funds are  shifted as the result of a tax benefit, the shifting potentially creates other  economic costs, including the opportunity cost of other uses of the funds,  and benefits. These costs and any benefits that accrue to low-income  communities should also be considered when evaluating the overall  effectiveness of the tax credit in addition to the revenue costs of the  program.", "When analyzing the effect of NMTC participation on the net assets of  corporations, our results consistently showed no effect. Further, when we  tested our results using different data specifications, we were still not able  to detect an effect. However, our analysis of the NMTC\u2019s effect on net  assets for corporations had several limitations. For example, the amount  of NMTC investment might be small enough relative to a corporation\u2019s  total size that our statistical models could fail to detect a positive effect of  the NMTC investment on corporations\u2019 asset levels. We attempted to  mitigate this problem by basing our analysis on firm-level data, the  smallest unit of analysis available, and growth in assets over time. In  addition, we did not have data for total liabilities. We calculated a  corporation\u2019s total liabilities by subtracting stockholders\u2019 equity and  retained earnings from the \u201ctotal liabilities and shareholders\u2019 equity\u201d line- item on the tax return. Additionally, our data made it difficult to identify  which industry NMTC corporate investors participated in, another variable  that would have helped strengthen our analysis.", "Similar analysis of individuals who invested in the NMTC indicates that at  least some portion of their investment may represent an overall increase in  investment (or \u201cnew\u201d investment) rather than investment shifted from  other uses. To assess whether NMTC investments represent new funds, we  compared the wealth of individuals who made NMTC investments to the  wealth of a similar group of individuals who did not make NMTC  investments over time. If NMTC investments represent new investment  funds then we would expect the wealth of NMTC claimants to grow faster  over time than the wealth of nonclaimants. As table 8 shows, the NMTC is  associated with a positive effect on the growth in NMTC investors\u2019 wealth.  This means that NMTC investors\u2019 wealth is growing at a faster rate than  similar investors who did not make NMTC investments. Thus, according  to our analysis for individual NMTC claimants, the NMTC program  investors appear to be increasing their investment in low-income  communities because their QEIs represent investments that they would  not have made otherwise and these investments are placed into low- income communities according to program rules.", "The increase in wealth for individuals can be broken down into its  components, such as interest-bearing assets and business assets. The  NMTC can have indirect effects on these components of wealth through its  effect on after tax income. In addition to potentially producing ordinary  returns on investment (such as dividend payments), part of the return on  NMTC investments comes in the form of reduced tax liabilities. Because  they are paying less in taxes, NMTC investors have more income available  for investing in other types of assets and for consumption. As table 8  shows, our results are consistent with individuals placing at least a portion  of this income into interest-bearing assets, such as savings accounts or  certificates of deposit. As table 8 shows, these new NMTC assets also  appear to take the form of business assets, including partnerships.  Increases in business assets may be consistent with typical NMTC  investment structures where many individuals are investing through pass- through entities.", "In our analysis, NMTC participation by individuals was associated with  greater growth in wealth, and most variables measuring this association  were highly statistically significant. In addition, various checks that we  performed were consistent with the results we present above. However, as  was also the case with our analysis of corporate investors, several data  limitations exist for our analysis of individual investors. For instance, we  did not have direct data on asset holdings. Consequently, we estimated  wealth based on income streams reported on tax returns. In addition,  some assets are particularly difficult to measure. Business assets are  especially susceptible to measurement errors as income streams from  these assets may vary widely from year to year. This means that assets not  generating reportable returns, such as stock holdings that do not generate  dividends in a particular year, do not appear in our estimates for that year.  We have attempted to mitigate this problem by conducting a series of  tests, such as using a 3-year average of wealth and asset variables, to  confirm the consistency of our results.

Fully examining the effectiveness of the NMTC requires  addressing at least two main issues: where do NMTC investment funds  come from and do NMTC investments generate economic benefits in low- income communities? Because of data limitations, the relative youth of the  NMTC program, and the inherent difficulties of measuring program costs  and benefits, a full evaluation is beyond the scope of this report. However,  our finding that the NMTC program causes claimants to shift their  investment portfolios suggests that the program might generate some  additional economic costs, such as the opportunity cost of redirecting  investment resources from other, potentially valuable uses. Whether  these economic costs are justified depends on the economic benefits that  are generated in the low-income communities and the extent to which  these benefits accrue to the targeted population.

However, IRS  changed its selection process because it took more time than expected for  CDEs to file tax returns, and the volume of returns filed was not sufficient  for IRS to draw a valid sample in a timely manner. IRS officials said that  the delay for most CDEs occurred because of the lapse of time between  the date that the CDE executed agreements with the CDFI Fund and when  the CDE actually collected equity investments and began operations.", "As a result of the delay in acquiring tax returns for its study, IRS modified  its overall compliance strategy in two ways.

Second, IRS  discontinued the sample approach and decided to manually review every  return that it could identify. IRS initially requested over 80 tax returns  from tax years 2003 and 2004. Of the returns that IRS had received by June  2006, it chose to facilitate audits of CDEs that filed 2004 tax year returns  that had some indication of NMTC activity. According to IRS, because of  the delays in when CDEs were awarded NMTC allocations and the time in  which they began filing tax returns, IRS did not develop specific criteria  for deciding which CDEs to audit.

We have previously reported that  taxpayer compliance studies should be representative of the population  for which compliance is being measured and reasonably designed for  developing compliance measures for the taxpayer population as a whole  and for subgroups of taxpayers (such as suballocatees in the case of the  NMTC program). IRS\u2019s current plan for its compliance study could be  improved to adhere to these standards more closely.

For example, IRS could use CDFI Fund data to categorize CDEs that  invest in different types of projects or CDEs that use different types of  investment structures for NMTC purposes. As the program expands and  more tax return data are available for future rounds, IRS could use the  audit results from its initial CDE audits, along with developing these  criteria for identifying which CDEs it will audit, in order to produce  compliance study results that will be more representative of the entire  population of NMTC allocatees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CDFI Fund Has Systems and Procedures in Place to Monitor CDEs\u2019 Compliance with Allocation Agreements", "paragraphs": ["The CDFI Fund is monitoring CDEs to ensure that they remain compliant  with their allocation agreements through the New Markets Compliance  Monitoring System (NCMS) and, on a more limited basis, site visits.

For  example, in one case the CDFI Fund determined through data reported in  the NCMS that the CDE was serving communities that were outside its  approved service area.

The CDFI Fund is working with most of these  allocatees to correct the problem; however, one first round allocatee has  had its NMTC allocation revoked and another CDE returned its allocation  as a result of not meeting this requirement. In the case where the CDFI  Fund used the NCMS to identify a CDE that was failing the \u201csubstantially  all\u201d test, the CDFI Fund referred the problem to the IRS. In this case, the  CDE was able to correct the problem within 6 months, the amount of time  CDEs are given to correct failing the \u201csubstantially all\u201d test, and further  action was not required.", "The CDFI Fund developed policies and procedures for conducting site  visits to CDEs where CDFI Fund officials check the validity of data  reported by CDEs\u2019 to the CDFI Fund and obtain additional information  about CDEs\u2019 efforts to remain compliant. These policies and procedures  include criteria for prioritizing which allocatees warrant a site visit, the  key information items to collect on a site visit, and a plan for using the  information after the site visit is complete. As of November 2006, the CDFI  Fund had conducted four site visits, two in 2005 and two in 2006, and  indicated that it intends to conduct more visits in the future. A CDFI Fund  official indicated that the CDFI Fund has plans to conduct three site visits  in fiscal year 2007. So far, the CDFI Fund has visited one multiyear  allocatee, one CDE that the NCMS had identified as noncompliant, a CDE  that participates in other CDFI Fund programs, and a bank that received  an allocation award.", "The process of conducting a site visit goes through several steps. A site  visit can be triggered when a CDE meets one or more of the seven criteria  established by the CDFI Fund, which include whether the NCMS identified  the CDE as noncompliant and whether the allocatee received awards in  multiple allocation rounds. Once the CDFI Fund contacts the allocatee it  intends to visit, CDFI Fund officials review the data that the CDE reported  to the CDFI Fund and identify any areas of concern that the CDFI Fund  will investigate during the site visit. During the visit, CDFI Fund officials  review other documents, such as board meeting minutes and financial  documents, and conduct interviews with key staff members. CDFI Fund  officials also review documentation that the CDE maintains in order to  ensure that the data the CDE reported to the CDFI Fund are accurate and  reliable. After the site visit is complete, CDFI Fund officials prepare a site  visit report using information gathered before and during the site visit. If  the CDFI Fund does not find the CDE to be in default with its allocation  agreement, no further enforcement action is taken. However, if the initial  CDFI Fund report finds that the CDE is not compliant with its allocation  agreement, the report is passed on to CDFI Fund senior management who  then either approve or disapprove the report\u2019s finding.", "While these site visits do not yield generalizable results, they do  supplement the information that the CDFI Fund receives through the  NCMS. Unlike IRS, which must audit CDEs to determine if they are  compliant with the NMTC\u2019s laws and regulations, the CDFI Fund is able to  use data reported by CDEs as its primary mechanism for reviewing CDEs\u2019  compliance with their allocation agreements. As a result, the CDFI Fund is  able to use data in the NCMS in conjunction with site visits that do not  yield generalizable results in order to detect when a CDE is no longer  compliant with its allocation agreement.", "If a CDE is determined to be noncompliant, the CDFI Fund can restrict the  CDE\u2019s access to the NMTC program. According to CDFI Fund officials, if  they find a \u201cserious occurrence of noncompliance,\u201d such as a CDE failing  to perform any of the transactions that it agreed to perform, the CDE  would be found in default. To the extent possible, the CDFI Fund would  assist the CDE in correcting the areas in which it was determined to be  noncompliant\u2014this could include amending or modifying the CDE\u2019s  allocation agreement. If the CDE is not able to come back into  compliance, the CDFI Fund could potentially bar that CDE from future  allocation rounds, or if the CDE has not yet issued all its QEIs, the CDFI  Fund could revoke its ability to make additional investments using its  current allocation.

In addition, the MOU states that the CDFI Fund will permit  designated IRS staff to have access to CDFI Fund databases, provide IRS  with the relevant findings and assessments of any site visits to NMTC  allocatees conducted by CDFI Fund staff, and notify IRS of any potential  credit recaptures. Also, on behalf of IRS, the CDFI Fund also includes  compliance questions that CDEs respond to in its database regarding  recapture and investments that CDEs have made in low-income  communities.

While IRS has access to CDFI Fund data,  according to IRS officials, they have had difficulty selectively obtaining the  information that they are most interested in from the CDFI Fund\u2019s data  systems. According to IRS officials, a more streamlined format for sharing  data between IRS and the CDFI Fund would allow IRS to better target  noncompliance. CDFI Fund officials said that they are working with IRS to  develop a streamlined compliance data report, and they indicated that IRS  has been cooperative in working with them. An IRS official agreed that the  two agencies are working together to develop a more user-friendly data  report specifically for IRS.", "IRS is also taking steps to increase the amount of information available  about NMTC investors. IRS is in the process of finalizing a new form that  will require CDEs to report to IRS the amount of QEI that NMTC investors  made at the investment\u2019s original issue. IRS currently does not have these  data for all claimants because the CDFI Fund data that IRS currently uses  to identify credit claimants does not track claimants in cases when the  underlying QEI is sold to another investor. In addition, IRS is finalizing a  second form that will require CDEs to notify the original equity investor in  an NMTC investment if the credit is being recaptured. With these forms  and the CDFI Fund data, IRS will have a complete record of the initial  NMTC investors in a CDE and how much they invested.", "However, further steps could be taken to identify NMTC investors and  ensure that only eligible taxpayers claim the credit and that they claim the  correct amounts. NMTC investors are allowed to sell their equity share in a  CDE, which determines their NMTC eligibility, to other investors after the  initial investment has taken place, and neither the IRS nor the CDFI Fund  tracks NMTC investors after the original investment. IRS officials  indicated that the forms they are finalizing cannot be used to track the  selling of an investor\u2019s equity share in a CDE because they will not be  refiled if the investment is sold to another investor after the original  investment. As a result, IRS and the CDFI Fund will not be able to identify  all NMTC investors and the amount of QEI that they made if an investor\u2019s  equity share in a CDE is sold after the original investment. When  evaluating other tax credits, we have noted that IRS is responsible for  ensuring that taxpayers claim those tax credits for which they are  entitled. If IRS and the CDFI Fund developed ways to identify investors  and the amounts they invested, even when NMTC investors sell their  equity shares in a CDE, they would be better able to ensure that credits are  claimed correctly.", "Our analysis of IRS and CDFI Fund data indicates that many NMTC  investments may be sold after the original QEI is made in the CDE, making  it difficult for IRS to identify all eligible NMTC claimants and the amounts  that they are eligible to claim. When we compared potential tax credit  claimants in IRS\u2019s databases to claimants in the CDFI Fund\u2019s database, we  noted that more investors were identified as being eligible to claim the  credit in IRS\u2019s taxpayer data than in the CDFI Fund\u2019s data on claimants  when a QEI is originally issued.", "According to IRS, requiring individual investors to report sales of NMTC  investments could place an undue burden on taxpayers. However, IRS told  us that this would be useful information for its compliance monitoring  efforts\u2014both for identifying investors eligible to claim the NMTC on their  tax returns and for identifying tax credit investors if IRS is forced to  recapture the credits from investors when a CDE is no longer compliant  with the \u201csubstantially all\u201d requirement. The CDFI Fund already collects  information from CDEs in its database identifying the initial investors and  how much NMTC eligible investment has been made by investors that did  not participate in tiered equity or leveraged NMTC transactions. Further, a  NMTC investor with prior experience investing in CDEs and a  representative of a CDE said that in their experience, CDEs are already  able to identify subsequent holders of NMTC qualified equity investments  when one NMTC investor sells its equity share in a CDE to another  investor, and CDEs could potentially be able to report that information to  the CDFI Fund or IRS.

The statistical analysis  also showed an increase in investment, with individuals adding new  investment and corporations shifting funds from other uses. However,  some of the survey evidence may be less consistent with the credit  increasing investment (e.g., the prior experience of most NMTC investors  with low-income community investment) and, because of data limitations,  our statistical evidence may only establish an association between the  credit and increased investment, not that the program causes the increase.  In any case, the indication that the program increases investment is not  sufficient to support conclusions about the program\u2019s effectiveness, nor is  the fact that the credit shifts investment an indicator of a lack of  effectiveness. For example, more information is needed about the  economic and social benefits that the low-income communities receive  from the investment. This information is only now likely to be available  given that the program\u2019s implementation was delayed.", "IRS and the CDFI Fund are implementing a compliance monitoring system  in the context of a program that is growing and that is attracting investors  that use increasingly complex and sophisticated investment structures.

To report on qualified  low-income community investments (QLICI) from the CDE to the  corresponding qualified active low-income community business (QALICB)  we analyzed data from the Community Investment Impact System (CIIS).  Specifically, we used data from the CIIS Transaction Level Report (TLR)  for fiscal years 2003 through 2005, which provides information on each  transaction made as part of a QLICI. To assess the reliability of the ATS  and the TLR data sources, we reviewed the CDFI Fund\u2019s data quality  control procedures and subsequently determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We also reviewed tax data on NMTC investors from IRS\u2019s Individual  Returns Transaction File (IRTF) and Business Returns Transaction File  (BRTF). We identified NMTC claimants using data on original claimants  (at the time the QEI was made) from the CDFI Fund\u2019s ATS and used their  tax return information to determine how NMTC investors differ in size  from all taxpayers. In cases where we could not locate a corporation\u2019s tax  return because the NMTC investor was a subsidiary of a larger parent  corporation, we used IRS\u2019s National Account Profile to link the subsidiary  to its parent corporation. In these cases, the parent corporation\u2019s tax  return was used in our analysis. In addition, because original claimants  may sell their investment, and along with it their NMTC credit, we  identified further claimants as those individuals or corporations that  indicated they were eligible to claim the NMTC on their tax returns. This  information came from IRS\u2019s IRTF or BRTF on the New Markets Tax  Credit Form (Form 8874) or as part of the General Business Credit (Form  3800).

Because some investors invested with more  than one CDE and because not all investors participated in tiered or  leveraged investment structures, the instrument was designed with skip  patterns directing investors to comment only on the prepopulated CDE  and type of investment structure that they utilized. Therefore, the number  of survey respondents for each question varied depending on the number  of CDEs in which the investor made a QEI and whether the investor had  used tiered or leveraged structures.", "We pretested the content and format of the questionnaire with  knowledgeable investors.

We collected this information primarily from the  investor\u2019s most recent tax return filed with IRS.

The NMTC program may affect investment by  increasing the overall level of investment (i.e., creating \u201cnew\u201d investment)  or by causing NMTC investors to shift investment from other uses to  investment eligible for the credit. The methodology that we use to detect  these changes in investment follows the methodology used in the  retirement savings literature. This literature generally compares the wealth  or financial assets of participants in retirement savings plans to that of  nonparticipants to detect any effect of participation on savings. In our  assessment of the NMTC program, we compare the wealth or assets of  NMTC program participants to that of a group of similar nonparticipants  to detect any effect on investment.", "Our statistical analysis of the effectiveness of the NMTC program in  stimulating investment depends on the distinction between new and  shifted investment. If our analysis detects new investment, this outcome is  consistent with program goals because it may indicate increased  investment in low-income communities that would not have occurred in  the absence of the credit. If we do not detect new investment, it is possible  that the credit has created no change in behavior and investors are just  receiving a subsidy for investments that they would have made anyway,  which is not consistent with the goals of the program. However, the  investment could also be shifted from other communities. The  implications for the effectiveness of the program in the case of shifted  investment are more ambiguous. It could mean that (1) the credit has  induced investors to shift investments from assets invested in other low- income communities, which means that although the credit has generated  investments in projects that would not have occurred otherwise, it has not  increased investment in low-income communities, or (2) NMTC  investments represent funds shifted from higher income communities. The  first outcome is not consistent with the NMTC\u2019s broader goal of increasing  investment in low-income communities as a whole. The second outcome is  more consistent with program goals because, as with new investment, it  may indicate increased investment funds available to low-income  communities. Finally, in the case of both new and shifted investment,  NMTC investment may reduce investment by non-NMTC investors (called  crowding out) which is also inconsistent with the broader goal of the  program. Our data and methodology do not allow us to detect crowding  out, and for this reason, we confine our analysis to the effect of the credit  on the investment behavior of participants in the NMTC program.", "A limitation of our statistical analysis is that in the case of no detected  change in the overall level of investment, we cannot distinguish between  the possible types of shifting or between shifting and the possibility that  there has been no change in investment behavior. However, if we combine  evidence from our survey of investors with evidence from our statistical  analysis, our analysis may provide some indication that the effect of the  program on investment in low-income communities by NMTC investors is  shifted investment. The survey of investors that benefit from the tax credit  indicated that most investments would not have occurred in the absence  of the credit (inconsistent with the notion that the credit has no effect on  investor behavior), and that NMTC investors had increased their  investments in low-income communities because of the credit  (inconsistent with the first shifting outcome above).

There were differences in  the number of claimants identified from the two different sources with the  IRS data resulting in more investors. The source of these differences is  unclear as they could indicate incomplete CDFI Fund data, missing  taxpayer identification numbers (TIN) in the CDFI Fund data, or a large  turnover in credits. In the latter case, investors may not be responding to  the incentives of the credit themselves but to the terms constructed by the  original investor. However, this is not necessarily the case as some  investors we spoke with that had purchased the credit from the original  investor indicated that they intended to participate but that the original  investor was necessary due to timing issues. Because of the uncertainty  over which set of investors is the most relevant for our analysis, we  estimated results using both the full sample (IRS and CDFI Fund  claimants) and CDFI Fund claimants only.

We oversampled high income and total asset taxpayers  relative to an unstratified random sample from the same populations. We  used quintiles to stratify our sample and drew a random sample of about  4,000 returns per quintile. We chose our quintiles and drew the  comparison groups based on 2000 tax year data because this was the year  before the credit could be claimed and in that year we would not expect  any changes in behavior due to the credit.", "For individuals, we collected all available data from Form 1040 and  information from Schedules C and F to form a panel of taxpayers for tax  years 1997 through 2004.

We followed the methods  used in the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to estimate asset holdings  using income streams and rates of return. We also expanded on the SCF  approach by using more sophisticated modeling to develop estimates of  home equity. Rather than attribute to each household the median home  value within its income group (as the SCF does), we estimated home  equity using the November 1999 Wave (12) of the 1996 Survey of Income  and Program Participation. Our controls included total income, age,  marital status, and region. We then applied these estimated coefficients to  tax return information on total income, age, filing status, and region of  residence to generate estimates of home equity for each household using  2000 tax data. Negative values were set to zero, and the consumer price  index (CPI) (research series) was used to adjust the year 2000 estimates  for earlier and later years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects of NMTC Program Participation on Investment", "paragraphs": ["We assessed the effects of NMTC participation by comparing the level of  assets and growth in assets of NMTC participants with the level and  growth in assets of corporations and individuals that did not participate in  the NMTC program. We used regression techniques to compare the level  of assets of NMTC investors and the relevant comparison group. The  results of these models indicate whether the assets of NMTC claimants are  higher than those of our comparison group controlling for other individual  and corporate characteristics. However, it is possible that this approach is  simply picking up the likelihood that NMTC claimants systematically have  higher assets than their counterparts (despite our efforts to choose an  appropriate comparison group using a stratified random sample).  Therefore, we used several methods, including regression and propensity  score techniques, to compare the growth of assets over time. Differences  in growth rates between NMTC investors and the comparison group do not  depend on differences in the level of assets.", "Our baseline model for corporate investors is a fixed effects model of the  following form:  Yit = Xit\u03b2 + \u00b5it For corporate investors, Yit represents the log of total assets, total  liabilities, or net assets; Xit represents control variables which include the  lag of net assets, the NMTC participation dummy, year dummies, and  region dummies; and \u00b5it represents a random error term. Additional  control variables are not used because they are included in the fixed  effect. These variables include corporate-level characteristics, such as  industry, that do not change over time.", "Statistical analysis of this baseline model indicates that corporate NMTC  investment funds are more likely to represent investment funds shifted  from other uses. Although there was some evidence that NMTC investors  have higher levels of net assets than those in our comparison group, this  result was not robust over different specifications of the model. On the  other hand, our analysis of growth rates showed no statistically significant  effect of NMTC investment status on the growth of net assets. This result  means that NMTC investors are not investing at rates different from non- NMTC investors. Unlike the case of asset levels, this result was robust  across several specifications involving regression and propensity score  methods, as indicated in table 9. In addition, the result was qualitatively  the same for each quintile, when we used only years 2001 through 2004 in  the analysis, when we used median regression, and when our analysis  included only banks.", "Further analysis included using instrumental variables for predicting  participation in the NMTC. However, we did not find important differences  between participants and nonparticipants based on location and  participation in other general business credits. We concluded that the  problem of endogeneity may not be a significant issue for corporations  because corporate participants are likely to be exposed to a similar set of  investment options as nonparticipants and individual corporate  characteristics that affect participation are captured in the fixed effect. We  also attempted to identify the source of the shifted investment funds by  dividing net assets into components, total assets and total liabilities.  However, these results were inconclusive as they were not consistent  enough to reach any strong conclusions.", "A limitation of our analysis of corporations is that the amount of NMTC  investment might be small relative to a corporation\u2019s total size. This means  that our statistical models could fail to detect a positive effect of the  NMTC investment on corporations\u2019 asset levels even if such an effect  exists. We attempted to mitigate this problem by analyzing firm-level data,  the smallest unit of analysis available, and growth in assets over time.", "We assessed the effect of NMTC participation on level and growth of  assets for individuals in a manner similar to the analysis for corporations.  Our baseline model for individual investors is a fixed effects model of the  following form:  yit = \u03b3Nit + X1it\u03b2 + \u03bdit where y is the dependent variable, wealth, for household i at time t; N is an  indicator for NMTC investment (which is endogenous, i.e., correlated with  the error term); X is a set of exogenous control variables; \u03b3 and \u03b2 are  coefficients; and \u03bdit is an error term.", "However, unlike the analysis of corporate investors, we analyzed the effect  of NMTC on individuals by estimating an instrumental variables version  of the baseline model to account for possible endogeneity of the NMTC  participation variable. We concluded that this problem is likely to be  worse for individuals than for corporations because individuals are less  likely to have the same information about the various business tax  incentives so that the decision to participate is not random and likely to be  correlated with other explanatory variables. We chose as our instrumental  variables the dollar amount of allocation in the state of residence and the  presence of other general business credits. These variables are likely to  be highly correlated with NMTC participation but not with levels of  household wealth.", "To implement the instrumental variables model, we first estimated N as  follows:  Nit = X1it \u03b2+ X2it\u03bb + \u03bdit where X contains our instrumental variables and the other variables are  defined as in the baseline model. This regression is used to predict NMTC  participation using presence of a general business credit deduction and  the cumulative NMTC allocation in state of residence as instrumental  variables. We then estimated the baseline fixed effects model with Yit as  the log of wealth and Xit as control variables, which include balance due,  an NMTC participation dummy (instrumented), year dummies, and region  dummies. In order to test the effect of NMTC participation on the  components of wealth, we also ran regressions with Yit as the log of  business assets, real estate assets, dividend assets, and interest bearing  assets. Like wealth, these asset levels were measured in thousands of  dollars and adjusted into constant dollars using the CPI research series.  The results of this analysis for asset levels of individuals are presented in  table 10. The coefficient for NMTC investor in the wealth column indicates  that the log of wealth (in thousands of dollars) is significantly higher than  for noninvestors.", "The coefficients of these regressions should not be used to generate  numeric estimates of the magnitude of the effect that the NMTC has on  asset levels. In some cases, the fit of our models is poor and it is difficult  to estimate the value of some types of assets, in particular business assets.  Our results for both the baseline analysis and propensity scoring are  intended to illustrate the direction of the effect that the NMTC has on  participating individuals\u2019 investments.", "Nonetheless, these results show that NMTC participants have higher levels  of wealth and business assets than those in the comparison group after  controlling for individual fixed effects, year, region, and tax balance due\u2014 a proxy for risk attitudes. These results are consistent across four of five  quintiles, using data for years 2001 through 2004 only, and using 3-year  averages for the dependent variable. However, it may be that these  differences in asset levels are simply picking up the likelihood that NMTC  claimants systematically have higher assets that their counterparts. (The  summary statistics show that individual NMTC investors have higher asset  levels on average than the comparison group despite our use of a stratified  random sample where comparison households were chosen based on  levels of adjusted gross income in tax year 2000.) Therefore, as an  alternative measure of the effect of NMTC participation, we compare the  growth in assets between the two groups using closest neighbor  propensity score matching to further narrow the comparison group and  estimate the effect of NMTC participation on asset growth. We used year  2000 data to estimate propensity scores for future participation in the  NMTC. The specification for our propensity scoring is as follows:  Prob(N=1) = G(X \u03b2)", "Where N represents any NMTC participation from 2001 through 2004; X  includes age, balance due, total income, presence of another general  business credit, wage earnings, and dividend earnings; and G( \u00b7 ) is the  cumulative standard normal distribution.", "We then estimated the effect of NMTC participation on the change in the  log of wealth asset levels from 2000 through 2004. Our results show that  individuals who participate in the NMTC have higher growth in interest  bearing assets, business assets, and wealth which is consistent with the  results we obtained for our instrumental variables regressions. For  example, the first column in table 11 indicates that the growth in wealth  for NMTC investors was significantly higher than that of noninvestors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Literature Review and Credits", "paragraphs": ["To develop our methodology, we relied heavily on savings literature,  which generally compares the wealth or financial assets of participants in  retirement savings plans to those of nonparticipants to detect any effect of  participation on savings.
