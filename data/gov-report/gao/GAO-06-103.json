FMCSA uses many approaches, such as direct contact with carriers, media campaigns, distributing printed materials, and establishing Web sites to provide information to target audiences. FMCSA has not described how its education and outreach program activities link expected changes in attitudes and behavior to broader goals, such as DOT's strategic objective of reducing transportation-related fatalities. FMCSA officials state that the education and outreach activities and programs link to agency goals at a high level, but this was not evident from our review, with the exception of the Safety Belt program. FMCSA has used a logic model as a tool in other programs to show the relationship between program activities and broader goals. FMCSA has begun some evaluations of its education and outreach programs, and plans other evaluations of these programs. However, although FMCSA's New Entrant program has existed for over 2 years, FMCSA has no plans to evaluate its New Entrant program until 2008. Thus FMCSA has no information on whether information on its safety requirements, provided through the Education and Technical Assistance package or during New Entrant safety audits--targeted toward truckers newly entering the industry--effectively communicate information to new entrants. This lack of evaluation makes it difficult to determine the impact the education portion of the New Entrant program has on commercial motor vehicle safety. Since FMCSA currently has little information on how its programs have affected attitudes and behavior, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of FMCSA's effort. However, the designs of two programs appear to follow theories and research regarding media campaigns, which are intended to influence decision making about safety. Research and behavior theory suggest that for some types of programs--such as DOT's Click It or Ticket program, which is designed to increase safety-belt use by passenger car drivers--enforcement linked to education can improve results, and FMCSA has indicated it is linking some education and outreach programs to enforcement efforts, where appropriate. Finally, motor carrier association officials whom we spoke with stated that, in their view, FMCSA is doing some positive things in its education and outreach activities. A public safety group stated that FMCSA followed reasonable approaches in starting its education and outreach efforts; however, they would like to see more information on program effectiveness to help FMCSA refine the programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, large trucks represented 3 percent of registered vehicles in the  country, but nearly 12 percent of the people killed in motor vehicle  accidents died in crashes involving large trucks. The Federal Motor Carrier  Safety Administration (FMCSA), within the Department of Transportation  (DOT), is responsible for improving the safety of commercial vehicle  operations\u2014which includes interstate truck and motor coach (bus)  companies\u2014and has set a safety goal to reduce fatalities from an estimated  2.81 per 100 million truck vehicle miles traveled in 1996 to no more than  1.65 per 100 million truck vehicle miles traveled by the end of 2008. Among  the ways that FMCSA attempts to achieve this and other goals is through  education and outreach activities. For example, the agency provides  information to consumers about motor coach safety records and what to  consider when hiring a moving company. It also provides new motor  carriers with information on safety requirements and conducts safety  audits to review motor carrier compliance with these requirements. In  some cases, education and outreach efforts regarding safety audits may be  reinforced when followed-up with enforcement.", "In recent years, we have raised concerns about FMCSA education and  outreach efforts. In 2003, for example, we reported that FMCSA\u2019s \u201cShare  the Road Safely\u201d program lacked a clear program strategy and included  activities that were only tenuously linked to program goals, and we  reported that FMCSA had not recently evaluated the program\u2019s  effectiveness. In addition, our 2001 report on oversight of the household  goods moving industry noted that DOT and FMCSA had made limited  efforts to provide consumer education that would enable the public to be  more informed about hiring a mover. Furthermore, the Congress has  expressed concern about how FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach programs  are meeting broader goals. In the conference report accompanying the  DOT appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005, FMCSA was asked to report by  April 2005 to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on  strategies linking outreach and education program initiatives to each goal.", "The House report accompanying the DOT appropriations bill for fiscal year  2005 asked us to monitor and evaluate FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach  programs and to report on the status of these programs to the House and  Senate Committees on Appropriations. We (1) describe the scope and  nature of FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach programs and how they relate  to FMCSA\u2019s goals, (2) identify the extent to which FMCSA has evaluated its  education and outreach programs, and (3) describe the extent to which  FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach programs are effective. As discussed with  your staff, we focused on five specific education and outreach programs:  (1) the New Entrant; (2) the Non-Entrant; (3) Commercial Safety-Belt Use;  (4) Motor Coach Selection Outreach; and (5) Household Goods Outreach  programs and did not review the \u201cShare the Road Safely\u201d program, which  Congress transferred from FMCSA to the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA) in fiscal year 2004, with FMCSA retaining a  supporting role. The recent highway reauthorization legislation authorizes  funding for this program to both FMCSA and NHTSA and asks us to review  the \u201cShare the Road Safely\u201d program by June 2006.", "To describe the scope and nature of FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach  programs and FMCSA\u2019s intended results for these programs, we discussed  these programs with FMCSA officials at agency headquarters and two field  locations, and we reviewed program materials and documentation as well  as observed a safety audit for the new entrant program. We also analyzed  both the extent to which FMCSA describes how its programs lead to  agency goals and incorporates its education and outreach programs into its  strategic and program planning and performance budgeting. To identify  approaches to describing how agency programs contribute to agency goals,  we reviewed our previous work on government education programs that  showed how a program logic model\u2014a model that links activities to goals  by analyzing program inputs, outputs, and outcomes\u2014illustrates how  education and outreach activities can influence attitudes and behavior, and  ultimately contribute to agency goals. To identify what the agency was  doing to evaluate these programs, we discussed evaluations and evaluation  plans with FMCSA officials at agency headquarters and two field locations.  We also reviewed evaluation materials, including proposals and statements  of work for planned contracts to carry out programs and program  evaluations. Finally, to identify what is known about the effectiveness of  the programs, we conducted a literature review of media based campaigns  and reviewed the structure and evaluation of these campaigns related to  improving safety as well as behavioral theories used in designing the  campaigns. We selected two behavioral theories that were directly  applicable to the programs under this review, which are called the theory of  reasoned action and the general deterrence theory. We also discussed  what is currently known about the effectiveness of these programs with  FMCSA officials and with representatives of associations that serve the  trucking, motor coach, and household goods moving industries, as well as a  law enforcement association and public interest groups that are involved in  motor carrier safety. Our work was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

FMCSA  is engaged in several programs and activities to carry out its mission,  including developing and enforcing Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Regulations, administering Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program grants  to states, regulating interstate household goods movers, and performing  education and outreach. FMCSA operates through its headquarters in  Washington, D.C.; four regional service centers; and division offices located  in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.", "FMCSA undertakes education or outreach while carrying out many of its  functions\u2014for example, in posting regulations pertaining to commercial  drivers\u2019 licensing or transporting hazardous materials on its Web site, or in  providing on-line access to motor carrier crash statistics. FMCSA is also  allocated funding for specific education and outreach programs. In fiscal  year 2005, FMCSA used education and outreach funding for activities  supporting its Safety Belt program targeted to commercial vehicle drivers,  outreach to the public on hiring motor coach services, and outreach to  consumers using household goods movers. Congress also allocated fiscal  year 2005 funding for FMCSA\u2019s program directed at recently registered new  entrant motor carriers and funding to establish an initiative directed to  non-entrants\u2014which are carriers in interstate operations that have not  registered with DOT.", "Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA),  federal programs should be designed with measurable goals that support  the agency\u2019s overall strategic goals. Congress enacted GPRA to shift  agencies\u2019 focus from simply monitoring activities undertaken to measuring  the results of these activities. Under GPRA, agencies develop multiyear  strategic plans, which are the starting point for their performance  measurement. Each strategic plan is to include a mission statement, a set of  outcome-related strategic goals, and a description of how the agency  intends to achieve these goals. To measure progress toward the strategic  goals, we have previously reported that the agency should also have a plan  for collecting data to measure and evaluate program performance.  Without measurable goals and evaluation, it is difficult to determine  whether the program is accomplishing its intended purpose and whether  the resources dedicated to the program efforts should be increased, used in  other ways, or applied elsewhere.", "Research conducted on the effectiveness of media campaigns indicates  that the development of an education and outreach program should include  identifying how the program is expected to change the target audience\u2019s  attitudes and behaviors. There are several theories and models on affecting  behavior, and two in particular are the most relevant to the education and  outreach programs under this review. This is because the theories are  consistent with the structure and goals of the FMCSA programs we  reviewed. One behavioral model that researchers have developed\u2014the  reasoned action theory\u2014assumes that people will take a desired action if  they believe the action is beneficial, and they have the means to undertake  it. Another model that experts have developed\u2014the general deterrence  theory\u2014indicates that in some circumstances people will take a desired  action when they recognize that they may be punished for failing to act.  The relative roles of education and enforcement depend upon the  program\u2019s target audience, the desired change to be achieved, and other  factors.", "Since media campaigns should identify how the program is expected to  change target audiences\u2019 attitudes and behaviors, program managers can  use a tool or framework to show how outreach activities are intended to  influence attitudes and behaviors, and thus achieve broad program goals.  Academic literature on program development and evaluation provides a  number of models. One tool we have previously used to review education and outreach programs is called a logic model. A logic model links  program inputs and outputs to program outcomes (see fig. 3). Agencies  have used such a model to plan, evaluate, and adjust program activities. A  logic model can facilitate planning and evaluation by (1) demonstrating  accountability through focusing on measurable outcomes; (2) linking  activities to results to prevent mismatches between program activities and  outcomes; and (3) integrating planning, implementation, evaluation, and  reporting. In addition, a program logic model can help describe a program\u2019s  components and desired results and explain the strategy\u2014or logic\u2014by  which the program is expected to achieve its goals. The logic model can  help clarify the links between program components, focusing on outcomes  that are measured and under some degree of control. In some cases, it may  be difficult to show a direct link\u2014a specific cause and effect\u2014between  program activities and outcomes due to the influence of external factors.  For example, the Safety Belt program, although targeted toward  commercial motor vehicles operators, may have outcomes influenced by  the NHTSA\u2019s \u201cClick It or Ticket\u201d program targeted to passenger car drivers.  Commercial motor vehicle operators could be affected by this program, or  other safety-belt messages, and decide to wear safety belts when driving  commercially. Thus, the Safety Belt program\u2019s initiatives may not have been  the primary factor in determining a particular driver\u2019s safety-belt use.", "Finally, once program activities are established and linked to program  goals, organizations can use program evaluation to determine whether or  not a program is meeting its goals. Program evaluations are conducted  periodically to provide an overall assessment of how well a program is  achieving its expected results. We have reported on the value of program  evaluations to assess the impact of a particular program. This work  showed that results of evaluations can support decisions on resource  allocation and ways to improve program effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMCSA Has Established Several Education and Outreach Efforts but Needs Specific Links to Goals", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA has established several education and outreach programs, with  different purposes targeted to different audiences.

FMCSA activities under these programs range from distributing  brochures and posting information on Web sites, to site visits to newly  registered motor carriers under its New Entrant program.

The performance budget also indicates  that education will be combined with traffic enforcement of safety-belt  requirements to achieve this outcome. In contrast, the performance budget  discusses the New Entrant program in terms of staffing, funding, and the  number of safety audits to be done in fiscal year 2006, without defining a  goal for what the New Entrant program will accomplish and how that  accomplishment would contribute to the strategic objective of reducing  fatalities.", "In addition, the links between the Motor Coach and Household Goods  program activities and broader strategic goals are difficult to discern.

In short,  people are more likely to change their behavior if they believe the change is  valued\u2014or that not changing their behavior has negative  consequences\u2014and if they have the necessary opportunity to change the  behavior.

Smokers became  aware of the negative consequences, and 26 percent of respondents  indicated that they were more likely to quit smoking based on the  awareness of the negative consequences of smoking. Another study on the  effects of sun exposure showed that countering the mistaken belief that  sun tanning had a positive effect reduced the percentage of individuals who  habitually lie in the sun. These studies demonstrate that emphasizing the  consequences of a negative behavior to individuals can result in changes to  attitudes and behavior, without applying any specific sanctions.", "Based on the theory of reasoned action, education and outreach can have a  positive impact through FMCSA\u2019s two programs that have a goal of  influencing consumers to make appropriate choices of motor carriers.  FMCSA\u2019s Motor Coach and Household Goods Outreach programs are  targeted toward consumers and do not have regulations governing the  consumers\u2019 behavior, thus, according to the theory of reasoned action,  gaining knowledge about the positive consequences of choosing a safe  carrier will affect the individuals\u2019 attitude toward this behavior. The change  in attitude will directly affect intention and the subsequent behavior. Thus,  education and outreach campaigns can provide an individual under these  circumstances with the information that is needed to make a more  educated choice. For example, the Motor Coach program follows this  approach by targeting consumers and conveying the negative  consequences of choosing an unsafe carrier. In the case of the Household  Goods program, the campaign conveys the positive consequences of  choosing a reputable carrier in the Households Goods program, although  the elderly, a group potentially susceptible to unscrupulous carriers, may  require a different delivery method other than FMCSA\u2019s Web site to receive  this message."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Link to Enforcement Can Strengthen Education and Outreach Programs\u2019 Ability to Change Behavior", "paragraphs": ["Independent studies as well as our prior work indicate that the level of  enforcement in safety related programs is positively correlated with  safety-belt use, especially when coupled with public-awareness efforts.  According to the general deterrence theory, individuals must be exposed to  law enforcement or receive information about legal ramifications of their  actions before they can be deterred. The perception or expectation of  certain sanctions results in attempts to avoid committing the offense.  Studies show this theory is an effective model for strengthening the change  in behavior resulting from safety programs. Thus, this link to enforcement  would apply to FMCSA\u2019s three education and outreach programs\u2014Safety  Belt, Non-Entrant and New Entrant\u2014that have existing regulations that  address their target audience\u2019s behavior.", "One study, conducted by the National Safety Council, on the state of South  Carolina\u2019s safety-belt program, showed that while media campaigns  immediately increased awareness of the importance of safety belts, the  largest increase in safety belt-use occurred after officers enforced the  requirement to wear safety belts. Additionally, a 2002 study by NHTSA  included data from the state of Washington, which showed that the  baseline percentage of individuals wearing safety belts (81 percent)  increased slightly with advertising over a 4-week period to 82 percent.  Ultimately with the addition of enforcement efforts, the percentage of  those who wear safety belts increased to 90 percent within 2 months. The  same study showed similar results in Texas, where the effects of  advertising alone raised the safety belt percentage slightly, but the  combination of advertising with enforcement caused the number to  increase another 6 percent, from the 80-percent baseline.  These studies  suggest that although publicity may increase the awareness of the need to  wear safety belts, some people are unlikely to act on that awareness unless  the enforcement component of the campaign was closely integrated with  the publicity campaign. The results of these studies suggest that education  and outreach alone can increase awareness and encourage the intended  behaviors for FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach programs, but that  enforcement can strengthen the result of these efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMCSA Is Increasing Enforcement in the New Entrant Program and Acknowledges the Importance of Enforcement to the Non-Entrant and Safety Belt Programs", "paragraphs": ["Three of FMCSA\u2019s programs we examined, the New Entrant, Non-Entrant  and Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Belt programs have regulations, such  as a requirement for motor carrier drivers to wear safety belts, affecting the  target audiences\u2019 (motor carrier industry) behavior.

In addition, even if a new entrant passes the safety audit, some  carriers are not yet following important safety requirements, such as  having a drug and alcohol testing program, at the time the safety audit was  conducted. This change should establish a better link to enforcement, in  keeping with behavioral research, in that it will be more difficult for new  entrants to retain their operating status unless they are following the safety  requirements at the time of the audit.", "The safety audit has been considered an educational unit, with a strong  emphasis on training new entrants about the requirements to operate in  interstate commerce. For example, the federal register notice that  established the new entrant safety assurance process indicated that the  new entrant process is intended to \u201cimprove the safety performance of new  entrants by providing educational and technical assistance\u201d and required  \u201cminimum requirements to new entrant motor carriers to ensure that they  are knowledgeable about applicable federal motor carrier safety  standards.\u201d There are few sanctions for carriers who fail critical areas of  the safety audit, although a new entrant might be subject to a more  stringent and detailed review\u2014a compliance review\u2014under certain  circumstances. However, the compliance review process occurs less  often with new motor carriers than experienced carriers.", "Although FMCSA\u2019s requirements indicate that the objectives of the safety  audit are to educate the carrier and determine areas where the carrier\u2019s  compliance might be deficient, in practical application almost all new  entrants have passed the safety audit, and little is done to follow-up to  ensure that new motor carriers correct deficiencies identified in the safety  audits. A new entrant can fail two of six sections and still pass the audit.   Safety audit sections include areas such as driver qualifications, business  operations, and maintenance records. Over a 2-year period ending in April  2005, there were 51,681 carriers that passed the safety audit, and only 372  failed, producing a 99.3 percent passing rate for new entrant motor  carriers. Those who fail the audit must take corrective action within 45  days if they are a passenger or hazardous material carrier, or 60 days for all  other carriers, or they will lose operating status. Furthermore, for those  carriers who passed the audit despite failing multiple sections of it, FMCSA  currently has no mechanism to ensure the failed sections of the audit have  been corrected before the carrier achieves permanent status. Although  FMCSA sends letters to new entrants about the sections in which they are  not in compliance with motor carrier regulations; beyond the letter and  agency follow-up to obtain proof of insurance, the agency or its  representatives do not determine if the new entrants have in fact corrected  deficiencies identified during the safety audits.", "Our analysis of critical factors within the safety audit questions revealed  that over the same 2-year period, about 40 percent of the carriers failed the  \u201cdriver\u201d section of the audit, despite passing the audit overall. This section  includes critical questions, such as whether a carrier\u2019s driver qualifications  have been reviewed and whether the carrier's drivers are covered by a drug  and alcohol testing program. Specifically, we found that about 60 percent of  the new entrant carriers that passed the safety audit had failed the  requirement to check qualifications of drivers prior to hiring them.  Checking qualifications means that before hiring a driver a motor carrier  company obtains and reviews information on an applicant\u2019s driving history,  including accident and ticket information. In addition, we found that for the  most part, between 27 and 29 percent of carriers who passed the safety  audit had not maintained maintenance files for requested vehicles. The lack  of improvement over the 2-year period illustrates the importance of  determining if the Education and Technical Assistance Package, which the  carriers received prior to the audit, should be changed to improve these  results.", "FMCSA officials agreed that the safety audit may not be improving safety  behavior of new entrants, and the agency is already tightening these  requirements. Currently, there is no one question or section of the audit  that can cause a new entrant to fail. FMCSA officials informed us that the  new federal register notice laying out stricter pass requirements\u2014expected  to be issued shortly\u2014identify eight critical questions that individually  could lead to failing the safety audit, thus providing more incentive for  carriers to comply with new entrant requirements. For example, carriers  would automatically fail if they do not employ a drug and alcohol program,  have insurance, or have the proper maintenance requirements.

However, in our review of agency  documents, we found that except for the Safety Belt program, FMCSA has  not established clear links between the education and outreach programs  and agency and departmental goals. For example, the conference report  accompanying the DOT appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005 requested  FMCSA report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations \u201ca  goal, message, and coherent and explicit program strategy that clearly and  directly link FMCSA\u2019s outreach and education program initiatives to each  program\u2019s goals\u201d because of its concerns over how FMCSA\u2019s education and  outreach activities support agency goals. In the October 2005 response,  FMCSA stated that its education and outreach programs support DOT  strategic objectives. The report, however, did not clearly set out the links  between changing attitudes and behaviors that would describe how these  programs contribute to objectives. Such a step would be welcome, for  without an explanation of that link, FMCSA cannot transparently  demonstrate to stakeholders, including congressional oversight authorities  that the programs do, in fact, contribute to these broader goals.  Furthermore, without a clear statement of how these programs are  intended to support these goals, it is difficult to design evaluations to  determine if these programs are performing as intended or if changes are  needed in program design. FMCSA has used a type of a logic model for its  Research and Technology program, making it clear to all interested parties  how its research activities help the agency achieve its goals. While FMCSA  officials say they have used a logic model for its education and outreach  program, this is not evident in agency budget and program documents. The  use of a logic model, similar to the one used by the agency\u2019s Research and  Technology group, in planning, budgeting or program for education and  outreach programs may be beneficial.", "Second, the absence of a plan to evaluate how well the information  provided to motor carriers as part of the New Entrant program was  understood and if the information raised awareness and helped promote  safer behavior also emerges as a concern. An FMCSA official stated that  the New Entrant program is still new and has limited data to evaluate.  Further, changes to the program are planned to raise the threshold for  passing a safety audit. Thus, FMCSA is planning on starting an evaluation of  the New Entrant program in 2008. However, without an evaluation of the  effect of education on new entrants\u2019 knowledge about safety requirement,  FMCSA is losing an opportunity to obtain information about the  effectiveness of the educational information conveyed through the  program. In addition, FMCSA cannot know whether its safety audits, which  composed almost 7.5 percent of FMCSA\u2019s 2005 funding, are having the  desired effect; whether the Education and Technical Assistance Package  and the information conveyed during the safety audits might require some  changes to improve their effectiveness; and whether the safety audits  themselves might be achieving their purpose of improving motor carrier  safety. FMCSA has two opportunities upcoming to obtain information on  the effectiveness of the educational materials and safety audits.

In  addition, DOT officials told us that it is not appropriate to include this level  of performance information in budget requests. Since the strategic plan and  the performance budget are not the only opportunities to detail program  linkage to broad agency goals, we clarified our recommendation to provide  FMCSA with more flexibility in identifying an appropriate planning,  program, or budgeting document in which to describe and document the  link between program activities and goals, so that external stakeholders,  including congressional oversight authorities, can understand how these  programs are supporting agency goals.", "Second, agency officials suggested that it is too early to evaluate the New  Entrant program, as we recommended; and they have not developed  evaluation plans because they do not plan on beginning an evaluation until  2008. However, after over 2 years of implementation and 52,000 safety  audits, FMCSA is losing an opportunity to conduct an evaluation of the  educational component of the New Entrant program, including the  Educational and Technical Assistance Package for new entrants and the  information conveyed during safety audits to determine if new motor  carriers increase their knowledge of motor carrier requirements and  change their behavior to better comply with these requirements. The lack  of such an evaluation is a missed opportunity for FMCSA to demonstrate  the effectiveness of its educational information and safety audits, which  represented almost 7.5 percent of its funding in fiscal year 2005. In  addition, we continue to believe this is an important component of any  evaluation FMCSA develops to determine the effectiveness of the New  Entrant program. Therefore, we retained our recommendation to evaluate   the New Entrant program and conclude that there are two opportunities for  doing so\u2014either through contracts for evaluations of education and  outreach programs or through the evaluation FMCSA is planning to start in  2008.", "Finally, agency officials provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Norman Mineta,  Secretary of Transportation.

We selected this division  office and service center because they were significantly involved in all  four of the currently active education and outreach programs we reviewed,  which are the New Entrant, Commercial Safety Belt, Motor Coach  Outreach, and Household Goods Outreach programs. We obtained and  reviewed information on FMCSA\u2019s plans to initiate an additional program  targeted at non-entrant carriers.", "Further, to determine how these programs relate to FMCSA\u2019s goals, we  reviewed its strategic planning and performance budgeting documents and  how these education and outreach programs were portrayed in the current  fiscal year 2006 documents. We also discussed the performance budgeting  process with an FMCSA senior budget analyst to identify the agency\u2019s plans  for the fiscal year 2007 and 2008 performance budgets.  We also obtained  and reviewed the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) strategic plan,  which FMCSA refers to in its performance budget. In addition, we obtained  the strategic plan for FMCSA\u2019s Research and Technology group. We  reviewed this plan to identify what one group within FMCSA uses for its  strategic and program planning. To identify other tools used for describing  how program activities relate to agency goals, we reviewed our previous  work and identified a program logic model, originally developed by the  University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, as a model that FMCSA  could use to clearly describe its education and outreach programs.", "To address our second objective\u2014identifying the extent to which FMCSA  has evaluated its education and outreach programs, we discussed the  status of these evaluation efforts with FMCSA officials and reviewed  proposals and statements of work for current and planned contracts to  carry out program evaluations. We also assessed the usefulness of FMCSA\u2019s  ongoing or planned program evaluations to determine if the ealuations  would address how program activities affected target audiences\u2019 attitudes,  knowledge, and behavior. We did not thoroughly assess the evaluation  design.", "We took several approaches to assess what is currently known about the  effectiveness of programs like FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach programs.  Finally, to identify what is known about the effectiveness of the programs,  we conducted a literature review of media based campaigns and reviewed  the structure and evaluation of these campaigns as well as behavioral  theories used in designing the campaigns. We selected two behavioral  theories that were directly applicable to the programs under this review\u2014 the theory of reasoned action and the general deterrence theory. We then  directly compared the characteristics of the two theories with the  characteristics of FMCSA\u2019s programs. Additionally, through our literature  search, we also identified additional research that discusses the  importance of the relationship between education and enforcement in  changing behavior. We used this research to help assess the potential for  using enforcement to augment FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach efforts. We  obtained aggregated data from safety audit results from FMCSA\u2019s Motor  Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) to examine results for  individual elements within a safety audit. We used these data to identify the  failure rates for key elements of the safety audit. We conducted a reliability  assessment of MCMIS data by (1) reviewing documentation related to  system development, (2) interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and  (3) reviewing FMCSA\u2019s internal controls, and we determined the data was  sufficiently reliable for our use. Finally, we interviewed officials from  several motor carrier, law enforcement, and safety organizations, including  the American Trucking Associations; the National Private Truck Council;  the American Bus Association; the United Motorcoach Association; the  American Moving and Storage Association; the Commercial Vehicle Safety  Alliance; Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety; and Public Citizen for  their perspective of the effectiveness of FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach  efforts.", "In accordance with congressional direction, we did not extend our review  to include \u201cShare the Road Safely\u201d which is targeted to passenger car  drivers. In fiscal year 2004, Congress transferred funding for the program  from FMCSA the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  Funding for this program is being returned to FMCSA in fiscal year 2006.

Other, earlier research had also  indicated that new entrant carriers had crash rates higher than more  experienced carriers. The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, which  established FMCSA, also directed the Secretary of Transportation to  establish regulations specifying minimum requirements for applicant motor  carriers seeking federal interstate operating authority and to require that  new entrants undergo a safety audit within the first 18 months of  operations. Effective January 1, 2003, FMCSA established its New Entrant  program to improve the safety of new entrant motor carriers by providing  them with educational and technical assistance as they begin their  businesses. Under FMCSA\u2019s New Entrant program, any new motor carrier  that registers with DOT is designated a \u201cnew entrant\u201d and will be subject to  a new entrant safety audit and increased roadside performance monitoring  for an 18-month period.", "The safety audit\u2019s purpose is to provide educational and technical  assistance to the new entrant by reviewing the carrier\u2019s compliance with  FMCSA requirements, including driver qualifications, driver records of duty  status, vehicle maintenance records, accident registers, and controlled  substances and alcohol use and testing requirements. Education and  technical assistance information is also available to new entrants through  FMCSA\u2019s Web site. A carrier that passes the safety audit is informed of any  deficiencies and what it must do to be in compliance. A carrier that fails the  safety audit has 60 days to take necessary corrective action, and ultimately  if the deficiencies are not corrected, its registration can be revoked. At the  end of the 18-month period, if the carrier has passed its safety audit, does  not have an unsatisfactory safety rating, and is not subject to an \u201cout of  service\u201d order or any notice to remedy safety management controls, the  \u201cnew entrant\u201d designation will be removed from its registration, and it will  be monitored like any other carrier.", "In most states, new entrant safety audits have been done by both state law  enforcement agency and FMCSA division office personnel. Contractors  conduct safety audits in four states (Florida, Maine, Oregon, and Wyoming)  that are presently doing few or none of their own.

FMCSA officials whom we spoke with  believe that non-entrants may represent an even higher level of risk than  new entrants, because they do not get exposure to FMCSA safety  information through registration. The officials believe that, in general,  motor carriers that do not register with DOT are unaware of the  requirement to do so, rather than intentionally avoiding registering.

In December 2003, FMCSA established the  Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Belt Partnership with 16 other  organizations, including trucking industry and law enforcement  associations, commercial drivers associations, and safety organizations,  with the goal of increasing commercial safety-belt use by commercial  motor vehicle drivers. With its safety belt partners, FMCSA produces  materials including posters, bumper stickers, and brochures for  distribution at trucking industry shows and events, and through law  enforcement campaigns.
