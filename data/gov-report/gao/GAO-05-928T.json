GAO will issue a classified report responding to this request later this year. To keep this testimony unclassified, GAO focused on the latter three questions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration reported about 3,400 violations of restricted airspace from September 12, 2001, to December 31, 2004, most of which were committed by general aviation pilots. Violations can occur because (1) pilots may divert from their flight plan to avoid bad weather, (2) the Administration may establish newly restricted airspace with little warning, and pilots in the air may be unaware of the new restrictions, or (3) pilots do not check for notices of restrictions, as required. Also, terrorists may deliberately enter restricted airspace to test the government's response or carry out an attack. Federal agencies have acted individually or have coordinated to enhance aviation security. For example, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) established a national operations center that disseminates operational- and intelligence-related information, and has enhanced passenger and checked baggage screening, secured cockpit doors, and assessed the risk to some, but not all, commercial airports. Also, few general aviation airport owners have conducted risk assessments. The North American Aerospace Defense Command's mission was expanded to include monitoring domestic air traffic and conducting air patrols. Collectively, the agencies are operating the National Capital Region Coordination Center to secure the National Capital Region. GAO identified gaps in the simultaneous, time-critical, multi-agency response to airspace violations. While it may not be possible to prevent all violations or deter all attacks, GAO identified some gaps in policies and procedures. Specifically, the agencies were operating without (1) an organization in the lead, (2) fully developed interagency policies and procedures for the airspace violations response teleconferencing system, (3) information sharing protocols and procedures, or (4) accepted definitions of a violation. As a result, opportunities may be missed to enhance the security of U.S. aviation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide results of GAO\u2019s  work on violations of restricted airspace and the interagency response.

Established by the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), temporary flight restrictions and  other special use airspace measures are national airspace management  tools used to restrict flights into protected airspace. The intent of  establishing restricted airspace is to reduce the number of flights in that  airspace to only those authorized so that the FAA, the Department of  Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS)  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and other agencies can  more readily identify an unauthorized aircraft and, if needed, take actions  to deter or defeat it.", "Intelligence agencies believe that terrorists remain highly interested in  attacking U.S. aviation with commercial or general aviation aircraft, in  attacking an airport, or in using aircraft to attack targets. Intelligence  agencies differ in their assessments of how significant the threat is from  the use of certain general aviation aircraft in an attack. Our prior work has  shown that the success of interagency efforts depends on melding multi- organizational efforts through central leadership, an overarching strategy,  effective partnerships, and common definitions. Securing and defending  U.S. airspace is a key example of an interagency mission that depends on  close coordination and information sharing between and among the  agencies that share this mission. As many as 7 key government  organizations can be simultaneously involved in responding to a violation  of restricted airspace. TSA is responsible for ensuring that only authorized  pilots, cabin crewmembers, or passengers gain access to an aircraft. Once  airborne, FAA becomes the lead agency and is responsible for managing  traffic entering into or operating in U.S. airspace to ensure safe operations  by monitoring aircraft movements using radar and maintaining  communications with the pilots. Either DOD\u2019s North American Aerospace  Defense Command (NORAD) or DHS is called in to enforce airspace  security if TSA or FAA cannot prevent someone from taking control of an  aircraft without authorization or flying into restricted airspace without  authorization. During a violation, these agencies carry out their  responsibilities simultaneously. This was the case during the incursions  into the National Capital Region restricted airspace during May 2005.", "Today I will provide our findings on (1) violations of restricted airspace  since September 11, 2001, (2) agencies\u2019 individual or coordinated steps to  secure U.S. aviation, and (3) interagency policies and procedures to  manage the response to violations of restricted airspace.

FAA  grounded all air traffic and DOD ordered Air Force fighter jets to fly  patrols over selected U.S. cites to deter and respond to any additional  attacks. In the months after the attacks, the President developed certain  national strategies and directives, and Congress established TSA and gave  it the responsibility to provide security for all modes of transportation.  Congress also later passed and the President signed legislation to protect  the homeland against air, land, and maritime threats, including creating  the DHS to coordinate and lead the national homeland security effort.  After the attacks, interagency coordination increased as FAA, NORAD,  TSA, their parent cabinet departments, and other agencies with homeland  air defense or security roles and missions worked together to meet the  overall goal of protecting U.S. airspace.", "NORAD and the FAA have historically been the main contributors to  protecting U.S. airspace. FAA\u2019s primary mission is to safely manage the  flow of air traffic in the United States, but it contributes to air security  through its control of U.S. airspace. About 17,000 FAA controllers monitor  and manage airspace, support the coordination of security operations, and  provide information to military and law enforcement agencies when  needed. Within NORAD, Continental North American Aerospace Defense  Command Region personnel monitor radar data on aircraft entering and  operating within continental U.S. airspace. NORAD also conducts air  patrols in U.S. airspace."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Different Classes and Use of Airspace", "paragraphs": ["According to FAA, the agency divides airspace into four categories:  controlled, uncontrolled, special use, and other. Controlled airspace may  include special flight restrictions and will have specific defined  dimensions, including altitude ranges, or vertical boundaries, and surface  area, or horizontal boundaries. Any aircraft operating within controlled  airspace must comply with rules governing that airspace or be subject to  enforcement action. Controlled airspace is further divided into classes  ranging from A through E. Each class of airspace has its own level of Air  Traffic Control services and operational requirements that pilots must  follow in order to enter and operate in it. For example, to operate in class  A airspace, pilots must have air traffic controller clearance to enter and  must have communication equipment on board to permit communication  with air traffic controllers. In lesser-restricted airspace, pilots can navigate  by landmarks. Controlled airspace can be further classified with special  flight restrictions. In uncontrolled airspace, class G, air traffic controllers  have no authority or responsibility to control air traffic.", "FAA also reserves airspace for special purposes, called Special Use  Airspace, which is normally established to protect important  infrastructure, including military installations. An Air Defense  Identification Zone is restricted airspace in which the ready notification,  location, and control of aircraft are required for national security reasons.", "FAA\u2019s other airspace category includes national security areas, military  training routes, and temporary flight restriction areas. A temporary flight  restriction typically restricts flights over specified areas for a specified  period of time. These zones can be established over critical infrastructure,  military operations areas, National Security Special Events, and United  States Secret Service protectees (e.g. such as the President, whose  airspace is protected as he moves throughout the United States).", "FAA notifies pilots of temporary flight restrictions through its Notices to  Airmen program. Pilots are required to check for notices before beginning  their flights to avoid any temporary flight restriction zones during their  flights. If pilots violate such a zone, FAA can take actions against them  ranging from suspending the pilot\u2019s certificate to fly in response to a one- time, first-time violation to revocation of the certificate when the violation  is deliberate or otherwise shows a disregard for the regulations.", "Temporary flight restrictions are one component of a tiered security  aviation system. The system includes ground procedures, such as TSA  passenger screening procedures, and in-flight security procedures,  including reinforced cockpit doors and Federal Air Marshals on selected  domestic and international flights. Temporary flight restrictions are  considered passive air space control measures intended to keep the flying  public out of the protected airspace so that agencies can more readily  identify and respond to pilots exhibiting hostile intent. A temporary flight  restriction alone will not prevent pilots from entering the protected  airspace.", "FAA monitors national airspace traffic to ensure safety and has  established triggers to help identify suspicious aircraft and pilots.  According to FAA procedures, FAA controllers are to advise the pilots to  change their course or altitude if they are on a course toward prohibited or  restricted airspace without authorization, or if they are circling or loitering  over a sensitive area. Sensitive areas include airspace over dams, nuclear  and electrical power plants, chemical storage sites, the location of the  President, or military facilities. Various forms of suspicious pilot and  aircraft activity are being monitored.", "If a violation is imminent or underway, responding agencies have only  limited time in which to decide what actions to take. Nonetheless, the  agencies need sufficient time to try to determine the pilot\u2019s intent and, if  necessary, to order, scramble, and launch DOD or DHS aircraft to  intercept the violator.", "The response to a violation is managed using a process of recognition,  assessment and warning, interdiction, recovery, and follow-up; which  agency takes these actions depends on the specific nature of the violation.  FAA can report a violation of restricted airspace based on radar tracking.  If the offending aircraft deviates from its planned flight path but is not  heading directly toward the protected asset, FAA may monitor the aircraft  and try to contact the pilot but not interdict the aircraft. Conversely, if  NORAD or FAA perceives the aircraft to be a threat based on its speed,  direction, or other information, NORAD can alert its aircraft and attempt  to intercept the violator. If successfully diverted away from the protected  asset or restricted airspace, Secret Service, FAA, TSA, or local law  enforcement officers may meet the aircraft and interview the pilot upon  landing, to identify any hostile intent. On the other hand, if the offending  pilot does not divert and proceeds to operate in a manner perceived as  threatening, the NORAD pilot can be ordered by the appropriate  authorities to engage the violating aircraft.

Airspace restrictions can move, such as when the President  travels. Notices on the location of newly restricted airspace may be issued  quickly, and pilots may already be in their aircraft or in the air when the  restriction is announced and implemented. Moreover, pilots may fly  around bad weather or may experience equipment problems and  consequently enter restricted airspace to maintain safe operations.", "To reduce violations, FAA has conducted safety seminars, provided a toll- free number for pilots to call and check for restricted airspace, identified  the location of restricted airspace on its Web site, and encouraged pilots to  check for and be attentive to notices on restricted airspace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Actions to Temporarily Suspend or Permanently Revoke Pilot Certificates", "paragraphs": ["When a pilot enters restricted airspace without authorization, FAA  investigates and decides what actions to take against the pilot.

Instead, FAA will now suspend a pilot\u2019s certificate for 30 to 90  days for a single, inadvertent, first-time violation of a temporary flight  restriction area that was established with a notice. The temporary  suspension\u2019s length depends on the degree of danger to other aircraft and  persons or property on the ground, the pilot\u2019s level of experience, prior  violations record, and certain other factors.

Because the interagency  process to manage the response to restricted airspace violations is a time- critical operation, the implications of not having well-developed policies,  procedures, information sharing protocols, and common definitions are  serious.

First, DOD  nonconcurred with our recommendation that the three secretaries work  together to identify an organization that would be responsible for  addressing interagency coordination issues. As did DHS, DOD pointed out  that the Interagency Airspace Protection Working Group already  addresses interagency coordination for homeland air defense.  Nonetheless, problems remain. For example, as we point out in our report,  information sharing protocols and procedures have not been established, a  concept of operations plan for airspace outside the national capital region  has not been developed, and common definitions have not been adopted.  DOD also pointed out that TSA hosts agencies at the National Capital  Region Coordination Center. While true, TSA officials told us that they  view their role as one of deconflicting rather than of leading interagency  efforts. As stated earlier, we believe that if the agencies can effectively  resolve the issues and gaps we identified in the interagency process of  responding to violations of restricted airspace without having an  organization in charge, then an organization in charge may not be needed.", "Second, DOD nonconcurred with our recommendation that the three  secretaries work together to determine the extent to which one agency  should be in charge of leading the interagency process of responding to  violations of restricted airspace as they occur. DOD stated that our report  is misleading because it implies that having someone in charge would  prevent some airspace violations. DOD also stated that DHS has managed  air security by hardening commercial aircraft cockpit doors, placing  armed Federal Air Marshals on some flights, and taking other actions.  DOD also pointed out that FAA manages airspace for flight safety and  DOD defends domestic airspace. DOD stated that all of these missions  occur at all times and there is never a \u201clead change.\u201d As discussed above,  we revised and clarified our recommendation to suggest that the  secretaries of the three departments determine the extent to which one  agency should be in charge of leading the interagency process of  responding to restricted airspace violations. Our recommendation is  intended to enhance the response to violations of restricted airspace and  is not premised on the notion that its adoption would prevent the  violations from occurring. Moreover, while steps taken by DHS, FAA, and  DOD to secure aviation, ensure flight safety, and defend homeland  airspace are important contributions, they generally do not contribute to  knowing who is in charge of the response as a violation is occurring. Also,  we agree with DOD that there is never a \u201clead change,\u201d because the  interagency process lacks central leadership. Finally, we did not  recommend that a specific agency or individual be in charge. We  recommended that the departments study the question of whether it would  be advantageous to have someone in the lead. If the departments  determined that such a change would be beneficial, they would  presumably also determine what, if any, changes in law would be needed.", "We acknowledge, however, that if the agencies can effectively resolve the  issues and gaps we identified in the interagency process of responding to  restricted airspace violations, then an organization in charge may not be  needed.", "Third, we recommended that the three secretaries determine whether  interagency policies, procedures, or other guidance is necessary to  evaluate Domestic Events Network performance and identify  improvements. DOD nonconcurred and stated that the Domestic Events  Network is not designed for decision making. We note that the network is  a telephone conferencing system that permits communication between the  agencies responding to violations of restricted airspace for the purpose of  deciding on the coordinated response. We are not aware that the agencies  have evaluated network performance to determine whether enhancements  are possible, and our recommendation was intended to promote such an  evaluation. We continue to believe that government initiatives benefit from  appropriate evaluation of performance, and consequently we stand by our  recommendation.", "Fourth, we recommended that the secretaries work together to develop a  concept of operations plan for management of violations in all U.S.  airspace. DOD nonconcurred on the basis that the agencies do not manage  violations but respond to them. Nonetheless, DOD agreed that an overall  air strategy and identification of roles and missions for each agency should  be considered. We agree that an overall strategy for securing U.S. air space  would be beneficial, and we believe that if such a strategy is developed, a  concept of operations plan or other relevant document would follow. As a  result of DOD\u2019s comment, we have revised our recommendation to one of  developing a concept of operations plan or other relevant document to  guide the interagency response to violations of restricted airspace.", "Finally, DOD concurred with our recommendations that the secretaries  work together to establish information sharing protocols and procedures  and establish common definitions.", "We had also recommended that the Secretaries of Defense and  Transportation work together to determine the extent to which key  elements of the FAA\u2019s pilot deviation database could be shared with  NORAD, and DOD nonconcurred. In its comments, DOD stated that it does  not require access to private citizen data contained in the FAA database.  We agree that DOD does not require such information. However, we  recommended that DOD meet with the Department of Transportation to  determine whether any elements would be useful, and if so, to pursue a  means to obtain them. Consequently, we stand by our recommendation.", "Department of Transportation officials told us that they agreed with our  recommendations and indicated that a national air security policy should  be established to outline major goals and responsibilities for each of the  agencies with responsibilities for the protection of U.S. airspace.  Department officials also stated that without a national policy, the  agencies would continue to work without unified, common goals.  Transportation officials suggested that a policy coordinating committee be  established for air security to address interagency issues. They also agreed  that information sharing is critical to enhance air security and told us that  they had begun sharing pilot deviations data with the FAA Strategic  Operations Security Manager as we had recommended. We agree with the  Department\u2019s overall comments and believe that this is the type of  dialogue that should take place between the Departments of Homeland  Security, Defense, and Transportation.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. Thank you again for the  opportunity to discuss these issues. At this time, I would be happy to  address any questions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In conducting our review of the response to violations of restricted  airspace, we visited key offices within DOD, DHS, and FAA that have  responsibility for oversight and management of U.S. airspace. We  conducted our review in the Washington, D.C., area, at DOD, including the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense), Defense  Intelligence Agency, and Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense Office;  DHS, including the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  United States Secret Service, and the Transportation Security  Administration, including the National Capital Region Coordination  Center; FAA Headquarters, Domestic Events Network, Air Traffic Control  System Command Center, and the Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar  Approach Control facility. We also met with the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National  Counterterrorism Center, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. We did  not review ground-based air defense batteries that are also part of the  homeland air defense system.", "We conducted fieldwork at U.S. Northern Command and NORAD,  Colorado Springs, Colorado, as well as NORAD\u2019s Northeast Air Defense  Sector, Rome, New York; Western Air Defense Sector, Tacoma,  Washington; and the Continental U.S. NORAD Region and Southeast Air  Defense Sector near Panama City, Florida. In addition, we visited the Air  Force\u2019s Air Combat Command, Langley, Virginia, and 84th Radar  Evaluation Squadron, Ogden, Utah; Immigration and Customs  Enforcement\u2019s Air and Marine Operations Center, Riverside, California;  and FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Control Center, Fort Worth, Texas.", "To determine the extent to which violations of restricted airspace have  occurred since September 11, 2001, we met with NORAD and FAA officials  to obtain relevant data from their incursion and pilot deviation databases,  respectively, and discussed their methods for determining what  constitutes an incursion/pilot deviation. After determining that NORAD\u2019s  database was not adequate to accurately identify the number of violations  of restricted airspace, we obtained relevant portions of FAA\u2019s pilot  deviation database and performed the analysis necessary to develop the  data provided in the report. We reviewed the reliability of the FAA  database to determine the numbers of incursions. We (1) performed  electronic testing of the data elements needed for our analysis and looked  for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewed related  documentation, and (3) interviewed officials knowledgeable about the  data. We noted several limitations in the data, including missing values for  key data elements and the fact that events might be both over- and under- reported due to varying definitions of pilot deviations. We were able to  partially correct for these problems and consequently determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable to illustrate analyses for tracking violations  of restricted airspace. However, because we could not fully correct for  data errors, the data presented should be considered estimates rather than  precise numbers.", "To identify the actions taken individually or in coordinated fashion to  secure U.S. airspace and aviation and to mitigate the threat since  September 11, 2001, we interviewed officials at the National Capital  Region Coordination Center; the headquarters of NORAD and its  Continental U.S. NORAD Region and the three continental U.S. based air  defense sectors, TSA, FAA, and Air Combat Command; and the Air and  Marine Operations Center. We discussed and reviewed changes in  operational responsibilities and plans of these organizations both pre- and  post- September 11, 2001. To better understand these actions, we toured  and observed the workings of the National Capital Region Coordination  Center, the air defense sectors, the Domestic Events Network, and the Air  and Marine Operations Center. While at some of these centers, we  observed the agencies\u2019 responses to actual violations of restricted  airspace, the interaction of the agencies involved in responding, and the  steps taken by the various agencies involved to address the violation. We  discussed with agency officials the procedures for responding to  incursions into restricted airspace and reviewed pertinent documentation  relating to those procedures where they existed.", "In examining interagency policies and procedures that govern the  management of airspace violations, we first reviewed existing GAO work  that found that the success of interagency efforts depends on melding  multi-organizational efforts through central leadership, an overarching  strategy, effective partnerships, and common definitions. We then  compared the extent to which agencies with responsibility for preventing  or responding to violations of restricted airspace have established an  organization in charge, interagency policies and procedures, protocols for  the sharing of database records documenting violations of restricted  airspace, and common definitions of restricted airspace.", "We conducted our review from June 2004 through April 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Brian J.
