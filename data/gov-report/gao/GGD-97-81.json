The act\u2019s \u201cbilingual voting assistance requirements\u201d apply to ethnic groups in 422 \u201ccovered jurisdictions\u201d\u2014most of which are counties\u2014in 28 states. Critics of the bilingual provisions have charged that the implementation of these requirements has been costly and has been of questionable benefit in increasing voter turnout of the targeted ethnic groups.", "This report responds to your request that we review two aspects of the implementation of bilingual language provisions of the act. You asked that we determine (1) the types of assistance jurisdictions provided for the 1996 general election; and (2) the actual cost that covered jurisdictions incurred to provide bilingual voting assistance in 1996, and in prior years, if available.", "To determine the types of assistance jurisdictions provided and the related costs, we surveyed election officials representing each covered jurisdiction and each state that had covered jurisdictions. In all, we solicited responses from election officials in 28 states and 391 covered jurisdictions. See appendix I for a detailed discussion of our objectives, scope, and methodology. In total, 26 states and 292 covered jurisdictions responded to our questionnaires, a response rate of 93 percent and 75 percent, respectively. (See app. II).", "The information contained in this report is limited to the data provided by the states and jurisdictions that responded to our survey. To the extent practical, we attempted to verify the completeness and accuracy of the responses. Where a response to a question was inconsistent with other answers elsewhere in the survey or where a respondent failed to answer a question, we contacted them to clarify or determine the response. On cost questions, we requested that respondents only provide actual costs for which they had supporting documentation, not cost estimates. In a number of cases jurisdictions provided us documentation supporting their costs; additional details are provided in appendix I (see page 34). Because the jurisdictions that reported costs were geographically dispersed, it was not practical to further verify the costs reported.", "For both objectives, the survey was affected by variables which limit the responses\u2019 generalizability. For example, the covered jurisdictions varied in (1) the number of polling locations where bilingual voting assistance was provided, (2) the size of the populations in need of assistance, and (3) the number of minority groups for whom assistance was required. Accordingly, comparisons across jurisdictions are not meaningful and the responses of states and covered jurisdictions cannot be projected or generalized to nonresponding jurisdictions.", "On April 9, 1997, we requested comments from the Attorney General or her designee on a draft of this report. On April 18, 1997, the Chief of the Voting Section, Civil Rights Division, on behalf of the Attorney General, provided technical information, which we incorporated where appropriate. We did our work in Washington, D.C., from July 1996 through April 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1975, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act and extended its coverage to protect the voting rights of citizens of certain ethnic groups whose language is other than English. The act\u2019s language minority provisions require states and covered jurisdictions\u2014political subdivisions\u2014that meet the act\u2019s coverage criteria to conduct elections in the language of certain \u201cminority language groups\u201d in addition to English. The act defined these language minorities as persons of Spanish heritage, American Indians, Asian Americans, and Alaskan Natives.", "Where the applicable minority groups have a commonly used written language, the act requires covered jurisdictions to provide written election materials in the languages of the groups. For American Indians and Alaskan Natives whose languages are unwritten, only oral assistance and publicity, e.g., public information spots on the radio, are required. All covered jurisdictions must provide oral assistance when needed in the minority language. Both written and oral assistance must be available throughout the election process from registration to election day activities and are required for all federal, state, and local elections.", "According to the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Voting Section, the objective of the act\u2019s bilingual assistance provisions, in the Attorney General\u2019s view, is to enable members of applicable language minority groups to participate effectively in the electoral process. Further, according to the Section, jurisdictions should take all reasonable steps to achieve the goal, but they are not required to provide bilingual assistance that would not further that goal. A jurisdiction need not, for example, provide bilingual assistance to all of its eligible voters if it effectively targets its bilingual program to those in actual need of bilingual assistance.", "The implementation of the act by states and jurisdictions could vary depending on the extent that the states provide assistance. For example, where states provide ballot translations for national and state issues and offices, the covered jurisdictions only have to translate the portions of ballot issues and offices that pertain to them. Where states provide no assistance, the responsibility for assistance falls entirely to the jurisdictions.", "The act, as amended, contains two sections\u20144(f)(4) and 203(c)\u2014which provide specific criteria for determining which states and jurisdictions are to be covered by the bilingual voting provisions. The act designates the Attorney General or the Director of the Census to make these determinations (see app. III). In total, 422 jurisdictions in 28 states were covered during 1996. These included three states\u2014Alaska (Alaskan Natives), Arizona (Spanish heritage), and Texas (Spanish heritage)\u2014which were covered statewide (i.e., the act\u2019s provisions apply to all political subdivisions within the state).

Moreover, five jurisdictions that reported providing assistance also reported providing assistance to other language minority groups that the act did not require them to assist.", "For 14 jurisdictions that reported providing oral assistance only, the act required 12 to provide assistance to American Indian groups. In addition, some jurisdictions that reported providing written and oral assistance actually provided assistance to more than one covered ethnic group, and depending on the group assisted, the type of assistance they provided may have varied. For example, Gila, AZ, reported providing written and oral assistance to Hispanics but only oral assistance to Apache Indians whose language is not written to the extent needed for election translation.", "Twenty-six of the 28 states surveyed responded.

Most of the jurisdictions that indicated they had not provided bilingual voting assistance had relatively few members of the applicable language group, and the Attorney General\u2019s minority language guidelines explain that the objective of the bilingual provisions is \u201cto enable members of applicable language minority groups to participate effectively in the electoral process.\u201d Accordingly, the Section said further inquiry would be needed to determine whether such a jurisdiction has violated the bilingual requirements of the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Jurisdictions and States Reported Providing Assistance to Groups That Were Not Required to Be Covered", "paragraphs": ["Five jurisdictions and two states reported that in addition to providing assistance to minority language groups, as required under the act, they also furnished assistance to other groups.
