Thus, it is uncertain whether FDA will meet the MDUFMA performance goals for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005. For fiscal years 2003 and 2004, there were two performance goals in effect for each year. As of March 31, 2004, only one application was subject to the action tied to one of the two MDUFMA performance goals. On this application, FDA completed its review and made the decision to approve the application within the goal's established time frame. To determine the likelihood of meeting the 20 MDUFMA performance goals for fiscal year 2005, FDA is collecting data on its performance against these goals. GAO found that FDA had performance data for some, but not all, of the MDUFMA performance goals. From fiscal year 2003 applications, data were available to compare FDA's performance against 17 of the 20 fiscal year 2005 performance goals. FDA took actions tied to 14 of the 17 goals within the goals' established time frames. From fiscal year 2004 applications, data were available to compare FDA's performance against 11 of the 20 performance goals. FDA took actions tied to the 11 goals within the goals' established time frames. The results of FDA's performance against MDUFMA performance goals are preliminary, however, because 8 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of the applications FDA accepted in fiscal year 2003 and the first 6 months of fiscal year 2004 were awaiting action by FDA or responses from manufacturers. Because FDA's performance against the MDUFMA performance goals is based on the percentages of actions the agency takes within required review times, FDA's results could change as the agency completes its actions on all applications for which the goals apply. FDA obligated about $128 million for postmarket medical device compliance activities and inspections in fiscal year 2002. FDA obligated about $109 million for compliance activities for outreach coordination, such as guidance to field staff on reporting problems with medical devices, laboratory analyses, and research, such as the development of domestic and international standards to provide reasonable assurance that medical device products are safe and effective. FDA obligated about $19 million for inspections of device manufacturers' establishments, including routine surveillance inspections to determine compliance with medical device regulations and inspections resulting from device problem reporting or product recalls."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating  medical devices\u2014such as tongue depressors, pacemakers, and artificial  hearts\u2014to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness  for human use. As part of its regulatory responsibilities, FDA reviews  applications from manufacturers that wish to have their new medical  devices or devices substantially equivalent to those already on the market  approved for marketing in the United States.  When required, FDA inspects  manufacturers\u2019 establishments prior to approval.

Members of the Congress, representatives of the medical device industry,  and others have expressed concern about the length of time it takes FDA to  review applications for marketing medical devices, with the consequence  of possibly delaying patients\u2019 access to useful, and possibly life-saving,  medical devices.", "In October 2002, the Congress passed the Medical Device User Fee and  Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) to provide FDA with additional resources to ensure prompt approval or clearance of applications for  marketing medical devices and licensing biological products. MDUFMA  authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers that submit several  types of applications to FDA for marketing medical devices. In return,  MDUFMA requires FDA to meet performance goals tied to the review  process for medical device and biological applications. MDUFMA also  requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop the  specific goals FDA must meet. The Secretary developed performance goals  for fiscal years 2003 through 2007. These MDUFMA performance goals are  set for certain actions FDA may take during the application review process  and specify lengths of time for taking these actions. FDA\u2019s performance  against the MDUFMA performance goals is based on the percentages of  actions the agency takes on applications within required review times. To  help FDA meet the MDUFMA performance goals, the Secretary of HHS also  identified several goal-related activities for FDA to undertake, such as  hiring additional review staff.", "The number of MDUFMA performance goals that FDA must meet increases  over time. For fiscal years 2003 and 2004, FDA must meet the same two  performance goals for each year. For example, one of the performance  goals requires FDA to review a manufacturer\u2019s response to the agency\u2019s  request for additional information on applications that are approvable with  minor corrections or clarifications, and then take the next appropriate  action, such as make a decision to approve the application. To meet the  performance goal, FDA must review and make the decision within 30 days  on 90 percent of the applications received for each fiscal year. In fiscal year  2005, FDA must meet the two goals and an additional 18 performance goals  tied to medical device and biological product applications, for a total of 20.   The 20 performance goals are tied to times for reviews, decisions, or a  combination of both.", "MDUFMA requires us to report on FDA\u2019s performance as measured against  the fiscal years 2003 and 2004 MDUFMA performance goals and determine  whether the agency is likely to meet the fiscal year 2005 MDUFMA  performance goals. MDUFMA also requires us to report on the amounts  FDA obligated in fiscal year 2002 for medical device compliance activities  and inspections of manufacturers\u2019 device establishments after their devices  are marketed, excluding the amounts that were obligated for inspections  related to the review of medical device applications.", "To examine FDA\u2019s performance, we analyzed actions taken by FDA on  applications that it received from fiscal year 2003 through the first 6  months of fiscal year 2004 (October 1, 2003, through March 31, 2004).  At  the time of our review, performance data through March 31, 2004, were the  most current FDA data available. To assess FDA\u2019s performance against the  two MDUFMA performance goals that were established for fiscal years  2003 and 2004, we analyzed performance data for applications received in  those years. To determine the likelihood of FDA meeting its fiscal year 2005  MDUFMA performance goals, we compared performance data that FDA is  collecting on fiscal years 2003 and 2004 applications to the 20 MDUFMA  performance goals that will be effective in fiscal year 2005. We also  reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from FDA\u2019s Center  for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and Center for Biologics  Evaluation and Research (CBER) about two key FDA medical device  application review processes and the agency\u2019s performance as measured  against the MDUFMA performance goals. These two processes are referred  to as (1) the Premarket Approval (PMA) review process, which is used to  review an application for a new medical device or when the risks  associated with the device are considerable, and (2) the 510(k) review  process, which is used to review an application for a type of device that  may be substantially equivalent to one already on the market. In addition,  we reviewed documentation of FDA\u2019s procedures for checking the  reliability of MDUFMA performance data and met with FDA officials to  discuss their efforts to verify the accuracy and consistency of their  reported performance data.

After an initial screening of an application  and determination that the review should proceed, an FDA  multidisciplinary staff conducts a scientific review of the application and  determines whether it is complete, that is, if it contains sufficient  information to allow the review to continue. (See fig. 1.)", "For complete applications, FDA may make one of five decisions. FDA may  (1) issue an order approving the application, which allows the  manufacturer to begin marketing the device; (2) send the manufacturer an  approvable letter pending a GMP inspection, which indicates that FDA  should be able to approve the device after the agency finds that the  manufacturer\u2019s device establishment is in compliance with GMP  requirements; (3) send the manufacturer an approvable letter indicating  that the agency should be able to approve the device if the manufacturer  can make minor corrections or clarifications to the application; (4) issue a  \u201cnot approvable\u201d letter informing the manufacturer that FDA does not  believe that the application can be approved because the data provided by  the manufacturer do not demonstrate that the device is reasonably safe and  effective; or (5) issue an order denying approval of the application, which  informs the manufacturer that the agency has completed its scientific  review, identified major safety and effectiveness problems, and decided not  to approve the application. FDA may refer complete applications to an  external advisory committee for evaluation when a device is the first of its  kind or when the agency believes it would be useful to have independent  expertise and technical assistance to properly evaluate the safety and  effectiveness of the device.
