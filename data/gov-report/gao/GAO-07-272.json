GAO analyzed (1) current challenges in identifying and enrolling new dual-eligible beneficiaries in PDPs, (2) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) efforts to address challenges, and (3) federal and state approaches to assigning dual-eligible beneficiaries to PDPs.

GAO also made site visits to six states to learn about the enrollment of dual-eligible beneficiaries from the state perspective."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS's enrollment procedures and implementation of its Part D coverage policy generate challenges for some dual-eligible beneficiaries, pharmacies, and the Medicare program. A majority of new dual-eligible beneficiaries--generally those on Medicare who have not yet signed up for a PDP and who become eligible for Medicaid--may be unable to smoothly access their drug benefit for at least 5 weeks given the time it takes to enroll them in PDPs and communicate information to beneficiaries and pharmacies. Pharmacies also may be affected adversely when key information about a beneficiary's dual eligibility is not yet processed and available. When dispensing drugs during this interval, pharmacies may have difficulty submitting claims to PDPs and accurately charging copayments. In addition, Medicare pays PDPs to provide these beneficiaries with several months of retroactive coverage but, until March 2007, CMS did not inform beneficiaries of their right to be reimbursed for drug costs incurred during these periods. CMS does not monitor its payments to PDPs for retroactive coverage or the amounts PDPs have reimbursed dual-eligible beneficiaries. Medicare paid PDPs millions of dollars in 2006 for coverage during periods for which dual-eligible beneficiaries may not have sought reimbursement for their drug costs. CMS has taken steps to address challenges associated with enrolling dual-eligible beneficiaries in PDPs. CMS has implemented a policy to prevent a gap in prescription drug coverage for those new dual-eligible beneficiaries whose Part D eligibility is predictable--Medicaid beneficiaries who subsequently qualify for Medicare. We estimate this group represents about one-third of new dual-eligible beneficiaries. In August 2006, CMS began operating a prospective enrollment process that should allow the agency and its Part D partners time to complete the enrollment processes and notify these beneficiaries before their effective enrollment date. Also, CMS is making changes to improve the efficiency of key information systems involved in the enrollment process. While the agency is performing some information systems testing, it is not planning to perform testing of the interactions of key information systems collectively, which is crucial to mitigating the inherent risks of system changes. Under federal law, CMS is required to assign dual-eligible beneficiaries to PDPs based on PDP premiums and geographic area. State Medicaid agency officials and others assert that this assignment method often places dual-eligible beneficiaries in PDPs that do not meet their drug needs. With CMS approval, Maine officials considered beneficiary-specific data to reassign nearly half of their dual-eligible beneficiaries to PDPs that better met their drug needs in late 2005. After the reassignment, the number of these dual-eligible beneficiaries whose PDP covered nearly all of their prescription drugs increased significantly. States choosing to make such reassignments in the future would need ready access to key information from PDPs. CMS contends that reassignments are not needed because beneficiaries may switch to drugs of equivalent therapeutic value or change plans at any time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) established a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit  for Medicare\u2014the federal health insurance program for elderly and certain  disabled individuals\u2014known as Medicare Part D. This benefit is provided  through prescription drug plans (PDP) sponsored by contracted private  companies. These private companies, termed sponsors, offer one or more  benefit packages, through individual PDPs that charge monthly premiums  that cover different drugs and have different beneficiary cost-sharing  arrangements (such as copayments and deductibles). Medicaid is a jointly  funded federal-state health care program that covers certain low-income  families and low-income individuals who are aged or disabled. Medicaid  beneficiaries receive their prescription drugs at no or low cost as part of  their Medicaid benefits. About 6 million people were eligible for both full  Medicare and Medicaid benefits in December 2005 and more become  eligible each month. For those who are dually eligible for both Medicare  and Medicaid, known as full-benefit dual-eligible beneficiaries, the MMA  required that drug coverage transition from Medicaid drug coverage to  Medicare Part D drug coverage on January 1, 2006. Dual-eligible  beneficiaries are generally poorer, are more likely to have extensive health  care needs, and use more medications than other Medicare beneficiaries.  To help dual-eligible beneficiaries and other low-income Medicare  beneficiaries with the costs of prescription drug coverage, the MMA  provided these individuals with a low-income subsidy that covers most of  their out-of-pocket costs for Part D prescription drugs.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that  administers the Medicare program\u2014has responsibility for assisting in the  transition of dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2019 drug coverage from Medicaid to  Medicare. In October and December 2005, CMS assigned each dual-eligible  beneficiary who had not already signed up for a Part D plan to a PDP and  notified these beneficiaries of their assignment. Part D prescription drug  coverage for these beneficiaries was effective January 1, 2006. CMS also  provided state pharmaceutical assistance programs (SPAP) with the ability  to enroll or reassign their members to PDPs using additional criteria, with  prior approval from CMS.", "The agency also developed contingency measures to help with  administrative difficulties that could arise with the change in coverage. It  established an enrollment contingency option to ensure that dual-eligible  beneficiaries not yet enrolled in a PDP could get their prescriptions and  that pharmacies would be reimbursed for those prescriptions. Also, CMS  required PDPs to provide beneficiaries with a short-term supply of needed  drugs, known as a transition supply, if they were prescribed a drug that  was not on their PDP\u2019s list of covered drugs, or formulary.", "Shortly after the start of the program, the media reported that some dual- eligible beneficiaries encountered difficulties that limited their access to  needed drugs. These included reports of dual-eligible beneficiaries not  enrolled in a PDP, enrolled in more than one PDP, not correctly identified  as a low-income beneficiary, charged incorrect copayments at the  pharmacy, and unable to obtain drugs because of inadequate transition  coverage. In February 2006, the Secretary of Health and Human Services  reported that these problems potentially affected several hundred  thousand dual-eligible beneficiaries. Some of these problems were the  result of data transmission difficulties among the states, CMS, and PDP  sponsors. Responding to a February 2006 survey by The Kaiser Family  Foundation, 31 state Medicaid directors reported widespread problems  affecting a significant number of dual-eligible beneficiaries. In response to  the problems, 29 state Medicaid agencies and the District of Columbia\u2019s  Medicaid agency interceded and provided temporary coverage to ensure  dual-eligible beneficiaries had access to prescription drugs.", "Each month CMS randomly assigns and enrolls new dual-eligible  beneficiaries who are not already in a Part D plan. Of the 633,614 new  dual-eligible beneficiaries that CMS automatically enrolled in 2006, most  were Medicare beneficiaries who subsequently qualified for Medicaid,  generally due to a loss of income and resources. Others were Medicaid  beneficiaries who subsequently qualified for Medicare, typically due to age  or disability. In addition to new dual-eligible beneficiaries, some  previously assigned dual-eligible beneficiaries may be reassigned each  benefit year. In fall 2006, CMS reassigned about 193,000 dual-eligible  beneficiaries to new PDPs for the 2007 benefit year. Consequently, the  challenges of ensuring prompt and accurate Part D enrollment are  ongoing.", "Given the reported problems that occurred during the early months of the  Part D program, you raised questions about whether difficulty obtaining  prescription drugs could continue to be a problem for many newly  identified dual-eligible beneficiaries. In this report, we examine (1) current  challenges in identifying and enrolling new dual-eligible beneficiaries in  PDPs, (2) CMS\u2019s efforts to address challenges in enrolling dual-eligible  beneficiaries, (3) federal and state approaches to assigning dual-eligible  beneficiaries to PDPs, and (4) CMS\u2019s actions to ensure that PDPs  implement effective transitional drug coverage following enrollment.", "To address these issues, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations  and guidance provided by CMS to state Medicaid agencies, PDPs, and  pharmacies on their respective roles in the Medicare Part D benefit, CMS  documents on the interaction of key information systems, and the model  contract between CMS and PDP sponsors. We also interviewed CMS  officials, including those responsible for information systems, CMS  contractors responsible for maintaining key information systems, Social  Security Administration (SSA) officials, state Medicaid officials, and  representatives of pharmacy associations and long-term care provider  associations. We also interviewed representatives from five PDP  sponsors that represented about 54 percent of dual-eligible PDP  enrollment as of June 3, 2006. Each of these sponsors offered a PDP that  was eligible to receive assignments of dual-eligible beneficiaries in 2006.  To learn about alternative methods of assigning Medicare beneficiaries to  PDPs, we also interviewed representatives of SPAPs.", "We also conducted site visits in six states\u2014California, Maine, Maryland,  Michigan, New Jersey, and Texas\u2014to learn about the transition of dual- eligible beneficiaries from the perspective of state Medicaid agencies,  pharmacies, and long-term care providers. Together, these states  accounted for 28 percent of all dual-eligible beneficiaries enrolled in a PDP  in May 2006. In selecting the states, we chose states that represented a  range in the number of dual-eligible beneficiaries, the number of PDPs to  which CMS assigned dual-eligible beneficiaries, state involvement with  PDP assignment, and state size. Information from the six states cannot be  generalized to every state\u2019s experience with the Part D program because  each state Medicaid program is different. To assess the reliability of  Maine\u2019s data on the reassignment of dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014the only  state in our sample to have such information\u2014we talked with Maine  Medicaid agency officials and state contractors about how the analyses  were conducted and reviewed documentation of the methodology.

All Part D plans must  meet federal requirements with respect to the categories of drugs they   must cover and the extent of their pharmacy networks. They must offer  the standard Medicare Part D benefit, or an actuarially equivalent benefit.  Beyond these requirements however, the specific formulary and pharmacy  network of each PDP can vary.", "Under the MMA, drug coverage for all dual-eligible beneficiaries  transitioned from Medicaid to Medicare Part D, on January 1, 2006. The  MMA requires CMS to assign dual-eligible beneficiaries to a PDP if they  have not enrolled in a Part D plan on their own. CMS may only assign  dual-eligible beneficiaries to PDPs serving their area with premiums at or  below the low-income benchmark amount and must randomly assign  individuals if there is more than one eligible PDP. During October and  December 2005, CMS randomly assigned to PDPs dual-eligible  beneficiaries who had not already enrolled in a Part D plan. The agency  mailed notices to these beneficiaries informing them of their assignment  and also that they could select a different PDP if they wished. If they did  not switch from their assigned PDP by December 31, 2005, their  assignment took effect, with coverage beginning January 1, 2006. CMS  enrolled 5,498,604 dual-eligible beneficiaries during this first round of  assignments and continues to assign new dual-eligible beneficiaries into  PDPs on a monthly basis, when these beneficiaries do not independently  enroll in a Part D plan.", "For some dual-eligible beneficiaries, some drugs that were previously  covered under Medicaid might not be covered by their Medicare PDP\u2019s  formulary. Subject to certain parameters, PDPs have the flexibility to set  their own formularies and, as a result, PDPs vary in their inclusion of the  drugs most commonly used by dual-eligible beneficiaries. According to a  2006 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of  Inspector General (OIG), one-fifth of dual-eligible beneficiaries were  assigned to PDPs that provide coverage of all of the most commonly used  drugs and one-third were assigned to PDPs that provide coverage of less  than 85 percent of these drugs. However, dual-eligible beneficiaries are  allowed to switch to a different PDP at any time with coverage under a  new PDP effective the following month.", "In addition, to help ensure a smooth transition to Part D, CMS requires  PDP sponsors to provide for a transition process for new enrollees whose  current medications may not be included in their PDP\u2019s formulary. For  2006, CMS recommended that PDP sponsors should fill a one-time  transition supply of nonformulary drugs in order to accommodate the  immediate need of the beneficiary. In particular, CMS suggested that PDPs  provide at least a 30-day transition supply to all beneficiaries and a 90- to  180-day transition supply for residents in long-term care facilities.", "Dual-Eligible Beneficiaries  Dual-eligible beneficiaries are a particularly vulnerable population.", "Totaling roughly 6.2 million in January 2006, they account for about   15 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries and 15 percent of all Medicare  beneficiaries. In general, these individuals are poorer, tend to have far  more extensive health care needs, have higher rates of cognitive  impairments, and are more likely to be disabled than other Medicare  beneficiaries. A majority of dual-eligible beneficiaries live in the  community and typically obtain drugs through retail pharmacies. Nearly  one in four dual-eligible beneficiaries reside in a long-term care facility and  obtain their drugs through pharmacies that specifically serve long-term  care facilities.", "While most Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a PDP pay monthly  premiums, deductibles, and other cost-sharing as part of their benefit  package, the Medicare Part D program pays a substantial proportion of  dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2019 cost-sharing obligations through its low-income  subsidy program. For dual-eligible beneficiaries, Medicare pays the full  amount of the monthly premium that nonsubsidy eligible beneficiaries  normally pay, up to the level of the low-income benchmark premium.  Medicare Part D also covers most or all of the prescription copayments:  dual-eligible beneficiaries pay from $1 to $5.35 copayments per  prescription filled in 2007, with the exception of those in long-term care  facilities who have no copayments. In addition, dual-eligible beneficiaries  are not subject to a deductible or the so-called \u201cdonut hole.\u201d", "In addition to dual-eligible beneficiaries, the Part D low-income subsidy is  available to other low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Some of these other  Medicare beneficiaries must apply for the subsidy through the SSA or a  state Medicaid agency. The subsidy is available on a sliding scale,  according to income and resources. Dual-eligible beneficiaries are  automatically entitled to the full subsidy amount and do not need to apply  independently for the subsidy.", "An individual can become a dual-eligible beneficiary in two main ways.  First, Medicare beneficiaries can subsequently qualify for Medicaid. This  occurs when their income and resources decline below certain thresholds,  and they enroll in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, or  they incur medical costs that reduce their income below certain  thresholds. CMS data indicate that roughly two-thirds of the 633,614 dual- eligible beneficiaries the agency enrolled in 2006 were Medicare  beneficiaries who subsequently qualified for Medicaid, and had not already  signed up for a PDP on their own. According to CMS officials, it is not  possible to predict the timing of dual-eligibility for these individuals  because determining Medicaid eligibility is a state function.", "Second, Medicaid beneficiaries can subsequently become eligible for  Medicare by either turning 65-years-old or by completing their 24-month  disability waiting period. This group represents approximately one-third  of the new dual-eligible beneficiaries enrolled by CMS in PDPs. State  Medicaid agencies can generally predict when this group of individuals  will become dually eligible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems and Steps Involved in the Identification and Enrollment of Dual- Eligible Beneficiaries", "paragraphs": ["Multiple parties and multiple information systems are involved in the  process of identifying and enrolling dual-eligible beneficiaries in PDPs. In  addition to CMS, the SSA, state Medicaid agencies, and PDP sponsors play  key roles in providing information needed to ensure that beneficiaries are  identified accurately and enrolled. SSA maintains information on Medicare  eligibility that is used by CMS and some states. State Medicaid agencies  are responsible for forwarding to CMS lists of beneficiaries who the state  believes to be eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. PDP sponsors  maintain information systems that are responsible for exchanging  enrollment and billing information with CMS.", "For the most part, CMS adapted existing information systems used in the  administration of other parts of the Medicare program to perform specific  functions required under Part D. In addition, CMS worked with the  pharmacy industry to develop a tool specifically to aid pharmacies in  obtaining billing information needed to process claims for dual-eligible  beneficiaries without enrollment information. The principal systems  supporting the Part D program are as follows:    The Medicare eligibility database. This system serves as a repository for  Medicare beneficiary entitlement, eligibility, and demographic data. In the  enrollment process for dual-eligible beneficiaries, the database is used by  CMS to provide up-to-date information to verify the status of dual-eligible  beneficiaries, as well as to determine subsidy status and make  assignments to PDPs. It also provides data to other CMS systems, SSA,  state Medicaid agencies, PDPs, and pharmacies.", "The enrollment transaction system. This system is used to enroll  beneficiaries in PDPs. In addition, it informs PDPs about a beneficiary\u2019s  subsidy status and copayment information, calculates Medicare payments  to PDPs for each covered enrollee, and processes changes in PDP  enrollment, including those elected by the beneficiary.", "The eligibility query. This tool is used by pharmacies to obtain Part D  billing information from the Medicare eligibility database. When filling a  prescription for a beneficiary who does not have proof of Part D  enrollment or eligibility, a pharmacy submits a request for billing  information using the eligibility query. In response, the pharmacy receives  information on the beneficiary\u2019s PDP enrollment, including the data  necessary to bill the beneficiary\u2019s PDP for the drugs dispensed.", "The process of enrolling dual-eligible beneficiaries requires several steps;  it begins when the state Medicaid agency identifies new dual-eligible  beneficiaries and ends when PDPs make billing information available to  pharmacies. (For more detailed information on the steps involved in  identifying and enrolling dual-eligible beneficiaries, see app. I.) The key  information systems (see fig. 1) and steps in identifying and enrolling dual- eligible beneficiaries are the following.  1.  State Medicaid agencies obtain Medicare eligibility information from  SSA or request data from CMS\u2019s Medicare eligibility database and  match that information against their own Medicaid eligibility files. The  state Medicaid agencies compile comprehensive files identifying all  dual-eligible beneficiaries, known as the dual-eligible files. CMS  receives Medicare eligibility information from SSA daily.  2.  State Medicaid agencies send CMS the dual-eligible files and CMS  matches the files against data in its Medicare eligibility database to  verify each individual\u2019s dual eligibility. The agency sends a response  file back to each state that includes the results of the matching process  for each submitted individual.  3.  Those dual-eligible beneficiaries who were matched are considered  eligible for the full low-income subsidy and the Medicare eligibility  database sets the copayment information accordingly. This process is  referred to as deeming. The Medicare eligibility database also assigns  beneficiaries not already enrolled in a Part D plan to PDPs that operate  in regions that match the beneficiary\u2019s official SSA address of record.  Both the deeming and assignment information are sent to the  enrollment transaction system to be processed.  4.  The enrollment transaction system processes the deeming and  assignment information in order to complete the enrollment and  notifies the PDPs of those dual-eligible beneficiaries who have been  enrolled in their PDP and their copayment amounts.  5.  PDPs process the resulting enrollment, assign the standard billing  information, and send this information to the Medicare eligibility  database. In addition, the PDPs mail out ID cards and PDP information  to the enrolled beneficiary.  6.  The Medicare eligibility database transmits the PDP\u2019s billing  information to the eligibility query system.  7.  Using the eligibility query, pharmacies can access the billing  information needed to fill prescriptions and bill them to the assigned  PDP if beneficiaries lack their enrollment information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Part D Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["Under tight time frames, CMS and its partners integrated information  systems to support the Part D program. To support the Part D program,  CMS pieced together existing information systems that had related  Medicare functions. In addition, information systems belonging to state  Medicaid agencies and PDPs had to integrate with CMS information  systems and CMS did not establish formal agreements with these partners  until the time of implementation. Final regulations for the program were  not issued until January 28, 2005, and business requirements for the  program were not finalized until March 2005. Thus, there was little time for  testing given that requirements and agreements were so late in being  solidified.", "A number of information systems problems surfaced in the early months  of the program. These problems included logic errors in the enrollment  process which generated cancellations to PDPs instead of enrollments, the  eligibility query being overwhelmed by the number of pharmacy inquiries,  and CMS difficulties matching data submitted by the state Medicaid  agencies to information in the Medicare eligibility database. These  problems can be attributed, in part, to poor systems testing. Because of  tight time frames associated with implementing Part D, robust system- level and end-to-end testing did not occur.", "In January 2006, CMS contracted with EDS, an information technology  consulting company, to identify opportunities for improvement in the  information systems and services for Medicare Part D. EDS\u2019s report  findings and observations addressed many overarching challenges in the  information systems infrastructure supporting the program, including the  observation that the aggressive time frame for implementation did not  allow sufficient time for end-to-end testing.

Because the interval between  notification of Medicaid eligibility and completion of the Part D enrollment  process can extend at least 5 weeks, some dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014 those previously on Medicare who subsequently become eligible for  Medicaid\u2014may be unable to smoothly access their Part D benefits during  this interval. At the same time, pharmacies that are unable to obtain up-to- date information about a dual-eligible beneficiary\u2019s enrollment are likely to  experience difficulties billing PDPs. In addition, CMS has tied dual-eligible  beneficiaries\u2019 effective date of Part D eligibility to the date of Medicaid  eligibility, providing for several months of retroactive Medicare benefits.  Although the Medicare program pays PDP sponsors for the period of  retroactive coverage, beneficiaries were not informed of their right to  reimbursement for drug costs incurred during this period. GAO found that  Medicare paid PDPs an estimated $100 million in 2006 for coverage during  periods for which dual-eligible beneficiaries may not have sought  reimbursement for their drug costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Enrollment Processes Can Create Difficulties for Some Dual- Eligible Beneficiaries", "paragraphs": ["The timing of steps to enroll dual-eligible beneficiaries in Part D and to  make billing information available to pharmacies generates a gap between  the date beneficiaries are notified of their dual eligibility status and the  date they receive their enrollment information. As a result, some new dual- eligible beneficiaries may have difficulty obtaining their drugs at the  pharmacy counter or may pay higher than required out-of-pocket costs.  Among Medicare beneficiaries who subsequently become eligible for  Medicaid, Medicare-only beneficiaries not previously enrolled in a PDP are  likely to experience more difficulties compared with those who had  enrolled in a PDP prior to becoming eligible for Medicaid. Because the  information systems used are not real-time processing systems, the  enrollment process takes place over a period of about 2 months.", "Given the time involved in processing beneficiary data under current  procedures, pharmacies may not have up-to-date PDP enrollment  information on new dual-eligible individuals. This may result in  beneficiaries having difficulty obtaining medications at the pharmacy. To  illustrate why this occurs, we present the hypothetical example of Mr.  Smith, who, as a Medicare beneficiary did not sign up for the Part D drug  benefit and, therefore, upon becoming Medicaid-eligible, must be enrolled  in a PDP. (Fig. 2 shows the steps in Mr. Smith\u2019s enrollment process.)", "From the time Mr. Smith applies for his state\u2019s Medicaid program on  August 11, it takes about 1 month for him to receive notification from the  state that he is eligible for Medicaid. It takes until October 15 before the  PDP notifies Mr. Smith of his enrollment and until October 16 before all  the necessary information is available to his pharmacy. If Mr. Smith had  sought to obtain prescription drugs prior to October 16, the pharmacy  would have had difficulty getting the PDP billing information needed to  process claims on his behalf.", "The reason this gap occurs is that some of the enrollment and PDP  assignment processing steps are done at scheduled intervals, such as once  a month or once a week. According to CMS, because of the challenges  some state Medicaid agencies have in compiling the dual-eligible file, CMS  requires the file be submitted just once a month. CMS waits until it  receives the monthly dual-eligible files from all state Medicaid agencies  before determining each individual beneficiary\u2019s subsidy level and making  the PDP assignment for these beneficiaries. State Medicaid agencies that  submit their dual-eligible file to CMS early in the monthly cycle do not  have their beneficiaries\u2019 subsidy levels determined or the assignments to a  PDP made any sooner than the last state to submit its file. Deeming and  PDP assignment can take up to 10 days. Similarly, CMS\u2019s system of  notifying the PDP of a beneficiary assignment is on a weekly cycle,  beginning on Saturday. Thus, regardless of what day in the week CMS\u2019s  enrollment transaction system receives a beneficiary\u2019s PDP assignment  and processes that enrollment, the information is not communicated to the  PDP until the following Saturday. It takes up to another week before the  beneficiary receives a membership card or other membership  documentation from the PDP or the pharmacy has computerized access to  the Part D information needed to properly process a claim if an eligibility  query is used to obtain billing information. Thus, the time elapsed from the  date the state notified Mr. Smith of his eligibility for Medicaid to the date  Mr. Smith was notified by his assigned PDP of his Part D enrollment was  at least 35 days.", "Other new dual-eligible beneficiaries may incur out-of-pocket costs at the  pharmacy that are too high for their dually eligible status because of the  time it takes information on the beneficiary\u2019s new status to reach their  PDP. To illustrate this case, we present the hypothetical example of   Mrs. Jones, a Medicare beneficiary who becomes eligible for Medicaid but  had already enrolled in a PDP. (See fig. 3.) When Mrs. Jones, who also  applied for Medicaid on August 11, goes to the pharmacy on September 12,  the pharmacy charges Mrs. Jones the same copayments that she was  charged as a Medicare-only Part D beneficiary instead of the reduced  amount for dual-eligible beneficiaries. This occurs because the PDP, and  consequently the pharmacy, does not have up-to-date information on Mrs.  Jones\u2019s status as a dual-eligible beneficiary; this information must go  through processing steps similar to those for Mr. Smith. That is, the state  Medicaid agency must first submit Mrs. Jones\u2019s name to CMS on its dual- eligible file, which is done monthly. Subsequently, CMS must determine  Mrs. Jones\u2019s level of subsidy according to the agency\u2019s schedule for the  deeming process. Mrs. Jones\u2019s PDP will change her copayment  information only after it receives CMS\u2019s weekly notification of enrollment  transactions on October 7.", "Any dual-eligible beneficiary who has a change in subsidy status, such as  dual-eligible beneficiaries who enter a nursing home, may temporarily face  higher than required out-of-pocket costs for drugs due to processing  delays. Residents of nursing homes who are dual-eligible beneficiaries are  not required to pay any copayments, but they could be charged until the  PDP updates its own data based on information provided by CMS.  Recognizing the time lags that pharmacies encounter in receiving  complete Part D information on dual-eligible beneficiaries, CMS issued a  memorandum in May 2006 requiring PDP sponsors to use the best  available data to adjust a beneficiary\u2019s copayment, meaning that PDPs  need not wait for CMS to notify them of a status change but can make  adjustments based on notification received from a nursing facility or state  agency. However, according to some we spoke with, PDPs vary in terms of  their willingness to act on information provided by a party other than  CMS.", "The time intervals associated with the Part D enrollment process for new  dual-eligible beneficiaries can lengthen when data entry errors occur or  when a dual-eligible beneficiary is identified by the state after the state has  submitted its monthly dual-eligible file. For example, if CMS cannot match  information from its Medicare eligibility database with a beneficiary\u2019s  information listed in the state\u2019s dual-eligible file, the state must find the  source of the problem and resubmit the beneficiary\u2019s information in the  following month\u2019s dual-eligible file. State Medicaid agency officials told us  that generally mismatches occurred in 2006 because of errors in a birth  date or Social Security number. CMS reported that for the month of June  2006, about 17,000 to 18,000 names in state Medicaid agencies\u2019 dual- eligible files could not be matched against information in the Medicare  eligibility database. This number of mismatches is down from 26,000  mismatches earlier in the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tools Designed to Help Pharmacies Have Not Worked Well", "paragraphs": ["CMS has provided pharmacies with certain tools to help process a claim  when a beneficiary does not present adequate billing information or has  not been enrolled in a PDP.

The enrollment contingency option was designed to ensure that dual- eligible beneficiaries who were not yet enrolled in a PDP could get their  medications, while also providing assurance that the pharmacy would be  reimbursed for those medications. Problems with reimbursements have  led some pharmacies to stop using the enrollment contingency option.", "The eligibility query was developed by CMS to help pharmacies determine  which plan to bill when a dual-eligible beneficiary lacks proof of  enrollment, but about half of the time the query system returns a response  indicating a match was not found (see fig. 4). To obtain billing information  on individuals without a PDP membership card or other proof of Part D  enrollment, pharmacies have modified their existing computer systems to  allow them to query CMS\u2019s Medicare eligibility database. Using the Part D  eligibility query, pharmacies can enter certain data elements\u2014such as an  individual\u2019s Social Security number, Medicare ID number, name, and date  of birth\u2014to verify whether the individual is a dual-eligible beneficiary and  whether the individual has been assigned to a PDP. Ideally, when a match  occurs, the pharmacy receives an automated response within seconds  showing codes that contain the standard billing information necessary to  file a claim\u2014such as the identity of the PDP sponsor and the member ID  number. According to CMS, of all the eligibility queries pharmacies  initiated in September 2006, about 55 percent enabled them to match data  identification elements with an individual in the Medicare eligibility  database. In comments on a draft of this report, the agency explained that  pharmacies had used the eligibility query for nonenrolled individuals  whose data would not otherwise be in the system.", "In cases where the PDP has not yet submitted standard billing information  to CMS, the pharmacy must spend additional time contacting the PDP. In  cases where the dual-eligible beneficiary has been assigned to a PDP, but  the PDP has yet to submit the standard billing information, the eligibility  query response contains only a 1-800 phone number for the assigned PDP.  In these cases, pharmacies must spend additional time contacting the   1-800 number to obtain needed billing information. In April 2006, about   13 percent of the eligibility query responses that matched a beneficiary did  not contain the standard billing information.", "Pharmacy association representatives and individual pharmacists we met  with told us that improvements to the eligibility query were needed. They  said the eligibility query would be more useful if the responses pharmacies  receive contained such information as the name of the PDP in which the  beneficiary is enrolled, the effective date of the beneficiary\u2019s enrollment in  the PDP, and the beneficiary\u2019s low-income subsidy status, rather than just  a 1-800 number or the standard billing information that is now provided.  They also noted that the frequency with which the eligibility query  responds without the standard billing information is also problematic;  without adequate billing information the pharmacy has to make a  telephone call to obtain the appropriate billing information.", "In cases where the eligibility query does not produce a match but the  pharmacy has other evidence that the individual is dually eligible for  Medicare and Medicaid, such as ID cards or a letter from the state, CMS  has provided pharmacies with an enrollment contingency option. That is,  the pharmacies can submit their claims to a nationwide PDP sponsor\u2014 WellPoint\u2014which CMS has contracted with to provide pharmacies with a  source of payment for prescriptions filled for dual-eligible beneficiaries  who have yet to be enrolled in a PDP. The WellPoint enrollment  contingency option was intended for use in cases where the pharmacy can  confirm that an individual is dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid but  cannot determine the beneficiary\u2019s assigned PDP through the eligibility  query. In such cases, claims are screened for eligibility, and if the  beneficiary is indeed dually eligible, but has not yet been enrolled in a  PDP, the beneficiary gets enrolled in a PDP offered by WellPoint.", "The WellPoint enrollment contingency option has often not functioned as  intended. For example, WellPoint was billed for a number of claims where  the beneficiary was enrolled in another PDP. As of November 26, 2006,  46.0 percent of the 351,538 Medicare ID numbers with claims that were  billed to WellPoint had already been assigned to a PDP. CMS and  WellPoint officials told us WellPoint reconciles payment for these claims  directly with the beneficiary\u2019s assigned PDP. However, pharmacy  association representatives told us that, in some cases, WellPoint required  the pharmacies to refund payments for these claims to WellPoint and then  submit the claim to the appropriate PDP. In other cases, pharmacies bill  WellPoint without supplying the necessary beneficiary data elements. For  instance, rather than entering the individual\u2019s actual Medicare ID number,  the pharmacy may enter dummy information into the Medicare ID field. As  of November 26, 2006, CMS reported that, roughly 35 percent of the  Medicare ID numbers submitted to WellPoint were invalid, requiring  pharmacies to refund their outlays on claims using these numbers. In  addition, about 4 percent of the Medicare ID numbers were valid but the  individual was either not eligible for Medicaid or was not eligible for Part  D enrollment (for instance due to incarceration). WellPoint required  pharmacies to refund money for these claims as well. According to one  state pharmacy association representative, some pharmacies in the state  have discontinued using the WellPoint contingency option because of the  reimbursement difficulties. Only about 15 percent of Medicare ID numbers  with claims filed through the WellPoint option were associated with  individuals eligible for enrollment in the WellPoint PDP.", "Pharmacy association representatives noted that some pharmacies  dispense medications to individuals without proof of Part D enrollment,  hoping to get needed billing information at a later date that will allow them  to properly submit a claim. One state pharmacy association representative  noted that pharmacies serving only long-term care facilities dispense  medication without assurance of reimbursement because they are required  to do so under the contractual arrangements they have with the long-term  care facilities.", "Pharmacy association representatives told us that after-the-fact  reimbursement of drug claims is problematic.

Given the vulnerability of the dual-eligible beneficiary  population, it seems unlikely that the majority of these beneficiaries would  have contacted their PDP for reimbursement if they were not notified of  their right to do so. GAO found that Medicare paid PDPs millions of  dollars in 2006 for coverage during periods for which dual-eligible  beneficiaries may not have sought reimbursement for their drug costs.", "Retroactive coverage for dual-eligible beneficiaries stems from both CMS\u2019s  Part D policy and from Medicaid requirements. Under the MMA, once an  individual who is not enrolled in a plan qualifies as a dual-eligible  beneficiary, CMS is required to enroll the individual in a PDP. However,  the MMA does not precisely define when Part D coverage for these  beneficiaries must become effective. As initially written, when enrolling a  Medicare beneficiary without Part D coverage who became eligible for  Medicaid, CMS\u2019s policy set the effective coverage date prospectively as the  first day of the second month after CMS identified the individual as both  Medicare and Medicaid eligible. In March 2006, CMS changed this policy,  making coverage retroactive to the first day of the month of Medicaid  eligibility. In making this change, CMS cited concerns about enrollees  experiencing a gap in coverage under its prior enrollment policy. Federal  Medicaid law requires that a Medicaid beneficiary\u2019s eligibility be set  retroactively up to 3 months prior to the date of the individual\u2019s  application if the individual met the program requirements during that  time. Therefore, for this group of dual-eligible beneficiaries, Part D  coverage may extend retroactively for several months prior to the actual  date of PDP enrollment by CMS.", "The mechanics and time frames for Part D retroactive coverage can be  illustrated by the hypothetical case of Mr. Smith, a Medicare beneficiary  who was not enrolled in a PDP when he applied for Medicaid. On  September 11, Mr. Smith\u2019s state Medicaid agency made him eligible for  Medicaid benefits as of May 11, 3 months prior to his August 11 program  application, as he met Medicaid eligibility requirements during that  retroactive period. In October, CMS notified Mr. Smith of his enrollment in  a PDP and indicated that his Part D coverage was effective retroactively as  of May 1, the first day of the month in which he became eligible for  Medicaid.", "Medicare\u2019s payment to Mr. Smith\u2019s PDP, beginning with his retroactive  coverage period, consists of three major components, two of which are  fixed and a third that varies with Mr. Smith\u2019s cost-sharing obligations.", "The first component is a monthly direct subsidy payment CMS makes to  Mr. Smith\u2019s PDP toward the cost of providing the drug benefit.", "The second component is the monthly payment CMS makes to Mr. Smith\u2019s  PDP to cover his low-income benchmark premium.", "The third component covers nearly all of Mr. Smith\u2019s cost-sharing  responsibilities, such as any deductibles or copayments that he would pay  if he were not a dual-eligible beneficiary. CMS makes these cost-sharing  payments to his PDP based on the PDP\u2019s estimate of the typical monthly  cost-sharing paid by beneficiaries. CMS later reconciles Mr. Smith\u2019s cost- sharing payments with the PDP based on his actual drug utilization as  reported by the PDP to CMS.", "Under CMS\u2019s retroactive coverage policy, Mr. Smith\u2019s PDP receives all  three components of payments for the months of May, June, July, August,  and September, although Mr. Smith was not enrolled in the PDP until  October. Medicare pays Mr. Smith\u2019s PDP sponsor about $60 a month for  the direct subsidy and another monthly payment for the low-income  premium up to the low-income benchmark, which ranges from $23 to $36  depending on Mr. Smith\u2019s location. We estimate that for all dual-eligible  beneficiaries enrolled by CMS with retroactive coverage, Medicare paid  PDPs about $100 million in 2006 for these two monthly payment  components for the retroactive period. Unlike the cost-sharing  component of Medicare\u2019s payments, the two monthly payment  components are not subject to a reconciliation process tied to utilization  of the benefit. This means that if Mr. Smith\u2019s PDP did not reimburse   Mr. Smith for any prescription drugs purchased during the retroactive  coverage period, the PDP would have to refund Medicare the cost-sharing  payment, but would keep the direct subsidy payments and the low-income  premium payments.", "Medicare makes the direct subsidy and low-income premium payments for  the retroactive coverage period because CMS requires PDP sponsors to  reimburse beneficiaries for covered drug costs incurred during this period.  However, we found that CMS did not inform dual-eligible beneficiaries  about their right to seek reimbursement or instruct PDP sponsors on what  procedures to use for reimbursing beneficiaries or others that paid on the  beneficiary\u2019s behalf for drugs purchased during retroactive periods. The  model letters that CMS and PDPs used until March 2007 to notify dual- eligible beneficiaries of their PDP enrollment did not include any language  concerning reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs incurred during  retroactive coverage periods. After reviewing a draft of this report and  our recommendations, CMS modified the model letters that the agency  and PDPs use to notify dual-eligible beneficiaries about their PDP  enrollment.

Finally, Mr. Smith or someone helping  him would have to find out how and where to claim reimbursement from  his PDP.

Nevertheless, Mr. Smith\u2019s PDP  would have received monthly direct subsidy and low-income premium  payments for Mr. Smith for the retroactive coverage period.", "For 2006, CMS did not calculate aggregate payments made to PDP  sponsors for retroactive coverage. Further, the agency did not monitor  reimbursements to dual-eligible beneficiaries for drug purchases made  during the retroactive period.

As a  result of not tracking this information, CMS does not know how much of  the roughly $100 million in direct subsidy and low-income premium  payments for retroactive coverage in 2006 was used by PDPs to pay for  drug expenses claimed by dual-eligible beneficiaries for drugs purchased  during retroactive coverage periods."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Taken Actions to Address Challenges Faced by New Dual-Eligible Beneficiaries and Pharmacies", "paragraphs": ["Given the experience of early 2006, CMS has taken several actions to  improve the transition of dual-eligible beneficiaries to Part D.

State Medicaid officials we met with maintained  that overall, dual-eligible beneficiaries would have been in a better  position during the initial transition to Medicare Part D if drug utilization  information were considered in the PDP assignment process. A  representative of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors  (NASMD) asserted that while CMS\u2019s assignment process was fair to PDP  sponsors, it did not ensure that beneficiaries were enrolled in appropriate  PDPs. The representative reported that CMS referred individuals who  wanted to take their drug usage into account in selecting a PDP to the  Medicare.gov Web site, which most dual-eligible beneficiaries are not able  to use.", "Some state Medicaid agencies indicated their support for IRA in the  months prior to Part D implementation. At that time, 15 state Medicaid  agencies made commitments to a software vendor to use a free software  package designed to match beneficiaries\u2019 drug utilization history with PDP  formularies as an educational tool to help them choose the PDP best  aligned to their individual drug needs. However, litigation over use of the  IRA software led to delays, at the end of which CMS had already assigned  dual-eligible beneficiaries to PDPs. State Medicaid agencies reported that  they then did not have the time to match beneficiaries, send out  scorecards, and allow beneficiaries to switch PDPs before the January 1,  2006, implementation date.", "Executives of PDP sponsors we spoke with stated that CMS\u2019s assignment  method generally worked well; however, some executives raised concerns  about IRA methodology. Two PDP sponsors raised concerns that IRA  methods misinterpret formulary information.

In addition,  CMS asked PDP sponsors to consider contacting beneficiaries receiving  transition supplies of drugs to inform them that (1) the supply is  temporary, (2) they should contact the PDP or physician to identify a drug  substitution, and (3) they have a right to request an exception to the  formulary and the procedures for requesting such an exception.", "When many beneficiaries continued to return to the pharmacy for refills  without having successfully resolved their formulary issues, CMS issued a  memorandum on February 2, 2006, calling for an extension of the Part D  transition period to March 31, 2006.

In addition, because  of CMS\u2019s limited oversight of its retroactive coverage policy, the agency  has not been able to ensure efficient use of program funds. Until March  2007, the letters used to notify dual-eligible beneficiaries of their PDP  enrollment and their retroactive coverage did not inform them of the right  to be reimbursed and how to obtain such reimbursement. CMS monitoring  of retroactive payments to PDPs and subsequent PDP reimbursements to  beneficiaries is also lacking. We found that Medicare paid PDPs millions of  dollars \u2014we estimate about $100 million in 2006\u2014for coverage during  periods for which dual-eligible beneficiaries may not have sought  reimbursement for their drug costs.", "After spending many months stabilizing the information systems  supporting the Part D program, CMS is now making changes to improve  the efficiency of its key information systems involved in the enrollment  process. While CMS officials are aware of the risks involved in these  changes, they are not planning to perform end-to-end testing because of  the complexity of the systems infrastructure, the multiple partners  involved, and time and resource constraints.

Recognizing the desirability of providing drug coverage as  soon as beneficiaries attain dual-eligible status, we do not object to CMS\u2019s  policy of linking the Part D effective coverage date to Medicaid\u2019s  retroactive eligibility date. However, our review found that CMS had not  fully implemented this policy and, as a consequence, neither beneficiaries  nor the Medicare program are well served. Therefore, we have  recommended actions that CMS should take to better protect beneficiaries  and ensure efficient use of Medicare program funds.

To be consistent with  its retroactive coverage policy, CMS is in the process of adding language to  this effect in the notices that the agency and PDP sponsors send to dual- eligible beneficiaries enrolled in a PDP.

We maintain that the agency should actively monitor its  retroactive coverage policy by examining data that plan sponsors routinely  submit to the agency. In their drug utilization records, sponsors must  indicate the amounts paid by the plan and by the beneficiary for each  claim.

We find this position on end-to-end testing to be inconsistent with systems  development best practices. Establishing end-to-end test environments  and conducting such tests is widely recognized as essential to ensure that  systems perform as intended in an operational environment. CMS was  alerted to this issue in a March 2006 CMS contractor report that identified  the lack of comprehensive end-to-end testing as a weakness of the Part D  program. We acknowledge that, given the complexity of the program\u2019s  infrastructure and the multiple partners involved, end-to-end testing will  be difficult.

States are responsible for identifying their Medicaid enrollees who  become dual-eligible beneficiaries. They combine data obtained from  SSA or requested from CMS on individuals eligible to receive Medicare  benefits with their own information on Medicaid enrollees to compile  the dual-eligible files. CMS receives Medicare entitlement information  daily from SSA.  2.  After the 15th of the month and before midnight of the last night of the  month, states transmit their dual-eligible files to CMS. These files  contain information on all individuals identified by the states as dual- eligible beneficiaries, including those newly identified and those  previously identified. Generally within 48 hours of receipt, CMS  processes state submissions. Within the Medicare eligibility database,  edits of the state files are performed. Based on the results of the edits,  the Medicare eligibility database transmits an e-mail to each state  telling the state its file was received and the results of the edits. Files  that fail the edits must be resubmitted. Once a file passes the edits, the  Medicare eligibility database matches the file against the Medicare  eligibility database to determine if it is a valid (matched) beneficiary,  eligible for Medicare, and passes business rules for inclusion as a dual  eligible. The results of this processing for each transaction on the  states\u2019 file are added to the response files, which are sent back to the  states.  3.  After CMS has performed the matching process, the Medicare  eligibility database processes these files through two additional steps:  (a) Deeming. Deeming takes the input from the matching process and   a monthly input file from SSA on beneficiaries receiving Social  Security Supplemental Income (SSI) to determine the copayment  level for the dual-eligible beneficiaries. Deeming is performed  against these data according to the business rules.  (b) Auto-assignment. Auto-assignment takes the results of deeming   and assigns each beneficiary to a PDP within the region that  includes the beneficiary\u2019s official address. Auto-assignment takes  the total dual-eligible population and eliminates records using 18  exclusions rules resulting in the final set of beneficiaries to be  auto-assigned. Exclusions include beneficiaries who are already  enrolled in a Part D plan, currently incarcerated, and not a U.S.  resident (residing outside the States and territories). Auto- assignment uniformly assigns qualified dual-eligible beneficiaries  to designated PDPs across each region.", "The resulting deeming and assignment information is sent to CMS\u2019s  enrollment transaction system for processing. In addition, a mail tape  is prepared by CMS containing beneficiary names and addresses so  that mail can be generated that informs beneficiaries of the pending  enrollment and identifies the PDP to which they were assigned. A file  also is sent to each of the plans identifying the beneficiaries assigned  to their PDP.  4.  Upon the receipt of the deeming and assignment information from the  Medicare eligibility database, CMS\u2019s enrollment transaction system  facilitates the changes in the copayments and the enrollment of the  beneficiaries into their assigned PDP. The enrollment transaction  system informs the PDP of the enrollment and copayment transactions  via a weekly Transaction Reply Report (TRR) that summarizes all  transactions that the enrollment transaction system has performed for  the respective PDP during the prior week, beginning on Saturday.  5.  PDPs then process the resulting assignment and copayment changes,  assign standard billing information, and send the information to CMS\u2019s  Medicare eligibility database. The Medicare eligibility database  performs edits, such as matching each submitted beneficiary\u2019s  information with Part D enrollment information. For each match, the  standard billing information is added to the Medicare eligibility  database and a response is generated for the PDP, confirming that the  information was accepted. The PDPs mail out ID cards and plan  information to the enrolled beneficiary.  6.  Nightly, the eligibility query receives billing information from the  Medicare eligibility database, making the updated standard billing  information available for use in the eligibility query system.  7.  Pharmacies can use their computer systems to access billing  information needed to bill the assigned PDP for the beneficiary\u2019s  prescriptions if a beneficiary does not have their enrollment  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts And Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Rosamond Katz, Assistant  Director; Lori Achman; Diana Blumenfeld; Marisol Cruz; Hannah Fein;  Samantha Poppe; Karl Seifert; Jessica Smith; Hemi Tewarson; and Marcia  Washington made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
