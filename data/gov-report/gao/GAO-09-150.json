The roadmap documents numerous initiatives and programs that are under way and aligns these with goals and objectives. However, the roadmap lacks key information in three areas necessary for it to be a more useful tool that DOD's senior leaders can use to guide and track logistics improvement efforts toward achieving stated goals and objectives. First, the roadmap does not identify the scope of logistics problems or gaps in logistics capabilities, information that could allow the roadmap to serve as a basis for establishing priorities to improve logistics and address any gaps. Second, the roadmap lacks outcome-based performance measures that would enable DOD to assess and track progress toward meeting stated goals and objectives. Third, DOD has not clearly stated how it intends to integrate the roadmap into DOD's logistics decision-making processes or who within the department is responsible for this integration. DOD officials stated they plan to remedy some of these weaknesses in their follow-on efforts. For instance, DOD has begun to conduct gap assessments for individual objectives in the roadmap and hopes to complete these by July 2009. They stated that they recognized the need for these assessments; however, they had committed to Members of Congress to release the roadmap by the summer of 2008 and were unable to conduct the assessments prior to the release of the roadmap. A comprehensive, integrated strategy that includes these three elements is critical, in part, because of the diffuse organization of DOD logistics, which is spread across multiple DOD components with separate funding and management of logistics resources and systems. Until the roadmap provides a basis for determining priorities and identifying gaps, incorporates performance measures, and is integrated into decision-making processes, it is likely to be of limited use to senior DOD decision makers as they seek to improve supply chain management. DOD has taken initial steps to implement two technologies included in the Logistics Roadmap-IUID and passive RFID-that enable electronic identification and tracking of equipment and supplies; but has experienced difficulty fully demonstrating return on investment for these technologies to the military components that have primary responsibility for determining how and where these technologies are implemented. Although DOD has undertaken initial implementation efforts of these technologies at several locations, at present, it does not collect data on implementation costs or performance-based outcome measures that would enable the department to quantify the return on investment associated with these two technologies. Without this information, it may be difficult for DOD to gain the support needed from the military components to make significant commitments in funding and staff resources necessary to overcome challenges to widespread implementation of these technologies. As a result, full implementation of these technologies is impeded and the realization of potential benefits to asset visibility DOD expects may be delayed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have focused attention on the  Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have focused attention on the  performance of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) supply chain  performance of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) supply chain  management in support of deployed U.S. troops.

Based on interviews with  OSD officials prior to the completion of the roadmap, we previously  reported that the roadmap would include performance measures and link  objective, quantifiable, and measurable performance targets to outcomes  and logistics capabilities. However, we found that the roadmap does not  include outcome-based performance measures of the objectives, which  would allow DOD to measure progress toward meeting these stated  objectives. While many of the individual initiatives include performance  goals or implementation milestones, the objectives lack such measures.  We also found that although the objectives were categorized by DOD-wide  logistics goals, they were not linked to those goals with performance or  cost metrics. The lack of outcome-based performance measures makes it  difficult to measure progress on how the objectives are meeting the stated  goals.", "An official from the Office of Supply Chain Integration, responsible for  leading the development of the roadmap, stated that performance  measures or assessments of the objectives to measure progress were not  included in this version of the roadmap because of a tight schedule for its  completion and release.

Within this time frame, officials said they were unable to address  performance measures or assessments. They stated that future versions of  the roadmap will include these elements, and assessments to measure  progress toward achieving 3 of the 22 objectives were ongoing at the time  we conducted our audit work. In October 2008, we requested descriptions  of the assessment approach and methodology; however, the DOD official  coordinating the assessments indicated that the assessments were a work  in progress and the approach had not been finalized.", "We have emphasized the importance of performance measures as  management tools for all levels of an agency, including the program or  project level, to track an agency\u2019s progress toward achieving goals, and to  provide information on which to base organizational and management  decisions. In a previous review of the Supply Chain Management  Improvement plan, we found that many of the initiatives in the plan, as  well as the three focus areas these initiatives were to address, lacked  outcome-focused performance measures, limiting DOD\u2019s ability to fully  demonstrate the results achieved through its plan. We also found that the  plan lacked cost metrics that might show efficiencies gained through these  supply chain improvement efforts, either at the initiative level or overall.  Without outcome-focused performance measures and cost metrics, DOD is  unable to fully track progress toward meeting its goals for improving  logistics from the component to the department level, limiting the  department\u2019s ability to fully demonstrate results achieved through the  roadmap. Increasing DOD\u2019s focus on measurable outcomes will enable the  department\u2019s internal and external stakeholders, including OMB and  Congress, to track the interim and long-term success of its initiatives and  help DOD determine if it is meeting its goals of achieving more effective  and efficient supply chain management.

As  mentioned previously, the roadmap defines the logistics portfolio and in  light of the recent formalization of the joint logistics capability portfolio,  the roadmap could serve as the starting point to assist the capability  portfolio managers with their responsibilities. The capability portfolio  managers for joint logistics, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics) and the Commander, U.S. Transportation  Command, are responsible for providing recommendations or advice to  appropriate DOD decision makers and forums regarding integration,  coordination, and synchronization of capability requirements for  capability investments, and for evaluating capability demand against  resource constraints, identifying and assessing risks, and suggesting  capability trade-offs within their portfolio to the heads of the DOD  components. Given that capability portfolio management has been  recently formalized, it remains to be seen how the capability portfolio  managers will implement the process and what types of information they  will need to fulfill their responsibilities.", "A comprehensive integrated strategy to address logistics problems  department-wide is critical, in part, because of the diffuse organization of  DOD logistics. Responsibility for logistics within DOD is spread across  multiple components with separate funding and management of logistics  resources and systems. For example, the Under Secretary of Defense  (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), as part of OSD, serves as the  principal staff element of the Secretary of Defense in the exercise of policy  development, planning, resource management, fiscal, and program  evaluation responsibilities. The Secretary of Defense designated the Under  Secretary of Defense as the department\u2019s Defense Logistics Executive with  authority to address logistics and supply chain issues. However, each of  the military services is separately organized under its own secretary and  functions under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of  Defense. The secretaries of the military departments are responsible for  organizing, training, and equipping their forces under Title 10 of the United  States Code. DOD policy states that each of the secretaries is directed to  prepare and submit budgets for their respective departments, justifying  before the Congress budget requests, as approved by the President; and to  administer the funds made available for maintaining, equipping, and  training their forces. As we have previously reported, the diffuse  organization of DOD\u2019s logistics operations complicates DOD\u2019s ability to  adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to joint logistics.

For  example, U.S. Transportation Command, the lead functional proponent for  the implementation of AIT, including IUID and passive RFID, released an  AIT Concept of Operations (CONOPS) in June 2007 and an AIT  Implementation Plan in March 2008. The CONOPS and Implementation  Plan provide information on DOD\u2019s future vision for AIT use across the  supply chain and are intended to establish a baseline standard for AIT use  and implementation throughout DOD. Guidance on these technologies has  also been published by DOD. For example, DOD has provided guidance  concerning the use of IUID to support improved maintenance and materiel  management processes, as well as detailed information on the technology  and the mechanics of its implementation.", "DOD has taken other actions to support and facilitate the implementation  of IUID and passive RFID. DOD established a UID Policy Office and  designated staff resources toward RFID implementation in the Office of  Supply Chain Integration. In addition to helping disseminate policy and  guidance, the two offices play a role in promoting the technologies and  educating the military components regarding implementation. For  example, the offices have established Web sites for suppliers, program  managers, and others involved in implementation efforts to access  information on the technologies, including specifications and  requirements, tutorials and trainings, guidance for implementation, and  updates to existing policy and guidance. Additionally, the UID Policy  Office holds biannual UID Forums to provide practical guidance to help  educate military program managers and DOD contractors regarding IUID  implementation, and the Supply Chain Integration Office holds annual  RFID summits to highlight best practices across the department and  provide a forum for discussion of RFID technologies and their potential  applications to supply chain management.", "In addition to guidance developed at the department level, the military  components are developing service-specific implementation plans for IUID  and passive RFID. As of October 2008, the Army had issued a service-wide  strategy for IUID implementation, and the Marine Corps and Air Force had  both completed draft IUID implementation plans. While the Navy does not  have a formal service-wide IUID implementation plan, a Navy official  responsible for managing IUID implementation stated its draft serialized  item management implementation plan contains information pertaining  to DOD IUID guidance and requirements. For passive RFID, the Navy and  Air Force had completed plans for implementation of the technology, the  Army had completed a draft implementation plan, and the Marine Corps  was in the process of updating its existing RFID implementation plan to  incorporate information from the DOD AIT CONOPS.", "Efforts to implement the technologies also include information sharing  across DOD and within its military components. DOD and its military  components have established integrated process teams and working  groups to define objectives and establish implementation timelines,  identify common implementation challenges and potential solutions, and  facilitate stakeholder communications. These teams focus on several areas  related to implementation and operate both within and across the military  components. For example, U.S. Transportation Command formed multiple  integrated process teams dedicated to different segments of supply and  distribution operations during the development of its AIT Implementation  Plan, which encompasses both IUID and passive RFID. Additionally, the  UID Policy Office has established and participated in a number of working  groups to support the development and implementation of IUID policy.", "Integrated process teams and working groups also operate within the  military components. For example, in September 2007, the Navy formed an  IUID integrated process team whose four working groups meet monthly to  discuss metrics for measuring implementation progress, technical  solutions for implementation challenges, process mapping of  implementation efforts, and internal and external communications  regarding implementation. In December 2007, the Army also formed an  IUID integrated process team, which developed the Army-wide  implementation strategy for IUID and continues to meet to share lessons  learned and discuss challenges related to implementation.", "The military components, DLA, and U.S. Transportation Command have  funded implementation of both IUID and passive RFID through various  mechanisms and to varying degrees. For instance, the Army funds AIT,  which includes both IUID and passive RFID, through its regular budget  process. Army officials estimated that, in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, the  Army has spent $22.5 million on the implementation of IUID and has  requested an additional $15 million per year for fiscal years 2009 through  2013. For passive RFID, Army officials estimated that the Army spent $2.2  million between the third quarters of fiscal year 2006 and 2008. Other  services, however, do not uniformly provide designated funding for  implementation. For example, Navy officials stated that implementation of  IUID within the Navy is an unfunded mandate and funding for  implementation must be taken out of operational budgets. Air Force  officials also stated that funding for implementation is taken out of  operational budgets by program managers. Additionally, DLA and U.S.  Transportation Command funded a project that spanned multiple military  components.", "Pilot projects and initial implementation efforts for both IUID and passive  RFID are under way at multiple locations throughout the military  components. Table 3 lists examples of pilot projects and initial  implementations that DOD officials identified as important ongoing  efforts.", "The implementation efforts listed in the table vary in scope, in terms of  both the number of components and installations involved and the amount  of resources required for full implementation. For example, the Alaska  RFID Implementation project, which aimed to test and evaluate passive  RFID within the DOD supply chain in order to streamline supply chain  operations, spanned multiple military components and cost more than $27  million to implement. As a part of this pilot, passive RFID infrastructure  was installed at DLA, Army, and Air Force locations in Alaska and  California. Other implementation efforts, however, have been smaller and  less resource intensive. For instance, the Robotic Systems Joint Project  Office, which works to procure, field, sustain, and support ground robotics  for the Army and the Marine Corps, implemented IUID at its Joint Robot  Repair Fielding division at a cost of approximately $400,000 during fiscal  years 2007 and 2008.

According to DOD officials, as of  October 2008 approximately 4 percent of the estimated 100 million items  currently in DOD inventory have been marked with item unique identifiers.  DOD officials stated that, at the current pace of implementation, full  marking of legacy items will take many additional years. For example, the  Air Force estimates that it will take until fiscal year 2021 to complete  marking parts already in inventory with item unique identifiers. Since  2005, Air Force officials estimated that the Air Force has marked 10,000  items in its inventory while the total number of Air Force items required to  be marked exceeds 12.5 million.", "The DOD AIT Implementation Plan estimates that the implementation of  technologies, including passive RFID will be completed in 2015; however,  current time frames indicate that it may take longer to fully implement the  technology.

Additionally, according to the DOD AIT Implementation Plan, updated  automatic information systems needed to support passive RFID and IUID  may not be functional until after 2015. Updates to these systems are  necessary in order for the components to derive benefit from these  initiatives. Furthermore, while infrastructure for reading passive RFID tags  is in place in multiple locations throughout the military components,  additional work is required to reach full implementation. According to a  September 2008 report by the DOD Inspector General on DLA\u2019s  implementation of passive RFID, 10 percent of supply contracts examined  did not contain the required RFID clause and suppliers for 43 percent of  contracts containing the required clause did not apply passive RFID tags  to shipments they sent to depots.

While DOD gathers  information on some of the costs associated with implementation, cost  estimates do not include all of the funding or staff resources provided by  the services to support implementation because funding for  implementation at the component level is frequently taken out of  operational accounts, rather than being directly allocated. The March 2008  DOD AIT Implementation Plan identified $744 million in programmed AIT- related funding for fiscal years 2008 through 2013, but does not include in  its estimate funding that the military components take from operational  accounts to support implementation efforts. A 2005 memo from the Under  Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) requires  acquisition programs to specifically identify funding for IUID in budget  submissions. However, several officials from the military services stated  that they divert resources from other efforts in order to facilitate  implementation of IUID and passive RFID. Navy officials stated that  implementation of IUID within the Navy is treated as an unfunded  mandate and program managers at the installation level must take funding  out of operational budgets in order to support implementation efforts.  Army officials have faced similar challenges. For example, program  managers involved in the Army\u2019s implementation of IUID for small arms  have had to release staff from other tasks to assist in the marking of  weapons with item unique identifiers. Since funding and staff resources  are often provided in this indirect manner, the total resources expended  on the implementation of IUID and passive RFID may not be visible to  decision makers, both at the component level and across DOD.", "Additionally, DOD does not require the military components to gather or  report on outcome-based performance measures to demonstrate the  extent to which benefits are being accrued through the implementation of  IUID and passive RFID. While DOD does gather some information to  assess implementation efforts across the military components, the  information collected focuses on measures of implementation progress  and does not include outcome-based performance measures. For example,  while OSD and the military components are required to provide updates to  DOD at quarterly IUID Scorecard Reviews, reporting requirements focus  on the execution of implementation plans rather than benefits accrued  from implementation. At the July 2008 scorecard review, military  components provided installation-level implementation plan status  updates and reported on implementation efforts, such as issuance of new  policies and outreach activities. Furthermore, while U.S. Transportation  Command\u2019s AIT Implementation Plan identifies potential performance  measures for automatic identification technologies and establishes a  schedule to begin collecting some data in 2009, the military components  have not yet been required to collect or report information pertaining to  these metrics. Senior DOD officials involved in the implementation of  passive RFID stated that they plan to collect this information in the future.", "During our site visits, officials at some locations were able to describe  qualitative benefits derived from the implementation of IUID or passive  RFID. However, the officials had not quantified the benefits they had  observed. For instance, Army officials cited a number of benefits from the  implementation of IUID by the Robotic Systems Joint Project Office.  These included reductions in inventory size, shipping and receiving time,  and data entry errors and increases in data quality, robustness, and  processing speed. However, officials stated that they had not attempted to  quantify these benefits. Other officials cited installation-level qualitative  benefits for implementing passive RFID. For example, officials from DLA\u2019s  Defense Distribution Center in San Joaquin, California, said the  implementation of passive RFID reduced the amount of time needed to  prepare shipments. However, they lacked key data to quantify the extent  of the time savings. Additionally, only limited efforts have been made to  gather the baseline information needed to quantify change in performance  outcomes over time. For instance, DLA gathered baseline information on  shipping and receiving operations at the Defense Distribution Center in  San Joaquin in September 2008, despite beginning its implementation of  passive RFID in November 2004.", "Without data on the costs and benefits associated with the technologies, it  is difficult for DOD to create a business case or other analysis that would  fully demonstrate return on investment from implementing IUID and  passive RFID to the military components. Both OMB and DOD have  established guidance for conducting such analyses. The stated goal of  OMB Circular A-94 is to promote efficient resource allocation through  well-informed decision making by the federal government, and the circular  provides general guidance on comparing the costs of alternative means of  achieving the same objective or stream of benefits. Additionally, according  to DOD Instruction 7041.3, economic analyses are an integral part of the  planning, programming and budgeting system of the department, and  economic analysis calculations should include information on the costs  and benefits associated with alternatives under consideration.", "While OSD and the military components have conducted some studies to  assess the business case for the use of IUID and passive RFID, these  studies have had mixed results. For example, a June 2008 analysis of  alternatives for AIT in base-level Air Force supply and distribution  processes found that implementation of the RFID vision presented in the  DOD AIT CONOPS was not optimal, based on the costs and benefits  associated with implementation. Instead, the Air Force determined that its  current state of operations, with limited incorporation of passive RFID,  functioned both effectively and efficiently. Broader analyses of return on  investment, however, have arrived at different results. DOD released a  business case analysis of passive RFID in April 2005 that projected overall  cost savings from implementation of passive RFID would range from $70  million to $1.781 billion over a 6-year period and found that there is a  reasonable to good expectation that implementation of passive RFID  across DOD will provide an economic return on investment in the near  term and an excellent expectation of economic returns in the long term.  Additionally, a March 2005 cost benefit analysis of IUID performed by OSD  found that implementation of the technology would deliver benefits in  both the short and long terms. However, these department-wide business  case analyses for both technologies have been characterized by DOD  officials involved in the coordination and management of IUID and passive  RFID as overly broad and unconvincing because analyses have been  largely based on data from private industry implementation efforts. DOD  officials stated that the April 2005 DOD business case analysis for passive  RFID and the March 2005 DOD IUID business case analysis were both  high-level efforts that were discounted by the military components for  overstating potential benefits of the technologies, as well as the time frame  in which those benefits would be achieved.", "In 2005, we identified unclear return on investment as an impediment to  the implementation of passive RFID. This impediment remains today.  Since return on investment for both IUID and passive RFID is not always  clear to the military components charged with their implementation, it is  difficult for DOD to convince program managers at the installation level to  invest time and resources toward overcoming challenges associated with  implementing the technologies at the expense of other competing  priorities. For example, officials from both the Army and the Navy who  have responsibility for coordinating and managing implementation of  these technologies in their respective components stated that  implementation of IUID is given low priority by program managers, who  do not see the benefits associated with implementation. DOD officials  agreed that program managers resist implementation of the technologies  when the value of implementation is unclear. In our previous work on  supply chain management, we have stated that it is important for the  Office of the Secretary of Defense to obtain the necessary resource  commitments from the military services, DLA, and other organizations,  such as U.S. Transportation Command, to ensure that initiatives are  properly supported. At present, DOD\u2019s inability to fully quantify return on  investment has impeded implementation progress, as the military  components charged with carrying out implementation are unable to  clearly discern the benefits of the technologies and are reluctant to devote  time and resources for implementation, rather than for competing  priorities.", "Effective integration of these technologies with supply chain processes  and information systems is challenging and requires the military  components to make significant commitments of funding and staff  resources, often without promise of short-term benefit. As noted  previously, DOD identified $744 million in programmed funding that will  be necessary in fiscal years 2008 through 2013 to achieve the vision laid  out in the AIT Implementation Plan. Military service officials stated that  tasks required to achieve full implementation include installation of  infrastructure and training of personnel to understand and use the  technologies. Additionally, costly and complex business process changes  are necessary for the military components to enable interoperability  between automatic information systems used to gather data from IUID  marks and passive RFID tags and service-specific supply data systems.", "Without these changes, data gathered through IUID and passive RFID  cannot be accessed to derive benefit from the technologies. In some cases,  data are not being gathered at all. Officials at three out of four locations  participating in the implementation of the Alaska RFID Implementation  Project stated they derive no benefit yet from passive RFID as a result of  the lack of integration between RFID data collection platforms and supply  chain information systems. Deriving benefit from IUID implementation has  also been difficult. Officials from multiple military components stated that  while IUID marking efforts are time consuming and resource intensive,  lack of data system integration prevents implementation benefits from  being realized.", "Without a clear return on investment, achieving the integration necessary  to derive benefit from the technologies may be resource intensive to a  degree that discourages the military components from investing in  technology solutions. For instance, faced with a lack of information  system interoperability, the Army decided against investing in  technologies that would allow its legacy supply systems to use IUID and  passive RFID data. Instead, the Army decided to delay obtaining benefit  from the technologies for multiple years until Army-wide information  systems that can directly communicate with one another are operational.

Although DOD did not  provide a time frame for completing these assessments, DOD officials  have previously stated that they tentatively expect to have all 22  assessments completed for the next iteration of the roadmap in July 2009.  Because DOD was not able to provide information on its assessment  methodology, we could not determine whether these assessments are  likely to address the information gaps we identified in the current  roadmap regarding the scope of DOD\u2019s logistics problems and capability  gaps; nor could we determine the extent that these assessments might  result in outcome-oriented performance measures that would enable DOD  to assess progress toward achieving the roadmap\u2019s goals and objectives.  DOD\u2019s decision to form an executive advisory committee appears to be a  positive step. However, it remains unclear at this time how the roadmap  will be integrated within the department\u2019s existing decision-making  processes used to govern and fund logistics; therefore, DOD will need to  take additional steps to clarify how it intends to use the roadmap.", "DOD also concurred with our three recommendations aimed at improving  the likelihood that the department will achieve the potential benefits it  expects from implementing IUID and passive RFID. DOD cited a number  of efforts to identify and collect performance metrics for IUID and passive  RFID and to analyze this information to justify the expanded investment of  resources in their implementation. DOD further stated it will review the  services\u2019 Program Objective Memorandum inputs to ensure that, based on  the department\u2019s AIT investment plan, sufficient funding priority is given  to integrating these technologies into their respective business processes.  Our review indicated that much work remains for DOD to collect complete  and useful performance data. Additionally, DOD did not indicate plans to  gather additional cost information pertaining to the implementation of  IUID and passive RFID. We continue to believe that cost information  associated with the implementation of these technologies is important to  any analysis of return on investment. As we noted in the report, some  funding for the implementation of IUID and passive RFID is being taken  out of operational accounts. Current POM information may not provide a  complete picture of the costs associated with the implementation of IUID  and passive RFID. Therefore, DOD should gather detailed information on  the full costs associated with the implementation of both IUID and passive  RFID, including those funded from operational accounts. We have  modified our recommendation accordingly.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, the  Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps; the  Commander of U.S. Transportation Command; the Director of the Defense  Logistics Agency; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.

We also reviewed memoranda directing components to  conduct assessments for specific objectives included in the roadmap. We  reviewed prior DOD logistics strategies and plans, including the 2005  Focused Logistics Roadmap and the DOD Plan for Improvement in the  GAO High Risk Area of Supply Chain Management with a Focus on  Inventory Management and Distribution, as well as other DOD strategic  plans such as the Enterprise Transition Plan and the Quadrennial Defense  Review. We reviewed DOD statements about the intended purposes of the  roadmap that were made in congressional hearings, in discussions with  our office conducted during prior GAO work in this area, and in the  roadmap itself. We identified sound management principles based on prior  work evaluating strategic planning efforts and performance assessments.  We obtained information on DOD\u2019s logistics capabilities portfolio  management test case by reviewing DOD guidance and interviewing  officials within the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were  responsible for managing the test case for joint logistics. We interviewed  officials from DOD components submitting information for the roadmap,  including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, the Defense Logistics  Agency, the U.S. Transportation Command, the U.S. Joint Forces  Command, and the Offices of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretaries of  Defense for Supply Chain Integration, Transportation Policy, and  Maintenance Policy and Programs. Over the course of these interviews, we  obtained pertinent information and perspectives on the roadmap, efforts  to compile and review the information included in the roadmap, and  potential uses of the roadmap for logistics decision making.", "To obtain information on the progress DOD has made implementing item  unique identification (IUID) and passive radio frequency identification  (RFID), we reviewed DOD\u2019s overall concept of operations and  implementation plan for automatic identification technology, which  includes IUID and passive RFID. We obtained briefing documents  describing the status of IUID and passive RFID implementation. We  obtained and reviewed various service-level implementation plans for  IUID and RFID; however, because the majority of these plans were only  recently released or in draft form, we did not evaluate the adequacy of  these service-level plans. We also reviewed Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and DOD guidance on benefit-cost analysis and economic  analysis for decision making. We visited and conducted interviews with  officials involved in the coordination and management of these  technologies within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA), the U.S. Transportation Command, and the  military services. Additionally, we visited and observed the use of passive  RFID technology at DLA\u2019s Defense Distribution Center in San Joaquin,  California; Travis Air Force Base, California; and the Naval Base Kitsap in  Bangor, Washington. We also visited and observed the use of IUID at the  Robotic Systems Joint Project Office and the Army Aviation and Missile  Command, Alabama. We also interviewed officials at the following  locations involved in implementing either IUID or passive RFID: Anniston  Army Depot, Alabama; Army Project Manager Soldier Weapons, New  Jersey; Navy Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communications Branch,  California; Naval Air Systems Command, Maryland; Elmendorf Air Force  Base, Alaska; Fort Richardson, Alaska; and Air Mobility Command, Illinois.  We also interviewed officials responsible for managing the IUID registry in  Battle Creek, Michigan. We also interviewed officials in the DOD Inspector  General\u2019s Office to review concurrent work that office is conducting on  passive RFID.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2008 through January  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
