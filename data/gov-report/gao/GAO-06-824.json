Award recipients GAO interviewed said that the BEA program lowers bank costs associated with investing in a CDFI or lending in a distressed community, allowing for increases in both types of activities. However, other economic and regulatory incentives also encourage banks to undertake award-eligible activities, and it is difficult to isolate and distinguish these incentives from those of a BEA award. For example, banks may have economic incentives to lend in distressed communities because of the potential profitability of such lending. Although it is difficult to determine the BEA program's impact, available evidence suggests that the impact likely has not been significant. For example, the size of a BEA award for large banks (which was .0004 percent of assets in 2005) suggests that a BEA award does not have much influence on such banks' overall investment and lending decisions. However, BEA awards may allow large banks to incrementally increase their award-eligible investments and lending. The BEA program's performance measures likely overstate its impact, and GAO identified weaknesses in certain program internal controls. To assess the BEA program's performance, Treasury, among other measures, annually aggregates the total reported increase in CDFI investments and distressed community loans by all applicants but does not account for other factors, such as economic and regulatory incentives that also affect bank decisions. GAO also found that Treasury has limited controls in place to help ensure that BEA program applications contain accurate information. In particular, Treasury provides limited guidance to application review staff to identify potential errors and does not require the reviewers to completely document their work.

CDFIs are private for- profit or not-for-profit financial institutions that provide financial services  (e.g., loans) to communities traditionally underserved by conventional  lenders and investors and that Treasury may certify for participation in the  BEA program and other related programs. CDFIs include community  development banks, which may receive BEA awards because they are  FDIC-insured; credit unions, which are ineligible for BEA awards because  they are not FDIC-insured; loan funds; and venture capital funds. Due to  statutory and regulatory requirements, community development banks,  which tend to be small institutions, receive relatively larger BEA awards  for increasing certain award-eligible investments and lending compared to  traditional banks. In providing banks with incentives to increase their  award-eligible activities, the BEA program seeks to build the financial  capacity of CDFIs, so they may better serve their customers, and the  availability of direct lending within distressed communities.", "However, the BEA program has faced long-standing questions about its  effectiveness and experienced significant funding declines in recent years.  A 1998 GAO report, as well as a 2002 review by the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), both questioned the extent to which the BEA program  provided banks with financial incentives to increase their award-eligible  activities. For example, we and OMB stated that the Community  Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) provides banks with incentives to make  similar investments and loans that the BEA program awards and that it can  be difficult to distinguish CRA\u2019s incentives from those of a BEA award.  Further, from fiscal years 2000 through 2005, BEA program funding  declined from over $46 million to about $10 million, the number of award  recipients declined from 159 to 53, and Treasury has increasingly been  unable to award all qualified applicants. The average BEA award amount  also dropped from almost $292,000 to about $187,000 during the period.", "Noting concerns about funding reductions to the BEA program and other  related programs within Treasury, as well as the lack of a recent third- party evaluation, a fiscal year 2006 report by the Senate Committee on  Appropriations requires us to assess the BEA program, particularly the  extent to which it affects bank behavior in providing financial services to  distressed communities. As agreed with committee staff, this review also  includes an assessment of certain aspects of Treasury\u2019s administration of  the BEA program. Accordingly, this report (1) examines the extent to  which the BEA program may have provided banks with financial  incentives to increase their investments in CDFIs and lending in distressed  communities and (2) assesses the BEA program\u2019s performance measures  and certain internal controls designed to ensure proper award payments.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed relevant program statutes, regulations,  guidelines, memorandums, and reports; interviewed Treasury officials  regarding the BEA program\u2019s impact and administration; interviewed CDFI  trade associations regarding their views of the program; and interviewed a  nonprobability sample of nine BEA award recipients and five CDFI  beneficiaries participating in the fiscal year 2005 round of awards. While  results from these interviews cannot be projected to the entire population  of BEA award recipients and beneficiaries, we selected these recipients  and beneficiaries for interviews to assure variation on a range of  characteristics, including differing asset sizes, frequency of program  participation, award-to-asset percentages, and CDFI type. Our interviews  with award recipients included both community development banks and  traditional banks. We also assessed the BEA program\u2019s performance  measures and internal controls against our standards for effective  measures and controls.", "We conducted our work from October 2005 through July 2006 in  Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Appendix I provides a description of our scope and  methodology in greater detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The BEA program\u2019s goals are to encourage banks to increase their  investments in CDFIs and lending and other financial services in  distressed communities. Unlike grant programs, which are usually  prospective\u2014meaning they award applicants based on their plans for the  future\u2014the BEA program is retrospective, awarding applicants for  activities they have already completed. Under the program\u2019s authorizing  statute, BEA award recipients are not limited in how they may use their  award and, therefore, may use their award proceeds in any manner they  deem fit.", "To encourage increased investment and lending, the BEA program awards  applicants on the basis of their increased activities from one year (known  as the baseline year) to the next (the assessment year). For example, for  the fiscal year 2005 round of awards, calendar year 2003 was the baseline  year and calendar year 2004 was the assessment year. When applying for  awards, applicants may submit an application for any of the following  three award categories: (1) CDFI-related activities, (2) distressed  community financing activities, and (3) service activities. CDFI-related  activities are primarily investments in CDFIs, such as equity investments  (including grants and equitylike loans), loans, and insured deposits.  Distressed community financing activities are primarily loans, such as  affordable housing loans, small-business loans, commercial real estate  loans, and education loans. Service activities include the provision of  financial services such as check-cashing or money order services,  electronic transfer accounts, and individual development accounts.", "Pursuant to statutory and regulatory requirements, BEA awards are  percentage matches of an applicant\u2019s reported increase in activities; that  is, banks qualify for a BEA award equal to the sum of the percentage  increase in the three program areas. For equity investments in CDFIs, the  percentage match for both community development banks and traditional  banks is the same\u201415 percent (see table 1). However, community  development banks are eligible to receive awards three times higher than  traditional banks for increasing CDFI support activities (e.g., increasing  insured deposits in other CDFIs) or increasing their lending and service  delivery in distressed communities. For distressed community financing  activities, a priority factor of 3.0 or 2.0 is assigned to each type of eligible  loan a BEA applicant originates\u2014for example, a small-business loan is  assigned 3.0 and an affordable housing development loan is assigned 2.0.  The change in award-eligible activity (i.e., the increase in lending from the  baseline to the assessment year) is multiplied by the applicable priority  factor, and the result (or weighted value) is then multiplied by the  applicable award percentage, yielding the award amount for that  particular activity.", "To illustrate how the BEA program works, suppose a community  development bank that did not have any investments in other CDFIs or  loans in eligible distressed communities during the baseline year. During  the assessment year, the bank makes the following investments or loans in  CDFIs: $300,000 in insured deposits in three community development  credit unions (three insured certificates of deposits of $100,000 each),  $500,000 in small-business loans, and $1 million in affordable housing  development loans in distressed communities (total increased investments  and loans of $1.8 million). Under this example, the bank would be eligible  for a BEA award totaling $369,000 (a 20.5 percent return on investment).  Under the same scenario, a traditional bank would be eligible for a BEA  award of $123,000 (or a return on investment of 6.8 percent).", "According to Treasury officials, the BEA program is seasonal and employs  the equivalent of about six staff annually, who work on the program on an  as-needed basis. A program manager oversees the BEA program on a day- to-day basis. During the program\u2019s peak application season, Treasury  reassigns roughly 10 staff members from other job responsibilities to  review BEA applications over a period of approximately 10 business days.  During fiscal year 2005, it cost approximately $1.2 million to administer  the BEA program. These costs are composed of personnel compensation,  information technology, and administrative contracting services, among  other costs.", "CRA requires federal bank regulators to assess how well the banks they  regulate meet the credit needs of all areas of the community they serve,  including low- and moderate-income areas (insofar as is consistent with  safe and sound operations) and to take this performance into account  when considering a bank\u2019s request for regulatory approval of a regulated  action, such as opening a new branch or acquiring or merging with another  bank. Federal regulators conduct examinations for compliance with CRA  requirements on a frequency that varies depending on an institution\u2019s size  and prior rating. When conducting examinations, regulators check to see  whether a bank\u2019s CRA compliance activities are an ongoing part of the  bank\u2019s business and generally apply three tests to make this  determination:  A lending test evaluates the number, amount, and income and geographic  distribution of a bank\u2019s mortgage, small business, small farm, and  consumer loans.", "An investment test evaluates a bank\u2019s community development  investments, including its investments in CDFIs.", "A service test evaluates a bank\u2019s retail service delivery operations, such as  branches and low-cost checking services.", "Upon completing examinations, regulators assign one of four ratings to a  bank: outstanding, satisfactory, needs improvement, or substantial  noncompliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The BEA Program Reportedly Produces Benefits, but Available Evidence Suggests That the Program\u2019s Impact Has Likely Not Been Significant", "paragraphs": ["Treasury officials and some BEA award recipients we interviewed said  that the BEA program provides banks with incentives to increase their  investments in CDFIs and lending in distressed communities.

For example, for large banks, a BEA award  (when compared with total bank assets) is small and likely not large  enough to have much influence on such banks\u2019 overall investment and  lending decisions. Other evidence also indicates that the BEA program\u2019s  impact has likely not been significant. In particular, until 2003, BEA  awards may have provided certain community development banks with  incentives to benefit financially from activities that were inconsistent with  BEA program goals, and available studies indicate that certain CDFIs have  been able to raise an increased amount of capital from banks, while BEA  program funding and participation have declined."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "According to Treasury Officials and Some Award Recipients, the BEA Program Produces a Range of Benefits", "paragraphs": ["According to Treasury officials and some award recipients, the BEA  program allows award recipients to increase their lending and investment  levels beyond those that would occur without the program. Award  recipients we interviewed stated that one of the program\u2019s main benefits is  reduced transaction costs. Transaction costs are primarily the time and  expense associated with researching markets or borrower qualifications  and underwriting loans within distressed communities. Award recipients  stated that transaction costs are higher in distressed communities than in  other communities because, for example, loans are typically smaller (thus  generating less interest income) and have a higher risk of default. Because  BEA awards are in cash, award recipients said that award proceeds can be  used to provide more loans, on more favorable terms, than are otherwise  possible. Award recipients said that such an arrangement benefits both  BEA award recipients and loan borrowers.", "Another benefit that award recipients cited is the formation of  partnerships between banks and other financial institutions, including  CDFIs. When investing in a CDFI\u2014the activity awarded with the highest  payout\u2014applicants identify and select a CDFI in which to invest, such as a  community development bank, credit union, loan fund, or venture capital  fund. According to officials from banks and CDFIs, the resulting  investment in the CDFI produces two benefits. First, the investment  increases the CDFI\u2019s capacity by providing it with capital, often at below- market rates, which in turn allows the CDFI to provide more loans in  distressed communities. Second, according to one CDFI official we  interviewed, the partnership allows traditional banks to learn about and  understand the work of CDFIs. For example, the CDFI official we  interviewed noted that the partnership formed through the BEA program  allowed officials from a traditional bank to sit on the CDFI\u2019s board of  directors, which exposed the traditional bank officials to the products and  services of the CDFI. When initially established, Treasury intended the  BEA program to encourage traditional banks to become involved in  community development banking activities by, for example, investing in a  CDFI or lending in a distressed community.", "A third benefit of the BEA program, according some award recipients we  interviewed, is the provision of capital needed to help the community  development banking industry grow and develop during its early years and  sustain its level of operations today. An official representing the  community development banking industry noted that there were only  three Treasury-certified community development banks in the mid-1990s  when the BEA program began, but today there are over 50 such banks,  growth the official attributes to the BEA program. Some award recipients  we interviewed also stated that award proceeds have allowed them to  sustain their current level of operations within distressed communities,  where, as previously noted, transaction costs are higher than in other  areas. Accordingly, the BEA program is said to help community  development banks remain true to their core missions of serving the  financing and developmental needs of their community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Isolating the BEA Program\u2019s Impact from Other Existing Economic and Regulatory Incentives Remains Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Independently evaluating and isolating the BEA program\u2019s impact on bank  investment and lending decisions is difficult because other economic and  regulatory incentives also affect bank behavior. In 1998, we reported that  the prospect of receiving a BEA award, while one factor, was not always  the primary reason banks undertook award-eligible activities. In 2000, the  Federal Reserve Board completed a survey providing additional evidence  that loan profitability can be an important factor in banks\u2019 community  development lending decisions. This survey, which focused on the  performance and profitability of CRA-related lending, found that a  majority of respondents\u2019 community development loans were profitable.  The survey also found that a majority of respondent\u2019s CRA special lending  programs, which target low-income borrowers and areas, were profitable.  Because community development loans can be profitable, as noted in the  Federal Reserve Board\u2019s survey, banks have economic incentives to make  these loans even without the incentive of potentially receiving a BEA  award.", "In addition to economic incentives, regulatory incentives can also  encourage banks to undertake award-eligible activities. In our 1998 report,  we found that compliance with CRA was a major reason banks made  investments in CDFIs and loans in distressed communities. CRA incentives  may be particularly strong for banks that plan to open a new branch or  merge with other banks because federal regulators may consider  inadequate compliance when reviewing banks\u2019 requests to merge with  other banks or expand their operations. However, Treasury officials said  that the BEA program provides banks with more targeted incentives than  CRA requirements do. For example, the officials said that the BEA  program provides banks with incentives to provide financial services in  the most distressed communities\u2014communities that banks are not  required to service in their efforts to comply with CRA.", "To obtain feedback on the BEA program\u2019s design and implementation,  Treasury has conducted surveys of BEA program applicants. Treasury\u2019s  most recent survey, conducted in 2002, suggests that both the BEA  program and CRA requirements are responsible for banks\u2019 increased  investments in CDFIs and lending in distressed communities. For example,  the 2002 survey of 115 program applicants found that both the prospect of  a BEA award and credit for CRA compliance motivated banks to  undertake many CDFI-related activities, including providing CDFIs with  loans, grants, and technical assistance, but found that the BEA program  contributed toward the development of new financial products. The  survey also found that, in many cases, neither the BEA program nor credit  for CRA compliance motivated banks to lend in distressed communities.  Rather, the banks reported making loans in distressed communities  because such lending is part of their community development mission or  part of their everyday business activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Evidence Suggests That the BEA Program\u2019s Impact Has Likely Not Been Significant", "paragraphs": ["Although it is difficult to determine the BEA program\u2019s impact, the  available evidence we reviewed suggests that the program\u2019s impact has  likely not been significant for large traditional banks, although it may  allow for incremental increases in award-eligible activities. The available  evidence also suggests that the BEA program may have provided some  community development banks with incentives to benefit financially  without furthering program goals. Further, available studies we reviewed  indicate that some CDFIs have raised an increased amount of capital from  banks while BEA program funding and participation have declined.  Specifically, we found the following:    For large traditional banks, as noted in our 1998 report, BEA awards  are likely not large enough to provide a meaningful financial incentive.  As shown in table 2, the size of a BEA award when compared with the  assets of large traditional banks (those with over $1 billion in assets) was  .0004 percent of assets in 2005. For these banks, the prospect of receiving  a BEA award, independent of any economic and regulatory incentives the  banks may have, is unlikely to serve as a significant financial incentive for  increased CDFI investment or distressed community lending. However,  BEA awards may provide large traditional banks with the capacity to  incrementally increase their award-eligible activities, offset some of the  cost associated with doing so, and increase the profits of related lines of  business. Large traditional banks may also derive public and community  relations value from receiving a BEA award that outweighs its financial  benefit.", "Until 2003, many BEA program participants engaged in a now- prohibited practice called deposit swapping that improved their  financial condition without necessarily furthering program goals.  According to a Treasury official, beginning around 1998, a group of about  30 community development banks began to purchase insured certificates  of deposit in one another\u2014that is, swap deposits\u2014to increase their CDFI  investments and thereby receive BEA awards. At the time, Treasury  provided a 33 percent award match for community development banks  that increased their deposits in other community development banks.  Following the 2003 prohibition, the percentage of total BEA dollars  awarded for CDFI investments fell substantially\u2014from 87 percent of all  BEA dollars awarded in 2002 to only 18 percent in 2003 (by contrast, total  BEA dollars awarded for increased lending and services in distressed  communities increased from 13 percent in 2002 to 82 percent in 2003).  According to a Treasury official, the prohibition on deposit swapping was,  in fact, the primary reason for the substantial decline in CDFI investments.  This decline suggests that, until 2003, banks may have been responding to  financial incentives that were inconsistent with the BEA program\u2019s goals,  which include increasing lending within distressed communities.", "Community development loan funds have raised an increased amount of  capital from banks, thrifts, and credit unions, while BEA program  funding and bank participation in the program have declined.  According to data from a consortium of CDFIs, community development  loan funds\u2014the most numerous type of CDFI and thus the largest group of  potential BEA program beneficiaries\u2014have continued raising capital from  banks, thrifts, and credit unions concurrent with a decline in funding and  bank participation in the BEA program. According to the consortium\u2019s  data, the percentage of capital loan funds raised from banks, thrifts, and  credit unions increased from 47 percent in fiscal year 2003 to 56 percent in  fiscal year 2004. As discussed previously, BEA program funding also  declined substantially in recent years from over $46 million in fiscal year  2000 to about $10 million in fiscal year 2005. We note that one limitation of  the consortium\u2019s data for purposes of this analysis is that it includes credit  unions, which are ineligible for BEA awards. However, an official involved  with completing the studies said that loan funds raised most of the capital  from banks and thrifts, which are eligible for BEA awards.

Treasury uses this information to monitor and measure the BEA program\u2019s  impact. Similar to its externally reported measure, Treasury assumes a  direct one-to-one correlation between these outcomes (new jobs and  housing units) and the BEA program. Treasury does not account for  external factors, such as economic and regulatory incentives that could  also contribute to an increase in jobs created or housing units developed.  Further, these data are self-reported and, according to Treasury, not  verified.

Treasury\u2019s BEA program performance measures do not  provide additional insights into the program\u2019s impact because they assume  that all reported increases in eligible investment and lending occur solely  because of the program\u2019s financial incentives. However, based on available  evidence we reviewed, it is reasonable to conclude that the program likely  does not provide significant financial incentives for large banks, due to the  typical award\u2019s relatively small size for such institutions. To an extent that  is unquantifiable, a significant percentage of reported large bank increases  in CDFI investments and distressed community loans each year would  likely have occurred without the BEA program. Further, the program also  appears to have provided certain community development banks with  financial incentives and opportunities to benefit financially without  furthering program goals. On the other hand, the BEA program may  provide some banks, including large banks, with additional incentives and  capacity to incrementally increase their award-eligible activities, offer  public and community relations benefits to some award recipients,  contribute to the development of new financial products, and help  establish partnerships between banks and other CDFIs.", "Treasury\u2019s internal controls to ensure proper award payments are  insufficient. Treasury\u2019s guidance to its BEA application review staff does  not require them to geocode property addresses, even though evidence  exists that applications may contain errors in reported information.

Consequently, the BEA program is vulnerable to making improper  payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure the integrity of the BEA award payment process, we  recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury revise the guidance for  reviewing program applications so that program staff are required to (1)  geocode property addresses where appropriate and (2) document their  efforts to verify property addresses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of the Treasury for its  review and comment. Treasury provided written comments that are  reprinted (with annotations) in appendix II. In its comments, Treasury  agreed with our conclusion that determining the extent to which the BEA  program provides banks with incentives to increase their investments in  CDFIs and lending in distressed communities remains difficult given the  number of external factors that drive such decisions. However, Treasury  stated that our report bases many of its conclusions on information that is  overly general, outdated, or developed for other purposes and, as a result,  does not reflect an accurate portrayal of the BEA program or its  importance within the banking industry. Treasury also said that we did not  adequately consider evidence the department provided regarding the BEA  program\u2019s impact. Treasury did agree to implement our recommendation  that application review staff (1) geocode property addresses, where  appropriate; and (2) document their efforts to verify property addresses.  Further, Treasury stated that it will adopt a policy requiring applicants to  report addresses for transactions; provide program staff with updated  instructions to geocode all transactions over $250,000 (not just  transactions over $500,000, as is the current practice); and initiate and  implement steps to analyze a statistically significant sample of  transactions less than $250,000.", "In its comments, Treasury stated that the focus of our report was  inherently flawed. Treasury said our report did not assess, as it expected,  whether the BEA program, as currently structured, is effective at  motivating banks to undertake community development financing  activities they would not normally undertake or, if the program were  found to be ineffective, recommend changes to its structure. In fact, we  did seek to assess whether the BEA program, as currently structured, is  effective at motivating banks to undertake activities they would not  normally undertake. However, as was the case when we initially evaluated  the BEA program in 1998 and as we state in this report, because of other  economic and regulatory incentives that affect bank behavior, it is difficult  to isolate the BEA program\u2019s impact from these other incentives. We note  an absence of change in the banking industry since 1998 that would  facilitate isolating the BEA program\u2019s impact for this review. On the  contrary, isolating the BEA program\u2019s impact may be more difficult today  than in 1998 because the average BEA award amount and number of banks  participating in the program have declined significantly in recent years.  Although isolating the impact of the BEA program is difficult, we believe  available evidence suggests that its impact has likely not been significant.", "Treasury also stated that our report relied on inappropriate information  and data to form conclusions and that we did not consider other evidence.  For example, Treasury stated that none of the studies cited in the report\u2014 including our 1998 report, a 2000 Federal Reserve survey on CRA-related  lending, and two studies by a consortium of CDFIs\u2014is an explicit  evaluation of the BEA program. Treasury also stated that we undertook  only a limited review of current program participants. Contrary to  Treasury\u2019s assertions, our 1998 report includes an assessment of the BEA  program. Moreover, the Federal Reserve survey and reports by a  consortium of CDFIs address issues that we believe are critical to  independently evaluating the BEA program\u2019s effectiveness. In particular,  the Federal Reserve survey indicates that community development lending  can be profitable, which suggests that a variety of factors\u2014including  economic and regulatory factors\u2014influence bank lending decisions. The  variety of factors that can influence bank lending decisions increase the  difficulties associated with isolating and determining the BEA program\u2019s  impact. As discussed in this report, the data from the consortium of CDFIs  also provide evidence that community development loan funds have been  able to raise an increased amount of capital from banks despite recent  declines in BEA program funding and participation. Regarding our  interviews with program participants, as we note in appendix I, we chose  program participants for interviews based on a variety of characteristics\u2014 including differing bank asset sizes, frequency of program participation,  status as a traditional bank or community development bank, and CDFI  type\u2014to elicit a wide range of views and perspectives on the BEA  program.", "Further, Treasury stated that we did not adequately refer to its 2002 survey  of BEA program participants in our draft report. Treasury stated that  evidence from the survey clearly demonstrates that the BEA program  plays a role in program applicant investment decisions. While we  recognize that surveys of program beneficiaries can play an important role  in program evaluations, we believe that their results must be interpreted  with caution. For example, survey respondents who are program  beneficiaries have a financial incentive to overstate a program\u2019s impact. To  compensate for this limitation, we sought to obtain and analyze  independent evidence, including available studies, to assess the BEA  program\u2019s impact. Even so, the findings of Treasury\u2019s 2002 survey are  consistent with the findings of our report. For example, our report states  that prior to 2003, when deposit swapping was prohibited, the BEA  program may have provided certain community development banks with  incentives to make investments that benefited them financially but were  inconsistent with program goals. In Treasury\u2019s 2002 survey, CDFI deposits  was the only category in which a majority of bank respondents (52  percent) said that the BEA program was the primary reason they made an  award-eligible investment. Overall, Treasury\u2019s 2002 survey indicates that  various factors, which include, but are not limited to, the prospect of  receiving a BEA award, motivate banks\u2019 decisions to invest in CDFIs and  lend in distressed communities. In fact, Treasury\u2019s 2002 survey found that  in many cases, neither the BEA program nor credit for CRA compliance  motivated banks\u2019 decisions to lend in distressed communities. Rather, as  we state in our report, the survey found that respondents undertook  lending activities because they were part of their community development  mission or part of their everyday business activities.", "Additionally, Treasury said that some conclusions in the report appear to  reflect a lack of understanding of the BEA program and the banking  industry. Specifically, Treasury stated the following:    GAO\u2019s analysis of the size of a BEA award relative to large banks\u2019 total  assets was overly general and did not consider that many banks (in  particular large banks) carry out CDFI financing within specific lines  of business, such as community development business lines. Rather than  comparing a large bank\u2019s BEA award amount with its total assets, as we  did, Treasury said a more appropriate and meaningful analysis would have  been to consider the bank\u2019s BEA award to the assets of a particular  business line or its relative importance in lowering the bank\u2019s transaction  costs. In response to this comment, we added language to the report that,  for large traditional banks, BEA awards may provide additional capacity to  incrementally increase award-eligible investments and lending, offset  some of the costs associated with doing so, and increase the profits of  related lines of business. In interviews for this report, officials from one  large bank said BEA awards have allowed their bank to provide more  loans than they would have in the program\u2019s absence, and officials from  another large bank said BEA awards have allowed their bank to provide  loans on more favorable terms. However, the officials said that other  factors, such as CRA compliance and loan profitability, also influence their  community development lending decisions. Further, officials from both  banks said their banks would continue community development lending in  the BEA program\u2019s absence, although officials from one bank said their  bank would continue such lending to a lesser extent. Therefore, we  continue to believe that the BEA program likely does not have a significant  impact on large banks\u2019 overall investment and lending decisions, although  there may be an incremental impact.", "GAO\u2019s discussion of the now-prohibited practice of deposit swapping  was based on outdated information, as Treasury moved to prohibit this  practice four years ago. Treasury said it did not understand why we chose  to include a discussion of deposit swapping in a report on the BEA  program\u2019s current status. In response to this comment, we assert that our  report sought to assess the BEA program\u2019s impact on bank behavior over  time, rather than at a single point in time. Thus, we believe that our  discussion of deposit swapping, which focuses on bank behavior in  response to incentives that the BEA program provided until 2003, is  appropriate. We note that deposit swapping provides evidence that, until  2003, the BEA program\u2019s impact in encouraging some banks to make  productive investments and loans in distressed communities likely was not  significant. We also note that funding for the BEA program, and bank  participation in it, were highest prior to 2003 when Treasury prohibited  deposit swapping, adding significance to the issue of deposit swapping and  its connection to bank behavior.", "GAO\u2019s report failed to mention other important program benefits. In  support of this statement, Treasury cites its 2002 survey in which 19  percent of respondents indicated that the prospect of receiving a BEA  award prompted them to launch innovate financial products, services, or  educational programs to meet the needs of underserved households or  communities. In response to this comment, we revised our report to  reflect this survey finding. Treasury also stated that it would have been  useful if our report studied the underlying data from the consortium of  CDFIs to, among other things, determine the BEA program\u2019s impact in  initiating productive relationships between banks and CDFIs. Our draft  report stated that a benefit of the BEA program is that it encourages  partnerships between banks and CDFIs. However, it was not possible to  determine from the CDFI consortium data we reviewed whether the loan  funds cited in the reports formed partnerships with banks participating in  the BEA program. For example, the consortium reports did not  specifically identify the loan funds and banks that were surveyed for  inclusion in the reports. Therefore, based on information in the reports,  we were unable to conduct the types of analyses Treasury proposes in its  comments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury and  other interested congressional committees.

We also interviewed three  trade associations representing various segments of the CDFI industry to  obtain their views on the BEA program. Further, we interviewed a  nonprobability sample of nine BEA award recipients and five CDFI  beneficiaries from the fiscal year 2005 round of BEA awards. We selected  these award recipients and CDFI beneficiaries for interviews based on a  range of characteristics, including differing bank asset sizes, frequency of  program participation, status as a traditional bank or certified community  development bank, and CDFI type.

We also  compared the BEA program\u2019s internal controls to GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. To further assess the  program\u2019s internal controls, we reviewed application documents for two  banks that each received multiple BEA awards from 2000 through 2005  and used Treasury\u2019s online geocoding system to determine the locations of  properties contained in the 2004 and 2005 applications for the two banks.
