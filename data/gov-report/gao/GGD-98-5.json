In addition, we found that an estimated $11.4 billion in reported losses resulted from transactions in such products from April 1987 through March 1997\u2014about $3.2 billion of which involved end-user concerns about dealer sales practices. Federal financial market regulators have an interest in these markets as a part of their responsibilities for ensuring the soundness of regulated financial institutions and maintaining the efficiency and stability of U.S. financial markets.

OTC derivatives are customized to satisfy specific end-user requirements that cannot always be met by the typically more standardized exchange-traded derivatives, which include futures and optionscontracts. Although the economic terms of OTC derivatives are privately negotiated, counterparties commonly elect to use standardized contract language contained in master agreements, such as those developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).", "Both OTC and exchange-traded derivatives are used by firms around the world to manage market risk by transferring it from entities less willing or able to manage it to those more willing and able to do so. In transferring this risk, OTC derivatives counterparties, unlike their U.S. exchange-traded counterparts, typically remain subject to credit risk\u2014the risk of counterparty default. Derivatives can be more cost-effective for market participants than transactions in the underlying cash markets because of the reduced transaction costs and the leverage that derivatives provide. These benefits do not come without risk because using OTC derivatives, similar to using other financial products, can result in losses from adverse market movements, credit defaults, or operations errors.", "As discussed in the following sections, the basic types of OTC derivatives are forwards, options, and swaps.

The calculation of these payments is based on an agreed-upon amount, called the notional amount, that generally is exchanged only in currency swaps. The periodic payments may be a fixed or floating (variable) amount.

Also, the price at which dealers are willing to enter into plain vanilla derivatives\u2014the bid-ask spread\u2014tends to be narrow. Furthermore, large transactions can be executed through one dealer at a single price. Therefore, through the availability of dealers, liquidity is provided for plain vanilla OTC derivatives.

Their values may be based on, or derived from, more than one underlying asset, reference rate, or index. An example of a more complex OTC derivative is a \u201crainbow call option,\u201d whose value is based on the highest 1-year yield available from among four underlyings\u2014cash, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond, and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. Unlike plain vanilla interest rate swaps in which the notional amount remains constant to maturity, this amount may change during the life of more complex swaps. Some OTC derivatives may be complex because they contain, or have embedded in them, other derivatives\u2014for example, a swap with an embedded option that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the swap contract at some future time. Complex OTC derivatives may have other features, such as a multiplier that magnifies the effect of a price movement in the underlying.", "In contrast to plain vanilla OTC derivatives, more complex OTC derivatives are offered by fewer dealers, or they may even be the creation, or proprietary product, of one dealer. Fewer dealers means less liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads, making it more difficult to offset or unwind an earlier transaction at a favorable price. Also, an end-user may find it difficult to independently determine the price or value of a complex OTC derivative that has very complicated terms or that is the proprietary product of one dealer. End-users may attempt to determine the market price of OTC derivatives on the basis of a model. However, the resulting price may not correspond closely to what would actually occur in the marketplace, assuming a buyer or seller could be found. The large fees that some more complex OTC derivatives transactions generate are an economic incentive for dealers to develop new products and refine existing products developed by other dealers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Mortgage-Backed Securities", "paragraphs": ["MBS are debt securities that are created from residential mortgages. They are backed (collateralized) by pools (groups) of mortgages, most of which are 30-year obligations. The process of pooling mortgages and using them to back a new issue of securities is called securitization. Investors in MBS are entitled to receive a portion of the interest and principal payments generated by the mortgage pool. MBS provide funds to the mortgage market by enabling mortgage lenders to sell the mortgages that they originate, thereby replenishing their funds for additional mortgage lending. MBS effectively expand funds available for housing by attracting investors in mortgage loans.", "MBS consist of mortgage pass-through securities (also called mortgage-backed certificates) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO). Mortgage pass-through securities entitle investors to share on a pro rata basis in all principal and interest payments received from the mortgage pool. CMOs, which are a form of multiple-class securities, entitle investors to share in principal and interest payments in accordance with a payment schedule. The payment schedule may divide the mortgage pool into classes, called tranches, and specify the order in which the tranches are to receive principal and interest payments. CMO tranches receiving the earliest payments, by design, contain less risk than is found in simple mortgage pass-through securities. However, the creation of these relatively safe and stable tranches requires the creation of more risky tranches that can be highly volatile in price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structured Notes", "paragraphs": ["Structured notes are debt securities that combine elements of traditional debt instruments and OTC derivatives. Interest payments for traditional debt instruments are generally either a stated fixed amount or a variable amount that is based on fluctuations in a specified interest rate. In contrast, the interest and/or principal payments for structured notes may be linked to two or more specified interest or currency rates, or to equity or commodity prices. Structured notes may contain precise formulas describing how these payments are tied to such rates and prices and how they are to be computed. For example, a more complex type of structured note, the inverse floater (also called an inverse floating rate note) pays investors a rate of interest that moves in the opposite direction of a specific market interest rate. Because its value tends to move in the opposite direction of other debt instruments, the inverse floating rate is often used for hedging. Inverse floating rate notes typically contain options that effectively set maximum and minimum rates that will be paid to holders.", "Structured notes may also have OTC derivatives embedded in them, such as forwards, options, and swaps. By combining debt and OTC derivatives into a single product, structured notes can provide a more efficient and economic means of managing certain risks than debt and OTC derivatives as separate products. For example, a company can, by purchasing a structured note, limit its credit risk to one party (the issuer) and limit its risk management costs to one product.", "Structured notes can be attractive both to investors and issuers. They can be customized to meet investors\u2019 preferences for risk and return. Such customization, which is hard to replicate with traditional debt securities, can be attractive to investors seeking to hedge their unique risks or possibly earn greater returns than those offered by traditional debt securities. The customization is not needed by issuers but is offered to attract investors. Structured notes can be attractive to issuers seeking to lower their cost of capital through access to cheaper financing sources. However, the customized features, though attractive to investors, can contain rate and price risks that are unwanted by the issuer. To offset such unwanted risks, issuers can enter into swaps or options with dealers at the time of issuance. Structured notes are generally of high credit quality because most are issued by highly rated (AAA/Aaa or AA/Aa)corporations or government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) and, therefore, are considered by market participants to have minimal credit risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OTC Derivatives, MBS, and Structured Note Markets\u2019 Growth and Participants\u2019 Activities", "paragraphs": ["Growth in the OTC derivatives market has continued since 1993 because of the popularity of plain vanilla products, which continue to dominate the market relative to more complex products.

Often, individual underwriters join with other underwriters and form underwriting groups, or syndicates, to handle a new issue. As underwriters, these firms agree to offer the securities of the issuer to other investors in two different ways. One way that underwriters agree to issue securities is on a \u201cfirm commitment\u201d basis, whereby the underwriting firm agrees to accept all of the issued securities from the issuing entity. If all of the securities are not sold to other dealers or investors, the firms underwriting the issue will own the unsold portion of the issuance.

Regulated broker-dealers market OTC derivatives. In addition, the affiliates of some securities firms actively market nonsecurities OTC derivatives, with the affiliates of six of the largest firms being the most active. Insurance company affiliates are also somewhat active, with three affiliates actively marketing nonsecurities OTC derivatives in volumes comparable to that of some of the securities firm affiliates. Together, these dealers conduct thousands of OTC derivatives transactions annually.

For example, in discussing potential transactions, dealers may attempt to determine whether a particular product is appropriate or suitable for the end-user by considering several factors, such as the product\u2019s complexity relative to the end-user\u2019s sophistication as well as the end-user\u2019s risk management needs or investment objectives. Dealers may also make disclosures about the product\u2019s benefits and risks, such as how the product\u2019s value may be favorably or adversely affected by changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates. This information is sometimes provided to an end-user as part of a \u201cterm sheet\u201d that outlines the relevant terms of the transaction, including price, quantity, and maturity dates, and that may also be included as a part of the confirmation materials that document the transaction.", "Another aspect of marketing these products is the establishment of the transaction price. The transaction price is usually negotiated between the dealer and the end-user and can be influenced by market conditions and other factors, including whether the end-user has other business transactions with the dealer, such as loans or securities underwriting. After a transaction is entered into, the dealer may be asked to periodically assist the end-user in determining the current value of the product. End-users are less likely to need such assistance for plain vanilla OTC derivatives that have readily available dealer price quotes or for certain MBS products that have an active secondary market. Dealers may also be asked to unwind an OTC derivatives contract, and this may require one party to pay the other an amount representing any change in the contract\u2019s market value.", "The nature of the relationship and expectations between dealers and end-users can vary, depending on the product involved. OTC derivatives transactions create obligations between counterparties that continue over the life of the contracts, and thus involve counterparty credit risk. Because of counterparty credit risk, dealers and end-users of OTC derivatives usually seek to enter into transactions with credit-worthy counterparties. Such creditworthiness concerns are important because the counterparties to a swap, for example, are obligated to exchange periodic payments over the life of the contract. Therefore, until the contract matures, each party is at risk that the other may not fully meet its obligations. In contrast, some securities transactions, including those in MBS and structured notes, involve a change in ownership, and thus no additional obligations would exist between the dealer and end-user."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Regulators Oversee the Dealers Marketing OTC Derivatives, MBS, and Structured Notes", "paragraphs": ["The dealers of OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes may be subject to oversight by various federal or other regulatory bodies. Bank dealers are generally overseen by either the Federal Reserve System, which oversees the bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are its members, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which oversees nationally chartered banks. Of the 10 largest bank OTC derivatives dealers as of 1996, 3 are overseen by the Federal Reserve and 7 are overseen by OCC. In addition, many banks have established separate legal entities to conduct securities activities, including marketing MBS and structured notes, and these entities are also subject to oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Banks can also conduct limited securities activities\u2014primarily in securities issued by the U.S. government, GSEs, or certain state or local governments\u2014from the banking entity itself.", "As previously noted, the activities of dealers marketing OTC derivatives that are securities as well as those marketing MBS and structured notes are overseen by SEC. The activities of dealers marketing OTC derivatives that are determined to be futures are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) oversight. Firms that market securities must do so from an entity registered with SEC and subject to various regulations, such as regulations requiring minimum levels of capital. In addition, firms offering futures and commodity options to the public must register with CFTC and comply with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and regulations promulgated under the act, unless otherwise exempted.", "Registered securities and futures firms are also required to join and subject themselves to the rules and requirements of a self-regulatory organization (SRO). Such SROs also impose sales practice-related requirements on their members. Most OTC derivatives are not considered to be securities or futures by the dealers offering them. Nonsecurities and nonfutures activities may be conducted in a subsidiary separate from the regulated entity. Consequently, securities and futures firms typically conduct their nonsecurities and nonfutures OTC derivatives activities outside of their registered entities in affiliates that are not subject to SEC or CFTC regulation. CFTC has also exempted swaps and certain other OTC derivatives from the requirement that such activities be conducted in an affiliate subject to its regulation, but CFTC has retained the authority to take action against fraudulent conduct involving exempted products that are futures.

In contrast to OTC derivatives, MBS and structured notes are typically securities; therefore, their sale is subject to the federal securities laws, except when exempted from specific provisions.", "The sales practice requirements that a dealer must follow when marketing OTC derivatives in the United States also vary, depending on which regulator, if any, oversees its activities. If the dealer is a bank, all of its activities are subject to oversight by one of the federal regulatory agencies responsible for ensuring that banks are appropriately managing their risks. Unlike the requirements applicable to securities, which are intended to protect investors, the requirements placed on banks marketing OTC derivatives are intended primarily to limit the risk that such activities pose to a bank. Securities and futures firms, as well as insurance companies, that offer nonsecurities and nonfutures OTC derivatives typically do so from affiliates that are not subject to direct regulatory oversight.However, should SEC or CFTC determine that a specific OTC derivatives transaction is a security or a futures contract, the transaction would be subject to the respective regulator\u2019s jurisdiction, absent an agency exemption or a successful court challenge.

SEC officials said that the agency responds, when requested, to dealer inquiries about whether SEC would consider a specific proprietary OTC derivative contract to be a security. In other cases, dealers independently evaluate the characteristics of individual OTC derivative products to determine whether the products meet the definition of a security as defined in the securities laws. However, when dealers conduct activities in products on the basis of their own determination that the product involved is not a security, SEC or a court may later disagree with their determination.

The CEA provides various sales practice-related requirements that must be adhered to by these and other firms offering such products, unless otherwise exempted from such requirements. When establishing accounts, firms are required by SRO rules to obtain certain information pertaining to their customers\u2019 financial condition and trading experience. CFTC generally requires that firms make certain disclosures about the risks of products and provide customers with a standardized risk disclosure document before engaging in transactions. The CEA also prohibits fraudulent conduct, including material misstatements and omissions. CFTC can bring actions against firms for violating the CEA. In addition, the CEA allows futures and options customers to pursue private claims against a firm for fraud, but questions have been raised about the application of the CEA\u2019s fraud provisions to OTC derivatives transactions.", "The extent to which some OTC derivatives are subject to the CEA is uncertain. CFTC\u2019s regulatory framework is focused primarily on the oversight of exchange-traded futures and certain options and of intermediaries engaging in such transactions on behalf of customers. CFTC has issued regulations that allow trade options on commodities, except on certain enumerated domestic agricultural commodities, to be traded off-exchange. Forwards and certain OTC foreign-currency transactions are excluded from regulation under the CEA, including its antifraud provisions. In 1992, Congress granted CFTC the authority to exempt certain OTC derivatives, including swaps, from almost all of the CEA\u2019s provisions.Without determining that swaps were futures, CFTC issued a rule that exempted eligible swaps from all but the CEA\u2019s antifraud and antimanipulation provisions.

These claims, which are typically advanced in suits against dealers, are either tort or contract based. Although similar in certain respects, tort claims are based upon the existence of a special relationship that creates a duty owed by the dealer to the end-user, while contract claims are based upon the contractual relationship between the dealer and end-user. Tort-based claims that are typically asserted by end-users include claims of fraud and fraudulent concealment against dealers. End-users may also assert a claim of breach of fiduciary duty. For such claims, a derivatives dealer may have a duty to disclose material information to an end-user if the court finds that an explicit or de facto fiduciary relationship exists. End-users may also assert a claim that the dealer\u2019s alleged misstatements or omissions constitute a negligent misrepresentation. In addition, other state law claims may be asserted. For example, under New York law, the judge in the Procter & Gamble case found that an implied contractual duty to disclose in business negotiations exists when one party has superior knowledge not known to the other and the party with superior knowledge knows that the other party is acting on the basis of mistaken knowledge.

For example, an end-user may advance a contract-based claim for rescission due to misrepresentation. This claim would restore the parties to the positions they held before they entered into the contract. If the end-user is a governmental entity, it may assert an ultra vires claim. To support this claim, the end-user may argue that the transaction at issue is unenforceable because it violates a provision in its charter. An end-user may also claim that the contract is voidable because the end-user was a victim of economic duress and, therefore, did not enter into the contract of its own free will. Finally, an end-user may assert that the contract is unenforceable under the applicable statute of frauds. Although the specifics may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the statute of frauds generally states that contracts in excess of a certain dollar amount that cannot be performed within 1 year are unenforceable unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the contract is being enforced.

According to the interpretation, banks should also determine whether proposed transactions are consistent with counterparties\u2019 policies and procedures, as these are known to them. Specifically, banks should understand the risks that counterparties are trying to manage or assume through the use of derivative products.

If a bank determines that its counterparty is unsophisticated, either generally or with respect to a specific transaction, the guidance directs it to educate the counterparty about the risks associated with the proposed transaction. Furthermore, the guidance provides that when a bank recommends a derivatives transaction to an unsophisticated counterparty, it should ensure that it has adequate information about the counterparty on which to base its recommendation. In the guidance issued to examiners, the Federal Reserve indicates that banks should have established standards for complex products to ensure that counterparties are not entering into transactions where they fail to understand the risks.

The requirements banks are to follow when marketing such products are designed to reduce their exposure to risk of loss from end-user default or transaction disputes. Although the Federal Reserve\u2019s guidance places additional sales practice requirements on banks, its guidance also states that end-users are ultimately responsible for their own transactions. Regarding OCC\u2019s guidance, a senior OCC official explained that it does not task banks with determining the suitability of OTC derivatives transactions for their customers, but the guidance is meant to ensure that the activities are being conducted in a safe and sound manner. According to the official, a suitability rule would represent a fundamental change in the relationship between a bank and its customers because certain transactions, such as loans, deposits, and letters of credit, are entered into on a principal-to-principal basis.

For example, an official at a mutual fund told us that dealer staff often provided written materials on how product use could be beneficial, but the dealer staff could not always answer questions about how the value of the products would change as interest rates changed. An insurance company official wrote on the survey form that his firm\u2019s dissatisfaction rating reflected experiences with some of the smaller dealers that contacted the firm. The official believed that the larger dealers generally did a good job of explaining the merits and risks of products.", "According to our survey results for another individual sales practice element that we asked questionnaire recipients to rate, organizations were not always satisfied with the suitability of the products dealers proposed, and this dissatisfaction was again more significant for dealers they did not use.

For example, an official at a money market mutual fund said that, although such funds should maintain fixed net asset values, many of the transactions dealers proposed to his organization were for products that could cause large declines in the value of the fund. A credit union official described mixed experiences. He said some dealers seemed interested in selling a product regardless of the credit union\u2019s needs and requirements, but others were more willing to describe products and attempt to understand the organization\u2019s needs. Officials of at least three organizations were concerned that dealers were marketing GSE-issued structured notes by portraying them as safe, government-backed investments, even though the values of such products could be quite volatile.", "Although some organizations were concerned about the suitability of products that dealers offered, other organizations generally welcomed receiving proposals even if the product was not currently appropriate or suitable for them. For example, officials at a hardware products manufacturer that exported worldwide explained that their firm used OTC derivatives for managing its foreign currency exposures and for altering the mix of fixed and floating interest rate obligations used to finance its operations. Although the firm had specific guidelines related to its use of these products, it was still interested in hearing ideas that could lead to alternative ways of meeting its needs.

These funds had been invested in some of the most volatile CMO tranches. Some of the fund investors sued Askin Capital Management and at least three large securities firms that sold Askin the volatile products. The investors alleged that Askin promised them high returns without large risks, but instead purchased high risk securities.

An institution acting as a fiduciary to an end-user, whether established by law or fact, must act in good faith and with loyalty and honesty towards the end-user and disclose to the end-user all material facts relevant to actions it takes within the context of the fiduciary relationship. In one lawsuit, Procter & Gamble accused Bankers Trust of misusing the trust and confidence it had placed in the bank by inducing the firm to enter into swaps that were represented as being safe investments, when instead the transactions entailed considerable undisclosed risk. Bankers Trust countered that it acted solely as a principal by dealing with and not on behalf of Procter & Gamble\u2014that is, by dealing with the firm on an arm\u2019s-length basis. The bank also indicated that Procter & Gamble, as with other counterparties, was responsible for making its own assessment of the likely rewards and risks of the transactions, although the bank contended that it had responded to any questions posed and had provided reasonable and accurate information.

The lawsuit brought against various large securities firms over their dealings in MBS with Askin Capital (see discussion in ch. 3) also alleged that the dealers had breached their fiduciary responsibilities and failed to act in the interests of Askin\u2019s investors. In January 1997, the judge in this case reduced the counts against these firms to those pertaining to fraud, according to press accounts.", "As these cases indicate, determining whether a formal fiduciary relationship exists can be difficult. In some instances, fiduciary duties are clearly placed on a financial institution by law when the institution agrees to act as an agent in performing certain services. Such fiduciary duties arise, for example, when a bank\u2019s trust department manages the assets of an estate or when an investment advisor manages the investments of a pension fund. In other instances, courts have found fiduciary duties applied to a financial institution that had not formally agreed to provide fiduciary services, but whose past relationship with a customer showed a pattern of reliance by the customer on the institution\u2019s advice. The factors that courts have considered to establish such a pattern of reliance include the extent to which a customer followed the institution\u2019s recommendations, statements by the customer indicating reliance or dependence on the institution, and the customer\u2019s general level of sophistication. Generally, courts have ruled that the larger and more sophisticated the customer, the greater its responsibility to independently assess the value and risks of a transaction and the lesser the dealer\u2019s responsibility to determine the suitability of a security and to fully disclose product risks and valuations. No specific standards distinguish between sophisticated and unsophisticated customers or degrees of sophistication.", "Even when no special relationship exists between a financial institution and an end-user, the institution may have an obligation to disclose to the end-user information regarding a transaction about which it has superior knowledge. Under principles defining common law fraud, superior knowledge or access to the means of knowledge can give rise to an affirmative duty to disclose material information, particularly when the information is not within reasonable reach of the other party. Applying this principle to the securities markets, federal courts have held that securities firms have a special duty not to take advantage of customers\u2019 lack of knowledge and, therefore, firms must disclose certain material information\u2014such as the amount of the markup they are charging\u2014even when executing a transaction on a principal-to-principal basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Potential for Additional Disputes Arises From the Differing Views of End-Users and Dealers", "paragraphs": ["Differences between end-users and dealers in the way they view their responsibilities in transactions involving OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes indicate that costly disputes may continue to accompany end-user losses.

On the basis of responses to our survey, we estimated that 53 percent of end-users believed dealers had a fiduciary relationship in some or all transactions involving plain vanilla OTC derivatives, and that 48 percent attributed such responsibilities to dealers in some or all transactions involving more complex OTC derivatives, as shown in figure 4.1.", "To better understand survey responses indicating that a fiduciary relationship existed, we reviewed comments on returned questionnaires and conducted follow-up telephone interviews with 50 judgmentally selected respondents, including those that were both satisfied and dissatisfied with dealer sales practices. In explaining their response that a fiduciary relationship existed, most end-users told us that this meant dealers had a duty to disclose adequate information about the products and their risks. Many end-users also commented that dealers should be truthful and provide accurate information. In addition, some end-users indicated that dealers should generally have the end-users\u2019 best interests in mind. For example, an official at a GSE that used OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes told us that, although a legal fiduciary relationship did not exist, his organization expected dealers to be open and forthcoming with information, and that this expectation creates responsibilities for dealers similar to those of a fiduciary.", "The percentage of end-users that believed fiduciary relationships existed as part of transactions in these products was generally similar across OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes. As discussed in chapter 1, no specific federal sales practice requirements apply to OTC derivatives that are not securities or subject to the CEA antifraud provisions. However, MBS and structured notes are subject to the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, which require dealers to disclose risks and assess the suitability of transactions involving such products for end-users. Because the percentages of end-users indicating that a fiduciary relationship existed for transactions involving OTC derivatives were not significantly different from the percentages for securities products, it does not appear that the different requirements afforded these products greatly influenced the degree of responsibility that end-users placed on dealers.", "However, our analysis of survey responses revealed some differences by type of industry. Officials of state and local governments were more likely than those from most other organizations to report believing that a fiduciary relationship existed in some or all transactions involving OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes. In contrast, GSEs were significantly less likely than organizations in some other industries to report that such a relationship existed between them and their dealers. Because of the small number of respondents within some industry groups, statistically valid comparisons between most industries could not be made.

The first set of guidance, the Framework for Voluntary Oversight (the Framework), was issued by the Derivatives Policy Group in March 1995. This group consists of six securities firms whose affiliates did approximately 90 percent of all U.S. securities firm-related business in nonsecurities OTC derivatives. The Framework was issued in response to concerns by Congress and others that the nonsecurities OTC derivatives activities of these firms were conducted in affiliates not subject to any direct U.S. regulation. The Framework contains procedures the participating firms have agreed to voluntarily follow in four major areas related to OTC derivatives, including counterparty relationships, which address dealer sales practices. Specifically, the counterparty relationships section consists of guidelines for professional intermediaries to follow in dealing with nonprofessional counterparties. Currently, the Framework applies only to the six firms and only to their nonsecurities OTC derivatives activities.", "In August 1995, six financial industry groups, in coordination with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, released the Principles and Practices for Wholesale Financial Market Transactions (the Principles). The purpose of the Principles is to define the relationship between institutional participants and to set out sound practices to be followed as part of transactions in OTC financial products, including OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes. This guidance does not purport to apply to transactions involving retail customers. The Principles resulted from an invitation by a senior official at the New York Federal Reserve Bank to representatives of the six groups to develop a code of conduct for U.S. financial markets. In contrast to the Framework, the Principles was promoted for use by all institutional market participants and does not make distinctions in its recommended practices on the basis of any differences in the professional or nonprofessional nature of the parties to a transaction.", "Although differences between the two sets of dealer-issued guidance exist, we did not find these differences to be material. One of the members of the Principles drafting committee, whose firm also served on the committee that developed the Framework, reached the same general conclusion. At an April 5, 1995, public meeting at which the Principles drafting committee discussed the provisions of Principles, he stated that the spirit of the two documents is the same and that it would be unfair to contrast them simply because they use different language in some sections.", "Overall, we found that the two sets of dealer-issued guidance advocate a similar approach to counterparty relationships. Both assert that the relationship between counterparties\u2014unless otherwise agreed to by the parties or provided by law\u2014is arm\u2019s length with neither party relying on the other, even if information is exchanged. Also, neither set of guidance requires risk disclosure on specific transactions by either party, although each states that the parties should consider exchanging such information when the transaction is more complex or involves leverage. The summary introducing the Framework also indicates that the six participating firms have agreed to provide a generic risk disclosure document to new counterparties. In addition, both sets of guidance recommend similar procedures for exchanging pricing information and controlling and supervising personnel. Furthermore, both state that they are not intended to create legally enforceable obligations; however, courts could find the guidance useful in evaluating counterparty relationships and defining counterparties\u2019 respective common law responsibilities. Table 4.1 compares the major sales practice provisions of the two sets of guidance.", "As a part of stating that neither counterparty should rely on the other, both the Framework and the Principles advocate that each party should be capable of independently analyzing prospective transactions. This expectation is generally consistent with existing risk management guidance, such as that issued by the Group of Thirty and others, for entities engaging in transactions in OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes. This other risk management guidance typically recommends that such entities have adequate risk management systems in place, including the ability to measure and control the risks associated with using these products. The Framework and the Principles echo this advice by maintaining that each party is responsible for assessing the risks of a transaction and its own risk tolerance or capability for managing such risks. While stating that the relationship between parties is arm\u2019s length, both sets of guidance advocate that parties clarify their relationship or obligations in writing. For example, the Principles states that any changes in the assumed relationship from one of arm\u2019s length should be agreed to in writing.", "Although the two sets of dealer guidance indicate that entities wishing to adhere to them should implement certain practices or controls, neither establishes any minimum responsibility for disclosing the risks of specific transactions\u2014although this is an area where problems and disputes have arisen. Nonetheless, when such information is shared, both sets of guidance offer advice on the types of disclosure that could be made and provide suggestions for making certain kinds of disclosures. For example, both discuss providing scenario analyses that are not misleading and that adequately explain any assumptions made.", "Both sets of guidance also indicate that all dealings should be conducted fairly and accurately. For example, the Framework states that dealers should conduct their OTC derivatives activities honestly, in good faith, and in a manner consistent with the promotion of public confidence in the integrity of the markets. It also indicates that all materials should be accurate and reasonable and that professional intermediaries \u201cshould consider including legends with those materials that identify various assumptions underlying the analyses presented, describe market factors that may affect the analysis, and/or inform the party receiving the materials that a variety of assumptions and market factors may affect the analysis.\u201d Similarly, the Principles indicates that \u201ca Participant should act honestly and in good faith when marketing, entering into, executing and administering Transactions.\u201d It subsequently indicates that any communications between the parties, either oral or written, should be accurate and not intentionally misleading. The Framework and the Principles also urge that any assumptions used in scenario analyses be reasonable and that the unique market terminology and conventions of particular transactions not be used in a misleading way.", "The Framework and the Principles also note that participants must be mindful of the potential for transactions to result in disputes as well as to expose them to compliance risk\u2014the risk of loss from counterparty or shareholder lawsuits, regulatory fines, and voided contracts\u2014and reputation risk\u2014the risk of loss from reduced revenues and firm value. Both sets of dealer guidance acknowledge that certain transactions pose greater levels of these risks, such as when the transaction is more complex or involves leverage, or when the counterparty lacks sophistication or the capability to independently analyze the transaction. In such cases, both indicate that participants may wish to increase the amount of information they exchange, involve additional internal personnel or external advisors in negotiating the transactions, or take other steps, including avoiding the transaction. Both sets of guidance also advocate that counterparties establish policies and procedures to assess and mitigate the extent to which these transactions create compliance and reputation risks for each party, such as when counterparties appear to believe that the dealer has assumed an advisory role."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Dealer-Issued Guidance Differs in Some, but Not All, Respects From Regulatory Standards Applicable to Other Activities", "paragraphs": ["To identify any significant differences between the dealer-issued voluntary guidance and other existing sales practice standards, we compared the major tenets of the dealer guidance to the approaches embodied in bank supervisory guidance, a foreign code of conduct, and U.S. commodities and securities laws.

Similar to the dealer-issued guidance, OCC and Federal Reserve guidance each indicates that bank counterparties are ultimately responsible for ensuring the appropriateness of transactions with bank dealers. Similar to the dealer-issued guidance, OCC guidance does not specifically require risk disclosure on individual transactions. The Federal Reserve guidance appears to require risk disclosure as it expects banks, if they determine that a counterparty is unsophisticated, to take steps to ensure that the counterparty is made aware of transaction risks. The goal of bank supervisory guidance as it relates to OTC derivatives is to promote the safety and soundness of regulated institutions; it is not specifically intended to protect those who engage in financial transactions with these institutions.", "The expectations for dealers set out in the dealer-issued guidance are also similar in some, but not all, respects to the requirements applicable to futures trading in the United States. Similar to the dealer guidance, U.S. commodities laws do not require entities marketing futures and exchange-traded options to determine whether such products are suitable for their customers. However, in contrast to the Principles, U.S. commodities laws require that the customer be apprised of the significant risks of buying and selling these products, including disclosing that the prices of futures and options can be volatile and that the customer may incur losses that are larger than the amount originally invested.", "The dealer-issued guidance is most similar to regulatory requirements issued in one of the major foreign markets for OTC derivatives and foreign exchange. In July 1995, the Bank of England issued an update to The London Code of Conduct, which was developed in conjunction with U.K. market participants. Similar to the U.S. dealer-issued guidance, the U.K. code establishes that the nature of the relationship for products in institutional markets involves transactions between principals, with end-users assumed to be capable of independently evaluating the transaction. In addition, the U.K. code states that if the end-user wishes to retain the other party as an adviser, it should do so in writing. Just as with the U.S. dealer-issued guidance, the U.K. code also states that participants share an interest in maintaining high standards of business conduct and fair dealing. However, whereas compliance with the U.S. dealer-issued guidance is voluntary, compliance with the U.K. code is mandatory. The code indicates that the U.K. central bank\u2014the Bank of England\u2014will view breaches of its provisions seriously, will investigate complaints, and may employ a range of sanctions against violators.", "The responsibilities envisioned by the dealer-issued guidance contrast most with the SEC requirements imposed on dealers marketing securities in the United States. Although the Framework and the Principles do not supersede existing regulatory requirements, they vary in several major respects from U.S. securities law requirements. Whereas the dealer-issued guidance asserts that an arm\u2019s-length relationship exists between counterparties, dealers marketing securities are expected to ensure that transactions they recommend are suitable, given the investment objectives, financial condition, and sophistication of the end-user. Disclosure of transaction risk, which the dealer-issued guidance makes optional for specific transactions, is generally expected as part of securities transactions.", "The differences between the dealer-issued guidance and U.S. securities laws may stem, in part, from differences in the types of entities to which each applies. The dealer-issued guidance addresses transactions between participants who tend to be large financial and commercial entities and tend to be financially sophisticated. In addition, the dealer-issued guidance does not apply to individual investors. In contrast, the antifraud provisions of the U.S. securities laws apply equally to all investors and do not distinguish between institutional and individual end-users.

In contrast, representatives of dealers and certain other organizations have supported the guidance.", "Although public comments were not sought on the Framework, the drafting committee of the Principles solicited comments before finalizing the guidance. We analyzed the comment letters to identify the views of end-users and others on the specific tenets of the dealer-issued guidance, many of which were common to both the Principals and the Framework. Of the 21 organizations that commented, we spoke with 9 that provided substantive criticisms of the Principles. These nine organizations told us that their primary criticisms had not been addressed in the final version of this guidance.", "One of the primary objections raised by commenting organizations was that the dealer-issued guidance inappropriately assumes that an arm\u2019s-length relationship should prevail for all transactions. Those citing this issue argued that the dealer guidance thus imposes a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model on end-users despite their varying levels of financial sophistication. For example, in their joint comments on the final draft of the Principles, three associations representing governmental entities stated that because the guidance uses the term \u201cparticipant\u201d to refer to both dealers and end-users, no distinction is made between their respective roles and responsibilities. As a result, they believe that the value of most of the document is negated. Additionally, the associations stated that end-users are a diverse group and that assuming they all have equivalent levels of expertise, responsibility, and access to information is erroneous.", "Another criticism has been that the Principles may reduce end-users\u2019 legal protections. In a May 3, 1996, letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, EUDA noted that Bankers Trust offered the Principles as documentation of common practices for OTC derivatives transactions in support of its litigation with Procter & Gamble. EUDA indicated that Bankers Trust\u2019s action affirmed the association\u2019s original concerns that the Principles would be used by dealers to reduce the legal protections afforded end-users. EUDA characterized the Principles as \u201cessentially a unilateral effort on the part of the dealer community to shift responsibilities from the dealers to end-users and to buttress the position of the dealers in pending and possible future litigation.\u201d Some have argued that adherence to the dealer guidance may negatively affect the ability of end-users to claim reliance on dealer representations. GFOA, NASACT, and NAST stated in a joint issuance to their members that they might inadvertently waive existing legal rights if they agreed to be bound by the Principles without careful prior review. In their letter commenting on the draft of the Principles, these organizations also indicated that the attempt by the guidance to preclude reliance on a dealer was not realistic because potential investors should be able to, and often do, rely on representations made by dealers about products. However, the organizations stated that the guidance would require written acknowledgement by the dealer before any such reliance could occur.", "Some of the commenting organizations also objected to the guidance because it does not place any responsibilities on dealers to disclose transaction risks or valuations. For example, in its November 1995 newsletter, EUDA stated that the Principles drafting committee had \u201cphilosophically rejected the idea that dealers should have any affirmative obligation to disclose material risks of OTC derivative transactions to end-users, irrespective of the complexity or novelty of the transactions.\u201d Later in that newsletter, EUDA stated that \u201cthe final Principles make it clear that a dealer is not obligated to provide periodic valuations to its end-user counterparty, regardless of whether the instrument sold is a proprietary product of the dealer for which market valuations are neither publicly available nor readily ascertainable.\u201d The associations representing governments stated that the guidance should recognize a dealer\u2019s affirmative obligation to provide information material to a transaction instead of requiring an end-user to request it. They believe that failing to do so inappropriately assumes that both sides have equal information. They also objected to the Principles\u2019 assumption that any additional transaction information, if not specifically requested, is considered unnecessary.", "In commenting on the Principles, various associations representing governmental entities stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s agreement with Bankers Trust would be a better model for disclosing risk and ensuring that end-users understand transactions. Such a model would require dealers to (1) provide every counterparty with information about the material terms and risks of any applicable proposed transactions, (2) ensure that every counterparty could understand such terms and risks, and (3) ensure that the means by which product prices and values are determined are reasonably clear to counterparties. Dealers would also be required to meet specific disclosure obligations for proposed transactions.", "Another criticism of the guidance was that end-users were insufficiently involved in their development. For example, the Department of Labor stated in its comment letter on the draft Principles that \u201centities which had no involvement in the creation of the Principles, had not agreed to adhere to the Principles, or may not even have known of its existence could be viewed as subject to the Principles.\u201d The agency also stated that the Principles should only apply to entities that subscribe to them in writing. According to EUDA, \u201cthe process followed in developing the Principles and Practices was fundamentally flawed\u201d because representatives of the end-user community were excluded from the Principles Drafting Committee. The treasurer of a major utility, who is an EUDA board member, was quoted in an industry publication as stating that \u201cthis is probably the only area in the finance world where a group of dealers have shaped both the products and all of the surrounding rules and regulations, with no input from those who are not dealers.\u201d", "Finally, in a May 1995, letter to the Principles drafting committee, GFOA contrasted the Framework with the Principles by stating that the Framework \u201ctakes limited steps in advising professional intermediaries to OTC transactions to disclose information regarding risks, clarify valuation questions, and provide training regarding counterparty relationships.\u201d A GFOA official told us that, although these documents call for largely the same practices, GFOA believed that the Framework was more balanced in tone.", "Representatives of dealers and other organizations have viewed the Principles more positively. A member of the ISDA board told us that the greater use of OTC derivatives has increased the need for dealers to formally explain their products and activities, including the risks associated with product use and the nature of their responsibilities in these transactions. A managing director at a large U.S. securities firm said that he disapproved of end-users who, when faced with losses, decide that they were not fully informed about the transactions. Therefore, he saw the guidance as valuable for describing the customary way the institutional markets work and for clarifying that dealers, unless otherwise agreed to, do not have fiduciary obligations as part of these transactions. An official from the New York Federal Reserve Bank indicated that the Principles provides a sound basis for relationships between parties conducting activities in financial products. He said that it assumes an arm\u2019s-length relationship unless otherwise agreed to and acknowledged that parties can agree to alter this assumption in writing if it does not fit their circumstances. He also stated that the United Kingdom makes the same assumption about the nature of counterparty relationships, and it would be problematic for U.S. practices to be inconsistent with those of other major markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Interests of End-Users and Dealers Conflict When It Comes to Defining Their Relationship", "paragraphs": ["Difficult issues remain to be resolved before the differing interests of end-users and dealers over the nature of their relationship can be reconciled. To date, attempts to address these differences have not been successful. The primary areas of disagreement and uncertainty between end-users and dealers, and among the most difficult to resolve, are the nature of their relationships in transactions involving OTC derivatives that are not securities or futures and whether or not each party can rely on the statements made by the other. Under the securities laws, an implied standard of fair dealing allows end-users to rely on dealer statements and advice about a security. Although both sets of dealer-issued guidance indicate that neither party is presumed to be relying on the other, these documents contain language stating that transactions and communications between parties are expected to be accurate and made in good faith. According to the New York Federal Reserve Bank official who sponsored the development of the Principles, this language means that misstatements are not permissible. An official of a U.S. securities firm that participated in drafting the Principles said that, although neither party has the duty to advise the other about the risks of the transaction, a \u201cbuyer beware\u201d philosophy is not assumed because the Principles calls for honest dealings between the parties.", "Some dealer officials explained that allowing counterparties to view their firms\u2019 statements as investment advice as a part of these transactions can be problematic. They said that to provide investment advice, dealers need to understand the complete financial position of their counterparties; however, end-users are not always willing to provide this information. A managing director at one of the major dealer banks, who also sits on ISDA\u2019s board, told us that OTC derivatives contracts require performance by both parties. As a result, it is not reasonable to hold dealers totally responsible for the actions of the end-user.", "Dealers also explained that the information they provide is not advice, rather it describes and explains the products. Dealers told us that they offer useful products that can meet the needs of end-users seeking to hedge risks or to obtain an investment return. In explaining how they marketed these products, dealers said they take time to learn end-users needs, assess end-users\u2019 current financial condition, and provide end-users education or explanations about products. For example, officials at one U.S. securities firm provided us with a sample of a presentation given to an end-user. The 26-page document included a detailed analysis of the end-user\u2019s exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates.", "However, officials representing end-users and other organizations indicated that when the complexity or other features of some products render their risk characteristics less obvious, then reliance on dealer statements is sometimes necessary. An official working in the treasury of a large end-user commented at an April 1996 conference that, although his firm was financially sophisticated, the effort required to fully analyze the performance of certain complex products was beyond his firm\u2019s capabilities. Therefore, the firm needed to be able to rely on dealer statements about how the products would perform as market rates changed. He said that, although the dealers\u2019 marketing staff who explain complex transactions are willing to allow his firm to rely on their representations, the dealers\u2019 legal staff advised his firm that no such reliance can be made because such firms are seeking to avoid the resulting legal liability. An attorney representing EUDA at a July 1996 forum on these issues said that dealers have superior knowledge about the proprietary products they develop and end-users find replicating the valuations of some products very difficult. During an address to an industry conference, an SEC commissioner said that dealers sometimes are tempted to describe products in sophisticated terms to increase their proprietary value.", "Although comments on a draft of the Principles were solicited in a public session, few meetings between end-user and dealer groups have been held. A representative of GFOA said that members of the Principles drafting committee met with their organization and other governmental end-user associations just before issuing the final draft of that document. A representative from another end-user organization told us that his organization had been approached in early 1996 about working on a committee to revise the Principles, but they had declined to participate at that time because, according to this official, participation was made contingent on endorsing the Principles.

However, dealers and others told us that, if end-users want to rely on the information provided, then it would be considered investment advice and the dealers would have to increase transaction prices or arrange separate compensation to reflect the increased legal risk in providing such advice. A former securities regulatory official said that reconciling the opposing views of the parties will be difficult because neither wants to assume the likely increased costs of the transactions. He noted that dealers, despite providing sometimes voluminous information about a product and its function, do not wish this information to be considered a recommendation or investment advice that can be relied upon because they do not want to assume any related legal liability.

The Chairman testified that dealers in financial transactions sometimes assume a role beyond that of a mere counterparty, such as when they provide advisory services. However, if dealers are required to ensure that an end-user\u2019s use of a product is appropriate, such requirements may serve as a means for end-users to shift a transaction\u2019s risk back to the dealer through legal actions.

The first case, decided in the English Commercial Court in December 1995, was decided in the dealer\u2019s favor. Although a U.K. case, the decision is relevant to U.S. OTC derivatives counterparties because many of their swaps personnel are located in London, and the ISDA master agreement used to document OTC derivatives contracts offers the choice of either New York or U.K. law as the governing jurisdiction for disputes. The case concerned two swaps transactions executed between Bankers Trust and an Indonesian business conglomerate. The Indonesian firm claimed, among other things, that the bank had made fraudulent misrepresentations and had a \u201cduty of care\u201d to fully explain the transactions and their risks. The judge found that Bankers Trust had not made a complete disclosure of the risks as part of these transactions. However, he stated that \u201cthe parties\u2019 respective skill and knowledge in the field is a very relevant, though not by itself, decisive factor.\u201d He also noted that officials at the Indonesian firm had held themselves out as being financially sophisticated and had demonstrated their ability to determine the transaction risks, even though the bank had not fully disclosed them. Therefore, the judge determined that Bankers Trust did not have a duty greater than the duty to present fairly and accurately any facts and matters in the representations it made.", "Another suit\u2014filed in U.S. District Court by Procter & Gamble against Bankers Trust\u2014may have aided in clarifying the responsibilities of dealers in OTC derivatives transactions, but its early settlement has left opinions divided on its implications. Procter & Gamble filed this suit in October 1994, but the two parties settled in May 1996 before the case was presented to a jury. Under the settlement, Bankers Trust agreed to forgive as much as $150 million that Procter & Gamble owed.

The judge would have allowed these three counts to proceed to trial. Bankers Trust had argued that the transactions in question had been conducted at an arm\u2019s length. In the ruling, the judge concluded that Bankers Trust had not been acting for or on behalf of Procter & Gamble as in a typical customer-broker context, but instead the two were principals to a contract and, therefore, no fiduciary duties were imposed.

While speaking at a forum for end-users about the relationship that should prevail between end-users and dealers in institutional market transactions, a New York Federal Reserve Bank official said that activities in these products are important to the economy. Therefore, he said that too much uncertainty is created by leaving these matters to be decided by the courts on the basis of individual case facts and circumstances. Another speaker, an SEC commissioner, called on dealers and end-users to come to common agreement on each party\u2019s responsibilities and duties. He cited the inefficiency of having dealers face potentially large legal liabilities over disputes decided by individual courts on the basis of what is usually a brief interaction between the end-user and dealer. He said that such uncertainty would not be tolerated in other areas of business and should not be tolerated in the markets for these products. Thus, he concluded that clarifying the relationship between end-users and dealers could enhance market efficiency and reduce dealers\u2019 legal liability. Furthermore, he said that having dealers agree on the rules regarding their responsibilities was better than having thousands of end-users attempting to individually negotiate the nature of their relationship with dealers.

End-users and dealers should also discuss when and how scenario analyses should be provided. Coming to such agreement could reduce the number of instances where legal disputes occur. In response to an end-user\u2019s concerns over the need to rely on the information dealers provide about product features and performance, ISDA\u2019s legal counsel agreed that the parties need to discuss these issues with the goal of reaching a consensus.

He emphasized that any consideration of regulation in this area should adhere to the principle that parties to financial transactions are responsible for their own decisions. However, he noted that misrepresentation and fraud could not be tolerated. He also said that, in some cases, end-users may not reasonably be expected to understand the risks involved in certain complex products, and that dealers in financial transactions sometimes act as more than just a counterparty by providing advisory services. According to the Chairman, addressing the situation may require limiting the use of some products to only certain organizations, providing guidance to end-users for investment and risk management, encouraging them to obtain independent advice, or encouraging them to diversify their portfolios.

In general, they explained that the amount and type of information they disclosed about the risks of transactions in OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes varied depending on the complexity of the product. For more complex products, dealers generally indicated that they would provide more detailed descriptions, explanations, and materials about the product\u2019s performance and risks. The firms also indicated that scenario analyses were sometimes provided, particularly for more complex transactions. The dealers explained that the amount of information they provided also varied depending on the sophistication of the end-user.

At least four of the dealers we contacted explicitly stated that they were not responsible for assessing the suitability of OTC derivatives transactions for end-users. However, all of the dealers said that their firms\u2019 policy is to tailor transactions to end-user objectives and sophistication. For example, officials at a major bank and a major securities firm indicated that, although suitability determinations are not legally required for OTC derivatives, their staff are generally protective of their relationships with end-users and would not knowingly enter into transactions that were inappropriate for end-users. However, officials at another major securities firm told us that they would enter into a transaction they believed was inappropriate for an end-user if the end-user insisted on proceeding even after hearing the dealer\u2019s advice against such action. Dealers also generally did not view themselves as acting as fiduciaries in these transactions\u2014most dealers emphasized that the end-users with whom they transacted were generally sophisticated. Officials at one of the large securities firms explained that, as a way of reducing their firm\u2019s exposure to compliance and reputation risks, sales staff are required to be alert to indications that an end-user might be viewing the relationship as one involving fiduciary responsibilities for the firm. Such indications could result from observing that the end-user generally entered into all or most of the transactions the firm proposed, or appeared to be doing so, without independent analysis. In such cases, firm policy was for sales staff to ensure that transactions conformed to the end-user\u2019s objectives and to discuss the situation with other levels of management within the firm.", "Dealers of OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes described having similar controls and supervision processes to oversee their marketing of these products and to reduce the likelihood of sales practice disputes.

The dealers described requiring staff other than the marketing personnel\u2014such as trading supervisors\u2014to review transactions daily as well as at weekly or monthly intervals. At least four firms had relationship managers who acted as central points of contact for the dealers\u2019 activities with individual end-users. In this capacity, such staff were to review the appropriateness of all activity between the dealer and end-users, regardless of which business line within the firm originated the transaction. Furthermore, most of the dealers indicated that their internal audit staff performed reviews of their marketing activities in these products. However, one firm indicated that its internal audit staff had never reviewed these activities.", "Most of the dealers of OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes told us that they had also made at least some changes to their sales practices or oversight activities within the last few years, primarily in response to publicized sales practice disputes. Five of the dealers indicated that they had revised policies applicable to their marketing of these products. For example, two firms said that they were creating more formal written policies to better document the specific practices they expected their staff to follow. Two other dealers said that they had made improvements to the information they provided to end-users including, in one case, expanding the range of possible market moves used in scenario analyses. Two of the dealers also indicated that they had formed new groups within their firms to review transactions and marketing of these products.

The findings of regulators and others indicate that the structure of such compensation can be influential in determining how marketing personnel conduct their activities. For example, to the extent that staff receive higher compensation for more risky transactions that bring the firm greater profits, they have greater incentives to market these types of transactions, even if they are not in the end-user\u2019s best interests. One dealer told us that more complex derivatives tend to offer the potential for greater bonuses than plain vanilla OTC derivatives because of their higher profit margin.", "In general, dealers told us that their marketing staffs were not compensated solely by commissions on individual transactions.

One dealer told us that its compensation is not a commission system tied to sales volume but a salary and bonus system that is based on the value of business brought into the firm. The dealer explained that, in calculating individual bonuses, overall firm profitability and the relative performance of other departments within the firm might be weighed more heavily than individual performance. The dealer said that the system was designed to reduce incentives for individuals to market high margin, risky products that are not in the end-user\u2019s best interests.

Of the 26 organizations that provided information on their ability to price or stress-test their holdings, 12 indicated they could independently do so. Six others indicated that they relied on assistance from dealers or other parties to conduct such activity. Four indicated that they did not attempt to stress test their portfolios.", "The processes respondents used to approve or review transactions also varied. Although 31 respondents said that they required some sort of approval before purchasing a product, the levels of review and authorizing parties varied greatly. In some cases, portfolio managers or treasurers approved transactions; whereas in other cases, approval was required by an investment committee or by the company president. Twenty-two respondents reported controlling their use of these products by entering into transactions only with dealers that had been previously approved. To become an approved dealer, these organizations evaluated dealers\u2019 credit ratings and other factors, such as their reputation. Two respondents reported that they only approved dealers that sign an agreement acknowledging that they understood and would follow the end-users\u2019 investment guidelines. Five other end-users, which said they did not conduct such evaluations, indicated that they would only use dealers with high credit ratings.", "Consistent with the descriptions of the practices followed by respondents we contacted, surveys by other organizations also found that end-user practices and controls varied across firms. For example, a 1995 survey by the Wharton School of Business found that while 76 percent of respondents had policies addressing their use of these products, only 3 percent reported results monthly to their boards, 25 percent reported results quarterly, 20 percent reported results annually, and 51 percent reported results on an as-needed basis. This survey and one other also found that just under one-half of the respondents conducted stress-testing or scenario analyses on their portfolios to determine how they could be affected by severe market changes. A 1995 survey of 75 large, multinational corporations found that their ability to internally determine the value of their holdings varied widely across these organizations, depending on the products involved. Seventy-six percent reported being capable of pricing forwards and futures contracts, but only 38 percent of the corporations reported that they could independently price swaps and swaptions, and 14 percent reported such capabilities for complex options.", "Other surveys also found that the controls employed by end-users varied. Separate surveys by two financial journals of between 150 and 200 large U.S. firms reported that the authority for entering into transactions in OTC derivatives and similar products resided mainly with senior managers who were responsible for the organizations\u2019 finances, but that some firms had recently begun requiring additional levels of approval. Similarly, an accounting firm\u2019s survey of U.S. and international investment fund companies reported that one-third of those surveyed who had used derivatives had a supervisory board or risk management committee that established limits on the use of derivatives and similar products.", "A more recent survey that addressed the practices of end-users also showed that practices varied across organizations. In November 1996, one of the large public accounting firms issued a survey of almost 700 financial and nonfinancial organizations that used exchange-traded and OTC derivatives.

Various groups have called for end-users to improve their management of and controls over the use of products like OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes to reduce the potential for losses and resulting sales practice disputes. The types of controls advocated by these groups are intended to reduce end-user dependence on the information provided by dealers and the resulting vulnerability to deficient dealer sales practices. Federal and state regulators, state audit departments, and other reviewing organizations that examined end-user losses where sales practice disputes existed found that the end-users involved had multiple weaknesses in their internal controls and practices that contributed to their losses. We reviewed the reports and findings of these organizations for nine cases where an end-user incurred a loss and subsequently alleged deficient dealer sales practices. Among the weaknesses identified at these end-users were inadequacies related to investment policies, oversight of investment activities, separation of duties, staff training and qualifications, and internal audits.", "Regarding investment policies, regulators and others have frequently recommended that, at a minimum, entities using OTC derivatives or investing in financial instruments, such as MBS and structured notes, identify their objectives for using such products, the type of products approved for use, and the extent to which the products will be used. However, in five of the nine cases we reviewed, the reviewing organization found that end-users had material weaknesses in their policies addressing product use and, in some cases, lacked formal written policies. For example, a State of California report on Orange County\u2019s losses noted that the county did not have a written investment plan against which its activities could have been compared before the losses occurred. Also, its investment policies did not establish limits on the level of risk allowed for the county\u2019s investments. In 1994, a Texas community college incurred a $3-million loss when it sold part of its portfolio of highly volatile CMO tranches. The college had also experienced an $11-million decline in the market value of its remaining portfolio, which originally had a book value of over $31 million. The state auditor found that the college had no policies related to controlling the risk of its investments, their desired level of liquidity, or the extent to which they should be diversified.", "Regarding oversight of investments, a key control identified by most reports and other guidance on the use of OTC derivatives and products with similar characteristics is the need to supervise the activities of staff engaging in such transactions to ensure that guidelines are followed and activities are prudent. Seven of the nine audit reports of end-users incurring losses identified lack of controls for monitoring investment activity and personnel as contributing to these losses. For example, the treasurer at one Texas county was allowed to enter into transactions without prior approval. He invested over 65 percent of the county\u2019s investment funds in long-term, high-risk CMOs. The value of the $12.7-million portfolio later declined by as much as $4.5 million.", "A related control is to adequately separate officials\u2019 duties and responsibilities. Internal control standards generally require that internal auditors report to officials other than those that directly oversee the activities they are auditing. This control was absent in one county that experienced losses because the comptroller was responsible for making the county\u2019s investments and for approving any internal audit of his activities\u2014approval which he had never granted. An official of another county was responsible for both executing investment transactions and preparing the accounting records that reported their value. Because these two duties were not assigned to separate staff, the official was able to falsify the accounting records to hide the full extent of the losses that resulted from transactions he executed.", "Federal and state regulators and state auditors also criticized some end-users for lacking staff that were adequately trained or that possessed sufficient understanding of the risks involved in using complex financial products. Six of the nine audits we reviewed indicated that investment personnel or supervisory staff did not sufficiently understand the risks involved with the products purchased or lacked the expertise to properly monitor complex investments. This lack of understanding is not surprising because the treasurers of some local entities are elected officials who may have no experience investing in sophisticated financial instruments. In these situations, external oversight assumes even greater importance because, as some of the reviewing authorities noted, the lack of expertise on the part of end-user personnel led them to rely heavily on dealers for advice.", "Finally, some end-users lacked adequate internal audits. Thorough internal audits can lead to corrective action when investment policies and procedures are deficient or not being followed. At three end-users, the reviewing organizations noted that audits of investment activities either were not being done frequently enough or were not sufficiently addressing whether investment activities were in compliance with policies or other guidance. State auditors noted that the investment activities at one community college had not been reviewed by county audit staff in at least 5 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Organizations Issued Guidance for End-Users", "paragraphs": ["In response to recent reported losses, various organizations issued guidance on recommended practices for reducing the risks of engaging in OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured note transactions. Although most of the recommended practices we reviewed addressed issues faced primarily by dealers, we identified four sets of guidance issued by professional associations or groups that address issues faced by end-users. In June 1994, GFOA issued guidance to its members on the policies and practices that governmental entities should have in place before using derivatives. About 1 year later, NAST issued revised guidance that focuses on preferred practices for government-administered investment pools in which smaller state and local government funds are pooled and invested centrally. That same year, the Treasury Management Association (TMA) issued guidelines on internal controls and appropriate disclosures for end-users of derivatives. Finally, in November 1996, the Risk Standards Working Group (RSWG) issued 20 standards for managing and measuring risks. The GFOA and TMA guidance is written specifically for derivatives use, while NAST and RSWG guidance is intended for all investment products. All four sets of guidance favor explicitly written policies and objectives that have been approved by executive management or the board of directors.", "As shown in table 5.1, the four sets of guidance also call for similar practices, which, if not followed, can leave an end-user more vulnerable to sales practice disputes. However, each set of guidance has a different emphasis.

The NAST guidance focuses on the importance of communicating with pool participants, establishing the authorization to invest in certain types of products, and ensuring that investment policies exist\u2014including borrowing and diversification policies. The RSWG guidance stresses the importance of risk management\u2014including setting overall risk management objectives, valuing investments, and measuring risk-adjusted rates of return.", "The TMA guidance pays particular attention to end-user management controls, calls for end-users to obtain any necessary independent expertise, and provides an extensive list of disclosure standards and practices.

These actions were taken to minimize the risk of loss that product use poses to governments in at least one of three ways\u2014by improving end-users\u2019 policies, procedures, and controls; limiting the use of certain types of products; or placing additional requirements on dealers.", "One way that state governments have sought to decrease the likelihood of losses arising from the use of OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes was by requiring governmental entities to revise their own investment policies, procedures, and controls. Thirteen states took actions that place additional requirements on the investing entities within their states. For example, legislative bodies in Florida and Texas placed a similar new requirement on governmental units within their respective states to adopt investment plans that make the safety of investment funds a primary objective of government investment strategies. California and Florida now require their treasurer or unit carrying out the state\u2019s investment activities to follow the prudent investor/person standard. Eleven states imposed requirements for strengthening internal controls on local governments. For example, Ohio now requires treasurers in local governments to establish and file written investment policies with the state, prepare quarterly investment reports, and provide monthly portfolio updates.", "Several states also placed restrictions on the types of products that governmental entities could use. Ten of the 14 states now prohibit or restrict the use of OTC derivatives, MBS, and/or structured notes. For example, New Mexico now prohibits governmental entities in that state from using complex financial products, including structured notes. Wisconsin\u2019s legislation allows its state investment board to use derivatives only for reducing risk. In Florida, local entities can invest in derivatives if the entity\u2019s investment policy authorizes derivatives and if the entity\u2019s financial officers have sufficient expertise in managing derivatives investments.", "Finally, four states also sought to place additional responsibilities on dealers marketing OTC derivatives, MBS, or structured notes to governmental entities in their jurisdictions as well as to impose punitive measures when violations are found. The four states\u2014Colorado, Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas\u2014require dealers to ensure that the products they offer are acceptable under the governmental entities\u2019 statutes or investment policies. For example, Texas requires broker-dealers to sign a statement acknowledging that they reviewed the entity\u2019s investment policy and implemented reasonable procedures and controls in an effort to preclude imprudent investment activities arising out of the subject transaction. Taking a different approach, Colorado law requires that dealers repurchase investments, for at least the original face value plus any accrued interest, if the investments are found to be impermissible for the governmental entity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Improved Sales Practice Oversight of Regulated Firms, but Some Weaknesses Remain", "paragraphs": ["Federal financial market regulators have improved their oversight of dealer sales practices, but have not taken certain steps that would better ensure dealers follow sound practices when marketing OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes.

The agreement required Bankers Trust to (1) provide every counterparty with sufficient information about the terms and risks of any LDT it entered, (2) reasonably ensure that every counterparty has the ability to understand this information, and (3) conduct its LDT business in a manner that ensured reasonable price and valuation transparency to its counterparties.", "The supervisory agreement also imposed specific disclosure obligations on the bank for proposed LDT transactions, including providing a written term sheet setting out material terms, explaining the risks, and preparing sensitivity analyses that show a broad range of potential outcomes.

On December 9, 1996, the Federal Reserve announced that it had terminated the written agreement, thus ending the heightened requirements and oversight placed on the bank.

The goals of its oversight are to (1) ensure the quality of SRO activities and (2) provide additional oversight of securities firms\u2019 marketing activities.

To facilitate these examinations and reduce the overlap of SRO jurisdiction over securities firms that conduct activities on multiple exchanges, usually just one SRO is designated to review the financial condition of such firms. However, the NYSE official said that the individual SROs remain responsible for conducting their own examinations for sales practice purposes, unless they contract with another SRO to have such examinations conducted on their behalf.", "Dealers\u2019 sales practice activities relating to OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes were not always subject to review by securities industry SROs. As previously discussed, the largest securities firms generally conduct their nonsecurities OTC derivatives activities in affiliates that are not registered with SEC. Although a dealer conducting activities in securities is required to join and submit to oversight by at least one securities industry SRO, its other nonsecurities affiliates, such as those conducting nonsecurities OTC derivatives activities, are not subject to SRO oversight.", "The way that certain end-users conduct their activities in MBS and structured notes also affected SROs\u2019 ability to fully assess sales practices. NYSE officials told us that assessing the adequacy of their members\u2019 sales practices for MBS and structured notes could generally only be done when the customers involved are retail end-users. However, they estimated that such end-users account for only about 5 percent of the purchases of MBS.

In addition, federal financial market regulators found that few dealers in these contracts were involved in sales practice disputes.", "Certain characteristics of the OTC derivatives markets may explain the high level of end-user satisfaction and the relatively limited number of disputes. Specifically, our 1995 survey found that about 10 percent of a broad range of U.S. organizations had entered into plain vanilla OTC derivatives contracts and only 2 percent had entered into more complex OTC derivatives contracts. In addition, product use was concentrated among generally large, financially oriented organizations, with GSEs, finance companies, mutual funds, and money managers reporting the highest rates of usage.", "Nonetheless, some regulators and market participants have responded to concerns about the losses and costly disputes that can arise when OTC derivatives sales practices are inadequate or when roles and responsibilities are unclear. Their responses have included issuing guidance on recommended practices and controls; strengthening sales practice or investment policies, procedures, and practices; and increasing internal reviews of these activities.", "Although the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets has concluded that legislation containing additional sales practice requirements is not currently needed for OTC derivatives, the market characteristics that contributed to the high level of end-user satisfaction and the limited number of sales practice disputes experienced to date could change as the markets evolve. These changes could include increased market participation by new dealers, more widespread use of complex products, or increased marketing to or product use by less sophisticated end-users. Such changes in market characteristics could cause the Working Group to reconsider whether current requirements are adequate to protect end-users of OTC derivatives or the financial markets.", "However, the federal financial market regulators that participate in the Working Group do not routinely collect information related to changes in market characteristics. These regulators monitor the OTC derivatives activities of the firms subject to their respective oversight, and they discuss any developments of which they become aware through their joint participation in the Working Group. However, the regulators do not routinely collect the information necessary to ensure that they are able to systematically detect changes in market characteristics. Thus, the Working Group lacks a formal mechanism for obtaining the necessary information for monitoring market developments related to sales practices. Such a mechanism is important because it could alert the Working Group to the need for reassessing the adequacy of existing sales practice laws and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives.", "Regarding MBS and structured notes, our survey found that end-user satisfaction with dealer sales practices was somewhat lower than for OTC derivatives. In addition, regulators identified more cases of potential sales practice abuse for these products than for OTC derivatives. However, SEC and the securities industry SROs have been investigating and, when deemed necessary, taking enforcement actions against the dealers involved in these cases. In addition, recently enacted rules subject dealers marketing GSE-issued MBS and structured notes\u2014which account for the bulk of such securities\u2014to all of NASD\u2019s sales practice requirements. The implementation of these rules should close what has been a major gap in regulatory oversight of these products and improve NASD\u2019s ability to ensure that dealer practices in these markets are appropriate.", "Although the number of cases in which sales practice concerns were raised was relatively limited, the disputes that accompanied some of these cases resulted in both the end-user and dealer incurring significant costs. These costs included legal expenses, regulatory fines, reduced income, and even bankruptcy as well as other costs related to the failure to manage the compliance and reputation risks associated with these transactions. Although expanded sales practice requirements to protect end-users may not be necessary at this time due to the market characteristics previously discussed, the seriousness of these risks justify additional action by federal financial market regulators to better ensure the sound financial condition of regulated institutions and the fairness and integrity of the markets. Even actions that focus primarily on the risks posed to dealers can help improve dealer sales practices, benefit end-users, and enhance the overall integrity of the markets.", "The Working Group could provide regulators a forum for assisting end-users and dealers in reconciling their differing views on the nature of their responsibilities in transactions involving OTC derivatives. According to our survey, over 50 percent of the end-users of plain vanilla OTC derivatives believed that dealers had certain fiduciary responsibilities to them in some or all cases. As reflected in the two sets of dealer-issued voluntary guidance\u2014the Framework and the Principles\u2014dealers have generally considered such transactions to be conducted at arm\u2019s length, with minimal responsibilities existing for either party beyond those of honest and fair dealing. To the extent that the differing views of end-users and dealers increase the likelihood of sales practice disputes that expose regulated institutions to material losses or that otherwise could prove disruptive to the markets, federal regulators have an interest in the reconciliation of these differences. The reconciliation of such differences does not entail federal regulators imposing a resolution on the markets. Rather, the type of relationship and accompanying responsibilities that should prevail in OTC derivatives transactions should be agreed upon by market participants.", "A clearer understanding of the nature of end-user and dealer responsibilities may also be necessary for the voluntary standards to receive more widespread acceptance among end-users. In addition, these standards may be the only ones applicable to some unregulated market participants, such as insurance company affiliates. Therefore, by assisting market participants in reaching a clearer understanding of their responsibilities, federal financial market regulators may enhance the overall integrity of the markets. Reaching a clearer understanding may also encourage product use, where appropriate, by organizations that have limited their use because of concerns about transaction risks and uncertainty about the roles and responsibilities of dealers and end-users. Finally, reaching such an understanding could result in greater diligence by both end-users and dealers in ensuring that they comprehend product risks before entering into transactions.", "Notwithstanding the potential benefits of an improved understanding between dealers and end-users, the issues surrounding their relationships are complex and federal involvement may not necessarily result in an agreement that is widely accepted. Even if an increased level of understanding between these groups could be reached, the likelihood of legal disputes when large losses occur might not decrease. However, federal financial market regulators would be justified in considering whether they can help end-users and dealers reach a mutually acceptable agreement because of the importance of these products to the financial markets and the U.S. economy. Consultation with market participants on this subject might assist regulators in assessing whether they should assume such a role.", "Regardless of whether they decide to assist end-users and dealers in resolving their differences, federal financial regulators can take other specific actions to address the risks to dealers that market OTC derivatives, MBS, and structured notes. Although the Federal Reserve has conducted examinations of banks\u2019 activities and issued guidance on the responsibilities of banks that market these products, its guidance remains incomplete. Specifically, it does not direct bank examiners to assess the adequacy of bank policies and controls related to disclosing risk, acting in a fiduciary or advisory capacity, or supervising marketing personnel. Weaknesses in these areas existed in some cases where sales practice disputes have arisen. Although we found both bank regulators\u2019 examinations to be generally thorough, specifically addressing these areas in the Federal Reserve\u2019s guidance would better ensure that such areas receive similar attention in future examinations. Federal Reserve officials have efforts under way to update this guidance, and our review of a draft of this updated guidance indicates that it would address the elements we identified as missing in the existing guidance.", "SEC and CFTC participation in the development of the Framework reflects their concern with the risks posed by the sales practices and other activities of the largely unregulated dealers in these markets. In lieu of additional regulation of this market, the Framework is to result in SEC and CFTC periodically receiving additional information, including the results of external audits, on some aspects of participating dealers\u2019 OTC derivatives activities. This information should improve the ability of SEC and CFTC to conduct the legislatively mandated risk assessments of the entities they regulate. However, information on these dealers\u2019 adherence to the sales practice provisions of the Framework is not included in the information these regulators are to receive. Adherence to these provisions is important for ensuring market fairness and integrity. In the absence of a mechanism for ensuring such adherence, SEC and CFTC cannot be sure that these firms\u2019 commitment to voluntarily follow the sales practice provisions of the Framework is being fulfilled, casting doubt on whether a voluntary arrangement is an adequate substitute for direct federal oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury, as Chairman of the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets, take the following actions:", "Ensure that the members of the Working Group establish a mechanism for systematically monitoring developments in the OTC derivatives markets to assess whether developments warrant introducing specific federal sales practice requirements.", "Lead the members of the Working Group in considering the extent to which it should assist end-users and dealers in reaching agreement on the nature of their relationship in transactions involving OTC derivatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation to the Federal Reserve", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board implement planned revisions to the Federal Reserve examination guidance, which are to more specifically address the need to assess the adequacy of banks\u2019 policies and controls related to disclosing risks, creating advisory relationships, and supervising marketing personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation to SEC and CFTC", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Chairpersons of SEC and CFTC establish a mechanism for determining that participating firms are following the sales practice provisions of the Framework for Voluntary Oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Industry Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the heads, or their designees, of CFTC, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, SEC, and Treasury. We also requested comments from two securities industry SROs (NASD and NYSE) and four industry associations (EUDA, GFOA, ISDA, and NASACT). Each of these agencies/associations provided us with written comments except CFTC, Treasury, and NASD. The Director of Treasury\u2019s Office of Federal Finance Policy Analysis provided oral comments on our recommendations. Officials from CFTC provided oral, technical comments. Our additional responses to written, nontechnical comments are contained in appendixes III through IX. Technical comments provided by CFTC, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, SEC, Treasury, NASD, NYSE, EUDA, GFOA, and ISDA were incorporated into this report as appropriate.", "Overall, no consensus emerged on the benefits of implementing our recommendations. The banking regulators and the associations that represent primarily end-users generally concurred with our findings and/or recommendations. The Federal Reserve also stated that this report makes a useful contribution to assessing the current state of financial market sales practices. OCC commented that the report is comprehensive in evaluating sales practices from the perspectives of dealers, end-users, and regulators. GFOA said this report will be an extremely helpful reference on derivatives, and NASACT stated that it provides an excellent study of sales practice issues facing the OTC derivatives market. In contrast, Treasury and ISDA generally objected to our recommendations, with both opposing additional federal involvement in the OTC derivatives markets to address sales practice issues. SEC\u2019s views were mixed.", "SEC, Treasury, and ISDA objected to our recommendation that the Working Group establish a mechanism for systematically monitoring developments in the OTC derivatives markets. Specifically, SEC and Treasury officials commented that the Working Group\u2019s current efforts, which generally include the principals meeting every 6 weeks and the staff meeting every 2 weeks, are adequate to address market developments. Similarly, ISDA commented that it is not readily apparent that a formal monitoring mechanism would be any more effective than the existing structure. In contrast, EUDA, GFOA, and NASACT supported this recommendation. EUDA indicated that taking the recommended steps\u2014as they relate to this and our other recommendation to the Working Group\u2014will lead to greater market safety and soundness, particularly concerning new dealers or end-users entering the markets. We continue to believe that the Working Group needs a formal mechanism for monitoring the OTC derivatives markets. As discussed in this report, the market characteristics that contributed to the relatively high level of end-user satisfaction and the relatively limited number of sales practice disputes could change as the markets evolve. This report recognizes that the federal financial market regulators monitor the OTC derivatives activities of the firms subject to their respective oversight, and they discuss market developments of which they become aware through their joint participation in the Working Group. However, this report also observes that the agencies that participate in the Working Group do not routinely collect the information necessary to ensure that they are able to systematically detect changes in market characteristics. Thus, the Working Group lacks a formal mechanism for obtaining the necessary information for monitoring developments related to sales practices. Such a mechanism is important because it could alert the Working Group to the need for reassessing the adequacy of existing sales practice requirements applicable to OTC derivatives. The information to be assessed could include the number and types of new dealers and end-users entering the markets, the types of complex new products being introduced, and changes in the types or sophistication of end-users to whom products are being marketed.", "Treasury and ISDA also objected to our recommendation that the Working Group consider the extent to which it should assist end-users and dealers in reaching agreement on the nature of their relationship in transactions involving OTC derivatives. Treasury was concerned that, because such relationships are contractual, no single model may be appropriate. ISDA commented that no need exists for the Working Group to involve itself in mediating between dealers and end-users, that the involvement of market participants and regulators to date has been sufficient, and that the issues involved are complex and federal involvement may not result in an agreement that is widely accepted. In addition, ISDA stated that the draft report offered no evidence suggesting that disputes among privately negotiated derivatives contracts (that is, OTC derivatives contracts) are more frequent than in other commercial dealings, that these markets have been largely free of sales practice abuses, and that courts and regulators have not had difficulty in finding remedies when necessary. For these reasons, ISDA indicated that it did not support expanded regulatory activity. ISDA also commented that the report does not substantiate that the OTC derivatives market is \u201cin any way broken and needs fixing,\u201d that our recommendations do not follow logically from the facts or conclusions in the report, and that our recommendations contradict the views of market participants and regulators.", "SEC commented that in its efforts to address financial market issues, the Working Group has had discussions with end-users and professional counterparties (dealers) and that it believes the Working Group would be willing to continue this dialogue. However, SEC stated that it is not necessary for the government to intervene and define contractual obligations for professional and sophisticated counterparties. The Federal Reserve noted that it has recognized the importance of and encouraged voluntary industry efforts in this area, and the three end-user associations supported our recommendation.", "We continue to support our recommendation that the Working Group consider assisting market participants in reaching agreement on the nature of their relationship in OTC derivatives transactions. This report acknowledges that the issues involved in reaching agreement between dealers and end-users are complex and may not lend themselves to a single, widely accepted solution. For this reason, we do not intend that the Working Group impose a model that defines counterparty relationships in OTC derivatives transactions. In addition, we do not base our recommendation to the Working Group on a finding that a high frequency of sales practice abuses exists or that courts and regulators have had difficulty in finding remedies when abuses occur. Instead, we present evidence that end-users and dealers do not always agree on the nature of their relationship, including their responsibilities, in OTC derivatives transactions. Although the dealer-issued voluntary guidance asserts that the nature of the relationship is arm\u2019s length, our survey found that a majority of end-users believed that dealers had fiduciary responsibilities in some or all OTC derivatives transactions, and that a majority indicated they relied on dealers from some to a very great extent as part of these transactions. To the extent that the differing views of end-users and dealers increase the likelihood of sales practice disputes that expose regulated institutions to material losses or that otherwise effect the sound financial condition of regulated institutions and the fairness and integrity of the markets, we concluded that the federal financial market regulators have an interest in the reconciliation of these differences.", "Regarding ISDA\u2019s objection to additional regulatory activity, our report concludes that no legislation or regulation is currently needed. Nonetheless, our views on the benefits of federal regulatory involvement in the OTC derivatives markets differ from those of ISDA. In this regard, our recommendations address the need for the federal financial markets to fulfill their responsibilities related to ensuring the sound financial condition of regulated institutions and the fairness and integrity of the markets, without creating unnecessary or costly burdens for them. We do not recommend that the federal financial market regulators resolve the differences between dealers and end-users by defining the nature of their relationship for them. Rather, we recommend that they consider, as participants in the Working Group, whether the benefits of assisting market participants are sufficient to warrant their involvement and whether their involvement is likely to achieve the desired result. The Working Group\u2019s assistance could involve facilitating discussions between dealers and end-users that lead to agreement in key areas where they now disagree. Regarding ISDA\u2019s comment that our recommendations contradict the views of market participants and regulators, this report recognizes the varying support of these parties for our recommendations.", "Treasury officials commented that the draft report appeared to be critical of establishing an arm\u2019s-length relationship as the default model for OTC derivatives transactions. ISDA officials supported the arm\u2019s-length relationship as the default model, noting that it is the appropriate starting place for institutional market participants. This report does not reach a conclusion on the appropriate default model for counterparty relationships. It presents the views of both those who support and oppose an arm\u2019s-length relationship as the default model. As clarified in chapter 7, we conclude that the type of relationship and accompanying responsibilities that should prevail in OTC derivatives transactions should be agreed upon by market participants, and we recommend that the Working Group consider assisting market participants in reaching agreement on these issues.", "The Federal Reserve commented favorably on our recommendation to its chairman. That is, the agency indicated that it has efforts under way that would fully respond to our recommendation that the agency revise its examination guidance to more specifically address the need to assess the adequacy of banks\u2019 policies and controls related to disclosing risk, creating advisory relationships, and supervising marketing personnel.", "In addressing our recommendation that SEC and CFTC establish a mechanism for determining that participating firms are following the sales practice provisions of the Framework, SEC indicated that it is willing to discuss with the affected parties the feasibility of extending the external auditor\u2019s role to incorporate a review of sales practice procedures. This appears to be an appropriate first step towards implementing our recommendation. As indicated in chapter 6, SEC and CFTC could also request that the participating firms provide copies of their sales practice policies\u2014as was done for these firms\u2019 risk management systems as part of SEC\u2019s risk assessment process\u2014and descriptions of the internal controls these firms have established to ensure that such policies are being followed. CFTC did not comment on this recommendation.", "However, NASACT opposed this recommendation to SEC and CFTC, contending that these agencies\u2019 participation in a compliance program would be recognized as an endorsement of the Framework and would present new legal obligations without first being subject to the due process associated with a new regulation. In place of our recommendation, NASACT proposed that the drafters of the Framework and end-users work with SEC and CFTC to further clarify counterparty relationships. GFOA also expressed concern that the dealer-issued voluntary guidance could establish legal obligations, noting that Bankers Trust cited the Principles as support in legal actions involving Procter & Gamble.", "Our recommendation is not intended to create new legal obligations for dealers or end-users. Regarding NASACT\u2019s concern that SEC and CFTC participation in a compliance program related to the Framework would present new legal obligations (presumably for end-users), this report notes that the Framework is not intended to apply to end-users. Instead, the Framework specifically states that it applies only to the participating firms and only to their nonsecurities OTC derivatives activities. Although the Framework indicates that it is not intended to create legally enforceable obligations, this report acknowledges that the courts could find the guidance useful in evaluating counterparty relationships and defining common law responsibilities. To the extent that market participants find this potential outcome objectionable, they can individually take steps to clarify their relationship with counterparties in each transaction they enter.", "We believe that a more effective approach would be for end-users and dealers to participate in a joint effort to reach agreement on the nature of their relationship in OTC derivatives transactions, and we have recommended that the Working Group consider assisting the parties in this process. We make our recommendation to the Working Group in the belief that a coordinated effort by the federal market regulators would be a more effective means of reaching agreement on the nature of counterparty relationships, including the responsibilities of counterparties to OTC derivatives transactions. An additional advantage to this approach is that the resulting agreement would not make distinctions between types of dealers and end-users. That is, it would not distinguish between dealers that are banks and dealers that are securities firm affiliates or their end-user counterparties. As a result, should the Working Group assist dealers and end-users in reaching an agreement on the nature of their relationship, the resulting agreement would be applicable to all dealers and end-users of OTC derivatives.", "This report also notes that, in lieu of additional regulation, SEC and CFTC are already participating with the drafters of the Framework in a voluntary program that includes monitoring the nonsales practice provisions of the Framework by external auditors. We are merely recommending that such monitoring be extended to the sales practice provisions of the Framework. As we conclude in this chapter, adherence to these provisions is important for ensuring market fairness and integrity. In the absence of a mechanism for ensuring such adherence, SEC and CFTC cannot be sure that a participating firm\u2019s commitment to voluntarily follow the sales practice provisions of the Framework is being fulfilled, thereby casting doubt on whether a voluntary arrangement is an adequate substitute for direct federal oversight."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
