In general, NRC is responsible for overseeing licensees' emergency preparedness at the plant (on-site), and FEMA is responsible for overseeing preparedness by local and state authorities around the plant (off-site). NRC and FEMA have also established a 10-mile emergency planning zone around nuclear power plants. Licensees are responsible for managing on-site radiological emergency preparedness and developing and maintaining plans that define activities that the nuclear power plant must take to prepare for and respond to a potential incident at the plant. Participating local and state authorities within the 10-mile zone must develop protective actions for responding to a radiological incident, including plans for evacuations and sheltering in place. A recent NRC task force considered the adequacy of the zone size and concluded that no change was currently needed but will be re-evaluated as part of its lessons learned efforts for the Fukushima incident.", "NRC and FEMA conduct activities to ensure that licensees and local and state authorities have adequate plans and capabilities to respond to a radiological incident. For example, NRC and FEMA review emergency plans developed by licensees and local and state authorities to ensure that planning standards are met. In addition, NRC and FEMA observe exercises for each plant that licensees and local and state authorities conduct every 2 years to demonstrate their ability to respond to an incident. NRC also requires licensees to develop estimates of how long it would take for those inside the 10-mile zone to evacuate under various conditions. Licensees are to provide these evacuation time estimates to local and state authorities to use when planning protective action strategies.", "NRC and FEMA require licensees and local and state authorities, respectively, to provide information annually on radiation and protective actions for the public only inside the 10-mile zone. Those in the 10-mile zone have been shown to be generally well informed about these emergency preparedness procedures and are likely to follow directions from local and state authorities in the event of a radiological emergency. In contrast, the agencies do not require similar information to be provided to the public outside of the 10-mile zone and have not studied public awareness in this area. Therefore, it is unknown to what extent the public in these areas is aware of these emergency preparedness procedures, and how they would respond in the event of a radiological emergency. Without better information on the public's awareness and potential response in areas outside the 10-mile zone, NRC may not be providing the best planning guidance to licensees and state and local authorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To better inform radiological emergency preparedness efforts, GAO recommends that NRC obtain information on public awareness and likely public response outside the 10- mile zone, and incorporate insights into guidance, as appropriate.

These criteria included plants that (1) had over 1 million people  within 50 miles and over 200,000 people within 10 miles and (2) were  located in different FEMA regions. In addition, we wanted to observe a  plant conducting a radiological emergency preparedness exercise, which  each plant must conduct once every 2 years.also expressed interest that we increase our regional sample by visiting a  plant outside of the East Coast. As a result, we selected the San Onofre  Nuclear Generating Station because it was the only plant outside the East  Coast that met some of our criteria, including that it has the second  highest population in the country within 50 miles of a plant. We  interviewed NRC and FEMA officials from headquarters and the regional  offices in which the plants were located, the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), licensee officials for the four plants we visited, and local  and state authorities responsible for emergency preparedness in areas  around the plants. We observed a radiological emergency preparedness  exercise to determine how the licensee and federal, local, and state  stakeholders conduct and evaluate preparedness exercises.

For the plume exposure pathway,  evacuation or shelter in place should be the primary protective  actions. The radius for the emergency planning zone implies a circular  area, but the actual shape can depend upon the characteristics of a  particular site. For example, local authorities around the Limerick  Generating Station in Pennsylvania told us that the Pennsylvania  Turnpike was used as a boundary for part of the 10-mile zone.

We noted that local and state  authorities near the four power plants we visited have dose assessment  teams that are to take radiation readings in the area during an incident  and coordinate radiation readings with licensee dose assessment teams  to help assess the situation and to help with overall decision making. In  some states, the local counties and cities have the primary role in making  protective action decisions. For example, around the St. Lucie Nuclear  Power Plant in Florida, county officials for several counties told us that  they develop individual emergency plans, but they work together during  an emergency to coordinate the appropriate protective action decision for  the area. According to local and state authorities around the San Onofre  Nuclear Generating Station in California, two counties, three cities, one  U.S. Marine Corps base, the California Department of Parks and  Recreation, and the power plant licensee formed an interjurisdictional  planning committee to coordinate an emergency plan for the area.  Members of this committee collectively decide on the protective action to  take during an incident, based on the licensee\u2019s protective action  recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NRC and FEMA Require That the Public within the 10- Mile Zone Be Informed Annually about Preparedness, but NRC Has Little Information about Public Awareness Outside This Zone", "paragraphs": ["NRC and FEMA require licensees and local and state authorities to  provide emergency preparedness information annually to the public within  the 10-mile emergency planning zone, and NRC has studied public  awareness within the zone.

Specifically, NRC regulations  require that licensees annually provide basic emergency planning  information to the public within the 10-mile emergency planning zone.  This information may take various forms, including brochures, telephone  book inserts, or calendars. According to NRC and FEMA guidance, these  materials must include educational information on radiation, protective  measure information such as evacuation routes and relocation centers,  information relating to the special needs of the handicapped, and a  contact for additional information. FEMA guidance also states that the  content of these materials is generally determined through coordination  between local and state authorities and the licensees. For example, St.  Lucie County authorities in Florida told us that they develop the annual  mailing in cooperation with neighboring Martin County authorities, so that  both counties use the same materials, and then the licensee prints and  distributes this mailing to households and businesses within the 10-mile  emergency planning zone around the nuclear power plant in St. Lucie,  Florida. Licensees told us that they translate these materials into non- English languages and make them available to the public, depending on  the demographic makeup of their communities, as directed by FEMA  guidance. NRC and FEMA updated their guidance on these public  information programs in November 2011 to provide more information  about protective actions in public information materials. For example, the  2011 guidance recommends that local and state authorities explain the  purpose of staged evacuations, define expectations for those under an  advisory, clarify expectations for those who are not at home when a  protective action is ordered, and discourage parents from picking up their  children from school during an event. Staged evacuation occurs when the  population in one area is evacuated, while the population in another area  is told to remain indoors until it is their turn to evacuate. According to  NRC guidance, the success of staged evacuation depends on public  compliance with sheltering in place while the population most at risk is  evacuated. NRC\u2019s research on the matter has suggested that the public  requires clear and direct communication both to evacuees and to those  near, but not within, affected areas.", "FEMA guidance also instructs local and state authorities to conduct  outreach to certain special needs populations within the 10-mile  emergency planning zone. Specifically, FEMA\u2019s guidance instructs  licensees and local and state authorities to take the following actions:", "Conduct outreach to transient populations. Authorities may, for  example, issue pamphlets, stickers, or signs in hotels, motels, and  public parks. Local and state authorities in communities around San  Onofre Nuclear Generating Station near San Clemente, California,  told us that they provide a card to campers when they enter state  parks that tells them what to do and which radio stations to tune into  in the event of an emergency at the nuclear power plant; are working  with hotels to include emergency information in each hotel room; and  have trained hotel managers and staff to make sure they are  registered with the appropriate jurisdiction to receive emergency  alerts.", "Have a plan to identify individuals who need assistance when  evacuating. Some local and state authorities told us that they  accomplish this by including a card inside the annual mailing that  enables residents with special needs to identify their needs and  complete and mail back the card to the licensee or to their local  authorities, so that the authorities can track special needs individuals  during an emergency.", "FEMA guidance also instructs local and state authorities to establish  coordinated arrangements for dealing with rumors and unconfirmed  reports to provide the public with direct access to accurate information  during an incident, as well as to provide local and state authorities with  information about trends in public inquiries. For example, some local and  state authorities told us that that they have established dedicated public  information telephone numbers and assigned staff to answer questions in  the event of an incident. Local and state authorities we spoke with varied  in their use of social media forums to monitor and respond to rumors  before or during an incident. Some local and state authorities near the  four plants we visited said that they use social media to provide  preparedness information, while others said they do not use social media.  FEMA officials told us that they are currently studying different social  media technologies and how information is disseminated to the public. In  addition, local and state authorities are required to conduct annual efforts  to brief news media on emergency plans, radiation information, and their  points of contact in an emergency. State of Florida authorities go beyond  these requirements and told us they conduct two media briefings  annually, hold an annual press conference with the Lieutenant Governor,  and provide radiological emergency preparedness information sheets to  the press.", "Local and state authorities we spoke with told us that they conduct other  voluntary activities to inform the public in the 10-mile emergency planning  zone. These activities include informing residents about annual siren  testing required in the zone, conducting presentations to community  groups and at local events, providing information to parents at schools,  and posting information on websites. Authorities we spoke with said that  some of these voluntary activities may also occur outside the 10-mile  emergency planning zone.", "NRC and FEMA do not require public information efforts for radiological  emergency preparedness outside the 10-mile emergency planning zone.  According to NRC and FEMA guidance, for the worst incidents at  commercial nuclear power plants, immediate life-threatening radiation  doses would generally not occur outside the 10-mile zone and would  probably not require protective actions outside the zone. In the 50-mile  emergency planning zone, the principal exposure to radiation would be  ingestion of contaminated food and water, and this would represent a  longer term problem. According to FEMA guidance, the licensee and  state authorities are to make information available to farmers and other  members of the agricultural industry within the 50-mile emergency  planning zone. This information is to describe recommended protective  actions for agricultural industries to minimize contamination of the food  supply. Some state and local authorities told us that they sometimes  conduct public education efforts outside of the 10-mile zone that include  radiological emergency preparedness information. However, some  authorities also expressed concerns about the radiological awareness  levels of residents and the potential for shadow evacuations. For  example, Los Angeles County authorities told us that one of their greatest  concerns in the event of an incident at the San Onofre Nuclear  Generating Station is a rumor that results in shadow evacuations, which  could result in clogged highways as people who are not in danger choose  to evacuate unnecessarily."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Has Studied Awareness and Likely Responses to an Incident Inside the 10-Mile Emergency Planning Zone but Not Outside of It", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, NRC conducted a study with the Sandia National Laboratory to  examine public awareness of emergency preparedness information and  likely responses within the 10-mile emergency planning zone. The  laboratory administered a national telephone survey to random members  of households within each of the 63 10-mile emergency planning zones.  According to the study results, those surveyed were generally well- informed, with many having taken action to prepare for an emergency.  Furthermore, most of those who responded to the survey reported that  they believe they are likely to follow directions from local and state  authorities in the event of an incident at the nuclear power plant.  However, about 20 percent of those responding to the survey reported  that they would evacuate even when told evacuation for them was not  necessary, referred to as a shadow evacuation. NRC guidance states that  a shadow evacuation can impede the evacuation of those under  evacuation orders. Also, most of those who responded to the survey and  who have children in school reported that they were likely to pick up their  children from school in an emergency. Using the findings from this study,  NRC updated guidance on protective action strategies and improving  public information programs in November 2011. This guidance  recommends that local and state authorities provide more information  about the purpose of staged evacuations, in addition to simply describing  the different types of protective action strategies.", "To address the potential for shadow evacuations, NRC officials told us  that they used the study results to determine the potential shadow  evacuation rate outside the 10-mile emergency planning zone.  Specifically, NRC instructed licensees to consider shadow evacuations of  20 percent of the public out to 15 miles from the nuclear power plant  when the licensee develops estimates of evacuation times. However,  the study surveyed residents inside the 10-mile emergency planning  zone, a population that is given radiological emergency preparedness  information every year and that is therefore more familiar with the power  plant, radiation risks, protective actions, and evacuation routes than the  public outside the 10-mile zone. Without this same level of information,  those outside the zone may not respond in a similar manner to a  radiological incident as those inside the zone. Because the survey was  conducted on a relatively more educated and aware population, the 20- percent rate for shadow evacuations may not accurately capture the level  of shadow evacuations that may occur outside the 10-mile zone.  According to NRC and FEMA officials, their agencies have not examined  public awareness outside the 10-mile emergency planning zone and  therefore do not know if a 20-percent estimate of shadow evacuations is  reasonable. Therefore, licensee evacuation time estimates may not  accurately consider the impact of shadow evacuations. Without estimates  of evacuation times based on more solid understanding of public  awareness outside the 10-mile zone, licensees and NRC and FEMA  cannot be confident about the reliability of their estimates. If shadow  evacuations are not correctly estimated, planning for a radiological  emergency may not sufficiently consider the impact of the public outside  the 10-mile emergency planning zone. Shadow evacuations outside this  zone greater than the assumed 20-percent rate would put additional  traffic on roadways, possibly delaying the evacuation of the public inside  the emergency planning zone and potentially increasing the risk to public  health and safety."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Fukushima Daiichi incident raised questions about the U.S.  government\u2019s ability to protect its citizens if a similar incident were to  occur here. NRC and FEMA have developed regulations and guidance to  help licensees and local and state authorities create and test radiological  emergency response plans that are intended to provide reasonable  assurance that they can adequately protect public health and safety in the  event of a radiological incident at a nuclear power plant. NRC regulations  and guidance also direct licensees to annually provide emergency  preparedness information to the public within their 10-mile emergency  planning zones. Furthermore, the 2008 NRC study by Sandia National  Laboratory demonstrated that the public within these planning zones is  generally likely to respond to instructions from local and state authorities  in the event of an incident. On the basis of this study, NRC estimated that  20 percent of the public within the zones would choose to evacuate even  when told evacuation for them was not necessary (shadow evacuations).  NRC then directed licensees to consider this same percentage of shadow  evacuations for the public outside the planning zone when estimating  evacuation times. However, communities outside the 10-mile zone  generally do not receive the same level of information as those within the  10-mile zone and therefore may not be as knowledgeable about  appropriate conduct during a radiological emergency as those inside the  zone and may not respond in a similar manner. If the public outside the  zone evacuates unnecessarily at a greater rate than expected, these  shadow evacuations would put additional traffic on roadways, possibly  delaying the evacuation of the public inside the emergency planning zone  and potentially increasing the risk to public health and safety. However,  because neither NRC nor FEMA have examined public awareness  outside of the 10-mile emergency planning zone, they do not know how  the public outside this zone will respond. Specifically, they do not know if  a 20-percent estimate of shadow evacuations is reasonable. Therefore,  licensee evacuation time estimates may not accurately consider the  impact of shadow evacuations. Without estimates of evacuation times  based on more solid understanding of public awareness, licensees and  NRC and FEMA cannot be confident about the reliability of their  estimates.

NRC explained that it has conducted considerable research on  evacuations and has confidence that shadow evacuations generally have  no significant impact on traffic movement.

NRC told us that this shadow evacuation estimate  came primarily from a telephone survey it conducted of the public within  each of the 63 10-mile emergency planning zones around the country.  However, residents inside the 10-mile zone are provided radiological  information every year and are therefore more familiar with the power  plant, radiation risks, protective actions, and evacuation routes than those  outside the zone. Without this same level of information, residents outside  the zone may not respond in a similar manner as those inside the zone,  and the use of a 20 percent shadow evacuation estimate for the public  outside the zone may therefore not be reliable.", "Second, NRC asserts that it has conducted considerable research on  evacuations and has confidence that shadow evacuations generally have  no significant impact on traffic movement. GAO acknowledges that NRC  has conducted research on evacuations, but these studies are generally  based on evacuations that have resulted from non-nuclear incidents such  as hurricanes, wildfires, and chemical spills. It is unclear whether the  public would behave the same for a nuclear evacuation as it would for the  incidents that NRC has studied. As we say in the report, NRC\u2019s Near- Term Task Force established after the Fukushima incident observed gaps  in public awareness in the United States. The task force recommended  that, as part of a follow-on review, NRC should pursue emergency  preparedness topics related to decision-making, radiation monitoring, and  public education, particularly to increase education and outreach in the  vicinity of each nuclear power plant in the areas of radiation, radiation  safety, and the appropriate use of potassium iodide. We believe the task  force\u2019s finding that there are gaps in public awareness and understanding  regarding nuclear incidents supports our recommendation that NRC  should obtain information on public awareness and the likely responses of  communities outside the 10-mile zone in the event of a radiological  incident at a nuclear power plant.", "Finally, with regard to NRC\u2019s confidence that shadow evacuations  generally have no significant impact on traffic movement, according to  NRC\u2019s 2011 guidance mentioned earlier, evacuation time estimate  studies should include a shadow evacuation consideration of 20 percent  of the population out to 15 miles away from the nuclear power plant  because the additional traffic generated has the potential to impede an  evacuation of the emergency planning zone. Thus, NRC has previously  acknowledged in its guidance that traffic from shadow evacuations may  impede the intended evacuations.  For these reasons, we believe our  recommendation to improve NRC\u2019s understanding of the effect of shadow  evacuations outside of the 10-mile zone is consistent with NRC\u2019s  guidance about the potential effects of shadow evacuations on  evacuations within the emergency planning zone.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
