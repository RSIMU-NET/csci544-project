Specifically, GAO assessed the extent to which (1) performance goals and measures have been established for these programs and (2) the agencies responsible have established adequate oversight procedures.

No federal performance goals or measures currently exist for the Randolph-Sheppard program, which provides opportunities for individuals who are blind to operate vending facilities on federal properties. Without goals, it is difficult to assess the program's performance, but Education officials told GAO they are developing them. Education has a goal and a measure for the Supported Employment State Grants program--a federal grant program that provides job coaching and other support to help individuals with severe disabilities secure jobs. The goal indirectly measures the program's performance because grant funds are mixed with other funding sources to provide supported employment services. Education has also developed one goal for the PWI program--a federal grant program that helps individuals with disabilities obtain competitive employment--that is consistent with the mission of the program. The goal is to create and expand job opportunities for individuals with disabilities in the competitive labor market by engaging business and industry, and one of the measures tracks the percentage of individuals placed in employment in work settings making at least minimum wage. The Committee for Purchase, which oversees the JWOD program--a program that helps to create jobs through the federal property management and procurement systems--first developed federal goals and measures for its fiscal year 2005-2007 strategic plan and has since revised them. The revised measures still have limitations, such as not being clearly defined or being difficult to measure. Education's and the Committee for Purchase's oversight of the four programs has been uneven. Education has established procedures, such as on-site reviews, for the PWI and Supported Employment State Grants programs that, if consistently followed, would provide reasonable assurance that the programs are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, Education conducts limited oversight of the Randolph-Sheppard program. For example, Education does not routinely analyze or report the data it collects from states and has provided little guidance to ensure states comply with laws or consistently interpret program requirements. One area in which Education has not provided sufficient guidance is the circumstances under which federal agencies may charge fees to licensed vendors operating vending facilities on their properties. As a result, vendors in some locations were paying commissions or fees but those in other locationswere not. Finally, the Committee for Purchase delegates most of its oversight responsibilities to two central nonprofit agencies that also represent the interests of the JWOD nonprofit agencies they oversee. This arrangement, as well as the fact that they receive a percentage of the total value of the contracts from the JWOD nonprofit agencies, raises questions about their independence and gives them little incentive to identify instances of noncompliance that could result in the JWOD nonprofit agency losing its federal contract."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The employment rate for working-age people with disabilities is about half  of the employment rate for working-age people without disabilities.

Education\u2019s October 2006  draft on-site monitoring protocols call for on-site reviews once every   3 years and are designed to verify and supplement the information it  receives from the states regarding program performance and compliance,  and include reviewing case files and holding public hearings or other  discussions with VR program consumers and advocates, as needed.  Education has not yet conducted any on-site reviews using the revised  protocols, but plans to conduct its first reviews beginning in fiscal year  2007. Once fully implemented, the annual reviews and on-site monitoring,  along with state-level activities, should offer reasonable assurance that the  Supported Employment State Grants program is in compliance with  applicable laws and regulations and the data that states submit to  Education annually are accurate.", "In addition, we found that all four states we visited had their own  accountability procedures for ensuring that VR grant funds, including  Supported Employment State Grants funds, were being used in  accordance with federal laws and regulations. For example, the New York  state VR agency has configured its automated information management  system in a way that only authorizes payment for supported employment  services to providers that have a contract to provide these services, at the  contracted rates. In addition, three of the four states had adopted  performance-based contracting systems, whereby vendors providing  supported employment services, such as job coaching or training, are  required to demonstrate progress toward required milestones in order to  receive payment from the state agencies, and VR counselors monitor their  progress on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Provides Little Oversight of the Randolph- Sheppard Program", "paragraphs": ["Education provides little oversight of the Randolph-Sheppard program.  Despite being required to conduct periodic evaluations of the program and  being responsible for approving states\u2019 rules and regulations for  implementing the Randolph-Sheppard Act, Education has no formal  procedures for evaluating state programs. In addition to lacking  procedures, Education has performed few on-site monitoring reviews of  SLAs in recent years. According to agency officials, Education has  performed five on-site monitoring reviews since the beginning of fiscal  year 2005 and had performed no recent site visits in the four states that we  visited. Education\u2019s oversight activities primarily consist of collecting data  from states through annual reports from the SLAs that administer the  program and providing requested technical assistance. Although the states  report considerable information including earnings data; the number of  vendors, facilities, individuals employed by vendors; types of facilities;  costs; and sources of funding, Education does not test the accuracy of data  that it requires states to report, nor does the agency routinely analyze the  data to assess program performance and management. As a result,  Education cannot assess trends in performance, identify possible best  practices, or help states that may need assistance. Upon request,  Education also provides technical assistance to SLAs. According to  Education officials, technical assistance and guidance is regularly  provided to SLAs through telephone calls and written correspondence,  including e-mails, with staff on specific questions.", "In its oversight role, Education has not provided clear guidance to states  on emerging issues that could have nationwide implications. Instead,  Education responds to individual state concerns and convenes panels to  arbitrate disputes that SLAs are unable to resolve. As a result, states have  different policies regarding the permissibility of teaming agreements,  which partner licensed vendors with commercial food operators in order  to help manage larger food service operations at dining facilities at  military bases. SLAs may have such agreements for various reasons, such  as state program officials\u2019 lack of expertise or licensed vendors\u2019  inexperience running such facilities. In these cases, the licensed vendor  generally does not operate the food service facilities, but rather manages  some aspects of food service operations. For example, one of the states  we visited (Kansas) had a teaming agreement. One of the states we visited  (New York) does not currently allow teaming agreements, while another  (Arizona) has no policy regarding teaming agreements. The fourth state,  North Carolina, permits teaming agreements but does not currently have  any as of June 2006.", "Although Education has noted the increasing use of teaming agreements, it  has not issued guidance to the SLAs directly addressing whether these are  in keeping with the spirit of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, or whether they  should be subject to limitations, despite concerns expressed by states and  others. For example, the California State Auditor found that by allowing  teaming agreements, the SLA had inadequately protected the interests of  the state and licensed vendors. The SLA had not (1) ensured that written  contracts existed before beginning operations, (2) analyzed the investment  and return on investment of the teaming agreement to the program and  licensed vendors, (3) adequately reviewed the teaming agreements, or   (4) ensured that the commercial food service operators were paying their  fair share of program costs. In addition, the Georgia State Auditor  identified some concerns about teaming agreements, including the failure  to define the duties for participating licensed vendors, resulting in these  vendors having little, if any, responsibility for the overall operation and  success of subcontracted food services. Further, the auditor noted that the  program is not ensuring that the commercial food service operators are  making progress toward the program\u2019s goal that licensed vendors  eventually assume responsibility for operating the facility.", "Additionally, Education has not provided clear guidance or policies  regarding when federal agencies may charge fees or commissions to  licensed vendors as a condition of operating a vending facility on federal  property. The Randolph-Sheppard Act has been interpreted to prohibit  commissions unless federal agencies obtain written approval from the  Secretary of Education. We found that licensed vendors have paid  commissions or fees in some locations but not in others and the federal  agencies had not obtained approval from Education. For example, in one  state we visited (Kansas), at least one licensed vendor was required to pay  1.5 percent of total revenues to the U.S. Postal Service in exchange for  permission to operate vending facilities on the agency\u2019s properties.  However, Education has not prohibited such practices or required the  Postal Service or other federal agencies charging commissions to obtain  written approval. Furthermore, officials in Kansas have chosen not to  dispute it. According to agency officials, Education has never approved  such a limitation and cannot routinely monitor state-level or vendor- specific business negotiations, but would intervene to bring the parties  together in an attempt to resolve disputes or make clear the requirements  of the Randolph-Sheppard Act.", "Although Education has exercised little oversight for this program, the  four SLAs that we visited had certain procedures in place that should, if  consistently operated along with other certain complementary processes  and procedures such as management\u2019s monitoring of performance over  time, help safeguard program assets. SLA officials obtained cash register  receipts, daily reports on business activities, or monthly reports submitted  by the vendors to review the financial operations for these programs.  However, audits of programs in other states have reported certain issues  relating to the accountability of state-operated programs under the  Randolph-Sheppard Act. For example, the Michigan Auditor General  reported that SLA staff did not comply with established equipment  inventory control procedures for program equipment and could not  account for equipment inventory, placing inventory at risk of  misappropriation. Further, the California State Auditor reported that,  among other things, the SLA has not followed up on missing financial  reports from licensed vendors and has not been able to monitor licensed  vendors\u2019 financial problems properly. In addition, the auditor found that  the SLA was not adequately pursuing past-due commissions owed to the  program by private businesses operating vending machines on federal  properties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Committee for Purchase Delegates Most Oversight Responsibilities for JWOD to Two Organizations That Represent the Interests of the Agencies They Oversee", "paragraphs": ["The Committee for Purchase has established procedures for monitoring  and overseeing the JWOD program, but has delegated most of the  responsibility for monitoring participating JWOD nonprofit agencies to  two central nonprofit agencies. As of April 2006, NIB officials reported  that they worked with 81 participating JWOD nonprofit agencies that  employed individuals who are blind, and NISH officials reported that they  worked with 552 JWOD nonprofit agencies that employed individuals with  other severe disabilities. In particular, although the Committee for  Purchase must approve the nonprofit agencies\u2019 participation in the  program, it relies on the central nonprofit agencies to certify that:    75 percent or more of the direct labor hours under JWOD contracts  are performed by individuals who are blind or have severe  disabilities, and if not, that there is a suitable plan in place to bring  this percentage up to the required level;    agencies maintain required documentation for each of these    agencies function as nonprofit entities serving individuals who are  blind or have severe disabilities;    agencies have a required job placement program; and    agencies comply with applicable occupational safety and health  standards.", "The Committee for Purchase requires that the JWOD nonprofit agencies  certify annually that they are in compliance with program requirements  but does not routinely verify this information, relying instead on the  central nonprofit agencies to do so. According to agency officials, the  Committee for Purchase performs about 20 field visits annually, visiting up  to 3 agencies per visit, or about 60 of the more than 600 participating  nonprofit agencies. At this rate, the Committee for Purchase is unable to  satisfy its own requirements to perform on-site compliance reviews at  each fully compliant participating nonprofit agency every 5 years.", "The Committee for Purchase\u2019s regulations create at least two problems for  NIB and NISH: the potential for a conflict of interest resulting from a lack  of organizational independence as well as disincentives to perform their  monitoring duties effectively. Specifically, these regulations require that  NIB and NISH, on behalf of the Committee for Purchase, monitor the  compliance of JWOD nonprofit agencies, but, at the same time, represent  them in their dealings with the Committee for Purchase. Moreover, the  regulations also permit NIB and NISH to charge a fee based on JWOD  nonprofit agencies\u2019 sales to the government that does not exceed the limit  set by the Committee for Purchase, and require the nonprofit agencies to  pay that fee in order to remain in good standing in the program. This  system of compensation may create a disincentive for NIB and NISH to  identify instances of noncompliance that could result in the JWOD  nonprofit agency losing its contract, especially for those JWOD nonprofit  agencies that are generating large volumes of JWOD sales. Finally,  although the regulations and procedures provide for a number of duties  that the central nonprofit agencies must perform, they do not specify  actions the Committee for Purchase can take if the central nonprofit  agencies fail to execute these duties.", "NIB and NISH officials reported that they monitor JWOD nonprofit  agencies\u2019 compliance with relevant laws and regulations by conducting on- site reviews of nonprofit agencies every 3 years, and require quarterly  statistical reports from the agencies they oversee. The Committee for  Purchase has established procedures for these reviews that require each  central nonprofit agency to use a standardized review sheet to assess  whether the JWOD nonprofit agency is compliant in 11 different program  areas, including the percentage of direct labor hours performed by  individuals who are blind or have severe disabilities, documentation of an  employee\u2019s disability, and an evaluation of whether or not the individual is  capable of competitive employment. The on-site reviews are the primary  means for NIB and NISH to test the accuracy of the data that the JWOD  nonprofit agencies submit, but the scope of the reviews may not be  sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the accuracy of all of the  data. For example, NIB and NISH officials reported that they test the  accuracy of the data for percentage of direct labor hours by reviewing a  sample of case files, but they do not verify other data, such as job  placement and upward mobility statistics. Further, they do not always  report instances of noncompliance they find to the Committee for  Purchase.", "In the states we visited, reports from NIB\u2019s and NISH\u2019s on-site reviews  generally showed that the JWOD nonprofit agencies were in compliance  with program requirements, and most files contained the required  documentation. Eleven of 13 agencies that we visited provided  documentation of the results of their most recent on-site reviews showing  they were in compliance. However, in our limited reviews of 137 case files  at these 13 agencies, we found that 5 of 8 NISH agencies had at least 1 file  that lacked the required medical documentation of a worker\u2019s disability,  and that 3 of these 8 NISH agencies had at least 1 file that lacked the  required documentation on competitive employment. We also found that  one of the five NIB agencies we visited had one case file that lacked the  required medical documentation. In sum, 11 percent of the files we  reviewed at the NIB and NISH agencies we visited lacked the required  medical or competitive employment documentation.", "A serious instance of noncompliance escaped detection by the responsible  central nonprofit agency (NISH) and the Committee for Purchase. In this  case, the National Center for the Employment of the Disabled (NCED) in  El Paso, Texas, failed to use workers with severe disabilities to perform  the required percentage of direct labor hours on its JWOD contracts,  which were valued at over $200 million. Instead, NCED inflated its  reported percentage by improperly including economically disadvantaged  workers. The problems at NCED were detected not through routine  monitoring, but rather through an anonymous tip to the Committee for  Purchase, and resulted in as many as 1,144 JWOD jobs being lost to  individuals who did not have severe disabilities during fiscal years 2004  and 2005. The JWOD nonprofit agency took actions prescribed by the  Committee for Purchase to come into compliance, including dividing the  agency\u2019s operations into two different units\u2014one for JWOD work and one  for commercial activities\u2014and the Committee for Purchase is satisfied  with the actions taken.", "The definition of a severe disability in the law allows for differing  interpretations, which may complicate efforts to ensure compliance for  agencies that serve individuals who have severe disabilities. The statutory  definition of blindness is fairly straightforward: a lack of visual acuity of  not more than 20/200 in the better eye with correcting lenses or a limited  field of vision of not more than 20 degrees. In contrast, the definition of a  severe disability requires a diagnosis of a residual, physical or mental  impairment that limits functioning in one of five areas (mobility,  communication, self-care, self-direction, and work tolerance or work  skills), and a determination that the impairment has rendered the  individual unable to engage in normal competitive employment over an  extended period of time. Despite the fact that the definition is subject to  interpretation, the Committee for Purchase has offered little additional  guidance that would clarify when disabilities that may not normally be  considered severe could be, such as the conditions under which a  recovering alcoholic or a person with diabetes could be considered to  have a severe disability. During our review of case files at 13 JWOD  nonprofit agencies, we noted instances where it was unclear in the  medical documentation that the disability was severe, such as a case in  which the individual was diabetic, with no indicated symptoms, and  another in which the individual was diagnosed as having an aggressive  personality."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["All four of these programs generally provide training and employment  opportunities that might not otherwise be available for individuals who are  blind or have severe disabilities. However, two are hampered by  weaknesses in performance management and program oversight that  signal a need for stronger federal leadership. Absent federal goals for the  Randolph-Sheppard program and routine analyses and reports from  Education on states\u2019 program operations and performance, little is known  about how this program is improving the lives of participants. Having such  information about outcomes is an important component of any program,  and essential during times of fiscal austerity. Further, by not exercising  more oversight and issuing clear guidance to all states on emerging issues  that could affect program participants, Education may be missing an  important opportunity to help states improve program operations or  proactively respond to these issues. While recognizing that there may be  increased costs for improved oversight, these costs could be minimized by,  for example, monitoring Randolph-Sheppard activities as part of  Education\u2019s oversight for the VR program. Although the Committee for  Purchase has made significant progress in developing goals for the JWOD  program, some of the goals lack key elements\u2014clear measures and  performance targets. Also, the current approach for overseeing nonprofit  agencies operating under the JWOD program poses difficult challenges for  the two central nonprofit agencies in managing the conflicts of interest  that may exist because of their lack of organizational independence, and  therefore demands strong and effective oversight from the Committee for  Purchase. Ensuring program integrity is particularly important for JWOD  since nonprofit agencies are given a competitive advantage over private  business and industry in the federal procurement system to ensure that  opportunities are provided to individuals with severe disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["1.  To improve program performance management and oversight, we  recommend that the Secretary of Education provide more effective  leadership of the Randolph-Sheppard program by:    establishing performance goals to identify desired programwide  outcomes that assess states\u2019 licensed vendor programs\u2019  performance as a whole in achieving established goals;    being more proactive in disseminating clear, consistent and routine  guidance about program requirements and prohibited practices to  federal agencies and states; and    strengthening their monitoring of SLA and Randolph-Sheppard  program performance in a cost-effective manner.  2.  To improve program performance management, we recommend that  the Chairperson for the Committee for Purchase assess goals and  measures for JWOD to ensure that they are clear, measurable and  continue to capture key aspects of program performance as the  Committee for Purchase continues to develop its performance  management system.  3.  To help ensure that JWOD nonprofit agencies comply with program  laws and regulations, we recommend that the Chairperson of the  Committee for Purchase improve procedures for overseeing these  agencies. This could include requiring the central nonprofit agencies to  enter into written contracts with the Committee for Purchase that  clearly lay out their oversight responsibilities and the consequences for  failing to fulfill them, providing a means of compensating the central  nonprofit agencies for their services that provides an incentive for  effective enforcement, or having the Committee for Purchase assume  greater responsibility for oversight of JWOD nonprofit agencies, by  performing more on-site compliance reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the  Department of Education and the Committee for Purchase.

Some of the steps Education cited  included developing appropriate performance goals, enhancing its efforts  to provide clear and consistent guidance, and improving program  monitoring. We believe these efforts will help to improve program  performance management and oversight.", "The Committee for Purchase agreed that its performance goals and  measures for the JWOD program should be assessed to ensure that they  are clear and quantifiable. However, the Committee for Purchase  commented that its regulations did not intend for \u201ctraining\u201d to be taken  literally as a mission output and, therefore, the agency did not establish a  separate goal for training activities. Rather, the Committee for Purchase  stated that it viewed training as an important, but incremental activity that  equips persons who are blind or have severe disabilities with the  knowledge and skills necessary for employment, which it considers the  paramount goal of the program. Also, the Committee for Purchase believes  the reporting requirements for establishing a separate goal for training  would burden the nonprofit agencies. To avoid confusion over the  Committee for Purchase\u2019s goals in the future, the agency plans to clarify  its regulations. While we believe that training is key to preparing persons  who are blind or have severe disabilities for employment, we can  understand the Committee for Purchase\u2019s view that the paramount  program goal is employment. Clarifying the regulations regarding the  Committee for Purchase\u2019s intent with respect to the role of training may  make it clear that a separate goal for training is not essential.", "With respect to ensuring effective monitoring and oversight, the  Committee for Purchase agreed that more guidance was needed to help  ensure that JWOD nonprofit agencies comply with program laws and  regulations. Additionally, the Committee for Purchase commented that it  has recently begun taking steps to address possible conflicts of interest  between the two roles played by the central nonprofit agencies. The  Committee for Purchase also commented that it is considering  establishing other oversight and compliance mechanisms and in its  proposed fiscal year 2007 budget included three new positions and  additional funding for oversight, compliance monitoring, and program  review.

During these visits, we  met with state VR agency officials to discuss the Supported Employment,  Projects with Industry (PWI), JWOD, and Randolph-Sheppard programs. In  addition, we visited 4 PWI grantees, 13 JWOD nonprofit agencies, and   7 Randolph-Sheppard vendors. Several criteria were used in selecting the  states to visit. States that were considered had all four of the employment- related disability programs currently present and operating in them. States  varied in the administration of their VR programs with about half of all  states having two separate programs\u2014one for the general VR and a  separate one for the blind\u2014and the remaining states having only one VR  program. We selected two states (New York and North Carolina) that had  both general and blind VR programs, and two states (Arizona and Kansas)  that had one VR program that served all people with disabilities seeking  employment-related assistance. In addition, we selected states based on a  review of information about the characteristics of NIB and NISH member  nonprofit agencies to include both large and small, urban and rural, and  different kinds of work performed (products and services). States were  also selected to include geographic diversity.", "During the state visits, we met with officials representing each of the four  programs. For Education\u2019s programs, we interviewed local officials of  nonprofit agencies with PWI grants, state program administrators for the  state-operated Randolph-Sheppard programs as well as licensed vendors,  and state VR officials responsible for administering the Supported  Employment State Grants program. For JWOD, we interviewed chief  executive officers or their representatives of the JWOD nonprofit agencies  with current federal contracts to provide goods and/or services. In  addition, during these meetings, we collected documentation to ascertain  how the federal and two central nonprofit agencies were monitoring their  respective programs. We also reviewed the records of 137 workers who  were blind or had severe disabilities, selecting some records at each of the  13 JWOD nonprofit agencies we visited. The records were randomly  selected from lists of current JWOD workers. A random number generator  was used to assign a number to each name on the active roster and  records were selected on the basis of the number\u2014starting with the  lowest number. During the record review, we assessed whether the  agencies\u2019 files of workers who were blind or had severe disabilities  contained required medical documentation and assessment of ability to  work in competitive employment.", "We determined that the fiscal and program data we used in this report was  reliable for our purposes. To make this determination, we assessed the  reliability of fiscal and programmatic data by interviewing officials  knowledgeable about the data and the steps they take to ensure accuracy.  For Supported Employment, prior GAO work had systematically tested  relevant variables, including all 22 variables of the services provided. In  addition, for this engagement we obtained documentation from two states  (Kansas and New York) that described the states\u2019 procedures for checking  the reliability of their data. Programmatic data collected by the Committee  for Purchase for the JWOD program, and Education for the PWI and  Randolph-Sheppard programs were self-reported by local program  officials. For example, reviews of the information reported by officials for  the PWI program were generally performed by project managers. For  fiscal reporting, however, we found that JWOD nonprofit agencies, PWI  grantees, and licensed vendors generally had systems and procedures for  stronger accounting of financial data. For example, state licensing agency  (SLA) officials used cash register receipts and routine reports on business  activities submitted by the licensed vendors to the SLAs to review the  financial information for these programs.
