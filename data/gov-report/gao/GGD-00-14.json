While the language of section 1385 lists only the Army and the Air Force, DOD has made the provisions of section 1385 applicable to the Department of the Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps through a DOD directive (DOD Directive 5525.5, Jan. 15, 1986).", "Congress has enacted various pieces of legislation authorizing a military role in supporting civilian law enforcement agencies. For example, in the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1982 (P.L. 97-86), Congress authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide certain assistance-type activities for civilian law enforcement activities. This legislation also provided, however, that such U.S. military assistance does not include or permit participation in a search, seizure, arrest, or other similar activity, unless participation in such activity is otherwise authorized by law.", "Beginning in the early 1980s, Congress authorized an expanded military role in supporting domestic drug enforcement efforts. As part of the national counterdrug effort, for example, the U.S. military provides federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies with a wide range of services, such as air and ground transportation, communications, intelligence, and technology support. DOD counterdrug intelligence support is provided by Joint Task Force Six, which is based at Fort Bliss (El Paso, TX). This component coordinates operational intelligence in direct support of drug law enforcement agencies.", "Moreover, under congressional authorization that was initially provided in 1989 (32 U.S.C. 112), DOD may provide funds annually to state governors who submit plans specifying how the respective state\u2019s National Guard is to be used to support drug interdiction and counterdrug activities. Such operations are conducted under the command and control of the state governor rather than the U.S. military. Also, federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel may receive counterdrug training at schools managed by the National Guard in California, Florida, and Mississippi.", "In 1989, Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense to transfer to federal and state agencies excess DOD personal property suitable for use in counterdrug activities, without cost to the recipient agency. In 1996, Congress authorized such transfers of excess DOD personal property suitable for use in law enforcement generally and not just specifically for counterdrug efforts. This Law Enforcement Support Program is managed by the Defense Logistics Agency.", "Military law enforcement agencies are major consumers of forensic laboratory services. The Army operates the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (Fort Gillem, GA), which provides forensic support regarding questioned documents, trace evidence, firearms and tool marks, fingerprints, imaging and technical services, drug chemistry, and serology. The Navy operates two limited-service forensic laboratories, which are referred to as Naval Criminal Investigative Service Regional Forensic Laboratories (Norfolk, VA, and San Diego, CA). Both Navy laboratories provide forensic support regarding latent prints, drug chemistry, arson, and questioned documents. The Air Force is the executive agent of the DOD Computer Forensics Laboratory (Linthicum, MD), which processes digital and analog evidence for DOD counterintelligence operations and programs as well as fraud and other criminal investigations.
