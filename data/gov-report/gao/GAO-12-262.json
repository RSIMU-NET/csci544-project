Federal tax laws and regulations permit use of multiple tax expenditures or tax expenditures with other federal spending programs, but often with limits. For instance, employers cannot claim more than one employment tax credit for the same wages paid to an individual. Besides IRS, administering many community development tax expenditures involves other federal agencies as well as state and local governments.

GAO has long recommended that the Executive Branch improve its ability to assess tax expenditures, but little progress has been made in developing an evaluation framework. Generally, neither these agencies, nor the Department of the Treasury or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have assessed or plan to assess community development tax expenditures individually or as part of a crosscutting review. The Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) calls for a more coordinated approach to focusing on results and improving performance. OMB is to select a limited number of long-term, outcome-oriented crosscutting priority goals and assess whether the relevant federal agencies and activities\u2014including tax expenditures\u2014are contributing to these goals. These assessments could help identify data needed to assess tax expenditures and generate evaluations of tax expenditures\u2019 effect on community development.

In  reviewing this literature, we focused on studies that attempted to analyze  the impact of the tax expenditures on community development through  empirical methods.

We identified one study on  the rehabilitation tax credits that attempted to measure one aspect of  community development. We did not identify any empirical studies on  disaster tax relief provisions. The scarcity of literature on some tax  expenditures may be due to the fact that establishing that a community  development tax expenditure or spending program has causal impact on  economic growth in a specific community can be challenging.

Many of the  eligible communities may already have significant business activities that  could mask NMTC impacts. Limitations associated with available data  also made it difficult to determine whether benefits generated in a low- income community outside the scope of a particular project are the direct  result of the NMTC program. As discussed above, CDFI Fund is  collecting additional data on the use of the NMTC that may provide further  insights into its use and impact on communities. For example, CDFI Fund  is now collecting data on the amount of equity that CDEs estimate will be  left in the businesses at the end of the 7-year period in which tax credits  can be claimed.

Increased investment in low-income communities can occur when NMTC  investors increase their total funds available for investment or when they  shift funds from other uses. A complete evaluation of the program\u2019s  effectiveness would require determining the costs of the program,  including any behavioral changes by taxpayers that may be introduced by  shifted investment funds.

Our 2010 report on the EZ/RC program reviewed seven  academic studies of Round 1 projects and found that the evaluations  used different methods and reported varying results with regard to  poverty and unemployment. For example, one study concluded that the  program reduces poverty and unemployment, while another study found  that the program did not improve those measures of community  development. As with the NMTC, our prior EZ/RC work has demonstrated  challenges in measuring the effects of the program. For example, data  limitations make it difficult to thoroughly evaluate the program\u2019s  effectiveness in that use of the EZ/RC Employment Credit cannot be tied  to specific communities.

Two studies have found lower unemployment in the  designated areas where the provisions have been used relative to similar  non-EZ areas. Specifically, one study reviewed federal and state  enterprise zones and found positive impacts on local labor markets in  terms of the unemployment rate and poverty rate.

The second study focused on Round 1 of  the EZ program and found that the EZ designation substantially increased  employment in zone neighborhoods, particularly for zone residents.  Importantly, the researchers examined Round 1 of the program that relied  on a mix of tax benefits and grant funding. In addition, another study  found that EZ program results seem to vary among different types of  businesses within the designated zones. For example, researchers  found that EZ tax incentives increase the share of retail and service  sector establishments but decreases the share of transportation, finance,  and real estate industries. They noted that the effectiveness of the EZ  wage credit may be affected by the types of industries that are located in  the designated area.

In addition, it is difficult to determine whether  the spending or tax incentives were responsible for any increases in  economic activity. CRS\u2019s review of academic literature found modest, if  any, effects of the program and called into the question their cost- effectiveness.

If Congress authorizes similar programs that  rely heavily on tax benefits in the future, it would be prudent for federal  agencies responsible for administering the programs to collect information  necessary for determining whether the tax benefits are effective in  achieving program goals.

Our prior work on the GO Zone reported that bonds were  awarded on a first-come, first-served basis that led to awarding bond  allocation to projects in less damaged areas in the zone because  businesses in these areas were ready to apply for and issue bonds before  businesses in more damaged areas could make use of the incentive.", "Thus, assessing the impact of disaster relief on an entire zone may not  reflect how the provisions affected specific areas within the zone.

Further, relatively  few evaluations of the effectiveness of community development tax  expenditures have been done and when they have been done, results  have often been mixed about their effects. These issues are familiar and  long-standing for tax expenditures generally. We have made  recommendations to OMB in 1994 and 2005 to move the Executive  Branch forward in obtaining and using information to evaluate tax  expenditures\u2019 performance, which can help in comparing their  performance to that of related federal efforts.", "GPRAMA offers a new opportunity to make progress on these issues. For  those limited areas where OMB sets long-term, outcome-oriented,  crosscutting priority goals for the federal government, a more coordinated  and focused effort should ensue to identify, collect, and use the  information needed to assess how well the government is achieving the  goals and how those efforts can be improved.

Given the overlap and fragmentation across  community development tax and spending programs, coordinated  congressional efforts, such as joint hearings, may facilitate crosscutting  reviews and ensure Executive Branch efforts are mutually reinforcing.", "While GPRAMA provides a powerful opportunity to review how tax  expenditures contribute to crosscutting goals, progress is likely to be  incremental and require sustained focus. Evaluating the impact of  community development efforts is inherently difficult and definitive  performance conclusions often cannot be drawn.

Some of the budget proposals relate to tax  expenditures covered in this report, and we updated the text to reflect the  President\u2019s latest proposals. We also updated our report to reflect the  release of new interim crosscutting priority goals and that the  Administration has identified some tax expenditures that contribute to  these goals, as required under GPRAMA. OMB staff said that this is a  significant step forward and will be important for broader GPRAMA  implementation over 2012 and 2013. We agree that this inclusion of tax  expenditures along with related other programs in the GPRAMA goals is  an important step toward providing policymakers with the breadth of  information needed to understand the full federal effort to accomplish  national objectives. Finally, OMB staff expressed concern that we were  suggesting that tax expenditures be addressed through a \u201cone size fits  all\u201d framework. We do not believe this report or earlier products suggest  that assessing the performance of tax expenditures be done in only one  way. We have emphasized the need for greater scrutiny of tax  expenditures and more transparency over how well they work and how  they compare to other related federal programs.", "In its comments, HUD described the report as substantive and  comprehensive in addressing community development tax incentives with  accurate information about the EZ/RC tax expenditures and HUD\u2019s role in  their administration. However, HUD expressed the view that we had  minimal justification for our matters for Congress to consider using the  GPRAMA consultation process to express congressional priorities related  to community development and to focus attention on community  development tax expenditures\u2019 performance through its oversight  activities. We disagree. The basic issues we found in this review\u2014the all  too often lack of even basic information about tax expenditures\u2019 use and  the relative paucity of evaluations of their performance\u2014are among the  key issues that could be mitigated through GPRAMA crosscutting goals  and Congress\u2019s oversight activities. HUD also said we had skirted the  issue of identifying programs with the greatest probability for elimination  due to duplication, fragmentation, and overlap. This was not among our  review\u2019s objectives and we believe the type of information we present can  assist Congress in understanding what information is available to support  such decisions. As we have previously reported, agencies engaging  Congress in identifying which issues to address and what to measure are  critical, and GPRAMA significantly enhances requirements on the  consultation process. With the release of the interim crosscutting goals,  we believe that Congress has a continuing opportunity to express its  priorities regarding community development ahead of the next goal cycle  due in February 2014. HUD also noted the expiration of some tax  expenditures and sought clarification about their inclusion in the report.  Our report includes recently expired tax expenditures and where  applicable discusses our prior findings and suggestions for Congress to  consider if it wishes to extend the tax expenditures that have expired or  create similar new ones.

Interior  characterized our report as expressing the view that unwarranted overlap,  fragmentation, or duplication existed involving the 20 percent historic  rehabilitation credit that Interior\u2019s NPS helps administer. Interior agreed  that the tax credit\u2014which has a primary purpose to preserve and  rehabilitate historic buildings\u2014has a two-fold mission to also promote  community development by revitalizing historic districts and  neighborhoods. However, Interior disagreed that the historic rehabilitation  tax credit overlaps or duplicates with other community development tax  expenditures. Interior stated that only the tax credit has a specific purpose  to preserve historic buildings, that the tax credit is not targeted to certain  census tracts or low-income areas, and that Congress generally did not  exclude historic tax credit users from also using other federal programs.  In addition, Interior said that the administration of the historic rehabilitation  tax credit was not fragmented, but instead was an example of joint  administration that effectively draws upon the best resources of two  federal agencies in a coordinated way to implement the law. Finally,  Interior disagreed with our finding that limited information is available  about the effectiveness of the 20 percent historic rehabilitation tax credit.", "Our report does not characterize any overlap, fragmentation, or  duplication as \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Rather, we provide a factual description  based on standard definitions used in many GAO reports of the  relationships between the various tax expenditures that have at least a  partial purpose of supporting community development. We make the  same point that Interior raises as well\u2014that Congress was aware of and  often designed rules to govern the interrelationships among these tax  expenditures. Accordingly, our report says these interrelationships do not  necessarily represent unnecessary duplication. Based on Interior\u2019s  comments, however, we further clarified our text to note that one of the  differences between the historic rehabilitation credit and the other  community development tax expenditures is that the rehabilitation credit  targets certain older structures. Regarding Interior\u2019s comment about  fragmentation in the credit\u2019s administration, our report describes the roles  of IRS and NPS and says fragmentation may sometimes be necessary  when the resources and expertise of more than one agency are required,  such as in the case of NPS overseeing technical standards for historic  preservation. As we reported, however, fragmentation can result in  administrative burdens when an applicant needs to apply at multiple  agencies to finance a specific project, such as restoring a historic building  as low-income housing. Finally, regarding Interior\u2019s comments on the  effectiveness of the rehabilitation tax credit, we continue to note that little  is known about the effectiveness of the credit as a community  development program given that we identified only one empirical analysis  of the effect of the tax credit on community development. Interior pointed  specifically to reports based on an economic model NPS helped fund.  However, as our report states, the modeling reports did not assess what  would have happened in the absence of the historic rehabilitation tax  credits or compare development in tax credit project communities to  similar communities.", "In its comment letter (reprinted in app. VIII), the CDFI Fund said that it  appreciated GAO\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen  performance measurement and evaluation of community and economic  development programs.

On  enactment, JCT projected total budget effects of $6,109 million for fiscal years 2006 through 2015.", "The Gulf Opportunity Zone package was enacted by the Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-135). Counties and parishes in  Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas that warranted additional, long-term federal assistance following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma  in 2005 were designated as Katrina, Rita and/or Wilma GO Zones. Portions of the Katrina and Rita GO Zones overlapped with counties and parishes  eligible for relief under the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act. The Gulf Opportunity Zone tax package also included some nondisaster-related tax  provisions: election to treat combat pay as earned income for purposes of the Earned Income Tax Credit; modifications of suspension of interest and  penalties where IRS fails to contact taxpayer; authority for undercover operations; disclosure of tax information to facilitate combined employment tax  reporting; disclosure of return information regarding terrorist activities; disclosure of return information to carry out contingent repayment of student  loans; and various tax technical corrections. On enactment, JCT projected total budget effects of $8,715 million for the disaster provisions for fiscal years  2006 through 2015.  The Kansas disaster relief package was enacted by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Pub. L. No. 110-246). The Kansas disaster relief  package targeted 24 counties in Kansas affected by storms and tornadoes that began on May 4, 2007. On enactment, JCT projected total revenue  effects of $63 million for the disaster provisions for fiscal years 2008 though 2018.  The Midwest disaster relief package was enacted by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Energy Improvement and Extension Act of  2008, and Tax Extenders and the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 (Pub.

The listed components  associated with the Midwest disaster relief package do not include rules outlining IRS reporting requirements for contributions to disaster relief; these  rules apply for tax returns due after December 31, 2008.

Certain provisions of  the National Disaster Relief Act of 2008 do not apply to the Midwest disaster areas because the Heartland and Hurricane Ike Disaster Relief Act, part of  the same legislation that resulted in the National Disaster Relief Act, provides other tax benefits. On enactment, JCT projected total revenue effects of  $8,091 million for fiscal years 2009 through 2018.
