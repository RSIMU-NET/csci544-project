In  1996, Congress enacted the Military Housing Privatization Initiative  (MHPI) in response to Department of Defense (DOD) concerns about the  effect of inadequate and poor quality housing on servicemembers and  their families. Since then, private-sector developers and property  management companies, hereafter referred to as private partners, have  assumed primary responsibility for military family housing in the United  States. They are currently responsible for the construction, renovation,  maintenance, and repair of about 99 percent of domestic military family  housing in the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. Over the  last few years, reports of the presence of lead-based paint and other  hazards, such as mold and pest infestations, have raised questions about  DOD\u2019s management and oversight of privatized housing.", "My testimony today summarizes preliminary observations from our  ongoing review assessing (1) DOD\u2019s oversight of privatized military  housing for servicemembers and their families, (2) efforts of the military  departments to communicate their roles and responsibilities to  servicemembers and their families, and (3) DOD and private partner  development and implementation of initiatives to improve privatized  housing.", "For our ongoing work, we reviewed DOD policies and guidance related to  the administration of the MHPI program; analyzed available private  partner data on work orders from October 2016 through April 2019 from  each of the 79 MHPI family housing projects; visited a non-generalizable  sample of 10 installations selected to represent each of the military  departments, six private partners\u2014including the five largest who own the  majority of privatized military housing\u2014and geographic and climate  diversity; and conducted 15 focus groups with residents at the 10  installations we visited. We also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of  ground leases and other MHPI project documents, including leases and  project documents for the installations we visited, as well as a sample of  leases from other locations not included in our site visits. We reviewed  the implementation and results of various resident satisfaction surveys  conducted by the military departments and private partners. To  understand roles and responsibilities and the management of privatized  housing, we interviewed Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and  military department officials, and contacted representatives from each of  the 14 private partners.

From the inception of MHPI,  the military departments were provided with various authorities to obtain  private-sector financing and management to repair, renovate, construct,  and operate military housing in the United States and its territories.  Through these authorities, the military departments have entered into a  series of agreements with private partners to provide housing to  servicemembers and their families. The military departments have  flexibility in how they structure their privatized housing projects, but  typically the military departments lease land to private developers for 50- year terms and convey existing housing located on the leased land to the  developer for the duration of the lease. The developer then becomes  responsible for renovating and constructing new housing and for the daily  management of these housing units. At the end of fiscal year 2017, 14  private partners were responsible for 79 privatized military family housing  projects\u201434 for the Army, 32 for the Air Force, and 13 for the Navy and  Marine Corps\u2014in the United States, each of which includes housing at  one or more military installation.", "The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Facilities Management,  under the authority, direction, and control of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment, is responsible for all matters related to MHPI  and is the program manager for all DOD housing, whether DOD-owned,  DOD-leased, or privatized. In this capacity, the Deputy Assistant  Secretary is to provide both guidance and general procedures related to  military housing privatization, as well as required annual reports to  Congress on the status of privatized military housing projects. However,  it is the responsibility of the military departments to execute and manage  privatized housing projects, including conducting financial management  and monitoring their portfolio of projects. Each military department has  issued guidance that outlines its responsibilities for privatized housing,  such as which offices are responsible for overseeing privatized housing  projects.", "We have previously reported on DOD\u2019s privatized housing program.

DOD guidance requires that the military departments ensure  eligible personnel have access to quality housing facilities and services  that generally reflect contemporary living standards. Further, DOD\u2019s  housing manual states that because privatization creates a long-term  governmental interest in privatized housing, it is essential that projects be  attentively monitored. Through its guidance, DOD delegates oversight  responsibility of the individual privatized housing projects to each of the  military departments. In addition, according to documents we reviewed,  individual project business agreements set guidelines that convey the  management, operation, and maintenance duties to the private partner, with the caveat that the military departments still have the right to access  the premises or private partner records to ensure compliance with  applicable laws.

Daily oversight of a  project\u2019s management and operations is to be conducted by each  installation\u2019s military housing office. Military housing officials told us  activities to monitor the physical condition of housing units generally  include reviewing sample work order requests, following up with a sample  of residents to check on their experience with recently completed work,  and inspecting housing units during the change of occupancy process.  Based on our preliminary observations, the implementation and scope of  these activities varies and can be limited. For example, during our site  visits conducted from June through August 2019, we identified the  following installation-specific practices:", "Military housing office officials at one Army installation told us that  they inspect 100 percent of housing units that have completed change  of occupancy maintenance. In contrast, officials from an Air Force  installation told us that they inspect 10 to 20 percent of housing units  that have completed change of occupancy maintenance.", "Military housing officials at one Marine Corps installation told us that  for one of the two partners that own housing on the base, they had  access to only 3 percent of completed work order tickets from the  previous month, as reported to them by the private partner.

Reviews of compliance with a project\u2019s business agreements are a joint  effort between the local military housing office, the private partners,  military department installation commands, and other echelons of  command. These reviews can include neighborhood tours to view  project amenities such as community centers, playgrounds, and pools, all  of which are owned, maintained, and operated by the private partner  companies, as well as exteriors of housing units. However, our  preliminary work showed these reviews have been limited in the scope of  their assessment of the physical condition of the housing units, as interior  walk-throughs may have been limited to just a few housing units at each  installation.", "According to military department officials, each department is currently  taking steps to revise guidance and standardize daily oversight activities  in an effort to provide consistent oversight across projects and  installations, and to increase the focus of oversight on the physical  condition of housing. The military departments are taking additional steps,  such as increasing staffing levels, improving training for military housing  office officials, and ensuring that housing officials have independent  access to data. However, each military department is working to  implement service-specific initiatives with only limited guidance from OSD  on the level of oversight expected of the services as it relates to the  condition of the housing. While existing OSD guidance provides  objectives to the military departments for oversight of the condition of  DOD-owned housing, guidance for privatized housing is focused on the  implementation of projects, construction of new housing units, and  financial management. The guidance does not include objectives for  monitoring the condition of privatized housing projects, such as objectives  focused on both ensuring the operation and maintenance of privatized  housing to standards that provide safe living conditions for  servicemembers and providing authorities to installation commanders to  oversee those standards.

Most but not all of the private partners are  eligible to receive performance incentive fees based on generally meeting  the performance metrics established in each individual project\u2019s business  agreement. Private partner performance is measured through a variety  of metrics, such as resident satisfaction, maintenance management,  project safety, and financial management. To determine how well the  private partners are performing under the metrics, military housing office  officials told us that they rely on a range of specific indicators established  in the project business agreements. However, the indicators themselves  may not provide meaningful information on the private partner\u2019s  performance in maintaining quality housing units. For example, our  preliminary work identified the following:", "Maintenance management. One indicator of performance of  maintenance management that is regularly included in project  business agreements measures how often the property manager\u2019s  response time to work orders meets required time frames established  in the project\u2019s business agreements. While this indicator measures  the timeliness of the private partner\u2019s response, it does not measure  or take into account the quality of the work that was conducted or  whether the resident\u2019s issue was fully addressed. Some projects  include indicators that aim to more directly measure quality, such as  the number of work orders placed during the first 5 business days of  residency, which may indicate the extent to which change of  occupancy maintenance was completed.", "Resident satisfaction. One example of an indicator of resident  satisfaction is whether a project has met the target occupancy rates  established in the business agreements. An OSD official we spoke  with and private partner officials told us they use occupancy as an  indicator of satisfaction based on the assumption that residents would  move if they were dissatisfied with their housing unit. However,  based on our focus groups, this may not be a reliable assumption.  Although most residents are not required to live in military housing,  residents in each of our 15 focus groups indicated a variety of reasons  for choosing to live in privatized housing, many of which did not have  to do with their satisfaction with the quality or condition of their homes.  For example, residents cited factors influencing their decision to live in  privatized housing, such as living in close proximity to military medical  or educational services for children or other family members who  receive benefits through the military\u2019s Exceptional Family Member  Program, access to quality schools, and a lack of safe and  affordable housing in the surrounding community.", "OSD and military department officials we spoke with recognized that the  current metrics do not consistently focus on or prioritize the private  partners\u2019 performance with maintaining housing units and ensuring  resident satisfaction. In October 2019 OSD issued new guidance  standardizing the performance incentive fee framework across the military  departments. According to OSD and the private partners with whom we  spoke, this guidance was developed through a joint effort with the military  departments and the private partners; it provides a framework where the  metrics for resident satisfaction and maintenance management will  account for a majority of the fee, with project safety and financial  performance weighted less heavily. However, according to officials from  OSD and officials we spoke with from each of the military departments,  the specific indicators used to drive the metrics will need to be negotiated  with each of the private partners for each project. Performance indicators  designed to more directly measure the quality of maintenance conducted  on housing units and resident satisfaction will provide military  departments more transparency into private partner performance with  regard to these two important metrics\u2014metrics that are often directly tied  to the performance incentive fees provided to the private partners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and Private Partners Collect Maintenance Data on Privatized Housing, but These Data Are Not Captured Reliably or Consistently for Use in the Ongoing Monitoring of Housing Units", "paragraphs": ["The housing projects\u2019 business agreements typically include a  requirement for the private partner to maintain a records management  system to record, among other things, maintenance work requested and  conducted on each housing unit.

In May 2019, OSD issued its  report for fiscal year 2017, which stated that overall resident satisfaction  for calendar year 2017 was 87 percent. For OSD\u2019s fiscal year 2017  report, the military departments provided data on resident satisfaction  based on information from the annual resident satisfaction surveys.  Specifically, OSD\u2019s instructions to the military departments required the  military departments to report satisfaction based on resident responses to  the question that asks: \u201cWould you recommend privatized housing,\u201d with  results indicating how many tenants responded \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t  know.\u201d", "However, the military departments\u2019 approaches for collecting data in their  annual resident satisfaction surveys varies, which limits their ability to  assess whether residents would recommend privatized housing.

Specifically, if servicemembers are experiencing a dispute with a private  partner, military department guidance establishes varying roles for their  respective military housing office officials. For example, Army policy  states that each installation should have an official tasked with supporting  servicemembers regarding resident issues that cannot be resolved by the  private property manager. This individual is also responsible for resolving  every resident complaint and the military housing office, if required, can  request mediation by the garrison commander.", "Despite this guidance, according to DOD officials, the military  departments had generally decreased their staffing and oversight of daily  privatized housing operations since the enactment of MHPI.

According to an OSD official, a  series of initiatives has been identified and are some are currently in  various phases of development and implementation. Tri-service working  groups, each chaired by a designated military department and comprising  officials and legal counsel from each military department as well as  private partner representatives, are leading efforts to develop and  implement the initiatives. In particular, DOD and the private partners are  collaborating on the following key initiatives:", "Development of a Resident Bill of Rights. The Resident Bill of  Rights is to provide clarity to residents on their rights and  responsibilities while living in privatized military housing.", "Development of a common tenant lease. The common lease  framework will be binding in all 50 states, but also include addendums  to capture state and local laws, as required. The common lease would  provide residents of privatized housing with similar terms in their  leases, regardless of where they are living and which private partner  owns their housing unit.", "Establishment of a resident advocate position. The resident  advocate position, according to an OSD official, will be available to  provide independent advice, education, and support to residents.  However, an OSD official noted that the military departments have not  yet determined whether this individual would be active duty or civilian  and where the position would fall organizationally\u2014specifically,  whether it would be part of the military housing office.", "Development of a standardized adjudication process. The military  departments and private partners are developing a common dispute  resolution process that would apply to all projects. According to OSD,  this process would provide residents the right to have housing issues  heard and resolved by a neutral third party.", "DOD and Congress are exploring additional initiatives and legislative  proposals. However, both DOD and private partner officials have noted  several challenges that could impact their ability to implement some of  these initiatives and legislative proposals. Key challenges include the  following:", "The need to collaborate with and obtain input and agreement  from the large number of stakeholders involved in privatized  housing. Many of the initiatives aimed at improving privatized  housing require not only agreement between DOD and the private  housing partners, but may also require discussion with and approval  by the project bond holders. This requirement could limit the military  departments\u2019 legal authority to unilaterally make changes to existing  business agreements. The private partners noted that the bond  holders may be reluctant to agree to changes to the business  agreements that could result in higher project costs.", "Limited military department resources. The military departments  had reduced their involvement in daily privatized military housing  operations as part of the overall privatization effort. This included  reducing staffing levels at the installations. Each of the military  departments has plans to increase the military housing office staffing  at each installation to allow for enhanced oversight.", "The potential for negative financial impacts to the projects that  may outweigh the intended benefits of the initiatives.  Representatives from many of the private partners we met with  expressed concern that some proposed initiatives may result in a  financial burden for their projects, such as legal fees associated with  the development of a common lease and the various addendums that  would be required; unanticipated costs of hiring outside third party  inspections; or the potential impact to project revenue that would  result from residents withholding rent. Some of the private partners  noted that the financial impact of unfunded requirements to projects  that are already experiencing financial distress could result in even  fewer funds available to reinvest in the physical condition of the  housing units.", "In summary, while the privatization of military housing has resulted in  private partners assuming primary responsibility for military housing, DOD  maintains responsibility for overseeing privatized housing and ensuring  that eligible personnel and their families have access to affordable, quality  housing facilities and services. While DOD and the private partners have  taken steps to address concerns raised about their ability to adequately  maintain and oversee the condition of these housing units and provide  quality housing for servicemembers, the extent to which the efforts will be  sustained and result in improvements remains unclear. We are continuing  our broader review of DOD\u2019s oversight of privatized housing, including the  issues addressed in this statement and will make recommendations as  appropriate in our final report, which we anticipate issuing in early 2020.", "Chairman Inhofe, Ranking Member Reed, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
