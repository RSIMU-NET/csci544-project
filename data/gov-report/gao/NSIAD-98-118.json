In doing so, SMAG is responsible for about two million items, ranging from weapon system spare parts to fuels, food, medical and dental supplies and equipment, and uniforms. SMAG is the largest supply management activity in Defense\u2014it reported $12 billion in revenue and $24.5 billion in inventory for fiscal year 1997.", "SMAG operations are financed as part of the Air Force Working Capital Fund, which was formerly a part of the Defense Business Operations Fund. In December 1996, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) dissolved the Defense Business Operations Fund and created four working capital funds to clearly establish the military services\u2019 and DOD components\u2019 responsibilities for managing the functional and financial aspects of their respective activity groups. The funds are to operate by charging customers the full costs of goods and services provided to them as currently defined in the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Financial Management Regulation, Volume 11B, Reimbursable Operations, Policy and Procedures\u2014Defense Business Operations Fund.", "The primary goal of the current working capital fund financial structure is to focus the attention of all levels of management on the full costs of carrying out certain critical DOD business operations and the management of those costs. Unlike a private sector enterprise which has a profit motive, the four working capital funds are to operate on a break-even basis over time by recovering the full costs incurred in conducting the business operations. Accomplishing this requires DOD managers to become more conscious of operating costs and make fundamental improvements in how DOD conducts business since customers have a defined amount of funds to pay for goods and services. It is critical for the working capital funds to operate efficiently since every dollar spent inefficiently is one less dollar available for other defense spending priorities.", "As figure 1.1 illustrates, SMAG receives orders from customers to purchase inventory items. Customers use appropriated funds, primarily Operation and Maintenance appropriations, to finance these orders. SMAG provides the inventory items to customers and bills customers on the basis of predetermined prices\u2014commonly referred to as standard prices, which generally are to be in force throughout the entire fiscal year. SMAG uses payments from customers to replenish the inventory sold to customers by (1) buying new inventory items or (2) ordering repair services of existing inventory from industry and DOD depot maintenance activities as well as to cover operating costs. SMAG procures critical material and makes repair parts available to its customers through five inventory control points: Ogden Air Logistics Center (ALC), Ogden, Utah; Oklahoma City ALC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Sacramento ALC, Sacramento, California; San Antonio ALC, San Antonio, Texas; and Warner Robins ALC, Warner Robins, Georgia. The five ALCs report to the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), located at Dayton, Ohio.", "SMAG\u2019s operations are divided into two main categories: wholesale and retail. Wholesale operations encompass about 200,000 types of inventory items (generally weapon system related) for which the Air Force is the inventory control point. SMAG procures, manages, and sets the prices that customers will pay for these wholesale items. The wholesale prices include SMAG\u2019s operational support cost, such as civilian salaries and accounting costs. SMAG adds a surcharge to the acquisition cost or repair cost of the individual inventory items to recover its operating costs. SMAG retail inventory operations encompass items that are managed by the other services, Defense agencies, or government agencies. These non-Air Force entities are the inventory control points for these items and, therefore, set the prices for these items. The retail portion of SMAG purchases these items from the non-Air Force entities and then resells them to customers.", "Since fiscal year 1991, the composition of the inventory items and costs managed by SMAG has significantly changed, making it more complicated for SMAG to manage, budget, and account for inventory. Prior to fiscal year 1991, SMAG consisted of the following six divisions: (1) systems support, (2) general support, (3) fuels, (4) medical/dental, (5) commissary, and (6) the Air Force Academy Cadet Store. The systems support division\u2014the only wholesale division\u2014procured consumable items (items that are replaced rather than repaired) for aircraft, missiles, and their major components.", "Beginning in fiscal year 1991, the Air Force added two new wholesale divisions to its stock fund operations: the reparable support and cost of operations divisions. The reparable support division procures depot level repairables and pays for the repair of these repairable inventory items. Managing repairable items was a new function for SMAG, and it complicated the budgeting and accounting for inventory items since SMAG did not have any experience in setting prices to recover the cost to repair items. The cost of operations division included the overhead costs for the five inventory control points of the stock fund which also complicated matters for the stock fund since these costs were not previously captured and included in the prices charged customers. The effect of adding the repairable support and cost of operations divisions to the stock fund is significant. For example, in fiscal year 1997, the Air Force reported wholesale division sales of about $6.8 billion of which only a reported $500 million pertained to the systems support division\u2014the only wholesale division that existed prior to fiscal year 1991.", "Three other changes also impacted SMAG\u2019s operations.", "In fiscal year 1992, the commissary division was transferred from SMAG to the Defense Commissary Agency. The Air Force budgets show that the commissary division had estimated sales of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion per year in the early 1990s.", "About 475,000 consumable items were transferred from the system support division to the Defense Logistics Agency from fiscal year 1992 through 1997. The transfer of these items significantly reduced the number of items managed by the systems support division to about 125,000 items.", "On October 1, 1997, the Air Force consolidated SMAG\u2019s three wholesale divisions into one wholesale division called the Materiel Support Division. The Air Force created the Materiel Support Division to provide better cost visibility. Now, the estimated costs associated with each ALC are included in the prices of inventory items they manage. Previously, these costs were spread across the board to all inventory items."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of our review were to evaluate the (1) accuracy and consistency of SMAG\u2019s accounting and budgetary reports, (2) SMAG\u2019s price-setting process, and (3) Air Force Working Capital Fund\u2019s cash management practices, including the practice of advance billing customers.", "To evaluate the accuracy and consistency of SMAG\u2019s accounting and budgetary reports, we (1) obtained and analyzed the Defense Working Capital Fund Accounting Report (1307), the Air Force Defense Business Operations Fund Chief Financial Officer Annual Financial Statement, and the Air Force\u2019s Working Capital Fund budget justification report for fiscal years 1992 through 1996, (2) interviewed Air Force and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) officials to determine why reports covering the same period provided widely different results, and (3) analyzed the DOD Working Capital Fund report, dated September 1997, that was prepared in response to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, to determine the actions DOD is planning to improve the accuracy of the working capital fund\u2019s accounting report.

We reported in March 1995, that due to a $6 billion clerical error, the Army supply management activity group reported an operating loss of $8.5 billion for fiscal year 1994 on a program that reported revenue of $7 billion for the same period. In addition, the DOD Inspector General has not been able to express an opinion on the accuracy of the Defense Business Operations Fund financial statements for fiscal years 1993 through 1996 due to significant deficiencies in the accounting systems and the lack of sound internal control structure.", "DOD has frequently acknowledged that the working capital funds\u2019 financial reports are inaccurate\u2014in the Acting Comptroller\u2019s February 2, 1993, letter to the congressional defense committees; in the Defense Business Operations Fund September 24, 1993, improvement plan; and in DOD\u2019s February 2, 1994, response to our October 1993 letter on the Defense Business Operations Fund improvement plan.", "More recently, DOD reported in its fiscal years 1996 and 1997 Annual Statement of Assurance as required by the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act that inadequate accounting and reporting for the working capital funds, including the Air Force SMAG, were major control deficiencies. The Air Force also recognized SMAG financial reporting as a material weakness in its fiscal year 1997 Statement of Assurance. In this statement, the Air Force reported weaknesses in inventory valuation and noted the adverse effect it has on forecasting budget requirements. It stated that correcting this problem will result in more accurate inventory pricing and budgets. The Air Force also reported that internal controls were not sufficient to ensure that SMAG accounts were accurately reflected in financial statements.", "DOD has stated in the past that it was acting to correct these financial reporting problems. For example, in the Defense Business Operations Fund improvement plan dated September 1993, DOD stated that the primary causes of the financial reporting problems were (1) inconsistent or insufficient policy guidance and (2) inadequate financial systems. DOD\u2019s September 1993 plan identified numerous actions needed to correct the deficiencies identified with the guidance and financial systems.", "However, because these long-standing problems continued, the congressional Defense committees acted to mandate improvements in the financial operations of the working capital funds. Specifically, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 required DOD to prepare a plan by September 30, 1997, to improve the management and performance of the working capital funds. Among other things, the Act required DOD to address the issue involving financial reporting requirements.", "In response to the authorization act requirement, DOD developed a plan to improve the management and performance of its working capital funds. In this plan, dated September 1997, DOD stated that the working capital funds have financial reporting problems and DOD recognized that (1) differences between the budgeting and accounting reports for the same information confuses managers and should be eliminated, (2) large adjustments significantly affecting the operating results can occur as long as 4 months after the \u201cas of\u201d date and undermine management\u2019s confidence in the reports, (3) a formal reconciliation of the various reports is not presently performed, and (4) eliminating the differences\u2014or providing a reconciliation\u2014would make reports more useful to decisionmakers and restore creditability and confidence in the reports.", "DOD\u2019s plan also identifies decisions made to correct these financial reporting problems which include (1) developing policies and procedures for reconciling budgetary and accounting reports, (2) developing a handbook that identifies the differences between the various reports to assist managers in monthly report analysis, and (3) revising the cost of goods sold treatment and presentation in the 1307 accounting report.", "The DOD September 1997 plan does a good job in identifying the problems hindering accurate financial reporting and the decisions reached to resolve the problems.

After this report was issued, DFAS made four revisions in preparing the SMAG portion of the Chief Financial Officer report, which had a major impact on SMAG\u2019s net operating results.

For example, the 1307 accounting report showed that SMAG lost about  $2 billion during fiscal year 1996 while the budget report showed that it lost $99 million.", "Differences between these two reports are expected since not all the accounts used to determine the net operating results in the 1307 accounting report are used to develop the net operating results in the budget. For example, if Air Force disposes of inventory items and does not plan to replace these items, it does not consider this an expense for budgeting purposes. However, for accounting purposes, this is considered an expense that reduces the net operating results. The Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DOD 7000.14-R) requires business activities to (1) explain the differences between the net operating results shown in the 1307 accounting report and those used in the budget formulation of prices charged customers as shown in the budget, (2) identify and justify the net operating result amounts in the 1307 accounting report that DOD components request be excluded from the prices, and (3) obtain approval from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) for the amounts to be excluded.

Without knowing the net operating results, the Air Force cannot determine whether the prices being charged SMAG\u2019s customers will allow it to recover its costs and operate on a break-even basis. In some cases, the prices might have been set too high because of erroneous net operating result data.

Therefore, DOD uses the latest acquisition cost method to value inventory and arrive at the cost of goods sold which is permissible under the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 3, Inventory and Related Property.", "DOD uses a summary-level formula to adjust the value of inventory from the standard (selling) price to the latest acquisition cost by removing surcharges for operating costs from the standard price.
