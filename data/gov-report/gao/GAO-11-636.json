In fiscal year 2010, more than $300 million was used to procure and ship 540,000 metric tons of commodities to be monetized by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Through analysis of agency data, interviews with agency officials, and fieldwork in three countries, this report (1) assesses the extent to which monetization proceeds cover commodity and other associated costs and (2) examines the extent to which U.S. agencies meet requirements to ensure that monetization does not cause adverse market impacts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the inefficiency of the monetization process reduced funding available to the U.S. government for development projects by $219 million over a 3-year period. The process of using cash to procure, ship, and sell commodities resulted in $503 million available for development projects out of the $722 million expended. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are not required to achieve a specific level of cost recovery for monetization transactions. Instead, they are only required to achieve reasonable market price, which has not been clearly defined. USAID's average cost recovery was 76 percent, while USDA's was 58 percent. Further, the agencies conduct limited monitoring of sale prices, which may hinder their efforts to maximize cost recovery. Ocean transportation represents about a third of the cost to procure and ship commodities for monetization, and legal requirements to ship 75 percent of the commodities on U.S.-flag vessels further increase costs. Moreover, the number of participating U.S.-flag vessels has declined by 50 percent since 2002, and according to USAID and USDA, this decline has greatly decreased competition. Participation may be limited by rules unique to food aid programs which require formerly foreign-flag vessels to wait 3 years before they are treated as U.S.-flag vessels. USAID and USDA cannot ensure that monetization does not cause adverse market impacts because they monetize at high volumes, conduct weak market assessments, and do not conduct post-monetization evaluations. Adverse market impacts may include discouraging food production by local farmers, which could undermine development goals. To help avoid adverse market impacts, the agencies conduct market assessments that recommend limits on programmable volume of commodities to be monetized. However, USAID's assessments were conducted for just a subset of countries and have not yet been updated to reflect changing market conditions, and USDA's assessments contained weaknesses such as errors in formulas. Both agencies have at times programmed for monetization at volumes in excess of limits recommended by their market assessments. Further, the agencies monetized more than 25 percent of the recipient countries' commercial import volume in more than a quarter of cases, increasing the risk of displacing commercial trade. Finally, the agencies do not conduct post-monetization impact evaluations, so they cannot determine whether monetization caused any adverse market impacts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Congress consider eliminating the 3-year waiting period for foreign vessels that acquire U.S.-flag registry to be eligible to transport U.S. food aid.

DOT disagreed with our Matter for Congressional Consideration due to its concern that the proposed statutory change might be detrimental to the U.S. maritime industry."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States provided nearly $2.3 billion to alleviate world hunger  and support development in 2010. This amount accounted for more than  half of all global food aid supplies, making the United States the single  largest donor of food aid. For almost 30 years, since the enactment of the  Food Security Act of 1985, Congress has authorized the sale of U.S. food  aid commodities in local and regional markets in developing countries  with the proceeds used to fund development activities that address causes  and symptoms of food insecurity\u2014a practice known as monetization. In  2010, more than $300 million was used to procure and ship 540,000 metric  tons of food assistance to be monetized. To adhere to cargo preference  requirements, 75 percent of all U.S. food aid commodities must be  shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. According to U.S. agencies, nonemergency  food aid resources, including proceeds from monetization, supported  development and direct assistance projects that benefited more than 7  million people in 35 developing countries. These development projects  include assistance to improve agricultural production, provide health and  nutrition activities, and support education and humanitarian needs.", "However, the practice of monetizing food aid has long been controversial.  Advocates view monetization as a tool to meet the development needs of  chronically food-insecure people in many developing countries. Critics  view the practice of converting cash to commodities and then back to cash  as an inefficient use of resources that may also have adverse market  impacts in recipient countries. These market impacts may include  displacing commercial trade and discouraging local food production. By  law, the two principal agencies that manage U.S. food assistance\u2014the  U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) Office of Food for  Peace and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Foreign  Agricultural Service\u2014must ensure that monetization transactions do not  entail substantial disincentive to, or interfere with, domestic production or  marketing in that country.", "While we recognize the benefits of the development activities that  monetization funds, in 2007, we reported that monetization was an  inherently inefficient use of food aid. The inefficiencies stem from the  process of using U.S. government funds to procure food aid commodities  in the United States which are then shipped to the recipient country and  sold, with the proceeds used to fund development projects. In that report,  we identified various costs associated with the transporting, handling, and  selling of commodities that contributed to these inefficiencies. Because  U.S. agencies did not collect monetization proceeds data electronically at  the time of our review, we found it difficult to assess the extent to which  monetization revenues covered the commodity and other costs associated  with the practice. We recommended that USAID and USDA develop an  information collection system to track monetization transactions, which  the agencies have begun to implement.", "In this report, we examine issues related to cost recovery and market  impact assessment for monetization. At your request, as part of our work  on international food assistance, we (1) assessed the extent to which  monetization proceeds cover commodity and other associated costs and  (2) examined the extent to which U.S. agencies meet requirements to  ensure that monetization does not cause adverse market impacts.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed food aid program data provided  by USAID, USDA, and USDA\u2019s Kansas City Commodity Office (KCCO).  USAID has not been collecting monetization cost recovery information  systematically and thus could not provide us with comprehensive and  reliable data for transactions prior to 2008. Therefore, for the purposes of  this report, the agencies generated cost recovery data manually, covering  fiscal years 2008 through 2010 for USAID, and fiscal years 2007 through  2009 for USDA. We worked with the agencies to correct errors in the data  and determined that the data used in our analysis were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. Further, we examined the differences between U.S.-and  foreign-flag ocean freight rates using KCCO data. We also reviewed and  analyzed data from the agencies, such as their market assessments,  volumes programmed for monetization, import data, consumption data,  and the limits set by the agencies for monetization in recipient countries  for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. We also interviewed officials from  USAID; USDA; the Departments of State and Transportation; and the  Office of Management and Budget in Washington, D.C., as well as subject- matter experts in the field of international food aid. In addition, we  conducted a survey of the 29 implementing partners who conducted  monetization between fiscal years 2008 and 2010 and received a 100  percent response rate. We also conducted field work in countries that  programmed some of the highest volumes of monetized nonemergency  U.S. food aid from fiscal years 2008 through 2010\u2014Bangladesh,  Mozambique, and Uganda\u2014and met with officials from U.S. missions,  representatives from nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and other  implementing partners that directly handle sales and implement  development activities, and officials from relevant host government  agencies.

In addition, appendix II provides technical notes  on our analysis of ocean freight rates.)", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 to June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.", "Based on our findings in this report, we are proposing that, consistent with  rules that apply to the Maritime Security Fleet and vessels transporting  other U.S. government cargo, Congress should consider amending the  Cargo Preference Act of 1954 to eliminate the 3-year waiting period  imposed on foreign vessels that acquire U.S.-flag registry before they are  eligible for carriage of preference food aid cargos. This could potentially  increase the number of U.S.-flag vessels eligible for carriage of preference  food aid cargo, thereby increasing competition and possibly reducing  costs. The Department of Transportation (DOT) disagreed with our Matter  for Congressional Consideration due to its concern regarding the  potentially detrimental impact the statutory change may have on the U.S.  maritime industry. However, we maintain that the elimination of the 3-year  waiting period can ease entry of new vessels into U.S. food aid programs.   We are suggesting this proposed amendment on the basis of factors  including the following: First, as USAID and USDA jointly reported in  2009, the number of vessels participating in U.S. food aid programs has  declined, thereby limiting competition in transportation contracting and  leading to higher freight rates. Second, our analysis shows that food aid  shipments on foreign-flag carriers cost the U.S. government, on average,  $25 per ton less than U.S.-flag carriers.", "Further, we are recommending that the Administrator of USAID and the  Secretary of Agriculture (1) jointly develop an agreed-upon benchmark or  indicator to determine \u201creasonable market price\u201d for sales of U.S. food aid  for monetization; (2) monitor food aid sales transactions to ensure that the  benchmark set to achieve \u201creasonable market price\u201d in the country where  the commodities are being sold is achieved, as required by law; (3)  improve market assessments and coordinate to develop them in countries  where both USAID and USDA may monetize; and (4) conduct market  impact evaluations after monetization transactions have taken place to  determine whether they caused adverse market impacts.

The act allowed implementing partners that received  nonemergency food aid under USAID\u2019s Food for Peace program and  USDA\u2019s Food for Progress program to monetize some of the food in  recipient countries and use the proceeds to cover associated shipping  costs. In 1988, the authorized use of monetization funds was expanded to  incorporate funding of food-security-related development projects, and in  1995, a minimum monetization level for nonemergency food assistance  was set at 10 percent, which was then increased to 15 percent in 1996. The  2002 Farm Bill authorized the McGovern\u2013Dole International Food for  Education and Child Nutrition Program and allowed it to raise cash  through monetization. (For a description of these program authorities, see  appendix III).", "The practice of selling commodities for cash to fund development  programs originated in part from U.S. government farm subsidies that  contributed to a surplus of agricultural commodities owned by the U.S.  government. However, the U.S. government no longer has surplus  agricultural commodities. Current monetization requires the U.S.  government to purchase the commodities from the commercial market  and ship them abroad for implementing partners to sell them in another  market to generate cash.", "Neither USAID nor USDA has been required to achieve a set level of cost  recovery following an amendment by the 2002 Farm Bill to the Food for  Peace Act. Rather, the agencies are required, by statute, to achieve  \u201creasonable market price\u201d for sales of food aid in recipient countries. Prior  to 2002, USAID sought to achieve an average cost recovery that was  calculated based on the following formula: either (1) 80 percent of  commodity value plus freight value, including associated transport and  marketing costs, or (2) 100 percent of free alongside ship price on its  monetization transactions. USDA\u2019s requirement was to adhere to  reasonable market price as its benchmark. According to the conference  report for the 2002 Farm Bill, the change from the cost recovery formula  to reasonable market price for USAID was made to address two primary  concerns. The first concern was that the cost recovery formula  requirement was too inflexible, and could either unfairly punish  participants where market forces were beyond their control, or not reward  situations where the market price was above the formula value. The  second concern was that, since both USAID and USDA monetize food aid,  sometimes in potentially overlapping markets, having a cost recovery  requirement for USAID but not for USDA could cause inconsistencies in  monetization and potentially penalizes one or the other agency.

This assistance is provided through both monetization and  direct distribution, where commodities are provided directly to  beneficiaries through implementing partners. While U.S. food aid  legislation mandates that a minimum of 15 percent of USAID\u2019s Food for  Peace nonemergency assistance be monetized, actual levels of  monetization far exceed the minimum. In fiscal year 2010, more than  313,000 metric tons of food aid were monetized under USAID\u2019s Food for  Peace program, accounting for 63 percent of food aid tonnage under that  program. In fiscal year 2010, USDA monetized more than 229,000 metric  tons of food aid under the Food for Progress program, accounting for 95  percent of food aid tonnage under that program. Monetization has been  less prevalent under the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education  and Child Nutrition Program since the end of its pilot program in 2003, due  to an increase in the amount of cash provided along with food aid for  direct distribution.

Monetization grants generally provide  development resources over a 3- to 5-year period. The process begins  with a call for applications from either USAID or USDA, to which  implementing partners respond by submitting grant proposals for  development programs that are to be funded in part with monetization  proceeds. USAID and USDA independently issue calls for applications and  approve applications at different times, based on different guidelines and  priorities. Grant proposals include, among other things, information on the  commodity to be monetized, commodity volumes requested, estimated  sales price, estimated cost recovery, considerations of market impact  assessments, and projects that will be funded based on the estimated sales  proceeds. Implementing partners that receive grants have the  responsibility to manage and oversee the monetization process. As part of  their responsibilities, implementing partners must secure a buyer in the  recipient country before a call forward (or purchase order) can be  approved by the relevant agency. After either USAID or USDA receives a  call forward request from the implementing partner in their Web Based  Supply Chain Management (WBSCM) system, the agency approves or  disapproves the request, which is then routed to KCCO. KCCO purchases  the requested commodities from U.S. producers in the United States and  ships them to the implementing partner in the recipient country. To adhere  to cargo trade preference requirements, DOT assists in identifying  qualified ocean carriers to ship the commodities to the recipient country.  The commodities are delivered to the implementing partner in the  recipient country, where the implementing partner executes the sales  contract with the buyer and collects payment. The implementing partner  uses the proceeds to implement the development projects. Figure 3  depicts the general steps in the monetization process, from submitting a  grant proposal to obtaining proceeds to completing development projects.  (See appendix V for more information).

Consortiums are often formed  when several implementing partners obtain grants for the same country to  monetize the same commodity. Generally, one of the implementing  partners in the consortium takes the lead in conducting monetization  sales. The lead implementing partner is responsible for identifying the  buyers; preparing a single call forward drawing from each partner\u2019s food  allocation; arranging for commodities to be shipped in a single shipment;  finalizing the sale in-country; and distributing proceeds among  participating consortium members, as appropriate. Typically, the lead  implementing partner charges a fee of 3 to 5 percent of total sales to  handle monetization, while in some cases, the lead is rotated among  consortium members. Fifteen of the 29 implementing partners we  interviewed reported being part of a monetization consortium.", "A single implementing partner might independently sell the  commodities granted to it. When a single implementing partner monetizes  only its own commodities, it must hire or train staff to conduct the sales or  contract a selling agent to sell the food.

Fourteen of  the 29 implementing partners we interviewed said that they monetize only  the food granted to their organization.", "Implementing partners generally sell commodities to private buyers in the  recipient countries in the open market. Sales are generally conducted  through a public tender process organized by the implementing partner or  its selling agent, where an open bidding will take place. This is the  preferred method for both USAID and USDA, on the assumption that a  public tender process will most likely produce a competitive sales price. In  some cases, however, implementing partners sell commodities through  direct negotiation, where the implementing partners or their agents enter  into a one-on-one dialogue with individual buyers. According to USDA  officials, monetization sales through direct negotiation are only permitted  when the public tender process is not feasible or does not initially result in  a sale.", "In some cases, implementing partners work with the recipient country\u2019s  national government to conduct monetization. For example, an  implementing partner may enter into direct negotiation with the  government, as in the case of Bangladesh, where the government is the  buyer and purchases all USAID Food for Peace nonemergency food aid  that is monetized in the country. In Haiti, the government requires that  monetization transactions to private buyers be facilitated through a  government entity called the Monetization Bureau.

Within this framework, monetization  is built around two main objectives\u2014to enhance food security and  generate foreign currency to support development activities. Therefore,  the range of activities that USAID funds through monetization includes  projects to improve and promote sustainable agricultural production and  marketing; natural resource management; nonagricultural income  generation; health, nutrition, water and sanitation; education; emergency  preparedness and mitigation; vulnerable group feeding; and social safety  nets. According to USDA guidance, commodities for monetization are  made for use in developing countries and emerging democracies that have  made commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements in  their agricultural economies. Within these constraints, USDA gives priority  consideration to proposals for countries that have economic and social  indicators that demonstrate the need for assistance. These indicators  include income level, prevalence of child stunting, political freedom,  USDA overseas coverage, and other considerations such as market  conditions. Therefore, according to USDA, development projects funded  through monetization by the agency\u2019s Food for Progress program should  focus on private sector development of agricultural sectors such as  improved agricultural techniques, marketing systems, and farmer  education.

The first source is  internal transportation, shipping, and handling (ITSH), which is cash for  shipping and handling the commodities, if necessary, once they arrive at  the destination port, to the final point of sale. The second source is  funding through Section 202(e) of the Food for Peace Act, which is  provided to implementing partners to assist in meeting administrative,  personnel, distribution, and other costs associated with Food for Peace  programs. Since most Food for Peace grants include both monetized and  direct distribution food aid, USAID does not track ITSH and 202(e)  specifically for monetization purposes. However, in 2010, ITSH and 202(e)  costs for all of USAID nonemergency assistance, including both  monetization and direct distribution, were $123.3 million, or about 30  percent of USAID\u2019s total nonemergency costs for the year.", "According to agency officials, USDA provides its implementing partners  with cash through Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds, to cover  various administrative costs that are associated with food aid.

The CCC is an agency within  USDA that authorizes the sale of agricultural commodities to other  government agencies and foreign governments and authorizes the  donation of food to domestic, foreign, or international relief agencies. The  CCC also assists in the development of new domestic and foreign markets  and marketing facilities for agricultural commodities. According to a  USDA official, such costs could include hiring a monetization agent to  facilitate a monetization transaction, or the salaries and benefits of the  staff that carry out the monetization transaction. USDA provided  implementing partners $23 million in CCC funding between fiscal years  2008 and 2010.

We found that more than one-third  of the 42 transactions we examined, for which we had IPP and sales price  data, had prices lower than 90 percent of the commercial import prices, an  indication that they might have been able to achieve higher prices. For  example, in 2008, USAID allowed an implementing partner in Burkina  Faso to monetize rice at a price that was 67 percent of the IPP, while at the  same time in Guatemala, USAID permitted monetization of vegetable oil at  70 percent of the IPP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ocean Transportation Costs Can Reduce the Amount of Funding Generated through Monetization", "paragraphs": ["Ocean freight cost is a significant component of the monetization cost,  and due in part to cargo preference requirements, U.S.-flag carriers have  higher shipping rates on average than foreign-flag carriers, further  lowering cost recovery.

Another  mandate, known as the Great Lakes Set-Aside, requires that up to 25  percent of Title II bagged food aid tonnage be allocated to Great Lakes  ports each month. These legal requirements limit competition and  potentially reduce food aid shipping capacity, leading to higher freight  rates.

For low-value commodities, such as bulk wheat, ocean  shipping costs take up a higher percentage of the total cost. In 15 percent  of the monetization transactions between fiscal years 2008 and 2010,  shipping costs accounted for more than 40 percent of the total cost of  procurement and shipping, amounting to more than $91 million in ocean  shipping. For several of these transactions, shipping cost was higher than  commodity procurement cost. For example, while it cost $3.9 million to  purchase the shipment of 10,000 metric tons of wheat to be sent to Malawi  in 2008 for monetization, it cost $4.5 million in ocean shipping.", "The freight rate for USAID and USDA food aid shipments on foreign-flag  carriers cost on average $25 per ton less than the freight rate on U.S.-flag  carriers, controlling for shipping routes, the shipping time and term, and  the type of commodities shipped. The difference in freight rate between  U.S.- and foreign-flag carriers also depends on the type of commodities  shipped. Figure 8 shows the difference in the average freight rate per  metric ton between U.S.- and foreign-flag carriers. The freight rate for bulk  commodities averaged $8 per ton lower and the rate for non-bulk  commodities averaged $30 per ton lower for foreign-flag carriers than U.S.- flag carriers for shipments with the same shipping routes and the same  shipping times and terms. We estimate that between fiscal years 2008 and  2010, cargo preference potentially cost the food aid programs  approximately $30 million because of the higher rates U.S.-flag carriers  charged.

The requirement, which does not apply to the Maritime Security Fleet or  to vessels transporting cargos financed by the U.S. Export-Import Bank,  seeks to ensure that vessels transporting 75 percent of food aid are not  only U.S.-flagged, but also constructed in U.S. shipyards. However, since  2005, U.S. shipyards have built only two new U.S-flag vessels appropriate  for transporting food aid and these vessels have not been awarded a food  aid contract.

The process of  getting a proposal approved, finding a foreign buyer, and conducting an  actual sale can be time-consuming, and market conditions can change  significantly from when the implementing partners first submitted the  proposals. For example, when an implementing partner monetized  through USDA\u2019s Food for Progress program in Bangladesh, it submitted its  initial proposal in August 2008, including the volume and estimated sales  prices for the proposed commodity, but the sale of the commodities was  not made until 17 months later, in December 2009.

In another example, an implementing partner stated that it  wanted to monetize its commodities at a certain point when prices were  high, but missed the opportunity to do so due to delays in the approval  process.

Monetization  has the potential to discourage food production by local farmers, and as a  result may undermine the broader agricultural development and food  security goals of the Food for Peace and Food for Progress programs. For  example, when large volumes of food are monetized at once, the prices of  the same or competitive commodities in the recipient country may be  depressed, creating disincentives to local producers and possibly resulting  in a decline in local production. The risk of depressing prices increases  when the commodities arrive while supply is at a peak, such as during a  harvest period for the same or competitive commodities. Monetization  also has the potential to displace commercial trade, especially if the  monetized food is sold on more favorable terms than what is available  commercially. Buyers in the recipient country, such as domestic importers  and millers, would then have an incentive to purchase monetized  commodities over commercial ones. When sold in significant volumes,  monetized food has the potential to substantially reduce demand for  exports from the United States, other developed countries, and regional  partners, thus hurting competitive commercial trade.

Monetizing large  volumes of food aid relative to commercial import volume increases the  risk that commercial trade is displaced. Fintrac recommends that the total  volume monetized of a given commodity should not exceed 10 percent of  the commodity\u2019s commercial import volume in a given country in a given  year.

In August 2008, USAID hired  Fintrac to improve the market analysis required before food aid programs  are approved in recipient countries, known as the Bellmon Estimation for  Title II (BEST). Prior to 2008, USAID made determinations about market  impact based solely on the Bellmon analyses conducted by its  implementing partners, who as the recipients of monetization grants are  not independent. As of May 2011, 13 of the 20 BEST analyses had been  completed. According to USAID, the BEST analysis is to complement and  not substitute the implementing partners\u2019 market analyses and  surveillance. Therefore, in many cases implementing partners continue to  conduct their own market analysis, which estimates the price they are  likely to receive for the commodity to be monetized. Overall, 17 of the 29  implementing partners we surveyed stated that the BEST analysis was  sufficient for determining which commodities to monetize and 13 of the 29  implementing partners stated that it was sufficient for determining how  much to monetize.", "The methodology for the BEST analysis includes identifying potential  commodities to be monetized, ensuring that recipient country policies and  regulations are favorable (i.e., there are no barriers or restrictions on the  commodity to be monetized), reviewing local market structure as well as  previous and planned food aid initiatives, and examining the likelihood of  achieving fair and competitive market price. In conducting its analysis,  Fintrac also considers the latest 5-year trends in import volumes and  domestic production data to ensure that the commodity to be monetized  has been imported in significant volumes and that local production is  insufficient to meet demand. As noted above, another important step in  the analysis is to assess the likelihood that the monetized commodity will  achieve fair and competitive market price. Fintrac uses the IPP as the  most precise estimate of fair and competitive price for commercially- imported commodities. As discussed earlier, the IPP is the price a  commercial importer in the recipient country pays to import the same or  similar commodities from the most common exporting country. Based on  all of these components, Fintrac makes a recommendation on  monetization. When Fintrac recommends monetization, it does so in  volumes that generally do not exceed 10 percent of the commodity\u2019s  commercial import volume in order to avoid substantial displacement of  trade. Fintrac\u2019s analysis also relies on field visits to obtain additional data,  and interviews with stakeholders in the recipient country such as  implementing partners; commercial importers; and potential buyers,  including millers and processors.

While Fintrac has conducted 13 BEST  analyses, these analyses were available for only 11 of 63 cases in which  USAID monetized since 2008. For the remaining cases, USAID relied on  Bellmon analyses conducted by their implementing partners, which are  not independent. In addition, while the BEST offers an independent and  consistent methodology and considers the latest 5 year trends in import  volumes and domestic production data, it is not updated to capture  changes in market conditions that may occur by the time sales  transactions take place. We found that in certain cases, in the interval  between the completion of the BEST and the sale of the monetized  commodity, there was a relatively long lag, during which market  conditions may have changed. Further, MYAPs generally last for 3 to 5  years, and monetization sales can take place in each of those years. The  BEST would likely not be useful for monetization transactions that take  place beyond the initial MYAP approval. According to USAID, while there  is market information that changes rapidly and requires continued  assessments, the BEST includes historical and cyclical information that  can be used for many years. However, we found that the BEST does not  include projection analysis that could take into account potential price  spikes and the volatile nature of the market.

However, the  consumption needs and apparent consumption figures in the spreadsheets  are not based on any formula and appear as a data entry. For example, the  consumption need noted in one UMR was more than double the  consumption need that was calculated for that commodity using the  standard methodology mentioned above. In another UMR, the  consumption need was 80 percent greater than the calculated amount  using the standard methodology. Further, our review of the UMRs showed  that while data sources are listed at the bottom of these spreadsheets, it is  impossible to identify which information came from which of the listed  sources.

Further, in all 12 cases, the  maximum allowable volume for U.S. programming found in the UMR was  higher than the recommended maximum volume found in the BEST (see  table 2).

For example, in 2008 USDA programmed 6,000 metric tons of  soybean meal to be monetized in Armenia when the maximum allowable  volume was set at 200 metric tons in the corresponding UMR. USAID  exceeded the UMR\u2019s limit for U.S. programming in 10 of 59 possible cases.  For example, in 2009, USAID monetized 2,390 metric tons of rice in  Senegal even though the corresponding UMR did not recommend  programming any rice for monetization. See table 3 for all the cases in  which USAID and/or USDA exceeded the limit recommended by the BEST  analysis and/or set by the UMR between fiscal years 2008 and 2010.", "Further, for 3 of 6 possible cases in which both agencies programmed the  same commodity for monetization in the same country and the same year,  the combined volume programmed for monetization by both agencies  exceeded the recommendation in the BEST and/or the UMR. For example,  for wheat in Malawi in 2009, the BEST recommended 8,000 metric tons  and the UMR set the limit at 29,200 metric tons; however, both agencies  programmed wheat for monetization and their combined total of 51,140  metric tons was more than six times the BEST\u2019s recommendation and 75  percent above the UMR\u2019s limit.", "According to USAID officials, the recommended limits are at times  exceeded because these market assessments are part of a larger decision- making process, which includes informal discussions between  headquarters, the field-mission, and the implementing partners. Officials  stated that through these discussions a decision on the commodity choice  and volume to be monetized is made. However, USAID acknowledged that  these discussions and the rationale for the decisions are not systematically  documented. According to USDA officials, the agency considers other  market information after agreements are signed and the UMRs are not the  only information used to make programming decisions. Further, USDA  officials stated that in some cases, they have documented the justification  to exceed the programming limits set by the UMR.

USAID and USDA have depended on the BEST, UMR, and  market assessments conducted by their implementing partners to help  meet their requirement to ensure that monetization does not result in  adverse market impacts in the recipient countries. However, without  conducting evaluations after monetization has occurred, they cannot  determine the impact the sale of donated food had on local production and  trade. Furthermore, they cannot assess the effectiveness of the BEST and  UMR in preventing adverse market impact.

However, monetization  of U.S. food aid\u2014the U.S. government\u2019s primary approach to meeting this  objective\u2014is an inherently inefficient way to fund development projects  and can cause adverse market impacts in recipient countries. The  monetization process results in the expenditure of a significant amount of  appropriated funds in unrelated areas such as transportation and logistics,  rather than development projects. Moreover, the potential for adverse  market impacts, such as artificially suppressing the price of a commodity  due to excessive monetization, could work against the agricultural  development goals for which the funding was originally provided. The  inefficiencies of monetization stem directly from the multiple transactions  required by the process and, except in rare cases, prevent full cost  recovery on monetization transactions. Therefore, as a source of funding  for development assistance, monetization cannot be as efficient as a  standard development program which provides cash grants directly to  implementing partners.", "While monetization continues, however, it is important that the agencies  strive to maximize the resources available for implementing development  projects funded through monetization. The absence of a clearly defined  benchmark or indicator for reasonable market price hinders their efforts  to forestall transactions that provide a very low rate of return. In addition,  since the agencies conduct only limited monitoring of the sales prices that  implementing partners achieve through monetization, they cannot ensure  that the transactions obtain the highest price and thereby generate as  much funding as possible for development projects. The agencies are  required by law to ensure that monetization does not cause adverse  market impacts, but their market assessments contain weaknesses that  diminish their usefulness for informing decisions on what, where,  whether, and how much to monetize. Moreover, whatever limits these  assessments attempt to establish are often exceeded and could contribute  to disincentives to local food production and displacement of commercial  trade. Furthermore, without conducting post-monetization transaction  impact evaluations, the agencies cannot determine the actual impacts of  monetization, even when the volume of the commodity monetized is more  than 25 percent of the commodity\u2019s commercial import volume. Finally,  transportation costs constitute about a third of the overall costs of  monetization over the 3-year period we examined, and the 3-year  reflagging rule\u2014which only applies to food aid and not to the defense  agencies and the U.S. Export-Import Bank\u2014can limit competition among  ships eligible to transport U.S. food aid, further increasing cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with rules that apply to the Maritime Security Fleet and vessels  transporting other U.S. government cargo, Congress should consider  amending the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 to eliminate the 3-year waiting  period imposed on foreign vessels that acquire U.S.-flag registry before  they are eligible for carriage of preference food aid cargos.

These agencies also provided technical  comments and updated information, which we have incorporated  throughout this report, as appropriate.

However, we  maintain that Congress should consider amending the Cargo Preference  Act of 1954 to eliminate the 3-year waiting period imposed on foreign  vessels that acquire U.S.-flag registry before they are eligible for carriage  of preference food aid cargos. We are suggesting this proposed  amendment on the basis of the following four factors: First, the number of  vessels participating in U.S. food aid programs has declined. In a 2009  report to Congress, USAID and USDA jointly stated that, due to the  declining size of the U.S.-flag commercial fleet, USAID and USDA are  forced to compete with the Department of Defense and other exporters for  space aboard the few remaining U.S.-flag vessels, thereby limiting  competition in transportation contracting and leading to higher freight  rates. Second, our analysis of ocean transportation costs showed that food  aid shipments on foreign-flag carriers cost the U.S. government, on  average, $25 per ton less than U.S.-flag carriers. Third, although the 3-year  requirement was established to provide employment opportunities to U.S.  shipyards, since 2005, U.S. shipyards have built only two new U.S.-flag  vessels appropriate for transporting food and the vessels have not been  awarded a food aid contract. Fourth, the 3-year rule applies only to food  aid and not to defense agencies and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. The  elimination of the 3-year waiting period can ease entry of new vessels into  the U.S. food aid program, with the potential to increase competition  among eligible U.S.-flag ships and reduce the cost of transportation. DOT  also said that we overstated the overall cost of transportation. Our  calculation of transportation cost was based on an analysis of all actual  monetization transactions over a 3-year period and is thus a precise  calculation of the actual cost to the U.S. government. In addition, DOT said  that the number of vessels participating in the program has declined by  less than what we found. However, our analysis was based on the number  of actual vessels booked for all food aid contracts awarded from fiscal  years 2002 to 2010.", "USAID generally concurred with our recommendations, noting ongoing  and planned actions to address them. Specifically, USAID stated that it will  work with USDA to explore options of setting a benchmark or indicator  for the sale of U.S. food aid through monetization. USAID noted that it has  regional and country-based food aid monitoring and evaluation specialists  who review U.S. food aid programs, including monetization sales, and that  the agency\u2019s BEST project is well-accepted by its implementing partners.  Additionally, USAID is updating its Monetization Field Manual, which  includes market assessment guidance. Finally, USAID stated that it will  explore possible cost-effective ways to conduct post-sale market impact  evaluations with its partners.", "USDA also generally concurred with our recommendations, stating that  they will be useful in ongoing efforts to generate cash development  resources and improve overall program management. USDA noted that an  advantage of monetization is that it can encourage commercial markets for  agricultural products and contribute to other market-building activities.  However, we found that the agencies cannot ensure that monetization  does not cause adverse market impacts, including discouraging food  production by local farmers. USDA also noted actions it is exploring to  reduce the cost of food aid shipments, such as the recipient host  government paying for the cost of ocean transportation and combining  shipments to obtain volume discounts. Further, USDA stated that it will  work with USAID to develop improved benchmarks for reasonable local  market prices. Finally, USDA stated that it will coordinate with USAID to  improve market assessments and it will consider revising its regulations to  require market impact evaluations.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested members of Congress,  the Administrator of USAID, the Secretary of Agriculture, and relevant  agency heads.

As a  result, we determined that the universe of implementing partners that had  monetized between fiscal years 2008 and 2010 was 29. We developed a  structured instrument for our survey in October of 2010, and pre-tested it  on two implementing partners. The instrument contained both closed and  open ended questions in four general areas: (1) the monetization process,  (2) the U.S. government role, (3) market analysis, and (4) cost recovery.

We did not include transactions for  which the agencies did not have actual sales prices.

Third, although the 3- year requirement was established to provide employment  opportunities to U.S. shipyards, since 2005, U.S. shipyards have built  only two new U.S.-flag vessels appropriate for transporting food and  the vessels have not been awarded a food aid contract. Fourth, the 3- year requirement applies only to food aid and not to defense agencies  and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. The elimination of the 3-year waiting  period can ease entry of new vessels into U.S. food aid programs, with  the potential to increase competition among eligible U.S.-flag ships and  reduce the cost of transportation. 2.
