The  $4.5 billion modernization includes four major systems\u2014AWIPS, the Next Generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-Next), the Next Generation Weather Radars (NEXRAD), and the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS). GOES-Next, NEXRAD, and ASOS form the foundation of NWS\u2019 observing infrastructure, watching the weather from earth and space. The two orbiting GOES-Next satellites each provide as many as 1,200 digital weather images daily to each forecast office, compared to less than 100 from their predecessors. The almost 150 NEXRADs are to blanket the continental United States and using Doppler radar technology, allow forecasters to see inside weather events to detect motion and dynamics that were invisible to pre-NEXRAD radars. ASOS, which consists of nearly 900 separate ground-based sensor sets, is to provide a portfolio of weather readings, such as temperature and visibility, from more locations and with greater frequency than has been done by human observers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "AWIPS at a Glance", "paragraphs": ["AWIPS is to function as the \u201ccentral nervous system\u201d of a modernized NWS.

It is also to be the national communications infrastructure for NWS\u2019 many forecasting offices and centers, connecting them not only to each other but also linking them to the many users of forecasts and warnings throughout the nation.", "Using AWIPS\u2019 advanced processing, display, and communications capabilities, NWS expects to fully capitalize on its new observing systems for the first time. Without AWIPS, these observing systems cannot be maximized because the current Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) computer and communications system and the associated weather office display systems cannot accommodate the mountainous data streams that these observing systems now provide. For example, the current system can only accept two satellite images an hour. With AWIPS, GOES-Next images are to be received in real time, meaning that up to eight images can be received and displayed each hour."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of AWIPS\u2019 Expected Impact on NWS\u2019 Mission Performance", "paragraphs": ["According to NWS, AWIPS is to contribute to improvements in the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts and warnings as well as streamlining its operations and downsizing its organization. All told, NWS expects that the combined pieces of the modernization will result in the number of NWS field offices dropping from 254 to 119 and the number of NWS staff falling from 5,100 to 4,678. AWIPS is expected to improve forecaster productivity by allowing forecasters to view disparate data sets in an integrated fashion, perform an assortment of scientific computations on these data sets, and graphically display and interact with these data sets. Currently, such activities are generally performed manually as data from the various observing systems are displayed on multiple screens and assimilated by the forecaster. For example, today, when forecasters want to combine radar and satellite images to view weather pattern movements, the images must be manually overlayed on transparencies. With AWIPS, such integration is expected to occur automatically on the AWIPS workstation with a few simple mouse clicks or keystroke commands. In short, AWIPS is to result in forecasters spending less time physically and mentally manipulating data and more time practicing meteorology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AWIPS History and Status in Brief", "paragraphs": ["The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is NWS\u2019 parent agency, began AWIPS in the mid-1980s to replace AFOS. Since then, NWS has invested considerable time and effort in analyzing and defining AWIPS\u2019 requirements, effectively involving users, as we reported in 1993, through hands-on experience with prototypes. In 1992, NOAA awarded the AWIPS development contract to the Planning Research Corporation (PRC). Because of the contractor\u2019s failure to deliver an acceptable AWIPS design, NWS renegotiated the contract in 1995, basically assuming responsibility for development of all hydrology and meteorology application software and assigning the contractor responsibility for delivering the hardware and systems software and for integrating the entire system. To fulfill its responsibility, NWS established joint NWS and contractor applications software (for example, the software that executes atmospheric and hydrological numerical and statistical models, manipulates satellite and radar graphics, etc.) development teams.", "NWS\u2019 current plans call for building and integrating AWIPS in seven increments. Thus far, NWS and the contractor have installed a very limited version of AWIPS, the first increment, at three sites to gain some experience in developing, testing, implementing, and operating a limited capability AWIPS. This limited version is also intended to validate selected AWIPS architectural features, such as satellite broadcasts and the central communications and system monitoring \u201chub.\u201d NWS has begun development of the second increment. NWS estimates that AWIPS will cost $525 million to fully develop and deploy. Deployment of less than the full AWIPS capability to NWS field offices and national centers is now scheduled to begin in 1996.

The five functional areas are (1) communications, (2) monitoring and control, (3) processing, (4) display and interaction, and (5) data management. The first two functional areas constitute what NWS calls the AWIPS network segment (that is, the national communications infrastructure). The latter three are referred to by NWS as the AWIPS site segment (that is, the functionality applicable to AWIPS sites). Appendix II provides examples of AWIPS capabilities for each functional area.

NWS has not done this for AWIPS. According to NWS officials, they have not explicitly linked either AWIPS requirements or higher-level capabilities to mission improvements, and they have no plans to do so because they claim that other requirements reviews, analyses, and validation activities already provide implicit justification for all AWIPS\u2019 proposed capabilities. We disagree. We carefully reviewed these other activities and while we found them to be valuable for different reasons, they were neither intended to nor do they demonstrate that AWIPS\u2019 full array of capabilities will improve NWS mission effectiveness.

In effect, agencies developing computer systems, like AWIPS, are to show that proposed system capabilities will produce some mission effectiveness or efficiency gain, like more reliable and timely forecasts or office and staffing reductions.", "These requirements are consistent with our recent findings on how leading public and private organizations tie technology investments to measurable mission improvements. We found that successful organizations\u2019 information system investment decisions are tied to explicit and quantifiable mission improvements. By doing so, these organizations know that investing in system requirements will make a difference in mission outcomes.", "Ensuring that proposed system capabilities are justified before expensive software development begins requires validating (that is, proving) that system requirements are anchored in user needs, which in turn are grounded in positive mission impacts. To do less increases the chances of spending money on capabilities that, even though desired by users, will not advance the organization\u2019s effectiveness or efficiency. Accordingly, software development guidance advocates assuring traceability from derived system requirements, designs, and implementations to both original user needs and mission needs. Approaches to validating proposed capabilities include performance modeling and prototyping."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Past and Ongoing Requirements Reviews, NWS Has Yet to Justify AWIPS\u2019 Capabilities on the Basis of Mission Results", "paragraphs": ["According to NWS, planned AWIPS capabilities are necessary and will contribute to NWS\u2019 goals of weather forecast and warning improvements, field office consolidation, and staff reductions. However, NWS officials were unable to produce any analysis or associated documentation to validate this claim. Instead, they presented the results of past AWIPS requirements analysis and definition activities and discussed ongoing requirements validation activities that, while useful in their own right, do not justify AWIPS capabilities on the basis of mission improvements. Each of these requirements review activities are discussed below.", "The first AWIPS requirements review began in 1984, when NWS initiated the Denver AWIPS Risk Reduction and Requirements Evaluation (DARE) program, an extensive AWIPS prototyping effort to analyze and refine meteorology requirements. Later, NWS augmented the DARE prototype addressed roughly half of AWIPS\u2019 22,000 requirements. The half that were addressed equates to over three-fourths of AWIPS\u2019 total lines of code. Moreover, even those AWIPS capabilities that were part of the prototypes, with one limited exception, were not explicitly linked to measurable improvements in NWS\u2019 mission effectiveness during these prototyping activities. The one exception is an NWS analysis linking DARE activities occurred at the Norman, Oklahoma, weather office to emulate the operations of a future, modernized weather office. According to NWS, the emulation examined such things as the AWIPS user interface for displaying NEXRAD products, AWIPS\u2019 integration of national weather products (e.g., satellite imagery) with local data (e.g., NEXRAD products), and future weather office staffing levels. However, we reviewed the results of these emulation activities and found no evidence validating AWIPS-specific capabilities on the basis of stated NWS mission goals of better forecasts, fewer weather offices, or less staff. For example, one report concluded that the AWIPS prototype provided capabilities for viewing NEXRAD data that forecasters found \u201cuseful,\u201d but does not show the mission outcome of having the capabilities. Another report that was AWIPS-specific concluded that a proposed AWIPS capability known as Interactive Computer Worded Forecast (ICWF), which is later to be replaced by the AWIPS Forecast Preparation System (AFPS), actually decreased rather than increased forecaster productivity and should not be deployed in its current form.", "In 1994, in response to the contractor\u2019s earlier mentioned failure to produce an AWIPS design, NWS undertook what it refers to as a \u201cfunctional decomposition\u201d of the 22,000 AWIPS requirements. In effect, NWS placed these requirements into about 450 capability categories. These categories are the foundation of the AWIPS \u201cA-Spec,\u201d which, as mentioned earlier, is the high-level system specification that further combines most of the 450 capabilities into five broad functional areas. (See figure 1.) Clearly, the development of the \u201cA-Spec\u201d was a valuable undertaking in that it translated the 22,000 AWIPS requirements into a smaller, simpler, more understandable set of high-level functions. However, this translation did not, nor was it intended to, link requirements or capabilities to mission improvements.", "Beginning in 1994 and continuing through today, NWS also has been reviewing all AWIPS requirements to identify any that are, in its words, \u201carchaic,\u201d meaning that they are technologically obsolete, duplicative of other AWIPS requirements, or in need of modification to comply with AWIPS\u2019 system design. Thus far, NWS has reviewed about 900 of the 1,000 requirements it dubbed as potentially extraneous and chose to eliminate about 600. The remaining 100 still need to be evaluated. Again, this requirements \u201cscrub\u201d has been and continues to be worthwhile. However, NWS\u2019 above-cited criteria do not address whether the proposed requirement or capability will produce a measurable mission improvement.", "At the same time NWS is completing its review of the aforementioned \u201carchaic\u201d requirements, the joint NWS/contractor teams established to develop AWIPS\u2019 application software are examining requirements one last time before building each software module. According to the AWIPS Software Development Plan, the required AWIPS scientific applications in many instances were written several years ago and may still contain ones that are obsolete. However, the NWS official responsible for overseeing the joint development teams stated that the teams\u2019 process for reviewing the requirements does not attempt to validate requirements back to mission improvements. Also, the official stated that the focus of the reviews is on reaching a common understanding on how best to proceed in developing the software module."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NWS clearly needs a new, modern system to support its current operations and allow it to take advantage of the vast data streams now available through its new observing systems. However, whether all of the 450 capabilities it plans for AWIPS are necessary to accomplish this is unknown because the process it has followed in developing AWIPS, while providing for traceability between proposed system capabilities and user expressed needs, does not include validating that these capabilities explicitly and measurably advance NWS\u2019 mission efficiency and effectiveness, which NWS has defined in terms of improved forecasts, fewer field offices, and reduced staffing levels. Validating system capabilities to mission outcomes is vital because it confirms prior to costly software development that proposed system capabilities are grounded in and will contribute to NWS\u2019 mission goals.

In particular, they stated that extensive AWIPS requirements validation activities have occurred and are ongoing. They also stated that only AWIPS capabilities that are essential to NWS\u2019 mission are being pursued, and that their inability to prove that mission-based requirements validation activities were performed is not sufficient to conclude that AWIPS is not needed. They promised to provide additional documentation to show that AWIPS proposed capabilities are grounded in mission impacts.", "We agree that extensive validation activities have occurred and are still ongoing, and we give NWS credit for these activities in the report. Unfortunately, NWS\u2019 validation activities have only dealt with a part of the validation equation and have not validated AWIPS capabilities to its stated mission outcomes of better forecasts, fewer field offices, and fewer staff. This is completely at odds with our recent findings on how leading public and private sector organizations base successful technology investments on whether they produce meaningful improvements in the cost, quality, and timeliness of product and service delivery.", "Further, we neither state nor imply that AWIPS is not needed. Rather, we are saying that NWS is spending hundreds of millions of dollars without knowing whether all AWIPS capabilities will contribute to its stated reasons for investing in the system (improving forecasts and reducing field offices and staffing levels). Restated, while we do not question the need to replace AFOS, we do question whether AWIPS, with all the capabilities that NWS currently envisions it providing, should be that replacement.
