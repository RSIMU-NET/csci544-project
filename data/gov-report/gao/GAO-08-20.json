AFIP provides consultations when physicians cannot make a diagnosis or are unsure of their initial diagnosis. About half of its 40,000 consultations in 2006 were for DOD physicians, and the rest were nearly equally divided between VA and civilian physicians. AFIP's educational services train physicians in diagnosing the most difficult-to-diagnose diseases. Civilian physicians use these services more extensively than military physicians. In addition, AFIP pathologists collaborate with others on research applicable to military operations and general medicine, often using material from AFIP's repository of tissue specimens to gain a better understanding of disease diagnosis and treatment. To implement the 2005 BRAC provision, DOD plans to terminate most services currently provided by AFIP and is developing plans to relocate or outsource others. DOD plans to outsource some diagnostic consultations to the private sector through a newly established office and use its pathologists for consultations when possible. With the exception of two courses, DOD does not plan to retain AFIP's educational program. DOD also plans to halt AFIP's research and realign the repository, which is AFIP's primary research resource. The BRAC provision allows DOD flexibility to retain services that were not specifically addressed in the provision. As a result, DOD will retain four additional AFIP services and is considering whether to retain six others. DOD had planned to begin implementation of the BRAC provision related to AFIP in July 2007 and complete action by September 2011, but statutory requirements prevent DOD from reorganizing or relocating AFIP functions until after DOD submits a detailed plan and timetable for the proposed implementation of these changes to congressional committees no later than December 31, 2007. Once the plan has been submitted, DOD can resume reorganizing and relocating AFIP. Discontinuing, relocating, or outsourcing AFIP services may have minimal impact on DOD, VA, and civilian communities because pathology services are available from alternate sources, but a smooth transition depends on DOD's actions to address the challenges in developing new approaches to obtaining pathology expertise and managing the repository. For consultations, these challenges are to determine how to use existing pathology resources, obtain outside expertise, and ensure coordination and funding of services to avoid disincentives to quality care. While DOD has begun to identify the challenges, it has not developed strategies to address them. Similarly, whether the repository will continue to be a rich resource for military and civilian research depends on how DOD populates, maintains, and provides access to it in the future, but DOD has not developed strategies to address these issues. DOD contracted for a study, due to be completed in October 2008, of the usefulness of the material in the repository. DOD plans to use this study to help make decisions about managing the repository."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On May 13, 2005, the Department of Defense (DOD) recommended closing  the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP)\u2014an agency within  DOD\u2014as part of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. This  would require that the pathology services currently provided by AFIP be  discontinued, transferred to other parts of DOD or elsewhere, or  outsourced to the civilian community. AFIP provides pathology  expertise\u2014which is based on laboratory analyses of tissue or other  specimens to diagnose diseases or other medical conditions\u2014to military  and civilian physicians and maintains a rich and comprehensive catalog of  pathology material such as tissue specimens, referred to as the National  Pathology Repository. In addition to providing services to DOD, AFIP  provides its expertise to other physicians such as those working at the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and it has statutory authority to  provide pathology services to civilian physicians.

In this report, we discuss (1) the key services AFIP provides to  the military and civilian communities; (2) DOD\u2019s plans to terminate,  relocate, or outsource services currently provided by AFIP; and (3) the  potential impacts of disestablishing AFIP on military and civilian  communities.", "To accomplish these objectives, we reviewed recent reports describing  AFIP\u2019s services and business practices, including a previous GAO report  on AFIP\u2019s business plan, as well as those conducted by the Army Audit  Agency and BearingPoint\u2014a consulting company that fulfilled a contract  from the Army Surgeon General to review AFIP. We also reviewed other  documents and legislation pertaining to AFIP and the BRAC provision,  including business plans and data related to analysis that led to BRAC- related decisions. Additionally, we obtained data from AFIP to describe  key services it provides and we determined the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. We also interviewed officials from  AFIP, VA, the American Registry of Pathology (ARP), and pathology  associations such as CAP to collect information on the services that AFIP  provides. Within DOD, we interviewed officials from the Offices of the  Surgeons General of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)); the  TRICARE Management Activity; the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary  of Defense (Installations and Environment); the Uniformed Services  University of the Health Sciences (USUHS)\u2014a military medical training  and research institution; and the Office of the General Counsel.

In 1949, the Army Institute of  Pathology was renamed the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and the  museum became a unit within AFIP. In 1976, the Department of Defense  Appropriation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1977 established AFIP in  its current form, as a joint entity of the Departments of the Army, Navy,  and Air Force, to offer pathologic support to military and civilian medicine  in consultation, education, and research."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Role of AFIP", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the early part of the 20th century, AFIP was the only  institution in the country that maintained expertise in every major area of  anatomical pathology, attracting large numbers of consultations, trainees,  and research grants on the basis of the institute\u2019s unique reputation.  However, according to AFIP\u2019s Scientific Advisory Board, many changes in  modern medical practice over the last several decades have altered the  environment in which AFIP operates. For example, AFIP must now  compete with over one hundred civilian medical institutions, many of  which have in-house experts and comparable subspecialty areas of  pathology.", "AFIP provides pathology expertise for all branches of the military. AFIP  also provides pathology expertise for VA in exchange for a specified  number of VA staff positions assigned to AFIP. Additionally, AFIP offers  pathology expertise on a reimbursable basis for its civilian customers. To  assist AFIP in this part of its mission, the Department of Defense  Appropriation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1977 authorized ARP to be  established as a nonprofit corporation with responsibility for encouraging  and facilitating collaborative work between AFIP and civilian medicine.  As such, ARP enters into contracts, collects fees, and accepts research  grants on behalf of AFIP, in support of cooperative enterprises and  interchange between military and civilian pathology.", "From 1998 through 2006, DOD and others conducted reviews that  concluded that AFIP lacked controls over its financial operations,  provided services for the civilian medical community without adequate  reimbursement, and the costs of the services it provided to VA exceeded  the value of the paid staff positions VA provided in exchange. These  reviews concluded that DOD, in effect, subsidized AFIP\u2019s work for VA and  civilian customers. In response to these concerns, AFIP began making  changes to its operations in 2000, including the development and  implementation of a business plan meant to increase AFIP\u2019s revenue and  reduce DOD\u2019s level of funding to AFIP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Examines AFIP\u2019s Future Role", "paragraphs": ["DOD examined AFIP\u2019s operations as part of the 2005 BRAC process, which  was intended to find ways to consolidate, realign, or find alternative uses  for current facilities given the U.S. military\u2019s limited resources. In making  its 2005 BRAC recommendations, DOD applied statutory selection criteria  that included military value, costs and savings, economic impact to local  communities, community support infrastructure, and environmental  impact. In applying these criteria, the law required that priority  consideration be given to military value, and allowed the other criteria to  be considered to a lesser extent. In DOD\u2019s evaluation, AFIP received a low  military value due to its large portion of civilian-related work. Therefore,  DOD recommended disestablishing AFIP by relocating critical military  services and terminating civilian-related activities currently provided by  AFIP.", "As part of the BRAC process, the Secretary of Defense issued a report  containing his realignment and closure recommendations, which were  then reviewed by the BRAC Commission.

Its  pathologists spend nearly twice as much time providing this service as  they do providing education and research services. AFIP pathologists  provide consultations for cases referred to them with and without  diagnoses. That is, when physicians\u2014clinicians or general pathologists\u2014 at civilian, DOD, or VA medical centers cannot make a diagnosis or when  they are unsure of their initial diagnosis and are in need of another  opinion, they can send the case to AFIP\u2019s subspecialty pathologists for  diagnostic consultation. According to the American Board of Pathology,  there are 10 different areas of subspecialty pathology, such as  dermatopathology and forensic pathology. Additionally, pathologists are  recognized as subspecialists in other areas of pathology pertaining to  particular cancers, such as breast or prostate. Requesting physicians\u2014 those who send cases to AFIP in search of diagnostic consultations\u2014 typically need consultations for more complex cases that require the  additional expertise of a subspecialty pathologist. In the course of  providing these diagnostic consultations to the requesting physicians,  AFIP receives and is able to add pathology material to its repository. As a  result, consultations have been instrumental in expanding the repository.", "Over time, AFIP has increased the amount of services provided for DOD  and decreased the amount of services provided for civilians. The total  number of diagnostic consultations that AFIP provided remained relatively  stable from 2000 to 2004. However, as we previously reported, DOD  diagnostic consultations provided by AFIP increased by 30 percent from  2000 through 2004, while its civilian consultations decreased by   28 percent. We also reported that nearly all of the decrease in civilian  consultations occurred in the 2 years after AFIP announced that it would  raise its consultation fees beginning in January 2003. According to AFIP  and civilian pathologists, this decrease in civilian diagnostic consultations  was also attributed to a more competitive marketplace for obtaining  consultations. Additionally, these pathologists also cited the loss of  nationally recognized experts at AFIP as another possible reason for the  decline in the number of civilian diagnostic consultations being sent to  AFIP.", "In 2006, AFIP provided almost half of its consultations to DOD physicians.  From 2005 to 2006, AFIP decreased the total number of consultations it  provided from 44,169 to 41,582. Consistent with earlier trends from 2000 to  2004, AFIP continued to increase the number and percentage of  consultations provided to DOD and decrease the amount provided to the  civilian community from 2005 to 2006. (See table 1.) In 2006, the largest  percentage of consultations, approximately 48 percent, was conducted for  DOD, followed by those for VA and civilian physicians at nearly 27 percent  and 25 percent, respectively. AFIP also provided about 1 percent of its  consultations for others, which included other federal agencies and  foreign military services. While AFIP receives consultation requests from  all over the world, consultations are heavily concentrated from more  populous states and the East Coast. (See app. II for maps of AFIP\u2019s 2006  consultations.)", "In 2006, about 62 percent (25,621) of AFIP\u2019s cases were for consultations  where AFIP pathologists reviewed the initial diagnoses from DOD, VA,  civilian, or other physicians for confirmation or change. For these cases,  AFIP pathologists changed the initial diagnoses from requesting physicians  in 10,987 cases, or about 43 percent of the time. For the remaining   57 percent of the cases (14,634), AFIP confirmed the requesting  physicians\u2019 initial diagnoses. When AFIP\u2019s diagnoses differ from the  requesting physicians\u2019 initial diagnoses, it classifies the changes as either  minor or major. According to AFIP, a minor change often involves a  change in severity of the condition diagnosed or the choice of appropriate  therapy. For example, the initial diagnosis may have correctly identified a  tumor as malignant but may have assigned an incorrect type or level of  aggressiveness, which could affect treatment and prognosis. In addition,  AFIP classifies a change as major if it involves a change in the nature of  the condition diagnosed. For example, a major change would include  changing a diagnosis from malignant to benign. Both minor and major  diagnosis changes can lead to a different treatment and, ultimately, a  different outcome for the patient. As shown in table 2, most of AFIP\u2019s  changes to initial diagnoses that were provided by requesting physicians  were classified by AFIP as minor changes.", "The type of consultations DOD, VA, and civilian physicians seek from  AFIP differ somewhat, both in terms of the number of cases sent without a  diagnoses and the type of pathology expertise requested. For example,   47 percent of DOD\u2019s consultation requests were sent without an initial  diagnosis, compared to 27 percent from VA and 31 percent from civilian  physicians. This may be due, in part, to the type of expertise DOD and  civilian physicians most commonly need, which also differs. For example,  in 2006, almost a quarter of all DOD consultations were in the area of  forensic toxicology, which includes examining material from autopsies  and testing biological specimens for alcohol and drugs. However, VA  physicians most frequently requested AFIP\u2019s environmental toxicology  diagnostic consultations, while civilian physicians most frequently  requested hepatic consultations\u2014involving diseases of the liver\u2014as well  as gastrointestinal consultations.

For  example, AFIP has accumulated a large collection of gastrointestinal  stromal tumors, a relatively uncommon tumor. Recent studies involving  this collection have led to advances in the identification of, and therapy  for, this tumor. One of the responsibilities of AFIP pathologists is to  classify the material that AFIP receives into the repository so that  researchers can access it in the future.

As figure 1 shows, DOD\u2019s plans left  a lag time between when AFIP DOD diagnostic consultations ended in  December 2010 and when the PMO was expected to be operational in  September 2011.", "Implementation of these plans were put on hold by the requirements of  section 3702 of the fiscal year 2007 supplemental appropriations act,  which suspended all BRAC actions affecting AFIP until after DOD submits  detailed plans to the House and Senate Appropriations and Armed  Services Committees, which are due by December 31, 2007. DOD officials  acknowledge that the timeline as envisioned in their February 2007  implementation plan can no longer be met and the full amount of onetime  savings from disestablishment of AFIP will not be realized, although they  believe that they may still be able to complete all actions required by the  BRAC provision by 2011.", "While DOD is required to share more information regarding its plans with  Congress before the end of the year, other developments could impact the  implementation of those plans. Specifically, on May 17, 2007, the House  passed H.R. 1585, a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2008, which contains a provision that would require DOD to  establish a \u201cJoint Pathology Center\u201d at the National Naval Medical Center  in Bethesda. On October 1, 2007, the Senate passed its version of the same  bill. However, the Senate-passed version contains a provision that would  authorize, rather than require, DOD to establish a Joint Pathology Center  at Bethesda, \u201cto the extent consistent with the final recommendations of  the 2005  Commission as approved by the President.\u201d If a new  Center is established under either provision, it would be required to  provide diagnostic pathology consultation, pathology education, and  diagnostic pathology research. In addition, the Senate bill would require  that the Center, if established, provide maintenance and continued  modernization of the tissue repository.

For example,  Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts) and M. D.  Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Texas) each provide about 60,000 or  more pathology consultations per year. While AFIP has many different  subspecialty areas, major civilian medical institutions, such as The Johns  Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, Maryland) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering  Cancer Center (New York, New York) have from 10 to 17 different  subspecialty areas, respectively. Pathologists we interviewed emphasized  the importance of being able to obtain consultations from expert  pathologists, wherever they may work. They also stated that pathologists  with particular expertise who move from AFIP to the private sector may  be able to continue to provide consultations from whichever institutions  they may join. Most DOD and VA pathologists noted that even though  MTFs and VA medical centers can readily access AFIP consultations  without incurring additional fees, they already use subspecialty  pathologists from civilian medical institutions on occasion for  consultations due to their needs for particular subspecialty expertise and  concerns about obtaining a diagnosis in a timely manner. In addition, some  MTFs have subspecialty pathologists who can provide consultations for  other military physicians. For example, Brooke Army Medical Center and  Wilford Hall Medical Center\u2014both located in San Antonio, Texas\u2014each  have over seven different subspecialty areas. According to pathologists  from the five MTFs we interviewed, subspecialty pathologists from their  centers currently provide consultations to other nearby MTFs.", "Pathology education: Other institutions also provide pathology  education. For example, CAP offers educational courses covering a range  of topics such as histotechnology and molecular pathology. DOD, VA, and  civilian pathologists that we interviewed told us that they have fulfilled  CME requirements through other institutions and could continue to do so.  Pathologists we interviewed said that DOD and VA pathologists generally  make independent decisions about which classes to attend and how to  meet accreditation requirements. Military pathologists we interviewed also  said that due to limited budgets, pathologists generally do not travel to  AFIP to attend courses because other pathology organizations, such as  CAP, offer CMEs that are accessible without the need to travel. Most DOD,  VA, and civilian pathologists we interviewed said that AFIP\u2019s Radiologic- Pathologic Correlation course is unique and valuable to the radiology  profession. Some of the pathologists we interviewed said that this is  because the course utilizes the expertise of physicians who work with  pathology material from a large volume of difficult-to-diagnose cases,  requires attendees to bring unique specimens for class analysis and  discussion, and utilizes material from AFIP\u2019s repository, which houses a  comprehensive collection of specimens. Further, many pathologists and  representatives from radiology organizations told us that it is the most  common way radiology residents fulfill a requirement to have specific  training in pathology. Although the course is recognized as being unique,  according to guidance set forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate  Medical Education, radiologists could fulfill their accreditation  requirements through avenues other than AFIP. In addition, according to  DOD officials, it is not DOD\u2019s mission to train civilian radiology residents,  although we believe that DOD could be in a position to assist outside  groups if any expressed interest in becoming responsible for maintaining  the course.", "Research services: The type of research historically conducted by AFIP  could be conducted at other institutions or by pathologists who remain  with DOD. USUHS will continue to perform militarily relevant, biomedical  research, focusing on health promotion and disease prevention, as it gains  responsibility for the repository\u2014AFIP\u2019s primary research tool.  Additionally, the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner has also  been responsible for conducting research applicable to military  operations. Because it is being retained, it could continue to do so. Also,  AFIP has partnered with other government, academic, and private sector  institutions to carry out research services. Specifically, AFIP staff have  conducted research affecting general medicine through collaborations  with external organizations, such as The Johns Hopkins Hospital and the  Mayo Clinic. These organizations will likely continue to fund medical  research and could possibly continue to conduct research using pathology  material from the repository. Although USUHS has not finalized its plans  regarding the repository, its intent is to make the pathology material  accessible to others including civilian researchers, to the extent it is  approved by DOD, practicable, and legally feasible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Faces Challenges in Ensuring That Military Physicians\u2019 Access to Subspecialty Consultation Services Is Maintained at a Reasonable Cost", "paragraphs": ["Given that AFIP is a central source that provides its customers with  definitive consults on the most difficult-to-diagnose cases, DOD and VA  pathologists face challenges in obtaining similar consultative expertise  once AFIP is disestablished. These challenges include determining how to  effectively use existing subspecialty pathology resources, obtain outside  expertise, and ensure coordination and funding of services to encourage  efficiency while avoiding disincentives to quality care. In addition, DOD  must decide whether VA could obtain consultation services through the  PMO and whether VA will be able to provide some subspecialty pathology  expertise for DOD. While DOD and VA officials have begun the process to  identify these challenges, as of mid-August 2007, they had not yet  developed management strategies to mitigate them.", "Effective utilization of existing resources: While DOD officials told us  that they might be able to perform some in-house diagnostic consultations  for MTFs, they have not evaluated their existing medical resources to  determine the extent to which such consultation services can be  performed. According to DOD officials, some large MTFs have  subspecialty expertise and might be able to absorb some of the demand  for consultations, but DOD has not identified the potential volume and  type of consultations that these large MTFs could absorb. Further, DOD  pathologists expressed concerns that MTFs would not be able to absorb  many additional consultations without increasing the number of  subspecialty pathologists staffed at MTFs. This could be challenging, they  said, because it is difficult to retain pathologists within the military.  Because DOD is retaining some of its pathology capabilities from AFIP  under the BRAC provision, such as the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, it  will continue to have expertise available to provide services in the area of  forensic toxicology\u2014DOD\u2019s most frequently used consultation service in  2006. Further, several DOD officials were concerned that the DOD General  Counsel\u2019s interpretation of the BRAC provision requiring outsourcing  through the PMO would preclude DOD from providing second-opinion  consultations from expertise within its MTFs. In addition, although VA  may be able to absorb some of its own consultations using its subspecialty  pathologists, including those who are currently assigned to AFIP, VA  pathologists told us that VA is limited in how many additional  consultations its current subspecialty pathologists could provide.", "The PMO process: How the PMO functions and obtains diagnostic  services from medical centers outside DOD and VA has important  implications, both from a quality of care and a cost standpoint. DOD and  VA officials we interviewed indicated that DOD faces challenges in  developing the new PMO that can outsource for quality pathology services;  such challenges involve issues related to the timeliness of consultations  and the ability to obtain appropriate expertise at a reasonable cost. As of  August 2007, DOD has not formulated its management strategies for  addressing the following issues concerning how the PMO will function.", "Assisting other federal agencies with obtaining consultations.", "Although DOD has discussed the possibility that the PMO could include  VA in outsourced diagnostic consultations, no decisions had been made as  of mid-August 2007. Since VA has received over a quarter of AFIP\u2019s total  consultations, VA officials have expressed an interest in continuing to  receive consultations through the PMO once DOD discontinues offering  AFIP consultations. VA officials also expressed concerns about the cost of  obtaining consultations outside of AFIP, which they estimated to be much  greater than the financial support it currently provides to AFIP for its  services. In addition, the officials stated that AFIP has been responsible  for VA\u2019s DU program, and as of June 2007, VA officials were uncertain  about the extent to which staff and equipment providing these services  would be sufficient to meet the future needs. VA officials stated that their  agency did not have the equipment or expertise to conduct the analyses  needed for this program, and for testing of other types of embedded  fragments, such as cobalt, nickel, and tungsten. VA officials indicated that  testing for DU and other potentially harmful embedded fragments plays an  important role in providing high quality health care to recently injured  combat veterans. As we previously discussed in this report, DOD officials  are considering the possibility of retaining DU testing.", "Obtaining consultation services. Several military pathologists  expressed concerns about the challenges DOD and VA would face in  identifying and obtaining needed subspecialty expertise from pathologists.  These concerns stem, in part, from their understanding of AFIP\u2019s  capabilities to provide consultations for difficult-to-diagnose cases by  involving different types of subspecialty pathologists as needed. Within  AFIP, cross-consultation among experts is available under one roof. As  DOD will have to determine a new method for obtaining consultations  using the PMO, military pathologists expressed concerns that it might be  more difficult to access expertise dispersed among different institutions to  obtain accurate diagnostic information. DOD and VA pathologists also  expressed concerns regarding whether continuity of patient care would be  maintained for retired military personnel if pathology specimens from  active duty personnel and veterans are no longer sent to one central  laboratory, such as AFIP. At present, if a patient has had a previous  consultation, the material is available from the repository for comparison  if AFIP is requested to conduct another consultation at a later date for the  same patient. This can be important for the patient\u2019s care\u2014for example, in  determining if a patient\u2019s cancer is metastasizing or if a precancerous  condition is worsening. AFIP pathologists expressed concern that patient  care could be compromised if the pathologists providing consultations  could no longer obtain their patients\u2019 previous specimens, slides, or case  notes from the repository. In addition, according to an AFIP pathologist,  the repository is particularly valuable for AFIP\u2019s consultation services  because it can serve as a reference tool to compare pathology material  from one patient to that of many others to confirm a diagnosis. VA and  AFIP pathologists have raised concerns about whether alternate sources  of consultation services obtained through the PMO will be able to provide  the same continuity or quality of service unless pathologists from these  alternate sources can use the repository as a reference. Further, DOD  pathologists expressed concern about whether private sector institutions  with the best subspecialty pathology expertise can absorb the 40,000  consultations that have been conducted by AFIP annually. DOD  pathologists also indicated that as of August 2007, DOD had not yet  developed a management strategy to address this challenge.", "Timeliness of consultation services. DOD pathologists we interviewed  are also concerned that obtaining consultations may take longer than it  does under AFIP because it is unclear how DOD will identify and obtain  needed pathology expertise. Timeliness of consultation services is  important. For example, understanding the aggressiveness and particular  stage of a cancer in a given point in time can influence patient treatments  and outcomes. Some pathologists also anticipate that turnaround time for  DOD\u2019s consultations may increase due to difficulty coordinating among  pathologists with varied subspecialty expertise that are dispersed among  different institutions and that this could impair the quality of services that  DOD obtains. As of August 2007, DOD had not outlined the management  strategy that it will pursue to ensure timely access to consultative services.", "Funding mechanisms. DOD pathologists\u2019 access to subspecialty  pathology expertise can also be impacted depending on how DOD plans to  mitigate funding incentives related to centralization or decentralization of  the budget. According to DOD officials, as of July 2007, DOD had not made  decisions regarding whether the budget for consultations would be  maintained centrally at the PMO or if each MTF would receive a separate  budget for outsourced consultations. Because DOD pathologists did not  have to pay for AFIP\u2019s consultation services, there was no financial  disincentive to use them. Several pathologists we interviewed expressed  concern that decentralized funding for consultation services would create  disincentives to obtaining consultations and could ultimately affect the  quality of the medical care the military would receive for such services.  More specifically, these officials asserted that a decentralized funding  system would require a Department of Pathology Chair within an MTF to  scrutinize the department\u2019s competing demands for resources and make  decisions about whether to obtain outside pathology expertise or spend  financial resources on other patient care needs. VA pathologists also  expressed concern that funding issues could contribute to increasing the  difficulty of obtaining subspecialty consultations. If pathologists cannot  obtain subspecialty consultations when they are unsure of their diagnosis,  patients might be misdiagnosed. This is particularly relevant since, as we  discussed earlier in this report, AFIP has changed requesting physicians\u2019  initial diagnoses for about 43 percent of the cases it reviews.", "Minimizing costs of services through volume discounts. By working  with VA, DOD could further increase its economies of scale by purchasing  a higher volume of consultation services. However, several DOD and VA  pathologists expressed concerns that if DOD chooses to obtain services  from the lowest bidder, the quality of consultations could be  compromised. They informed us that large national laboratories would  likely be the lowest bidders, but these institutions might lack the  subspecialty expertise to provide the best services. In fact, such large  national laboratories currently use AFIP consultation services. Further,  DOD pathologists we interviewed expressed concern for their patients\u2019  care with respect to whether DOD would obtain the best subspecialty  consultations possible.", "DOD has formed a working group, which met for the first time in August  2007, to address issues pertaining to obtaining consultations. This group  includes representatives from the Offices of the Surgeons General of the  Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as other DOD and VA officials.  According to DOD officials, the workgroup spent its first meeting  identifying the challenges faced by DOD in obtaining needed expertise but  had not yet developed specific options to address the challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Could Be Affected Depending on How DOD Plans to Populate, Maintain, and Use the Repository in the Future", "paragraphs": ["Because DOD has not developed its strategy regarding how it will  populate, maintain, and use the repository, some pathologists we  interviewed were concerned about the future of the repository and  whether it would continue to be a viable research tool. Recently, USUHS  awarded a contract to study the usefulness of the pathology material in the  repository. According to DOD, once that study is completed in October  2008, USUHS plans to convene a panel of experts to develop a blueprint on  how to use the repository for research, and then will likely contract for  development of a detailed plan on how to best populate, manage, and use  the repository. USUHS does not intend to finalize key decisions until that  process is complete.", "USUHS officials told us that one of the challenges they face in the future is  how they will populate pathology material in the repository in order to  maintain its viability as a research tool. They explained that AFIP generally  populates its repository through pathology material obtained from its  consultation services. As a result, the repository includes material from  the DOD, VA, and civilian populations. Additionally, AFIP\u2019s Radiologic- Pathologic Correlation course has historically contributed to the growth of  pathology material in the repository because students, who are primarily  civilians, are required to submit samples to AFIP that have pathologic  significance. We estimate that the repository gains approximately 1,200 to  2,400 samples per year from students attending this course. Pathologists  we interviewed explained that the value of the material in the repository is  related to the number of cases it accumulates for a particular disease. That  is, in order for a researcher to be able to identify the characteristic  patterns of a disease allowing for its diagnosis and treatment, there must  first be a sufficient number of cases of the particular disease. USUHS  officials told us that due to the large volume of cases that AFIP  accumulated in the repository, including complex cases, researchers can  currently conduct studies of considerable sample size. Thus, the manner in  which USUHS plans to continue to accumulate material in the repository  can influence the pace of research.", "Because USUHS does not provide pathology consultations, in the absence  of civilian consultations it will need to develop other strategies to populate  the repository. The strategy that USUHS officials discussed with us was to  populate the repository with specimens from military hospitals. Populating  the repository in this manner, however, could skew the repository since  military hospitals generally draw patients that are largely young, male, and  active. This could decrease the usefulness of the repository, ultimately  affecting the breadth of research. As a result, it is important that USUHS  develop a strategy to determine how it will populate the repository,  considering both the quantity of pathology material for each disease as  well as the quality and type of material from which it draws.", "DOD, VA, and civilian pathologists we interviewed also recognize that  proper maintenance of pathology material is necessary for retaining the  repository\u2019s optimal usefulness. Specifically, as medical knowledge of  tumors and other conditions evolves, material requires reclassification by  pathologists with subspecialty expertise in order to be useful. As such,  repositories can become useless without continuous update and  evaluation. Officials from academic centers that we spoke with said that  the failure to preserve, maintain, and update the repository would be a  tremendous loss to pathology, and general medicine overall. USUHS  officials said that having staff pathologists with subspecialty expertise  responsible for properly classifying pathology material is important to the  repository\u2019s viability. USUHS discussed with us that it may employ about  10 to 12 pathologists with subspecialty expertise who would be  responsible for reclassifying material in the repository as needed.", "USUHS officials expressed a desire to expand the use of the repository to  others outside of DOD\u2014such as pharmaceutical companies and  cooperative ventures with other academic institutions\u2014so that the  repository\u2019s role in general medical research could continue and benefit  the general population. However, USUHS officials said that they first need  to determine policy, financial, and legal ramifications, such as patient  privacy issues, before they make any decisions regarding research access  to the repository assets. USUHS officials also told us that the pathologists  they hire would have access to pathology material in the repository and  would also be responsible for conducting militarily relevant research."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["AFIP is a noted institution that has provided pathology expertise in a  range of subspecialty areas, and its customers value the services that it  provides.

DOD  awarded a contract to study the usefulness of the material in the  repository, which it anticipates to be completed by the end of 2008. DOD  anticipates using the study, a subsequent panel of experts, and a possible  second contract to develop a detailed implementation plan to help make  decisions on how the repository will be managed. As part of its planning  process, it is critical for DOD\u2019s plan to go beyond the steps to terminate,  relocate, or outsource AFIP\u2019s services and include implementation  strategies that detail how it will organize consultation services and manage  the repository in the future.

However, DOD  partially concurred with the recommendation to report to the Congress  within 6 months of completing its study on the viability of the repository.  Specifically, DOD indicated that USUHS would not be in a position to  report its strategies on managing the repository until further work was  completed. As a result, we modified our recommendation to limit the  reporting requirement to information on the viability of material in the  repository and its usefulness for research. We also added another  recommendation that DOD should report to Congress at a later date on  USUHS\u2019s planned strategies for managing the repository. In its written  comments, VA agreed that the draft report was factually accurate, but  indicated that it did not fully capture the essential nature of AFIP\u2019s  services to VA and DOD or fully address the impact of its closing.

DOD emphasized that it  was in the process of developing alternative strategies that would be  coordinated internally and with VA to ensure that the strategies would  meet DOD\u2019s needs, assist the VA, and be in accordance with BRAC  recommendations. DOD concurred with our recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense should include in the December 2007 plan to  Congress implementation strategies for how DOD will use existing in- house pathology expertise available within MTFs, identify and obtain  needed consultations from subspecialty pathologists with appropriate  expertise through the PMO in a timely manner, and solidify the source and  organization of funds to be used for outsourced consultation services. In  addition, DOD agreed that the Secretary of Defense should submit a plan  to Congress within 6 months of completion of the repository evaluation  contract to provide information on the status of pathology material in it  and its research potential. However, DOD indicated that the results of the  evaluation contract will likely result in another contract to help develop a  detailed strategy on how USUHS will populate, manage, and use the  repository. Therefore, DOD will not be able to report on how USUHS will  populate, manage, and use the repository within 6 months of completion  of the repository evaluation contract and did not concur with that portion  of the draft recommendation.

In our report,  we discussed such concerns and stated that DOD faces challenges in  obtaining expertise similar to what AFIP offered.

We disagree. The draft report clearly states that  changing a diagnosis can lead to different treatment and, ultimately, a  different outcome for the patient. The report also states that timeliness is  important because it can affect patient treatment and outcomes. VA  appears to assume that DOD will not be able to obtain timely and quality  consultative services through the PMO.

We did not conduct an overall assessment of whether  it would cost DOD more to obtain consultations from other sources than it  would to maintain AFIP. DOD considered costs when developing its  recommendation to the BRAC commission to outsource consultations.  However, as we have reported previously, implementing other BRAC  recommendations has led to lower cost savings than DOD had estimated.  Regarding the costs for VA, we state in our report that earlier studies had  found that the costs of the services that AFIP provided to VA exceeded the  value of the paid positions VA provided in exchange. AFIP officials  indicated that this continued to be true in fiscal year 2007.
