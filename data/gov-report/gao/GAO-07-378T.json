US-VISIT is designed to collect, maintain, and share data on selected foreign nationals entering and exiting the United States at air, sea, and land POEs. These data, including biometric identifiers like digital fingerprints, are to be used to screen persons against watch lists, verify identities, and record arrival and departure. This testimony addresses DHS's efforts to (1) implement US-VISIT entry capability, (2) implement US-VISIT exit capability, and (3) define how US-VISIT fits with other emerging border security initiatives. GAO analyzed DHS and US-VISIT documents, interviewed program officials, and visited 21 land POEs with varied traffic levels on both borders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["US-VISIT entry capability had been installed at 154 of the 170 land POEs. Officials at all 21 sites GAO visited reported that US-VISIT had improved their ability to process visitors and verify identities. DHS plans to further enhance US-VISIT's capabilities by, among other things, requiring new technology and equipment for scanning all 10 fingerprints. While this may aid border security, installation could increase processing times and adversely affect operations at land POEs where space constraints, traffic congestion, and processing delays already exist. GAO's work indicated that management controls in place to identify such problems and evaluate operations were insufficient and inconsistently administered. For example, GAO identified computer processing problems at 12 sites visited; at 9 of these, the problems were not always reported. US-VISIT has developed performance measures, but measures to gauge factors that uniquely affect land POE operations were not developed; these would put US-VISIT officials in a better position to identify areas for improvement. US-VISIT officials concluded that, for various reasons, a biometric US-VISIT exit capability cannot now be implemented without incurring a major impact on land POE facilities. An interim nonbiometric exit technology tested (see photo, below right) did not meet the statutory requirement for a biometric exit capability and thus cannot ensure that visitors who enter the country are those who leave. DHS had not yet reported to Congress on a required plan describing how it intended to fully implement a biometric entry/exit program or use nonbiometric solutions. Until this plan is finalized, neither DHS nor Congress is in a good position to prioritize and allocate program resources or plan for POE facilities modifications. DHS had not articulated how US-VISIT is to align with other emerging land border security initiatives and mandates, and thus could not ensure that the program would meet strategic program goals and operate cost effectively at land POEs. Knowing how US-VISIT is to work with these initiatives, such as one requiring U.S. citizens, Canadians, and others to present passports or other documents at land POEs in 2009, is important for understanding the broader strategic context for US-VISIT and identifying resources, tools, and potential facility modifications needed to ensure success."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide a summary of our  December 2006 report on the challenges facing the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) as it implements United States Visitor and  Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) at land ports of entry  (POE).", "In the years since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the need to secure U.S.  borders has taken on added importance and has received increasing  attention from Congress and the public. In an effort to avoid repetition of  such attacks, and improve overall national security, Congress and the  Administration have sought better ways to record and track the entry and  departure of foreign visitors who pass through U.S. POEs by air, land, or  sea; to verify their identities; and to authenticate their travel  documentation. Pursuant to several statutory mandates, DHS, in  consultation with the Department of State, established an automated  visitor system to integrate information on the entry and exit from the  United States of foreign nationals, called the US-VISIT Program. According  to DHS, the purpose of US-VISIT is to enhance the security of U.S. citizens  and visitors, facilitate legitimate travel and trade, ensure the integrity of  the U.S. immigration system, and protect visitors\u2019 privacy. The program is  managed by the US-VISIT Program Office, which is headed by the US- VISIT Director, who currently reports to the DHS Deputy Secretary. US- VISIT is used in the field by officers with U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), a separate DHS component.", "US-VISIT is designed to use biographic information (e.g., name,  nationality, and date of birth) and biometric information (e.g., digital  fingerprint scans and photographs) to verify the identity of those covered  by the program. The program applies to certain visitors whether they hold  a nonimmigrant visa or are traveling from a country that has a visa waiver  agreement with the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. U.S.  citizens, lawful permanent residents, and most Canadian and Mexican  citizens are currently exempt from being processed under US-VISIT upon  entering and exiting the country. When foreign nationals subject to US- VISIT arrive at a land POE, they are directed by CBP officers from the  primary inspection area to the secondary inspection area for further  processing. Visitors covered by US-VISIT who are determined to be  admissible are issued an I-94 arrival/departure form, which, among other  things, records their date of arrival and the date their authorized period of  admission expires. The requirement that arriving nonimmigrants admitted  to the United States, unless otherwise exempted, be issued a Form I-94 as  evidence of the terms of their admission predates implementation of US- VISIT and was incorporated into US-VISIT processing.", "Many aspects of US-VISIT program implementation have been driven or  defined by various legislative mandates. These include a 2001 statutory  requirement to focus particularly on the use of biometric technology in  developing the integrated entry-exit system subsequently named US-VISIT;  a 2002 statutory requirement to develop biometric identifier standards to  be used to verify the identity of persons seeking to enter the United States  at POEs; and a requirement to install at all POEs equipment and software  to allow biometric comparison and authentication of U.S. visas and other  travel and entry documents issued to aliens, as well as Visa Waiver  Program participant passports. In addition, by law, an integrated entry and  exit data system was to be implemented at all U.S. POEs, including land  POEs, by December 31, 2005, but there was no specific requirement to  collect any new data on foreign nationals departing at land POEs by that  date. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, on  the other hand, did require the collection of biometric exit data for all  individuals subject to US-VISIT, but it did not set a deadline for  implementation of this requirement.", "This statement presents a summary of our December 2006 report on the  US-VISIT program, which was requested by the Chairman and Ranking  Minority Member of the House Homeland Security Committee and  Congressmen Filner, Grijalva, Hinojosa, Ortiz, and Reyes. My testimony  today provides a summary of our report and will focus on the following  issues:    what the US-VISIT Program Office has done to implement US-VISIT  entry capabilities at land POEs and what impact US-VISIT has had on  these facilities,  the status of US-VISIT Program Office efforts to implement a US-VISIT  exit capability at land POE facilities, and    what DHS has done to define how US-VISIT fits with other emerging  border security initiatives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["US-VISIT is a large, complex governmentwide program intended to    collect, maintain, and share information on certain foreign nationals  who enter and exit the United States;  identify foreign nationals who (1) have overstayed or violated the terms  of their visit; (2) can receive, extend, or adjust their immigration status;  or (3) should be apprehended or detained by law enforcement officials;    detect fraudulent travel documents, verify visitor identity, and  determine visitor admissibility through the use of biometrics (digital  fingerprints and a digital photograph); and  facilitate information sharing and coordination within the immigration  and border management community.", "The US-VISIT Program Office has responsibility for managing the  acquisition, deployment, operation, and sustainment of US-VISIT and has  been delivering US-VISIT capability incrementally based, in part, on  statutory deadlines for implementing specific portions of US-VISIT. For  example, the statutory deadline for implementing US-VISIT at the 50  busiest land POEs was December 31, 2004, and at the remaining POEs,  December 31, 2005. From fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2007, total  funding for the US-VISIT program has been about $1.7 billion.", "In reports on US-VISIT over the last 3 years, we have identified numerous  challenges that DHS faces in delivering program capabilities and benefits  on time and within budget. In September 2003, we reported that the US- VISIT program is a risky endeavor, both because of the type of program it  is (large, complex, and potentially costly) and because of the way that it  was being managed. We reported, for example, that the program\u2019s  acquisition management process had not been established, and that US- VISIT lacked a governance structure. In March 2004, we testified that DHS  faces a major challenge maintaining border security while still welcoming  visitors. Preventing the entry of persons who pose a threat to the United  States cannot be guaranteed, and the missed entry of just one can have  severe consequences. Also, US-VISIT is to achieve the important law  enforcement goal of identifying those who overstay or otherwise violate  the terms of their visas. Complicating the achievement of these security  and law enforcement goals are other key US-VISIT goals: facilitating trade  and travel through POEs and providing for enforcement of U.S. privacy  laws and regulations. Subsequently, in May 2004, we reported that DHS  had not employed the kind of rigorous and disciplined management  controls typically associated with successful programs. Moreover, in  February 2006, we reported that while DHS had taken steps to implement  most of the recommendations from our 2003 and 2004 reports, progress in  critical areas had been slow. As of February 2006, of 18 recommendations  we made since 2003, only 2 had been fully implemented, 11 had been  partially implemented, and 5 were in the process of being implemented,  although the extent to which they would be fully carried out is not yet  known."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "US-VISIT Scope, Operations, and Processing at Land POEs", "paragraphs": ["Currently, US-VISIT\u2019s scope includes the pre-entry, entry, status, and exit  of hundreds of millions of foreign national travelers who enter and leave  the United States at over 300 air, sea, and land POEs. However, most land  border crossers\u2014including U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and  most Canadian and Mexican citizens\u2014are, by regulation or statute, not  required to enroll into US-VISIT. In fiscal year 2004, for example, U.S.  citizens and lawful permanent residents constituted about 57 percent of  land border crossers; Canadian and Mexican citizens constituted about 41  percent; and less than 2 percent were US-VISIT enrollees. Figure 1 shows  the number and percentage of persons processed under US-VISIT as a  percentage of all border crossings at land, air, and sea POEs in fiscal year  2004.", "Foreign nationals subject to US-VISIT who intend to enter the country  encounter different inspection processes at different types of POEs  depending on their mode of travel. Those who intend to enter the United  States at an air or sea POE are to be processed, for purposes of US-VISIT,  in the primary inspection area upon arrival. Generally, these visitors are  subject to prescreening, before they arrive, via passenger manifests, which  are forwarded to CBP by commercial air or sea carrier in advance of  arrival. By contrast, foreign nationals intending to enter the United States  at land POEs are generally not subject to prescreening because they arrive  in private vehicles or on foot and there is no manifest to record their  pending arrival. Thus, when foreign nationals subject to US-VISIT arrive at  a land POE in vehicles, they initially enter the primary inspection area  where CBP officers, often located in booths, are to visually inspect travel  documents and query the visitors about such matters as their place of birth  and proposed destination. Visitors arriving as pedestrians enter an  equivalent primary inspection area, generally inside a CBP building. If the  CBP officer believes a more detailed inspection is needed or if the visitors  are required to be processed under US-VISIT, the visitors are to be  referred to the secondary inspection area\u2014an area away from the primary  inspection area\u2014which is generally inside a facility. The secondary  inspection area inside the facility generally contains office space, waiting  areas, and space to process visitors, including US-VISIT enrollees.  Equipment used for US-VISIT processing includes a computer, printer,  digital camera, and a two-fingerprint scanner. Figure 2 shows how U.S.  citizens and most Mexicans, Canadians, and foreign nationals subject to  US-VISIT are to be processed at land POEs.", "As of August 2006, there were 170 land POEs that are geographically  dispersed along the nation\u2019s more than 7,500 miles of borders with Canada  and Mexico. Some are located in rural areas (such as Alexandria Bay, New  York, and Blaine-Pacific Highway, Washington) and others in cities (such  as Detroit) or in U.S. cities across from Mexican cities, such as Laredo and  El Paso, Texas. The volume of visitor traffic at these POEs varied widely,  with the busiest four POEs characterized by CBP, in fiscal year 2005, as  San Ysidro, Calexico, and Otay Mesa, California, and Bridge of the  Americas in El Paso, Texas."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Had Installed US-VISIT Biometric Entry Capability at Nearly All Land POEs, but Faces Challenges Identifying and Monitoring the Operational Impacts on POE Facilities", "paragraphs": ["My statement will now focus on what the US-VISIT Program Office had  done to implement US-VISIT entry capabilities at land POEs and what  impact US-VISIT has had on these facilities.", "At the time of our review, DHS had installed the entry portion of US-VISIT  at 154 of the nation\u2019s 170 land POEs, usually with minimal new  construction or changes to existing facilities. As required by law, the US- VISIT entry capability includes biometric features\u2014such as digital scans  of 2 fingerprints\u2014to help verify the identity of visitors. CBP officials at all  21 land POEs we visited told us that US-VISIT\u2019s entry capability has  generally enhanced their ability to process visitors subject to US-VISIT by  providing assurance that visitors\u2019 identities can be confirmed through  biometric identifiers and by automating the paperwork associated with  processing I-94 arrival/departure forms.", "Going forward, DHS plans to introduce changes and enhancements to US- VISIT at land POEs intended to further bolster CBP\u2019s ability to verify the  identity of individuals entering the country, including a transition from  digitally scanning 2 fingerprints to scanning 10. While such changes are  intended to further enhance border security, deploying them may have an  impact on aging and space-constrained land POE facilities because they  could increase inspection times and adversely affect POE operations. Our  site visits, interviews with US-VISIT and CBP officials, and the work of  others suggest that both before and after US-VISIT entry capability was  installed at land POEs, these facilities faced a number of challenges\u2014 operational and physical\u2014including space constraints complicated by the  logistics of processing high volumes of visitors and associated traffic  congestion. Moreover, our work over the past 3 years showed that the US- VISIT program office had not taken necessary steps to help ensure that  US-VISIT entry capability operates as intended. For example, in February  2006 we reported that the approach taken by the US-VISIT Program Office  to evaluate the impact of US-VISIT on land POE facilities focused on  changes in I-94 processing time at 5 POEs and did not examine other  operational factors, such as US-VISIT\u2019s impact on physical facilities or  work force requirements. As a result, program officials did not always  have the information they needed to anticipate problems that occurred,  such as problems processing high volumes of visitors in space-constrained  facilities.", "Turning to another aspect of our work on US-VISIT entry capability, our  December 2006 report stated that management controls did not always  alert US-VISIT and CBP to operational problems. Our standards for  internal controls in the federal government state that it is important for  agencies to have controls in place to help ensure that policies and  procedures are applied and that managers be made aware of problems so  that that they can be addressed and resolved in a timely fashion. CBP  officials at 12 of 21 land POE sites we visited told us about US-VISIT- related computer slowdowns and freezes that adversely affected visitor  processing and inspection times, and at 9 of the 12 sites, computer  processing problems were not always reported to CBP\u2019s computer help  desk, as required by CBP guidelines. Although various controls are in  place to alert US-VISIT and CBP officials to problems as they occur, these  controls did not alert officials to all problems, given that they had been  unaware of the problems we identified before we brought them to their  attention. These computer processing problems have the potential to not  only inconvenience travelers because of the increased time needed to  complete the inspection process, but to compromise security, particularly  if CBP officers are unable to perform biometric checks\u2014one of the critical  reasons US-VISIT was installed at POEs.", "Our internal control standards also call for agencies to establish  performance measures throughout the organization so that actual  performance can be compared to expected results. While the US-VISIT  Program Office established performance measures for fiscal years 2005  and 2006 intended to gauge performance of various aspects of US-VISIT at  air, sea, and land POEs in the aggregate, performance measures  specifically for land POEs had not been developed. It is important to do so,  given that there are significant operational and facility differences among  these different types of POEs. Additional performance measures that  consider operational and facility differences at land POEs would put US- VISIT program officials in a better position to identify problems, trends,  and areas needing improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Cannot Currently Implement a Biometric US-VISIT Exit Capability at Land POEs and Faces Uncertainties as Testing of an Alternative Exit Strategy Continues", "paragraphs": ["My statement will now focus on the challenges facing DHS as it attempts  to implement a biometric exit capability at land POEs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Various Factors Have Prevented US-VISIT from Implementing a Biometric Exit Capability", "paragraphs": ["Various factors have prevented US-VISIT from implementing a biometric  exit capability. Federal laws require the creation of a US-VISIT exit  capability using biometric verification methods to ensure that the identity  of visitors leaving the country can be matched biometrically against their  entry records. However, according to officials at the US-VISIT Program  Office and CBP and US-VISIT program documentation, there are  interrelated logistical, technological, and infrastructure constraints that  have precluded DHS from achieving this mandate, and there are cost  factors related to the feasibility of implementation of such a solution. The  major constraint to performing biometric verification upon exit at this  time, in the US-VISIT Program Office\u2019s view, is that the only proven  technology available would necessitate mirroring the processes currently  in use for US-VISIT at entry. A mirror image system for exit would, like  one for entry, require CBP officers at land POEs to examine the travel  documents of those leaving the country, take fingerprints, compare  visitors\u2019 facial features to photographs, and, if questions about identity  arise, direct the departing visitor to secondary inspection for additional  questioning. These steps would be carried out for exiting pedestrians as  well as for persons exiting in vehicles. The US-VISIT Program Office  concluded in January 2005 that the mirror-imaging solution was \u201can  infeasible alternative for numerous reasons, including but not limited to,  the additional staffing demands, new infrastructure requirements, and  potential trade and commerce impacts.\u201d", "US-VISIT officials told us that they anticipated that a biometric exit  process mirroring that used for entry could result in delays at land POEs  with heavy daily volumes of visitors. And they stated that in order to  implement a mirror image biometric exit capability, additional lanes for  exiting vehicles and additional inspection booths and staff would be  needed, though they had not determined precisely how many. According  to these officials, it is unclear how new traffic lanes and new facilities  could be built at land POEs where space constraints already exist, such as  those in congested urban areas. (For example, San Ysidro, California,  currently has 24 entry lanes, each with its own staffed booth and 6  unstaffed exit lanes. Thus, if full biometric exit capability were  implemented using a mirror image approach, San Ysidro\u2019s current capacity  of 6 exit lanes would have to be expanded to 24 exit lanes.) As shown in  figure 3, based on observations during our site visit to the San Ysidro POE,  the facility is surrounded by dense urban infrastructure, leaving little, if  any, room to expand in place. Some of the 24 entry lanes for vehicle traffic  heading northward from Mexico into the United States appear in the  bottom left portion of the photograph, where vehicles are shown waiting  to approach primary inspection at the facility; the 6ix exit lanes (traffic  toward Mexico), which do not have fixed inspection facilities, are at the  upper left.", "Other POE facilities are similarly space-constrained. At the POE at  Nogales-DeConcini, Arizona, for example, we observed that the facility is  bordered by railroad tracks, a parking lot, and industrial or commercial  buildings. In addition, CBP has identified space constraints at some rural  POEs. For example, the Thousand Islands Bridge POE at Alexandria Bay,  New York, is situated in what POE officials described as a \u201cgeological  bowl,\u201d with tall rock outcroppings potentially hindering the ability to  expand facilities at the current location. Officials told us that in order to  accommodate existing and anticipated traffic volume upon entry, they are  in the early stages of planning to build an entirely new POE on a hill about  a half-mile south of the present facility. CBP officials at the Blaine-Peace  Arch POE in Washington state said that CBP also is considering whether  to relocate and expand the POE facility, within the next 5 to 10 years, to  better handle existing and projected traffic volume. According to the US- VISIT program officials, none of the plans for any expanded, renovated, or  relocated POE include a mirror image addition of exit lanes or facilities  comparable to those existing for entry.", "In 2003, the US-VISIT Program Office estimated that it would cost  approximately $3 billion to implement US-VISIT entry and exit capability  at land POEs where US-VISIT was likely to be installed and that such an  effort would have a major impact on facility infrastructure at land POEs.  We did not assess the reliability of the 2003 estimate. The cost estimate did  not separately break out costs for entry and exit construction, but did  factor in the cost for building additional exit vehicle lanes and booths as  well as buildings and other infrastructure that would be required to  accommodate a mirror imaging at exit of the capabilities required for entry  processing. US-VISIT program officials told us that they provided this  estimate to congressional staff during a briefing, but that the reaction to  this projected cost was negative and that they therefore did not move  ahead with this option. No subsequent cost estimate updates had been  prepared, and DHS\u2019s annual budget requests have not included funds to  build the infrastructure that would be associated with the required  facilities.", "US-VISIT officials stated that they believe that technological advances  over the next 5 to 10 years will make it possible to utilize alternative  technologies that provide biometric verification of persons exiting the  country without major changes to facility infrastructure and without  requiring those exiting to stop and/or exit their vehicles, thereby  precluding traffic backup, congestion, and resulting delays. US-VISIT\u2019s  report assessing biometric alternatives noted that although limitations in  technology currently preclude the use of biometric identification because  visitors would have to be stopped, the use of the as yet undeveloped  biometric verification technology supports the long-term vision of the US- VISIT program. However, no such technology or device currently exists  that would not have a major impact on facilities. The prospects for its  development, manufacture, deployment, and reliable utilization are  currently uncertain or unknown, although a prototype device that would  permit a fingerprint to be read remotely without requiring the visitor to  come to a full stop is under development.", "While logistical, technical, and cost constraints may prevent  implementation of a biometrically based exit technology for US-VISIT at  this time, it is important to note that there currently is not a legislatively  mandated date for implementation of such a solution. The Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires US-VISIT to collect  biometric exit data from all individuals who are required to provide  biometric entry data. The act did not set a deadline, however, for  requiring collection of biometric exit data from all individuals who are  required to provide biometric entry data. Although US-VISIT had set  a  December 2007 deadline for implementing exit capability at the 50 busiest  land POEs, US-VISIT has since determined that implementing exit  capability by this date is no longer feasible, and a new date for doing so  has not been set."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The US-VISIT Program Office Tested Nonbiometric Technology to Record Travelers\u2019 Departure, but Identified Numerous Performance and Reliability Problems", "paragraphs": ["US-VISIT has tested nonbiometric technology to record travelers\u2019  departure, but testing showed numerous performance and reliability  problems. Because there is at present no biometric technology that can be  used to verify a traveler\u2019s exit from the country at land POEs without also  making major and costly changes to POE infrastructure and facilities, US- VISIT tested radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a  nonbiometric means of recording visitors as they exit. RFID technology  can be used to electronically identify and gather information contained on  a tag\u2014in this case, a unique identifying number embedded in a tag on a  visitor\u2019s arrival/departure form\u2014which an electronic reader at the POE is  intended to detect. While RFID technology required few facility and  infrastructure changes, US-VISIT\u2019s testing and analysis at five land POEs at  the northern and southern borders identified numerous performance and  reliability problems, such as the failure of RFID readers to detect a  majority of travelers\u2019 tags during testing. For example, according to US- VISIT, at the Blaine-Pacific Highway test site, of 166 vehicles tested during  a 1-week period, RFID readers correctly identified 14 percent\u2014a sizable  departure from the target read rate of 70 percent.", "Another problem that arose was that of cross-reads, in which multiple  RFID readers installed on poles or structures over roads, called gantries,  picked up information from the same visitor, regardless of whether the  individual was entering or exiting in a vehicle or on foot. Thus, cross-reads  resulted in inaccurate record keeping. According to a January 2006 US- VISIT corrective-action report, remedying cross-reads would require  changes to equipment and infrastructure on a case-by-case basis at each  land POE, because each has a different physical configuration of buildings,  roadways, roofs, gantries, poles, and other surfaces against which the  signals can bounce and cause cross-reads. Each would therefore require a  different physical solution to avoid the signal interference that triggers  cross-reads. Although cost estimates or time lines had not been developed  for such alterations to facilities and equipment, it is possible that having to  alter the physical configuration at each land POE in some regard and then  test each separately to ensure that cross-reads had been eliminated would  be both time consuming and potentially costly, in terms of changes to  infrastructure and equipment.", "However, even if RFID deficiencies were to be fully addressed and  deadlines set, questions remain about DHS\u2019s intentions going forward. For  example, the RFID solution did not meet the congressional requirement  for a biometric exit capability because the technology that had been tested  cannot meet a key goal of US-VISIT\u2014ensuring that visitors who enter the  country are the same ones who leave. By design, an RFID tag embedded in  an I-94 arrival/departure form cannot provide the biometric identity- matching capability that is envisioned as part of a comprehensive  entry/exit border security system using biometric identifiers for tracking  overstays and others entering, exiting, and re-entering the country.  Specifically, the RFID tag in the I-94 form cannot be physically tied to an  individual. This situation means that while a document may be detected as  leaving the country, the person to whom it was issued at time of entry may  be somewhere else.", "Our report also noted that DHS was to have reported to Congress by June  2005 on how the agency intended to fully implement a biometric entry/exit  program. As of October 2006, this plan was still under review in the Office  of the Secretary, according to US-VISIT officials. According to statute, this  plan is to include, among other things, a description of the manner in  which the US-VISIT program meets the goals of a comprehensive entry  and exit screening system\u2014including both biometric entry and exit\u2014and  fulfills statutory obligations imposed on the program by several laws  enacted between 1996 and 2002. Until such a plan is finalized and issued,  DHS is not able to articulate how entry/exit concepts will fit together\u2014 including any interim nonbiometric solutions\u2014and neither DHS nor  Congress is positioned to prioritize and allocate resources for a US-VISIT  exit capability or plan for the program\u2019s future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Had Not Articulated How US- VISIT Strategically Fits with Other Land Border Security Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["My statement will now focus on DHS efforts to define how US-VISIT fits  with other emerging border security initiatives.", "DHS had not articulated how US-VISIT strategically fits with other land  border security initiatives. In recent years, DHS has planned or  implemented a number of initiatives aimed at securing the nation\u2019s  borders. In September 2003, we reported that agency programs need to  properly fit within a common strategic context governing key aspects of  program operations\u2014e.g., what functions are to be performed by whom;  when and where they are to be performed; what information is to be used  to perform them; what rules and standards will govern the application of  technology to support them; and what facility or infrastructure changes  will be needed to ensure that they operate in harmony and as intended.  We further stated that DHS had not defined key aspects of the larger  homeland security environment in which US-VISIT would need to operate.  For example, certain policy and standards decisions had not been made,  such as whether official travel documents would be required for all  persons who enter and exit the country, including U.S. and Canadian  citizens, and how many fingerprints would be collected\u2014factors that  could potentially increase inspection times and ultimately increase  traveler wait times at some of the higher volume land POE facilities. To  minimize the impact of these changes, we recommended that DHS clarify  the context in which US-VISIT is to operate. Our December 2006 report  noted that, 3 years later, defining this strategic context remained a work in  progress. Thus, the program\u2019s relationships and dependencies with other  closely allied initiatives and programs were still unclear.", "According to the US-VISIT Chief Strategist, the Program Office drafted in  March 2005 a strategic plan that showed how US-VISIT would be  strategically aligned with DHS\u2019s organizational mission and also defined an  overall vision for immigration and border management. According to this  official, the draft plan provided for an immigration and border  management enterprise that unified multiple internal departmental and  other external stakeholders with common objectives, strategies,  processes, and infrastructures. As of October 2006, we were told that DHS  had not approved this strategic plan. This draft plan was not available to  us, and it is unclear how it would provide an overarching vision and road  map of how all these component elements can at this time be addressed  given that critical elements of other emerging border security initiatives  have yet to be finalized.", "For example, under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  of 2004, DHS and the Department of State are to develop and implement a  plan, no later than June 2009, which requires U.S. citizens and foreign  nationals of Canada, Bermuda, and Mexico to present a passport or other  document or combination of documents deemed sufficient to show  identity and citizenship to enter the United States (this is currently not a  requirement for these individuals entering the United States via land POEs  from within the Western Hemisphere). This effort, known as the Western  Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), was first announced in 2005, and  some members of Congress and others have raised questions about  agencies\u2019 progress carrying out WHTI. In May 2006, we issued a report that  provided our observations on efforts to implement WHTI along the U.S.  border with Canada. We stated that DHS and the Department of State had  taken some steps to carry out the Travel Initiative, but they had a long way  to go to implement their proposed plans, and time was slipping by. Among  other things, we found that    key decisions had yet to be made about what documents other than a  passport would be acceptable when U.S. citizens and citizens of  Canada enter or return to the United States\u2014a decision critical to  making decisions about how DHS is to inspect individuals entering the  country, including what common facilities or infrastructure might be  needed to perform these inspections at land POEs, and     a DHS and Department of State proposal to develop an alternative form  of passport, called a PASS card, would rely on RFID technology to help  DHS process U.S. citizens re-entering the country, but DHS had not  made decisions involving a broad set of considerations that included  (1) utilizing security features to protect personal information, (2)  ensuring that proper equipment and facilities are in place to facilitate  crossings at land borders, and (3) enhancing compatibility with other  border crossing technology already in use.", "As of September 2006, DHS had still not finalized plans for changing the  inspection process and using technology to process U.S. citizens and  foreign nationals of Canada, Bermuda, and Mexico re-entering or entering  the country at land POEs. In the absence of decisions about the strategic  direction of both programs, it was unclear (1) how the technology used to  facilitate border crossings under the Travel Initiative would be integrated  with US-VISIT technology, if at all, and (2) how land POE facilities would  have to be modified to accommodate both programs to ensure efficient  inspections that do not seriously affect wait times. This raises the  possibility that CBP would be faced with managing differing technology  platforms and border inspection processes at high-volume land POEs  facilities that, according to DHS, already face space constraints and  congestion.", "Similarly, our December 2006 report noted that it is not clear how US- VISIT is to operate in relation to another emerging border security effort,  the Secure Border Initiative (SBI)\u2014a comprehensive DHS initiative,  announced last year, to secure the country\u2019s borders and reduce illegal  migration. Under SBI and its CBP component, called SBInet, DHS plans to  use a systems approach to integrate personnel, infrastructures,  technologies, and rapid response capability into a comprehensive border  protection system. DHS reports that, among other things, SBInet is to  encompass both the northern and southern land borders, including the  Great Lakes, under a unified border control strategy whereby CBP is to  focus on the interdiction of cross-border violations between the ports and  at the official land POEs and funnel traffic to the land POEs. As part of  SBI, DHS also plans to focus on interior enforcement\u2014disrupting and  dismantling cross border crime into the interior of the United States while  locating and removing aliens who are present in the United States in  violation of law. Although DHS has published some information on SBI  and SBInet, it remains unclear how SBInet will be linked, if at all, to US- VISIT so that the two systems can share technology, infrastructure, and  data across programs.", "Also, given the absence of a comprehensive entry and exit system,  questions remain about what meaningful data US-VISIT may be able to  provide other DHS components, such as Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), to ensure that DHS can, from an interior enforcement  perspective, identify and remove foreign nationals covered by US-VISIT  who may have overstayed their visas. In a May 2004 report, we stated that  although no firm estimates were available, the extent of overstaying is  significant. We stated that most long-term overstays appeared to be  motivated by economic opportunities, but a few had been identified as  terrorists or involved in terrorist-related activities. Notably, some of the  September 11 hijackers had overstayed their visas. We further reported  that US-VISIT held promise for identifying and tracking overstays as long  as it could overcome weaknesses matching visitors\u2019 entry and exit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions, Recommendations, and Agency Response", "paragraphs": ["Developing and deploying complex technology that records the entry and  exit of millions of visitors to the United States, verifies their identities to  mitigate the likelihood that terrorists or criminals can enter or exit at will,  and tracks persons who remain in the country longer than authorized is a  worthy goal in our nation\u2019s effort to enhance border security in a post-9/11  era. But doing so also poses significant challenges; foremost among them  is striking a reasonable balance between US-VISIT\u2019s goals of providing  security to U.S. citizens and visitors while facilitating legitimate trade and  travel.", "DHS has made considerable progress making the entry portion of the US- VISIT program at land POEs operational, but our work raised questions  whether DHS has adequately assessed how US-VISIT has affected  operations at land POEs. Because US-VISIT will likely continue to have an  impact on land POE facilities as it evolves\u2014especially as new technology  and equipment are introduced\u2014it is important for US-VISIT and CBP  officials to have sufficient management controls for identifying and  reporting potential computer and other operational problems that could  affect the ability of US-VISIT entry capability to operate as intended. For  example, if disruptions to US-VISIT computer operations are not  consistently and promptly reported and resolved, it is possible that a  critical US-VISIT function\u2014notably, the ability to use biometric  information to confirm visitors\u2019 identities through various databases\u2014 could be disrupted, as has occurred in the past. The need to avoid  disruptions to biometric verification is important given that one of the  primary goals of US-VISIT is to enhance the security of U.S. citizens and  visitors, and in light of the substantial investment DHS has made in US- VISIT technology and equipment. To help DHS achieve benefits  commensurate with its investment in US-VISIT at land POEs and security  goals and objectives, we recommended that DHS (1) improve existing  controls for identifying and reporting computer processing and other  operational problems to help ensure that these controls are consistently  administered and (2) develop performance measures specifically for  assessing the impact of US-VISIT operations at land POEs.", "With respect to DHS\u2019s effort to create an exit verification capability,  developing and deploying this capability at land POEs has posed a set of  challenges that are distinct from those associated with entry. US-VISIT has  not determined whether it can achieve, in a realistic time frame, or at an  acceptable cost, the legislatively mandated capability to record the exit of  travelers at land POEs using biometric technology. Apart from acquiring  new facilities and infrastructure at an estimated cost of billions of dollars,  US-VISIT officials have acknowledged that no technology now exists to  reliably record travelers\u2019 exit from the country, and to ensure that the  person leaving the country is the same person who entered, without  requiring that person to stop upon exit\u2014potentially imposing a substantial  burden on travelers and commerce. US-VISIT officials stated that they  believe a biometrically based solution that does not require those exiting  the country to stop for processing, that minimizes the need for major  facility changes, and that can be used to definitively match a visitor\u2019s entry  and exit will be available in 5 to 10 years. In the interim, it remains unclear  how DHS plans to proceed. According to statute, DHS was required to  report more than a year ago on its plans for developing a comprehensive  biometric entry and exit system, but DHS has yet to finalize this road map  for Congress. Until DHS finalizes such a plan, neither Congress nor DHS is  likely to have sufficient information as a basis for decisions about various  factors relevant to the success of US-VISIT, ranging from funding needed  for any land POE facility modifications in support of the installation of exit  technology to the trade-offs associated with ensuring traveler convenience  while providing verification of travelers\u2019 departure consistent with US- VISIT\u2019s national security and law enforcement goals. We recommended  that as DHS finalizes the mandated report, the Secretary take steps to  ensure that the report includes, among other things, information on the  costs, benefits, and feasibility of deploying biometric and nonbiometric  exit capabilities at land POEs. Our recommendation also stated that DHS\u2019s  report should include a description of how DHS plans to align US-VISIT  with other emerging land border security initiatives and what facilities or  facility modifications would be needed at land POEs to ensure that  different technologies and processes work in harmony. By showing how  these initiatives are to be aligned, Congress, DHS, and others would be in a  better position to understand what resources and tools are needed to  ensure success and ensure that land POE facilities are positioned to  accommodate them.", "DHS generally agreed with our recommendations and stated that it either  had begun to take or was planning to take actions to implement them. It  acknowledged that the exit technology tested by DHS would not satisfy  statutory requirements for a biometric exit system and said that it would  perform research and industry outreach to satisfy the mandate. DHS,  however, disagreed with our finding that the US-VISIT Program Office did  not fully consider the impact of US-VISIT on the overall operations at  POEs. It said that US-VISIT impacts are limited to changes in Form I-94  processing time, which according to officials, improved, and that issues  related to capacity, staffing, and other factors are \u201carguably\u201d beyond the  scope of US-VISIT. We agree that the approach taken to do operational  assessments of the impact of US-VISIT land POE facilities focused on  changes to I-94 processing time. Our concern is that the assessments did  not examine other operational factors, such as US-VISIT\u2019s impact on  physical facilities, to help ensure that US-VISIT operates as intended. We  believe more complete assessments of the impact of US-VISIT on land  POE operations would better position DHS to anticipate potential  problems and develop solutions, especially as additional US-VISIT  capabilities, such as 10-fingerprint scanning, are introduced at these  facilities.", "This concludes my prepared testimony.

It also required the integration of overstay  information into appropriate databases of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service and the Department of State, including those used  at ports of entry and at consular offices. The system was originally to be  developed by September 30, 1998; this deadline was changed to October  15, 1998, and was changed again for land border ports of entry and sea  ports to March 30, 2001.", "The Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management  Improvement Act (DMIA) of 2000 replaced the 1996 statute in its entirety,  requiring instead an electronic system that would provide access to and  integrate alien arrival and departure data that are authorized or required to  be created or collected under law, are in an electronic format, and are in a  database of the Department of Justice or the Department of State,  including those created or used at ports of entry and at consular offices.  The act specifically provided that it not be construed to permit the  imposition of any new documentary or data collection requirements on  any person for the purpose of satisfying its provisions, but it further  provided that it also not be construed to reduce or curtail any authority of  the Attorney General (now Secretary of Homeland Security) or Secretary  of State under any other provision of law. The integrated entry and exit  data system was to be implemented at airports and seaports by December  31, 2003, at the 50 busiest land ports of entry by December 31, 2004, and at  all remaining ports of entry by December 31, 2005.", "The DMIA also required that the system use available data to produce a  report of arriving and departing aliens by country of nationality,  classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, and date of arrival in and  departure from the United States. The system was to match an alien\u2019s  available arrival data with the alien\u2019s available departure data, assist in the  identification of possible overstays, and use available alien arrival and  departure data for annual reports to Congress. These reports were to  include the number of aliens for whom departure data were collected  during the reporting period, with an accounting by country of nationality;  the number of departing aliens whose departure data were successfully  matched to the alien\u2019s arrival data, with an accounting by country of  nationality and classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant; the  number of aliens who arrived pursuant to a nonimmigrant visa, or as a  visitor under the visa waiver program, for whom no matching departure  data have been obtained as of the end of the alien\u2019s authorized period of  stay, with an accounting by country of nationality and date of arrival in the  United States; and the number of identified overstays, with an accounting  by country of nationality.", "In 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act provided that, in developing the integrated  entry and exit data system under the DMIA, the Attorney General (now  Secretary of Homeland Security) and Secretary of State were to focus  particularly on the utilization of biometric technology and the  development of tamper-resistant documents readable at ports of entry. It  also required that the system be able to interface with law enforcement  databases for use by federal law enforcement to identify and detain  individuals who pose a threat to the national security of the United States.  The PATRIOT Act also required by January 26, 2003, the development and  certification of a technology standard, including appropriate biometric  identifier standards, that can be used to verify the identity of persons  applying for a U.S. visa or persons seeking to enter the United States  pursuant to a visa for the purposes of conducting background checks,  confirming identity, and ensuring that a person has not received a visa  under a different name. This technology standard was to be the  technological basis for a cross-agency, cross-platform electronic system  that is a cost-effective, efficient, fully interoperable means to share law  enforcement and intelligence information necessary to confirm the  identity of persons applying for a U.S. visa or persons seeking to enter the  United States pursuant to a visa. This electronic system was to be readily  and easily accessible to consular officers, border inspection agents, and  law enforcement and intelligence officers responsible for investigation or  identification of aliens admitted to the United States pursuant to a visa.  Every 2 years, beginning on October 26, 2002, the Attorney General (now  Secretary of Homeland Security) and the Secretary of State were to jointly  report to Congress on the development, implementation, efficacy, and  privacy implications of the technology standard and electronic database  system.", "The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 required  that, in developing the integrated entry and exit data system for the ports  of entry under the DMIA, the Attorney General (now Secretary of  Homeland Security) and Secretary of State implement, fund, and use the  technology standard required by the USA PATRIOT Act at U.S. ports of  entry and at consular posts abroad. The act also required the  establishment of a database containing the arrival and departure data from  machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and entry documents  possessed by aliens and the interoperability of all security databases  relevant to making determinations of admissibility under section 212 of the  Immigration and Nationality Act. In implementing these requirements, the  INS (now the Department of Homeland Security ) and the  Department of State were to utilize technologies that facilitate the lawful  and efficient cross-border movement of commerce and persons without  compromising the safety and security of the United States and were to  consider implementing a North American National Security Program, for  which other provisions in the act called for a feasibility study.", "The act, as amended, also established a number of requirements regarding  biometric travel and entry documents. It required that not later than  October 26, 2004, the Attorney General (now Secretary of Homeland  Security) and the Secretary of State issue to aliens only machine-readable,  tamper-resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use  biometric identifiers and that they jointly establish document  authentication standards and biometric identifiers standards to be  employed on such visas and other travel and entry documents from among  those biometric identifiers recognized by domestic and international  standards organizations. It also required by October 26, 2005, the  installation at all ports of entry of the United States of equipment and  software to allow biometric comparison and authentication of all U.S.  visas and other travel and entry documents issued to aliens and passports  issued by visa waiver participants. Such biometric data readers and  scanners were to be those that domestic and international standards  organizations determine to be highly accurate when used to verify identity,  that can read the biometric identifiers used under the act, and that can  authenticate the document presented to verify identity. These systems also  were to utilize the technology standard established pursuant to the  PATRIOT Act.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 did not  amend the existing statutory provisions governing US-VISIT, but it did  establish additional statutory requirements concerning the program. It  described the program as an \u201cautomated biometric entry and exit data  system\u201d and required DHS to develop a plan to accelerate the full  implementation of the program and to report to Congress on this plan by  June 15, 2005. The report was to provide several types of information  about the implementation of US-VISIT, including a \u201clisting of ports of entry  and other DHS and Department of State locations with biometric exit data  systems in use.\u201d The report also was to provide a description of the  manner in which the US-VISIT program meets the goals of a  comprehensive entry and exit screening system, \u201cincluding both entry and  exit biometric;\u201d and fulfills the statutory obligations imposed on the  program by several laws enacted between 1996 and 2002.
