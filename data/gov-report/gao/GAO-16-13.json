As a result, differences in the manifestation of certain diseases and reactions to treatment in women compared with men were not identified. For example, there have been instances of women having adverse effects that differed from those of men related to medications and other treatments. NIH's Inclusion Policy established requirements governing women's inclusion in its clinical research.", "GAO was asked to provide information on women's participation in NIH research. Among other reporting objectives, GAO examined (1) women's enrollment and NIH's efforts to monitor this enrollment in NIH-funded clinical research; and (2) NIH's efforts to ensure that NIH-funded clinical trials are designed and conducted to analyze potential sex differences, when applicable. To do this, GAO reviewed relevant laws and policies, including the Inclusion Policy, and federal standards for internal control; reviewed and analyzed NIH enrollment data from fiscal years 2005-2014; and interviewed NIH and IC officials and other experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) show that more women than men were enrolled in NIH-funded clinical research for fiscal years 2005-2014, but NIH does not make certain enrollment data readily available to interested parties or examine other detailed data to identify potential challenges to enrolling women in specific research and disease or condition areas. In fiscal year 2014, for example, NIH reported that across all of the clinical research studies it funded\u2014including phase III clinical trials, the largest studies involving human subjects\u2014 57 percent of enrollees (16.4 million) were women. NIH collects enrollment data from individual awardees through its Institutes and Centers (IC)\u2014which generally fund studies in different research areas\u2014and publicly reports data on aggregate enrollment as part of its implementation of the Inclusion Policy developed to implement provisions of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. However, NIH does not make the IC-level enrollment data from each of the 25 ICs that report data readily available to interested parties, so that interested parties must make an effort to seek out this data. In addition, NIH does not routinely examine more detailed enrollment data, such as enrollment data organized by the disease and condition being studied. As a result, NIH is limited in its ability to identify whether women are sufficiently represented in studies in specific areas\u2014such as cardiovascular disease\u2014or if the agency-wide data inadvertently mask enrollment challenges. By not examining more detailed data on enrollment below the aggregate level, NIH cannot know whether it is adequately including women in all of the research it supports, in a manner consistent with its Inclusion Policy. Further, NIH's reporting and monitoring in this area is inconsistent with federal internal control standards, which call for agencies to have controls to help ensure effective information flow and effective monitoring of agency activities.", "NIH requires that phase III clinical trial awardees consider whether analysis of potential differences in outcomes between women and men is needed in their studies\u2014one of the key requirements of its Inclusion Policy; however, the agency does not maintain, analyze, or report summary data to oversee whether analysis of outcomes by sex are planned or conducted. NIH officials told GAO that they rely on peer review and program officer monitoring to ensure awardee compliance with the analysis requirement. However, NIH program officers do not have a required field in a reporting system or other means to record the information they collect to monitor awardees' analysis plans and compliance with the Inclusion Policy requirement. In addition, there is no data element in NIH's data system to indicate whether an awardee's study should or does include plans for an analysis of potential differences in research outcomes by sex. As a result, NIH lacks summary data, such as the percentage of awardees in a given year with trials designed to identify potential differences in clinical outcomes by sex. Without this summary information, NIH cannot report this information in the agency's biennial reports to Congress and other stakeholders. The lack of summary data and reporting compromises NIH's monitoring of its implementation of the Inclusion Policy and conflicts with federal internal control standards, which call for agencies to ensure the flow of information about agency activities, provide for internal and external communication, and conduct periodic monitoring. Further, it limits NIH's assurance that it is supporting research that can be used to shape improved medical practice for both women and men."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NIH examine and report more detailed data on women's enrollment in NIH-funded studies, and collect, examine, and report data on the extent to which these studies include analyses of potential differences between women and men.

Although women make up just over half the U.S. population, their health  needs have historically been underrepresented in the research supported  by NIH and others. This underrepresentation in clinical research has led  to failures in recognizing differences between women and men in the  prevalence of certain diseases, in how certain diseases manifest, and in  the reactions to treatments. As a result, there have been notable  instances of women experiencing adverse effects and other poor  outcomes that differed from those experienced by men related to health  care treatments. For example, in 2013, the Food and Drug Administration  lowered the recommended dose of a popular sleep drug for women after  it was determined that women and men metabolize the drug differently.  That difference left women with more of the drug in their bodies the next  morning and therefore at a greater risk of driving while impaired.  Women\u2019s health research advocates have stated that without the routine  consideration of the potential for these and other clinical differences  between women and men, the nation does not receive the full value of its  public investment in biomedical research.", "It has been over 2 decades since Congress passed the NIH Revitalization  Act of 1993 (Revitalization Act), which provided statutory requirements for  NIH to follow regarding research on women\u2019s health. Specifically, the  Revitalization Act contained provisions for the enrollment of women in  clinical research studies\u2014including clinical trials\u2014and requiring that  clinical trials be designed and carried out to be able to provide for a valid  analysis of whether the variables being studied affect women and men  differently. The Revitalization Act also required NIH to establish  guidelines for including women in clinical research. In 2000, we examined  NIH\u2019s efforts to conduct research on women\u2019s health over the previous  decade. We reported that NIH had made significant progress in  implementing the Revitalization Act by issuing guidelines to implement  the law, conducting extensive training for scientists and reviewers, and  implementing a centralized data system to monitor enrollment. However,  we also recommended in 2000 that NIH continue to make improvements,  including better implementation of the requirement that some studies be  designed to permit analysis of results by sex, which could reveal whether  interventions affect women and men differently. In response, NIH  developed specific guidance on this aspect of the policy for applicants  and for the reviewers who evaluate applicants for NIH funding.", "Partly in response to our recommendation, in October 2001, NIH  amended its Policy and Guidelines on The Inclusion of Women and  Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research (Inclusion Policy), which is in  place today. The Inclusion Policy establishes two key requirements for  NIH-funded researchers conducting clinical research studies. Specifically,  researchers must (1) design research plans that detail the breakdown of  their studies\u2019 participants by sex and provide a rationale for their planned  enrollment; and (2) for certain clinical trials, include plans for analyzing  outcomes for potential sex differences, when appropriate, as determined  by prior scientific evidence.", "Despite these efforts, reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM)  published in 2010 and 2012 stated that continued efforts\u2014by NIH and  others\u2014are needed to improve both the overall status of women\u2019s health  research and, in particular, the ability of researchers to conduct analysis  of study results by sex to determine whether outcomes differ for women  compared to men. While experts acknowledge that there have been  increases in women\u2019s enrollment in clinical research studies since the  passage of the Revitalization Act, the IOM and others have found that  even when women are included in clinical trials, the results of analyses  are often not reported by sex\u2014even when the overall results are  published in peer-reviewed journals. A recent study found that less than  half of NIH-funded clinical trials overall had been published in a peer- reviewed biomedical journal within 30 months of trial completion, and in  response, NIH officials stated that other means of sharing such results\u2014 besides publication in scientific literature\u2014is needed. Experts have  stated that insufficient reporting of clinical trial results by sex limits the  ability of researchers to identify potentially important sex differences that  may ultimately affect patient care.", "You asked us to provide information on women\u2019s participation in NIH- funded clinical trials, including NIH\u2019s policies regarding enrollment, and  both the analysis and reporting of clinical trial results.

In phase I clinical  trials, which typically include 20 to 80 people, researchers test a new  biomedical or behavioral intervention on human subjects for the first time  to evaluate safety. In phase II clinical trials, the intervention is given to a  larger group of people, 100 to 300 participants, to further evaluate  efficacy and safety. In phase III clinical trials, the intervention is given to  even larger groups\u2014from several hundred to several thousand  participants\u2014to compare the intervention to commonly used or  experimental interventions.

The guidance NIH provided to the ICs for  submitting their fiscal year 2013-2014 enrollment data to ORWH and  OER explains that ICs may choose to further break out their reported  enrollment data by disease area, portfolio area, or in some other manner.  According to NIH officials, certain ICs analyze enrollment data by various  disease categories when necessary.  However, the IC officials we spoke  with told us that their data systems are not capable of systematically  aggregating enrollment data in this manner for routine reporting.

Specifically, the internal control  standards for information and communications state that for an entity to  run and control its operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and timely  communications relating to internal as well as external events.  Information is needed throughout the agency to achieve all of its  objectives, and effective communication should occur in a broad sense,  with information flowing down, across, and up the organization. In  addition to internal communications, management should ensure there  are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining information  from, external stakeholders who may have a significant impact on the  agency achieving its goals (e.g., the Women\u2019s Health Advisory  Committee). Federal internal control standards for monitoring call for  management to assess the quality of agency performance over time and  ensure that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly  resolved.", "Because NIH does not readily share IC-level enrollment data with the  public and other interested parties, such as the Women\u2019s Health Advisory  Committee\u2014through means such as the ORWH website or the biennial  NIH enrollment report\u2014those interested in reviewing IC-level enrollment  information would have to attend\u2014or watch online if webcast\u2014each  individual IC\u2019s advisory board or council meeting or specifically seek out  or request any public record resulting from these meetings to have  access to these data. In addition, by not routinely examining more  detailed enrollment data that is aggregated by sex\u2014such as data at the  disease and condition level\u2014NIH is limited in its ability to identify whether  women are sufficiently represented in studies in specific areas that cross  ICs\u2014such as obesity. Further, NIH does not have information of sufficient  detail to monitor and determine if the aggregate enrollment data from  across NIH inadvertently mask low enrollment for particular research  areas or diseases or conditions. At an April 2015 Women\u2019s Health  Advisory Committee meeting, some committee members raised such  concerns, noting that published studies on clinical trials of specific  diseases and conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, appeared to  show that women\u2019s enrollment was lower than the enrollment that NIH  had reported in the aggregate.

Peer reviewers  document this assessment in a summary statement provided to the ICs  for final award determinations. According to NIH officials, if reviewers  determine that an applicant\u2019s plans are not acceptable, the applicant is  barred from funding until the plans are addressed and deemed  acceptable by IC officials. After awards are made, program officers from  the ICs that fund the studies are responsible for monitoring awardees\u2019  overall progress on an ongoing basis. Specifically, program officers are to  review awardees\u2019 annual progress reports, which the Inclusion Policy  states should address analysis of potential sex differences, as  appropriate. Officials from one IC told us that, through their regular  interactions with awardees, program officers are very familiar with the  design of their awardees\u2019 trials and whether any such analysis is planned  or underway.", "NIH program officers monitor individual awardees\u2019 compliance with the  analysis requirement of the Inclusion Policy; however, the agency lacks  summary data on awardees\u2019 analysis plans, including the percentage of  awardees in a given year with trials designed to identify potential sex  differences, when applicable. Currently, program officers review  awardees\u2019 progress reports\u2014including any information reported regarding  the analysis of potential sex differences\u2014but do not have means, such as  a written checklist or a required field in an electronic reporting system, for  recording the information obtained through this monitoring, as they do for  monitoring enrollment. NIH\u2019s awardee data system includes information  on whether individual awards include phase III trials. However, the data  system does not have a data element that denotes whether an awardee\u2019s  study should include or has plans for an analysis of potential sex  differences. Although such information is included in the narrative  included in awardees\u2019 funding applications, this information cannot be  easily aggregated for summary reporting, NIH officials explained, and  therefore they do not estimate the proportion of trials being conducted at  any one time that are designed and explicitly intended to identify  differences in study outcomes by sex. NIH officials also told us that they  plan to add a question for this type of monitoring to the existing electronic  checklist used by program officers in the fall of this year, to be  implemented for awards funded in fiscal year 2016.", "Because NIH does not have summary data regarding the analysis  requirement of the Inclusion Policy, it has not reported summary  information on this aspect of the Inclusion Policy to key stakeholders\u2014 including the Women\u2019s Health Advisory Committee and the Congress.  Notably, NIH\u2019s agency-wide biennial reports on the status of the Inclusion  Policy do not include information on the extent to which NIH-funded  phase III trials included plans to conduct analyses of potential sex  differences, or on the overall status of this aspect of the Inclusion Policy.  Instead, the report focuses primarily on NIH-wide aggregate enrollment.  NIH officials told us they rely on program officers\u2019 monitoring of individual  awardees to ensure that the analysis requirement of the Inclusion Policy  is being implemented appropriately after awards are made, because part  of the program officer\u2019s role is to ensure satisfactory scientific progress as  well as compliance with NIH policies. The officials added that they were  not sure of the utility of summary reporting in this case.", "NIH\u2019s lack of summary data and reporting regarding the analysis  requirement of the Inclusion Policy conflicts with federal internal control  standards. First, federal internal control standards require that federal  agencies have control activities in place to ensure that management\u2019s  directives are carried out and that these controls are monitored. These  standards also state that information should be recorded and  communicated to management and other responsible officials in a form  and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their internal  control and other responsibilities.", "Without summary data on the funded phase III clinical trials that are  intended to provide information on potential sex differences\u2014including  the number of such trials funded in a given year\u2014senior NIH officials are  limited in their ability to effectively oversee the implementation of the  Inclusion Policy to assess whether changes are needed to their  procedures. Further, NIH cannot provide this information to stakeholders  such as the Women\u2019s Health Advisory Committee and Congress in its  regular reporting on other aspects of the Inclusion Policy. As a result,  these stakeholders lack assurance that the agency is implementing the  Inclusion Policy as intended and in a manner consistent with the  Revitalization Act\u2019s provisions regarding the design of certain clinical  trials. In its fiscal year 2011-2012 Report of the Advisory Committee on  Research on Women\u2019s Health, NIH previously acknowledged that  inclusion is not just a matter of having women and men included in clinical  studies; rather, the scientific value of research studies is greatly  enhanced by providing knowledge about differences and/or similarities  between different populations affected by the diseases under study.  However, without assurance that its clinical trials are being designed and  conducted as directed under the law and its implementing policy, NIH\u2019s  insight regarding the interpretation, validation, and generalizability of  findings resulting from the research it supports\u2014as these findings apply  to both women and men\u2014is diminished, potentially limiting the value of  NIH-funded research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed NIH Policy Intended to Increase Public Reporting of Clinical Trial Results by Awardees and Could Increase Reporting of Sex- Specific Results, According to NIH Officials", "paragraphs": ["NIH has developed and proposed a policy intended to increase public  reporting of clinical trial results by requiring all NIH-funded clinical trials to  be registered and have results submitted to its registry and results  database, ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov contains accessible and  searchable information on publicly and privately supported clinical trials  and observational studies that is provided and updated by NIH awardees  and other researchers. Currently, all NIH awardees are encouraged to  register their trials with ClinicalTrials.gov at the beginning of the study, but  only certain trials\u2014those of certain drugs and devices regulated by the  Food and Drug Administration\u2014must register and provide summary  results as required by law. According to NIH officials, as of July 2015,  there were approximately 195,000 studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov,  and almost 18,000 of these have summary results information posted.  Under the proposed NIH policy, all NIH-funded clinical trials, regardless of  trial phase or type of intervention being studied, would have to be  registered and submit summary results\u2014including participant flow,  baseline demographics such as the sex and age of participants, primary  and secondary outcomes, and adverse events\u2014to ClinicalTrials.gov.  According to NIH, if the proposed policy goes into effect, compliance may  be enforced through possible suspension or termination of funding and  noncompliance could impact future funding decisions. NIH sought public  comments on the proposed policy from November 2014 through March  2015 and, as of August 2015, was analyzing the comments it received.  NIH anticipates that the final policy will be issued in the first quarter of  fiscal year 2016.", "NIH officials told us that the proposed policy for clinical trial registration  and results submission was not intended to increase reporting of sex- specific results to ClinicalTrials.gov; however, the officials also said that  there is the potential for more reporting of sex-specific results, given the  overall increase expected in the number of reported studies. Since the  proposed policy would require awardees to report results for their  prespecified primary and secondary outcome measures as part of the  summary results submission, the reporting of sex-specific results would  depend on the design of the trial, according to NIH officials. Specifically, if  sex differences were among the prespecified primary and secondary  outcomes studied in a specific trial, officials said, then that would be  reflected in the results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov.", "In issuing the proposed policy, NIH stated that its awardees are expected  to make their trial results available to the research community and to the  public at large in order to contribute to scientific knowledge and,  ultimately, public health. NIH proposed the policy partly in response to a  recent study, which found that within 30 months of trial completion, the  results of less than half of NIH-funded clinical trials had been published in  a peer-reviewed biomedical journal, the traditional method for sharing  results. NIH stated that because journal publication of clinical trials  results is not always possible, it is important to provide other ways for  clinical trial results to be disseminated and publicly available to  researchers, health care providers, and others.", "NIH has made efforts to encourage sex-specific reporting of clinical trial  results. In NIH\u2019s fiscal years 2011-2012 Report on the Advisory  Committee for Research on Women\u2019s Health, ORWH stated that it is only  through sex-specific reporting that full information becomes available to  the public and to scientists who can then use such data to inform future  studies, thereby building the knowledge base in a manner that takes into  consideration the influences of sex on health and disease. Specifically,  NIH has worked with journal editors and others to encourage reporting of  results by sex. Specifically, in 2011, NIH asked IOM to convene a  workshop of researchers, journal editors, and others on the topic to  discuss the importance of reporting results by sex and the implications of  this issue for journals\u2019 reporting policies. According to Stanford  University\u2019s Gendered Innovations project, 32 peer-reviewed journals  worldwide have editorial policies requiring that clinical trial researchers  include information on results by sex when they submit articles for  publication. However, editors from one medical journal that we spoke  with stated that when evaluating whether results should be reported by  sex, it is important to consider whether examining sex differences is a  primary outcome of the study, and whether the trial was big enough for a  valid subgroup analysis\u2014i.e., analysis of the effect of the intervention on  two or more different groups of participants, such as women and men.  They emphasized that if a study was not designed for a subgroup  analysis by sex and one was performed, the results could be erroneous.", "NIH has also made efforts to facilitate the sharing of clinical trials results,  including sex-specific information, through venues other than journals and  ClinicalTrials.gov. NIH has a number of policies that promote the  dissemination of research results\u2014and the underlying data\u2014and guide  awardees in disseminating their results, including the NIH Data Sharing  Policy, among others. Additionally, related to the sharing of sex-specific  information, NIH hosts a Women\u2019s Health Resources portal and a  Women\u2019s Health topic page on the Medline Plus webpage, which includes  links to other information about women\u2019s health from journal articles and  ClinicalTrials.gov. The agency also reports summaries of research related  to women\u2019s health in the biennial Report of the Advisory Committee on  Research on Women\u2019s Health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although NIH has made progress in the 2 decades since the 1993  Revitalization Act regarding the inclusion of women in NIH-funded clinical  research, opportunities remain for NIH to further extend the value of its  investment in medical research. NIH is responsible for ensuring that the  nation receives the greatest benefit of the large federal investment in  clinical research by fully implementing its Inclusion Policy, such that  women are adequately included in NIH-funded clinical trials when  appropriate, and that potential sex differences may be identified. By not  readily sharing IC-level enrollment data, NIH limits the public\u2019s and other  interested parties\u2019 ability to gain insight into enrollment issues at each of  the ICs, putting the onus of obtaining these data on the interested parties  themselves to attend or view online up to 25 individual IC board or council  meetings or request any public record of these meetings. By not  examining more detailed enrollment data\u2014such as data aggregated by  research area or specific to various diseases and conditions\u2014NIH cannot  know whether it is adequately including women across all of the research  it supports. Without this greater insight into enrollment for specific to  diseases and conditions, NIH is limited in its ability to assess whether its  programs that support cross-cutting research spanning multiple ICs are  successfully including women in clinical research or facing challenges  that the agency should address. Further, the lack of summary data and  reporting about the extent to which awardees plan to conduct or perform  analyses of potential sex differences in phase III clinical trials  compromises NIH\u2019s oversight and jeopardizes the agency\u2019s ability to  provide assurances over the Act\u2019s provisions regarding the design of  certain clinical trials and meet the purposes of its Inclusion Policy. Without  summary data, such as the proportion of trials being conducted that  intend to analyze differences in outcomes for men and women, and  reporting on that data, NIH and Congress cannot know whether or to what  extent current efforts are helping to ensure that differences in clinical  outcomes by sex are identified and that NIH is supporting research that  can be used to shape improved medical practices for both women and  men.", "The overall increase in the enrollment of women in NIH-funded clinical  research studies, such that women have been a significant proportion of  research subjects for nearly 2 decades, is a noteworthy achievement for  NIH.

Fear of  experimentation/trust issues included distrust of physicians and the  medical community and fear that the experimental treatment may be  inferior to the conventional treatment(s). Health related concerns cited in  the articles included concerns about the potential side effects or other  adverse events associated with the experimental treatment.

(See table 2.)  Personal/health benefits included access to new treatment and drugs,  while \u201cother\u201d reasons included the fact that the research was being done  at a clinic where the participant had already received care or was being  conducted by clinical staff with whom the participants were familiar.  Participation due to altruism included the desire to help science.", "The NIH IC officials and program officers we spoke with generally agreed  that the barriers and reasons for participation that we identified through  our literature review were consistent with those they have encountered  when working with their awardees. In addition, officials from one IC we  spoke with identified other reasons women participate in clinical research,  as cited by awardees. These reasons included the opportunity to learn  about the disease being studied and how to manage it, and a sense of  pride associated with participation.
