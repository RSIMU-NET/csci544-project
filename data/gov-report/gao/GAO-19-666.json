According to the plan, these initiatives will cost at least $116 million to implement through fiscal year 2021. GAO found that the plan generally contains the elements required under section 921\u2014a schedule and cost estimate\u2014and that several initiatives address aspects of GAO's prior recommendations. However, because many of the planned initiatives entail collecting information that will lay the groundwork for later reforms, assessing the feasibility of DOD's reform effort is difficult. For example, one logistics reform initiative plans to identify opportunities to improve processes, make recommendations, and develop an implementation plan for the recommendations by the end of fiscal year 2019.", "Although DOD officials told GAO that the department is making progress implementing the plan's initiatives and achieving cost savings on its broader efforts, DOD provided limited documentation of that progress. As a result, GAO could not independently assess and verify this progress. For example:", "Office of the Chief Management Officer (OCMO) officials provided briefing charts on the status of milestones for DOD's three human resource\u2013related initiatives stating that those initiatives are progressing according to the schedule, but did not provide underlying documentation for each milestone.", "According to DOD, its broader reform efforts have saved or are expected to save about $18.4 billion between fiscal years 2017 and 2020. According to Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials, they have validated these savings. However, DOD did not provide any supporting documentation that would allow GAO to independently validate these savings. GAO's prior work has found repeated shortcomings in DOD's ability to demonstrate that it has achieved its goals for savings from reform efforts. DOD is taking steps to address these challenges, including establishing cost baselines for DOD's major lines of business and incorporating Comptroller input into estimates of the costs and potential savings from initiatives as they are developed.", "Further, according to the plan, DOD has provided funding through its annual budget process for four of the eight initiatives included in its plan. For the four remaining initiatives, OCMO has identified a source of funding but not obtained that funding for two initiatives, is awaiting a cost estimate for one initiative, and has identified only partial funding for one initiative, which is designed to review contracts and categories of goods or services on a quarterly basis to identify savings. OCMO anticipates that savings identified in earlier rounds of this initiative will fully fund later rounds. However, in January 2019, GAO reported that, according to OCMO, DOD initially planned to fund its reform initiatives in part with savings generated by other initiatives, but recognized that this approach did not work because additional funding was needed. GAO recommended that DOD establish a process to identify and prioritize funding for implementing its initiatives. OCMO has updated its processes for managing its reform efforts in part to address this issue, but the effects of this update at this time are unclear."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars each year to  maintain key business operations intended to support the warfighter,  including systems and processes related to the management of contracts,  finances, the supply chain, support infrastructure, and weapon systems  acquisition. DOD\u2019s National Defense Strategy identifies reforming the  department\u2019s business practices as one of three distinct lines of effort  within the strategy. In addition, DOD\u2019s approach to business  transformation is among the areas identified in our High-Risk report,  which calls attention to agencies and program areas that are high risk  because of their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement, or are most in need of transformation.", "The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for  Fiscal Year 2019 established requirements for DOD to reform its  enterprise business operations, which include, among other things,  aspects of financial management, health care, acquisition and  procurement, and human resources operations. Section 921 of the act  requires the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Chief Management  Officer (CMO), to reform DOD\u2019s enterprise business operations to  increase effectiveness and efficiency of mission execution. DOD is  required to accomplish this reform through, among other things, reductions or improvements across all organizations and elements of the  department with respect to certain covered activities: civilian resources  management, logistics management, services contracting, and real estate  management. These reforms are required to achieve savings of at least  25 percent of the cost of performing the covered activities in fiscal year  2019 by the end of fiscal year 2020. Further, the CMO is required to do  one of the following:  If the CMO believes achieving the required savings will create overall  inefficiencies for the department, the CMO must provide notice and  justification to the congressional defense committees by October 1,  2019, specifying a lesser percentage of savings the CMO determines  to be necessary to achieve efficiencies in the covered activities and a  description of the efficiencies to be achieved.", "If the CMO believes the required savings can be achieved in fiscal  year 2020, then the CMO must certify to the defense committees by  January 1, 2020, that these reforms will achieve the required  savings.", "The CMO was required to submit to the congressional defense  committees a plan, schedule, and cost estimate for conducting these  reforms by February 1, 2019. DOD submitted that plan, titled Initial Plan  for Reforming the Business Operations of the Department of Defense for  Efficiency and Effectiveness, referred to hereafter as the \u201c921 plan,\u201d on  April 24, 2019.", "Section 921 also includes a provision for us to provide a report assessing  the feasibility of the plan within 90 days of DOD\u2019s submission. In addition,  section 921 has other provisions for us to assess DOD\u2019s progress in  implementing the reforms required by that section. In January 2019, we  provided our assessment of DOD\u2019s actions pursuant to section 921, as  required by one of these provisions. We reported that DOD\u2019s enterprise  business reform efforts were driven by nine cross-functional teams, but  those teams\u2019 progress had been uneven, in part because some teams  lacked resources to fully implement their approved initiatives. We  recommended, and DOD concurred, that DOD establish a process to  identify and prioritize funding for implementing its cross-functional teams\u2019  business reform initiatives. We discuss the status of DOD\u2019s efforts to  implement this recommendation later in the report. In addition, since our  January 2019 report, an Office of the CMO (OCMO) official responsible  for OCMO\u2019s management of the reform efforts told us OCMO has made  changes to the teams and processes related to these efforts, including  changes to the composition of the teams and the framework it is using to  manage the efforts. We discuss these changes further in appendix I.", "For this review, our objectives were to assess (1) DOD\u2019s 921 plan,  including its feasibility in reforming DOD\u2019s business operations, and (2)  the extent to which DOD has made progress in implementing the plan  and its broader reform efforts.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed DOD\u2019s 921 plan and  associated documentation and interviewed OCMO and other DOD  officials regarding the development of the plan. We compared this  information to the elements required under section 921. We also reviewed  our past work on DOD reform efforts and the specific subject areas  covered by DOD\u2019s initiatives, and identified findings and  recommendations from that work that are applicable to DOD\u2019s plan and  overall business reform effort.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed documentation and  interviewed OCMO officials regarding implementation of the 921 plan,  including the extent to which the plan\u2019s initiatives are proceeding  according to the schedules contained in the plan and any challenges  DOD is facing in implementation. We also reviewed documentation and  interviewed OCMO and other DOD officials on the extent to which DOD\u2019s  reform efforts have produced documented cost savings. Further, we  assessed the extent to which DOD addressed selected key questions that  we identified in our June 2018 report on agency reform efforts. In that  report, we identified key questions that decision makers should consider  for assessing the development and implementation of agency reforms  based on our prior work and leading practices on organizational mergers  and transformations, collaboration, government streamlining, and  efficiency. We used the term \u201creforms\u201d to broadly include any  organizational changes\u2014such as major transformations, mergers,  consolidations, and other reorganizations\u2014and efforts to streamline and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations. We  identified key questions across four categories related to (1) goals and  outcomes; (2) the process for developing reforms; (3) implementing the  reforms; and (4) strategically managing the federal workforce. Because  some of the questions were not applicable to DOD\u2019s plan, we did not  compare the plan against all of the key questions, but did note when  aspects of the plan related to any of the key questions.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2019 to September 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Plan Generally Addresses Requirements of Section 921, but Assessing Feasibility of Reforms Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s 921 plan identifies eight initiatives across the covered activities  and generally addresses most of the elements required under section  921. Specifically, section 921 required the CMO to provide a plan,  schedule, and cost estimate for conducting its reforms of the covered  activities. DOD\u2019s plan provides a schedule for all eight efforts, and  provides a cost estimate for all but one, which OCMO officials indicated  was still under development. The plan identifies costs of at least $116.3  million to $116.8 million to implement these initiatives through fiscal year  2021. We discuss DOD\u2019s funding of these costs later in this report.  According to DOD\u2019s plan, the eight initiatives have the following  objectives:", "Civilian hiring improvement. Shorten the time needed to hire civilian  employees, improve the matching of enterprise needs to employee  competencies, and establish standard metrics and reports on  performance of an improved hiring process.", "Human resources regulatory reform. Develop a new proposed legal  authority that allows the department to simplify, streamline, and  standardize civilian personnel policies. In addition, use regulatory  reform to better recruit, compensate, and retain a qualified civilian  workforce at DOD.", "Human resources service delivery. Establish a common human  resources business and service delivery model, a standard set of  performance measures, and a cost accountability structure that will be  applied to all human resources service providers, with a focus on  certain defense agencies and field activities.", "Strategic sourcing of sustainment and commodity procurement.", "Improve the buying power of the department, increasing data  transparency related to sustainment and commodity procurement, and  apply best-in-class cost and contract management practices with  suppliers to drive higher performance and lower cost.", "Maintenance work packages and bills of material.

Produce an integrated tool capable of  providing senior leaders with an effective assessment of all the  variables associated with the health and readiness of the munitions  inventory and the ability to assess options for correcting negative  trends.", "Service requirements review boards. Expand the use of service  requirement review boards\u2014which review, validate, prioritize, and  approve contracted services requirements to accurately inform the  budget and acquisition process.", "Category management. Implement best practices for purchasing  goods and services, such as consolidating separate requirements into  single contracts, allowing DOD to achieve savings from volume  discounts and develop tools aimed at focusing spending on contracts  that meet certain best practices for management.", "Several of these initiatives address aspects of our prior recommendations  related to the objectives of the initiatives. How findings and  recommendations from GAO and agency inspectors general have been  addressed in proposed reforms is among the key questions GAO has  previously identified for assessing agency reform efforts. We found that  DOD\u2019s initiatives address aspects of our findings and recommendations,  but in some cases do not fully address them. For example:  In September 2018, we reported that at least six organizations within  DOD, including three defense agencies and field activities and the  three military departments, provide human resources services to other  defense agencies or organizations. All perform the same types of  human resources services, such as those related to civilian workforce  hiring across DOD. We also reported that there is fragmentation and  overlap within the defense agencies and field activities that provide  human resources services to other defense agencies or organizations  within DOD. This fragmentation and overlap has resulted in negative  effects, such as inconsistent performance information regarding  hiring, fragmented information technology systems, and inefficiencies  associated with overhead costs. We recommended, and DOD  concurred, that DOD collect consistent performance information and  comprehensive overhead cost information as well as establish time  frames and deliverables for key reform efforts. DOD\u2019s human  resource service delivery initiative is intended, in part, to address our  recommendations. This initiative, however, is focused only on the  defense agencies and field activities responsible for human resources  service delivery, and does not include all human resources service  providers we highlighted in our September 2018 report.", "In June 2016, we reported that the Defense Logistics Agency and the  military services have some internal efficiency measures for supply  and depot operations; however, they generally have not adopted  metrics that measure the accuracy of planning factors that are  necessary to plan efficient and effective support of depot  maintenance. Additionally, the Defense Logistics Agency and the  services do not track the potentially significant costs to supply and  depot maintenance operations that are created by backorders.  Further, we reported that without relevant metrics on cost and  planning factors, DOD, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the  services are unable to optimize supply and maintenance operations  and may miss opportunities to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of depot maintenance. We recommended, and DOD  concurred, that DOD, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the services  develop metrics to monitor costs and accuracy of demand planning  factors. DOD\u2019s initiative on maintenance work packages and bills of  material includes steps that may, in part, address these  recommendations. Specifically, the initiative plans to assess the  accuracy of bills of material, one of the planning factors we  recommended DOD develop and implement metrics for, but does not  include assessing the accuracy of other planning factors.", "In August 2017, we reported that DOD\u2019s service requirement review  boards were intended to prioritize and approve contracted services in  a comprehensive portfolio-based manner to achieve efficiencies, but  the military commands we reviewed did not do so. Instead,  commands largely leveraged existing contract review boards that  occurred throughout the year and focused on approving individual  contracts. As a result, the review boards at these commands had  minimal effect on supporting decisions within and across service  portfolios or capturing efficiencies that could inform the commands\u2019  programming and budgeting decisions. We recommended, and DOD  concurred, that DOD clarify policies concerning the purpose and  timing of the review board process. DOD\u2019s initiative on service  requirements review boards expands the use of these boards, and  indicates that they are timed to inform budgets for the following fiscal  year, but does not indicate whether guidance to do so has been  provided. In its concurrence, DOD stated it would update the relevant  DOD instruction to include this guidance, but, as of June 2019, DOD  has not issued an updated instruction that includes this guidance.", "Although these initiatives intend to address aspects of our prior  recommendations, assessing the feasibility of DOD\u2019s reform effort is  difficult because many of the planned initiatives entail collecting  information that will lay the groundwork for later reforms. For example, the  human resources service delivery initiative tasks the reform team to draft  a project charter, collect and analyze information on human resources  service providers within DOD, and eventually develop recommended  courses of action for reform by fiscal year 2020. Similarly, the initiative on  maintenance work packages and bills of material tasks the reform team to  identify opportunities to improve processes, make recommendations to  address deficiencies, improve efficiency, and improve material availability  and then to develop an implementation plan for the recommendations by  the end of fiscal year 2019, with implementation beginning in fiscal year  2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Provided Limited Documentation of Progress in Implementing Its 921 Plan and Achieving Cost Savings, and Has Not Fully Funded Some Plan Initiatives", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Provided Limited Documentation of Progress in Implementing Its 921 Plan", "paragraphs": ["OCMO officials told us that DOD is making progress in implementing the  921 plan\u2019s initiatives according to the schedules contained in the plan,  and they provided summary documentation stating that progress has  been made on five of the eight initiatives.

However, DOD did not provide  separate underlying documentation for each milestone. For example,  under the plan, the teams conducting these initiatives were to have  established by June 2019 a common DOD process and metrics for  civilian hiring, prepared drafts of updated DOD policies and fiscal year  2020\u20132021 talent management guidance, and collected and mapped  different human resources service delivery models. However, OCMO  did not provide documentation of the common DOD process and  metrics for civilian hiring, drafts of updated policies and guidance, or  human resources service delivery model maps.", "For the service requirements review boards initiative, OCMO provided  documentation stating that the service requirements review boards  had largely been completed on schedule, but did not provide  information on the outcomes of these boards. OCMO officials told us  that delays in completing 3 of 69 boards had prevented them from  fully meeting planned deadlines.", "For the category management initiative, OCMO officials told us that  the first two quarterly \u201csprints\u201d\u2014reviews of different contracts or  categories of goods or services to identify savings\u2014for fiscal year  2019 had been completed and the third was in progress, but did not  provide documentation to support this assertion. For example, OCMO  did not provide information on the outcomes of the sprints.", "For the strategic sourcing of sustainment and commodity resources,  maintenance work packages and bills of material, and munition  readiness initiatives, DOD did not provide any documentation on the  progress of the initiatives.", "While most of DOD\u2019s initiatives included in its plan identify either  performance metrics or targets, five of the eight initiatives also state that  part of the work of the initiatives will be to establish such metrics or  targets. Among our key questions for assessing agency reform efforts is  the extent to which the agency has established clear outcome-oriented  goals and performance measures for the proposed reforms, and whether  the agency has put processes in place to collect the needed data and  evidence that will effectively measure the reform\u2019s goals. Identifying and  collecting this information can lay the groundwork for further reform  efforts.", "Moreover, we found that objectives for some of the initiatives in DOD\u2019s  plan are similar to those presented in prior plans with deadlines that have  already passed, suggesting that progress on some initiatives is going  more slowly than the department originally anticipated. For example,  DOD\u2019s August 2017 report to Congress on restructuring the CMO  organization included an initiative to create a single civilian personnel  system and rating system for certain employees by the middle of fiscal  year 2018. DOD\u2019s 921 plan contains a similar initiative on human  resources regulatory reform, which aims to develop standardized civilian  personnel policies and processes. Development of the initiative is not  scheduled to be completed until the end of fiscal year 2019, and  implementation would not occur until fiscal year 2020, at the earliest,  compared to the original fiscal year 2018 deadline for the initiative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Reported Cost Savings from Broader Reform Efforts but Provided Limited Documentation of Those Savings", "paragraphs": ["DOD has stated that its business operations reform efforts\u2014which are not  limited to the covered activities under section 921\u2014will produce cost  savings; however, DOD did not provide underlying documentation to  allow us to independently validate the savings.

Funding needs for the remaining four initiatives have not  been fully determined or met. Specifically:  1.  Funding needs for the human resources service delivery  initiative have not yet been determined.

Funding needs for the strategic sourcing of sustainment and  commodity procurement initiative have not been determined.  According to OCMO, the Defense Logistics Agency and the military  services are developing a detailed cost estimate for this initiative.

DOD plans to complete a total of 10 sprints, at  a total cost of $110 million. According to OCMO, limited funding has  hindered execution of two of the sprints so far. OCMO has requested  $12 million in its budget request for fiscal year 2020 to support this  effort and expects the remaining sprints to be funded by savings  identified through earlier sprints.

According to an overview of the new framework provided  by OCMO, the new process is designed to establish a simplified,  standardized, and repeatable process for managing these reforms and  identifying and prioritizing funding for reform initiatives. An OCMO official  told us that one of the goals of the updated process is to improve the  uniformity of documentation across business reform teams and initiatives.  That official told us the updated process also reduced the number of  decision points\u2014through which reform teams receive approval from  DOD\u2019s Reform Management Group to proceed with an initiative\u2014from  five to two.", "Further, OCMO introduced new processes for estimating and tracking the  costs and potential savings resulting from reform initiatives. Among other things, the updated framework includes input from the OUSD  (Comptroller). Specifically, according to OCMO documentation and  OUSD (Comptroller) officials, OUSD (Comptroller) officials review  estimates of the costs and potential savings recorded in OCMO\u2019s reform  management portal\u2014a database OCMO uses to monitor business reform  initiatives. OUSD (Comptroller) assigns a confidence score based on the  degree to which each initiative has been developed.
