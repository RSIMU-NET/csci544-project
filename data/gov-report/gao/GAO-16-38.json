Specifically, FEMA provides preparedness grants to states and localities, and works to implement the National Incident Management System nationwide, among other things.", "GAO was asked to review FEMA's efforts to enhance coordination for regional preparedness. This report addresses the extent to which FEMA and regional offices have (1) addressed preparedness grant management coordination challenges, (2) established a system to assess NIMS implementation, and (3) collaborated with RAC stakeholders. GAO analyzed FEMA documentation on grant management, NIMS evaluation, and RACs. GAO surveyed RAC members, visited 4 regional offices selected for their geographic representation, spoke with state emergency management officials from 10 states, and interviewed FEMA officials. The site visits cannot be generalized but provided insights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has taken some steps, but has not fully addressed, preparedness grant management coordination challenges between headquarters and its regions. For several preparedness grant programs, FEMA headquarters and regions share management and monitoring responsibilities. Assessments by FEMA and others since 2009 have recommended that FEMA regions manage and monitor preparedness grants to avoid confusion and duplication and strengthen coordination with state and local grantees. However, in 2012 FEMA changed course and decided to continue sharing grant management between headquarters and regions. Since then, FEMA officials said they are taking steps to address coordination challenges that exist in this structure. However, GAO found that challenges continue to exist. For example, states and FEMA regional officials told GAO that FEMA headquarters and regions did not always coordinate monitoring visits and provided inconsistent guidance to grantees. Further, while FEMA officials identified some steps to address the challenges, FEMA lacks a plan with time frames and goals for addressing them. Doing so will better enable FEMA to effectively address the long-standing challenges in managing preparedness grants.", "FEMA uses states' self-assessments to determine if states have implemented the National Incident Management System (NIMS), as required, but does not assess NIMS implementation using the results of preparedness exercises. NIMS is a comprehensive, national approach to incident management and provides a framework to enable all levels of government and the private sector to work together to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from incidents. Although states generally report high levels of NIMS implementation, officials from all four FEMA regional offices and 9 of 10 states GAO spoke with said that the NIMS self-assessments are perfunctory and do not measure whether, or how well, NIMS is being implemented. FEMA officials said they do not verify states' self-reported NIMS implementation information because of the scope and breadth of the information. All of the FEMA regions and 8 states said the best way to assess NIMS implementation is to review states' performance in after-action reports following exercises and real-world events. However FEMA officials do not review these reports to assess NIMS implementation. Doing so could allow FEMA to better assess NIMS implementation and identify areas for improvement.", "All 10 FEMA regions established Regional Advisory Councils (RAC) to provide advice on emergency management issues specific to the region, and about 90 percent of RAC members reported in a GAO survey that meetings are useful for collaborating with their FEMA regional office. However, some regions do not routinely meet with their RACs, and some do not consistently report back to RAC members on the status of their recommendations to FEMA. By more routinely obtaining input from RAC members and by providing timely feedback on recommendations, FEMA regional offices could better ensure they are coordinating with key stakeholders and identifying areas for strengthening preparedness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop a plan for addressing long-standing coordination challenges with grant management, review after action reports to assess NIMS implementation, and improve coordination with RACs.

DHS concurred with the other 4 recommendations and described the actions they planned to take in response."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through its 10 regional offices  is responsible for coordinating government-wide disaster response efforts  and delivery of all of FEMA\u2019s programs and activities to state, tribal, and  local partners; nongovernmental organizations; and citizens across the 56  states and territories. According to FEMA, disaster response begins and  ends with the affected FEMA regional office in the lead, and regional  FEMA personnel have central roles throughout the life cycle of an  incident. We previously reported how regional coordination efforts of  state and local stakeholders can enhance preparedness.", "FEMA regions coordinate with state and local stakeholders in various  ways in order to strengthen national preparedness to prevent and  respond to domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other  emergencies. For example, from fiscal years 2002 through 2015, DHS  awarded over $40 billion to state, local, tribal and territorial grant  recipients in preparedness grants to strengthen national preparedness  capabilities, and FEMA\u2019s regional offices are responsible for financial  management and, for selected programs, programmatic management of  these grants. The regional offices also work directly with states, tribes,  and territories to implement the National Incident Management System  (NIMS), a standardized approach to guide emergency responders at all  levels of government and the private sector to coordinate efforts to  respond to incidents and save lives and property. All states and  territories must agree to adopt and implement NIMS and certify their  compliance with NIMS as a requirement to receive preparedness grant  funding from FEMA. To enhance coordination with regional stakeholders,  regional offices convene Regional Advisory Councils (RAC) to obtain  insight into emergency management issues at the state and local levels.", "The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post- Katrina Act) was enacted to address various shortcomings in the national  response, including federal, state, and local preparedness capabilities,  identified in FEMA\u2019s preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina.  The Post-Katrina Act included several requirements that address FEMA\u2019s  regional coordination with state, local, and tribal governments. For  example, the Post-Katrina Act called for the establishment of regional  offices that would work with state, local, and tribal governments to ensure  effective, coordinated, and integrated regional preparedness, among  other things. As part of this effort and to address grant management  coordination challenges between headquarters and the regions, FEMA  developed plans to transfer grant management functions from  headquarters to the FEMA regions (regionalization). The Post-Katrina Act  also mandated that FEMA establish a comprehensive system to assess  compliance with NIMS, among other things, and required that each  FEMA regional office establish a RAC with members from state, local and  tribal stakeholders to advise regional administrators in each of FEMA\u2019s 10  regional offices on emergency management issues specific to their  regions.", "You requested that we review FEMA\u2019s efforts to enhance coordination for  regional preparedness. This report assesses the extent to which FEMA  headquarters and regional offices have (1) addressed grant management  coordination challenges between headquarters and the regions, (2)  established a comprehensive system to assess NIMS implementation,  and (3) collaborated with RAC members.", "To address the first objective, we gathered and reviewed relevant  documentation, such as FEMA assessments of grant management by the  Grant Programs Directorate (GPD), FEMA\u2019s previous delegations of grant  management responsibilities to regional offices, agency task force reports  on advantages and disadvantages of regionalization, FEMA headquarters  and regional office grant management roles and responsibilities, FEMA  documentation on regionalization pilot programs, and other memoranda  and internal documents. We also reviewed prior GAO reports on regional  preparedness, grant management, and consolidation of management  functions. In addition, we interviewed FEMA\u2019s Director of the  Preparedness Grants Division within GPD and other senior GPD officials  to discuss programmatic grant management as well as previous FEMA  assessments of the impact of moving management responsibilities to  FEMA regional offices. We also interviewed grant management officials  from 4 FEMA regional offices to discuss financial grant management and  coordination of monitoring activities with GPD. These offices were  selected in order to provide a mix of geographic locations and whether  the regional office had been selected to participate in FEMA grant  management pilot programs. Similarly, we interviewed officials from 9  states in the 4 FEMA regions to discuss grant management within the  states as well as interactions with FEMA grant management officials.  These states were selected to reflect a diversity of experiences from  FEMA regions we chose. While the information gained from these  interviews cannot be generalized across all states, it provides useful  insights into the nature of FEMA GPD and regional coordination with  states with regard to grant management.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed NIMS-related documents  such as the NIMS Doctrine, NIMS Compliance Guidance, NIMS  implementation reports, and results of the NIMS implementation  questions in the Unified Reporting Tool (URT). We also reviewed  documents on the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program  (HSEEP) and on preparedness grants requirements. We compared  FEMA\u2019s efforts in NIMS implementation and verification with Homeland  Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5) and with language in OMB\u2019s  Circular No. A-11, regarding data validation and verification. We  interviewed officials at FEMA\u2019s National Preparedness Directorate, which  includes the National Integration Center (NIC)\u2014the office responsible for  coordinating and enabling NIMS implementation to discuss the NIC\u2019s  efforts in implementing NIMS. To discuss NIMS implementation efforts at  the regional and state levels, interactions between regional and state  officials, and mechanisms for verifying how well NIMS is being  implemented, we also interviewed officials from the 4 FEMA regional  offices and 9 states mentioned above. In addition, because of the  recommendation of officials in several regional offices and states, we  interviewed an official from a 10th state from within the selected FEMA  regions. While the information gained from these interviews cannot be  generalized across all regions and states, it provided useful insights into  the various efforts in implementing NIMS. Additionally, we analyzed all 35  full-scale exercise after-action reports (AAR) that FEMA received for  exercises conducted during fiscal year 2014 in the 4 regions we visited.  The purpose of the analysis was to determine if they could be used to  assess the level of participants\u2019 implementation of NIMS. While the  results of these exercises are not generalizable to the country as a whole,  they do provide useful insights into their possible use to assess NIMS  implementation.", "To address the third objective\u2014to assess regional offices\u2019 collaboration  with RAC members\u2014we interviewed officials at FEMA headquarters with  responsibilities for regional operations and regional office officials from  the 4 regions we visited. We also reviewed FEMA and DHS Office of  Inspector General (OIG) reports with information and findings relevant to  RACs. In addition, we contacted FEMA RAC liaisons from all 10 regions  by e-mail to obtain information about their RACs and RAC members. We  attended two RAC meetings in two regions that took place during the  early part of our review, and obtained documentation of agendas and  other relevant materials for the RACs in all 10 FEMA regions. In addition,  we conducted a self-administered web-based survey from May 27  through June 29, 2015 of 110 RAC members FEMA identified as active  from all 10 regions and 77 responded, for a response rate of 70 percent.

NIMS implementation consists of  training, using a standardized way of defining and categorizing  emergency resources known as resource typing, and incorporating a  standardized organizational emergency response structure called the  Incident Command System into emergency management plans, policies  and procedures, among other things. States, tribes, and local  jurisdictions are required to adopt and self-assess their level of NIMS  implementation, and certify their compliance and report it to FEMA  through the URT in order to receive preparedness grant funding from  FEMA. Additionally, states receiving preparedness grants are required  to develop and maintain an exercise program consistent to the degree  practical with HSEEP in support of the National Exercise Program.  HSEEP exercises identify exercise objectives and align them to FEMA\u2019s  32 \u201ccore capabilities\u201d for evaluation during the exercise.

In response to the lack of coordination  in monitoring site visits, GPD\u2019s Deputy Assistant Administrator sent a  memorandum to staff in 2011 citing concerns that it had become  \u201capparent GPD HQ staff continue to do program monitoring visits without  proper notification to the regional offices\u201d and directing that headquarters  personnel conduct all monitoring visits in conjunction with regional staff,  changing the dates of any planned headquarters visits to accommodate  regional staff schedules. While the memorandum called for disciplinary  action against any GPD personnel who did not follow the directive, GPD  officials did not identify any instances where disciplinary action had been  taken.", "We also found challenges in the coordination of site visits. Officials in 3 of  9 states we talked with on grants issues stated that monitoring visits from  FEMA GPD and the regional offices do not appear to be well coordinated.  For example, officials in 1 state said that in September 2014, GPD and  regional grants staff conducted site visits during the same week; however,  neither the GPD staff nor the regional staff knew that the other was  conducting a monitoring visit that week. The state officials stated that they  had to leave one monitoring meeting early to go to another monitoring  meeting by a different group of grant management staff. Similarly,  regional grants officials in 2 of the 4 regions we visited said in 2015 that  they may or may not receive information on monitoring activities  undertaken by GPD officials, depending on who is conducting the  monitoring activities. A grant official in 1 region we visited stated that GPD  conducted a site monitoring visit as recently as September 2015, but did  not inform regional staff of this visit. Regional grants management officials  in all 4 regions we visited stated that not having the results of  programmatic monitoring creates challenges in financial monitoring. For  example, financial monitoring may identify a significant drawdown of grant  funds; however, without program information, regions cannot determine if  this corresponds to significant progress in program implementation.", "Further, challenges related to coordination and implementation of  guidance provided by GPD (headquarters) officials, FEMA regional  officials, and state officials has been a long-standing problem. For  example, in 2009, NAPA identified regional challenges associated with  assessment activities including grant monitoring, noting that FEMA  regional and headquarters units \u201cneed to reduce burden on states and  ensure assessments-requirements are coordinated among FEMA  divisions and the federal sector\u201d and that new documents from FEMA  headquarters \u201ctypically have a short review and comment period, and  adherence is often required prior to finalization.\u201d Similarly, the May 2010  RIG Task Force Report noted that \u201cthe timeliness of communication and  information distribution with the grantee community needs to be  improved\u201d and the need to \u201cformally establish regional liaisons to support  the consistent prioritization of communication within GPD and with  grantees.\u201d", "We found that these issues related to coordinating guidance provided by  headquarters officials to state officials continue to create challenges.  Officials from all 4 FEMA regions we visited said that GPD officials had  provided guidance to state grantees that contradicted guidance given by  the regional staff. Further, officials in 2 of the 4 regional offices we visited  stated that incorrect guidance given by GPD officials to state grantees  resulted in deficiencies during financial monitoring conducted by regional  grants personnel. Specifically, according to FEMA grant management  officials in 1 region, a grantee, at the advice of GPD officials, shifted funds  from one grant program into other grant programs, but regional grants  personnel later found, as part of their financial monitoring, that this was a  violation of regulations and required that the funding be returned.  Similarly, FEMA grant officials in another region stated that a new grantee  that received transit grants drew down the entire grant amount soon after  the grant was awarded, which is a violation of FEMA grant management  regulations. Regional officials asked the grantee to return the funds;  however, the grantee stated that GPD officials had told him he could draw  down these funds. Regional officials added that had the grantee not  returned the funds, the next step would have been to do an official  collection; however, regional offices do not have the authority to do this  because the grant program is managed from FEMA headquarters by  GPD.

For example, GPD  officials said that they had taken steps to improve coordination of site  visits and that, beginning in fiscal year 2013, GPD made integrated  financial and programmatic monitoring a priority, and incorporated this  into its monitoring plans. According to FEMA\u2019s fiscal year 2014 grants  monitoring plan, GPD officials are to contact regional grant staff when  monitoring activities are initiated and document this interaction.

For example, GPD cited monthly coordination  calls between GPD and the regional offices as a coordinating effort meant  to address challenges we identified. However, FEMA also cited these  calls as a coordination mechanism in 2012 and noted that these calls had  been a recurring effort since 2008.

However, FEMA has not developed  a plan with time frames, goals, metrics, or milestones for how and when it  will address long-standing coordination challenges associated with the  existing hybrid grants management model identified in previous FEMA  assessments and in our review. According to FEMA\u2019s Assistant  Administrator, GPD has involved the regions in performance measure  development since September 2011 and has communicated the  measures and results to the regions.

To  capture information on states\u2019 performance during preparedness  exercises and real-world events, states generally develop after-action  reports.

Under HSEEP\u2014which provides a common approach to  designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating exercises\u2014planners  identify exercise objectives and align them to core capabilities. In some  cases, the exercise objectives test one or more of the NIMS elements  identified by FEMA that should be incorporated into training. As such,  exercises could also allow for identifying areas of needed improvement in  NIMS implementation, one of the legislative bases for establishing the  National Exercise Program.", "FEMA regional officials we spoke with stated that some of FEMA\u2019s  national core capabilities are good proxies for how well NIMS is being  implemented, and that AARs\u2014which states submit to the National  Exercise Division\u2014can provide insight into the level of NIMS  implementation when certain of these core capabilities are assessed.  NIC officials stated if an exercise objective includes testing an element of  NIMS, then it is possible to assess NIMS implementation. For example,  evaluating a state\u2019s performance related to the core capability of  operational coordination could include as an exercise objective to  evaluate the command and control of an incident according to NIMS  principles. Similarly, the core capability for operational communications  could provide an assessment related to the NIMS elements for  interoperability of compatible communications, technology, and  information management.", "We analyzed AARs for 35 full-scale exercises that were conducted in  fiscal year 2014 in 4 FEMA regions, 33 of which assessed at least one, if  not two or all three, of the core capabilities we identified as proxies for  NIMS elements\u2014operational coordination, operational communication,  and public information and warning. Of the 35 reports we reviewed, 30  assessed operational coordination, 22 assessed operational  communication, and 12 assessed public information and warning.  Generally, for the capabilities assessed, the AARs identified strengths as  well as issues and challenges in performing related activities and tasks.  Specifically, 24 of the 30 exercises that assessed operational  coordination, 21 of the 22 exercises that assessed operational  communication, and 8 of the 12 exercises that assessed public  information and warning identified areas for improvement with those  capabilities. While exercises are meant to assess the ability to meet  exercise objectives by documenting strengths, areas for improvement,  core capability performance, and corrective actions in an AAR, some of  the AARs documented problems with NIMS-related exercise objectives,  indicating that there is room for improvement in NIMS implementation.  For example, four of the AARs found that an Incident Command System  (ICS) was not established among responding agencies, even though  NIMS calls for using such a structure. Similarly, another AAR concluded  that responding staff were unfamiliar with their position-specific roles and  responsibilities, even though NIMS calls for emergency management and  response personnel to have a clear understanding of their roles and  responsibilities. The report noted that the staff displayed difficulty in  monitoring, gathering, receiving, organizing, and sharing incident  information\u2014all activities that implementation of NIMS is designed to  facilitate. Another exercise evaluating operational communication found  that there was no communication among the different law enforcement  agencies and officers during the exercise. These examples demonstrate  that AARs can provide a basis for FEMA to develop a more  comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of states\u2019 NIMS  implementation, and suggests that there is room for improvement in NIMS  implementation for some jurisdictions.", "NIC officials said they do not verify the self-reported NIMS  implementation information that states submit because of the scope and  breadth of the information. However, in reviewing AARs to help inform  FEMA\u2019s understanding of NIMS implementation, FEMA regional office  staff could be in a better position to assess how well states have actually  implemented NIMS, as regional staff have more direct responsibilities  related to states\u2019 NIMS implementation. Specifically, FPCs\u2014who lead  regional efforts to implement the National Preparedness System across  the federal, state, tribal, and local jurisdictional levels\u2014are responsible for  monitoring NIMS compliance and implementation. FPCs are also  responsible for assisting in planning, design, execution, and evaluation of  exercises. In addition, each regional office has a NIMS coordinator who is  responsible for working with states to provide NIMS information and  technical assistance to support, facilitate, and enhance their  implementation of NIMS. One FPC stated that officials in his region  review state AARs within the region to identify needed corrective actions  that could be taken by states. Similarly, one regional NIMS coordinator  developed a checklist to perform NIMS implementation state monitoring  visits and said he visits 2 states each year in his region to ask questions  about implementation of various NIMS principles and provide assistance.  However, while some of these officials have taken independent steps to  assess some level of NIMS implementation, the regional offices we spoke  with do not systematically assess states\u2019 level of NIMS implementation  by, for example, reviewing AARs because there are no policies or  procedures that call for these activities. Specifically, while states are to  submit AARs to FEMA\u2019s National Exercises Division, and to the regional  EMPG Program Manager, as a requirement for receiving EMPG grants,  FPCs and NIMS coordinators are not required to review them to provide  validation of the NIC\u2019s NIMS implementation assessment.", "FEMA regional office officials we spoke with, along with several state  emergency management officials, agreed that assessing NIMS  implementation using AARs could provide FEMA a way to further assess  and elaborate on the information states and territories currently provide.  For example, the National Exercise Division, another division within the  National Preparedness Directorate, conducted an assessment of NIMS in  2013 by reviewing AARs and found that failures in NIMS performance  were predominantly due to failures in implementation of NIMS. The report  recommended, among other things, that the agency modify existing  training and exercises to allow responders to integrate NIMS concepts  and improve assessments of the ICS (as a component of NIMS  performance) by incorporating relevant principles as criteria of  performance. According to a NIC official, FEMA has been working on  the recommendations and expects to implement the actions when FEMA  releases an update to the NIMS doctrine. Finally, while the National  Exercises Division did assess NIMS implementation issues in 2013 by  analyzing AARs, regional offices and the NIC do not systematically or  regularly assess NIMS implementation. Using AARs to systematically  assess NIMS implementation over time could allow the regions and the  NIC to identify recurring issues in jurisdictions.", "HSPD-5 calls for FEMA to (1) establish a mechanism for ensuring  ongoing management and maintenance of the NIMS, including regular  consultation with other federal departments and agencies and with state  and local governments, and (2) develop standards and guidelines for  determining whether a state or local entity has adopted NIMS. In addition,  OMB Circular No. A-11 states that data limitations can lead to bad  decisions resulting in lower performance or inaccurate performance  assessments, and data limitations can include imprecise measurement  and recordings, incomplete data, and inconsistencies in data collection  procedures. Consistent verification and validation of performance data  support the general accuracy and reliability of performance information,  reduce the risk of inaccurate performance data, and provide a sufficient  level of confidence to Congress and the public that the information  presented is credible as appropriate to its intended use. As we have  previously reported, FEMA\u2019s reliance on self-reported data from states  and lack of verification for FEMA preparedness grants has presented  reliability concerns. While AARs are also self-reported, they use a  narrative format that includes analyses of the various aspects of actions  following an exercise or actual event. State officials from two states we  spoke with said that they review AARs within their state in order to  evaluate NIMS implementation. For example, officials from one state said  they use AARs to identify gaps in NIMS implementation so they can align  resources to support better implementation. This is because exercises  enable stakeholders to identify both capability gaps and areas for  improvement. Further, the purpose of exercises is to provide a low-risk  environment to test capabilities, familiarize personnel with roles and  responsibilities, and foster meaningful interaction and communication  across organizations. As such, evaluating AARs could provide an  additional opportunity to look for areas of NIMS implementation that could  be improved.", "According to NIC officials, they meet the requirements of HSPD-5 through  ongoing discussions with NIMS stakeholders, including state emergency  managers, to ensure ongoing management and maintenance of NIMS,  and by obtaining self-assessment information provided by states on NIMS  implementation in the URT that provides standards and guidelines.  Additionally, in order to meet the requirements of HSPD-5, in 2006 the  NIC developed implementation guidance through the NIMS Compliance  Objectives and Metrics for states and territories, tribal nations, and local  governments, which was last updated in 2010. However, NIC officials  said that, given the large number of states and their jurisdictions that have  adopted NIMS, any efforts to validate the information states provide on  their implementation efforts would be prohibitively difficult and costly.  While verifying each state and jurisdiction\u2019s self-reported information may  not be feasible, states are already required to develop AARs under the  EPMG program, which could provide a source in addition to the URT by  which FEMA could assess progress made on implementation of NIMS, as  the 2013 assessment by the National Exercise Division demonstrates.  States are already required to develop AARs following their preparedness  exercises, based on grant program requirements. Moreover, FEMA\u2019s  regional offices have multiple positions with responsibilities for NIMS  implementation, as well as preparedness exercises. Therefore,  developing policies and procedures for regional office staff to review and  assess information on states\u2019 NIMS implementation, gleaned through a  review of exercise AARs, would not only help FPCs and NIMS  coordinators better meet their responsibilities for supporting and  enhancing regional preparedness, but also provide the NIC a means, in  addition to the URT, to further evaluate states\u2019 self-reported assessments  of NIMS implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Opportunities Exist for FEMA Regional Offices to Enhance Collaboration with Regional Advisory Council Members", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "RAC Members and Liaisons View RAC Meetings as Useful and Well Run", "paragraphs": ["As described earlier, the Post-Katrina Act required that each FEMA  region establish a Regional Advisory Council (RAC) in order to provide  the types of advice on emergency preparedness in their regions listed in  the Post-Katrina Act to the FEMA regional administrators.

For example, regional officials invited RAC  members to other regional meetings with other federal agencies\u2014a  process used by some other regions. In 2015, the regional office resumed  having RAC meetings, with one taking place in mid-January with 11 of 12  members attending. According to the regional RAC liaison, the high  attendance was the result of the regional administrator having personally  reached out to the individuals who had been recommended for RAC  membership and inviting them to participate.

For example, at the suggestion of  their RACs, regional offices created a regional training and exercise  coordination website to share information; forwarded a suggestion from a  RAC to revise FEMA national policy to include ice storms as a  reimbursable emergency; and developed and distributed monthly  preparedness themes to help synchronize federal, state, and local  officials\u2019 focus on common topics, among other things.", "Although some FEMA regional offices have incorporated various  recommendations made by RAC members, 50 percent of the  respondents in our survey of RAC members said that FEMA should  provide more detailed feedback to them on suggestions or advice they  made at RAC meetings.

These challenges continue to hamper the effectiveness of  interactions between FEMA and state officials in implementing the  preparedness grants program. A plan with time frames, goals, metrics,  and milestones for addressing these challenges would better enable GPD  officials to monitor and improve their efforts to resolve long-standing  problems in coordination of monitoring activities and the consistency of  guidance given to state grantees. Regarding oversight of FEMA\u2019s efforts  to implement the national system for managing incidents, there are  opportunities to access more sophisticated and comprehensive  information using FEMA regional staff to better assess NIMS  implementation. Further, using AARs that are already required to be  developed and submitted could provide a better opportunity to assess  NIMS implementation, including areas of success as well as areas where  improvement is needed.

In its comments, DHS stated that it disagreed with  GAO\u2019s characterization of longstanding challenges in managing  preparedness grants. As we stated in the report, multiple assessments  dating back to 2009 have reported challenges with the hybrid model that  splits management of preparedness grants between FEMA\u2019s  headquarters and regional offices.

However, DHS expressed concerns about overstating the value of AARs  as a means to improve understanding of NIMS implementation.  Specifically, DHS stated that FEMA does not agree that the \u201cbest way to  assess how well NIMS has been implemented is by assessing states\u2019  performance in preparedness exercises and real-world events.\u201d As noted  in the report, most all of the officials we spoke with believed that the  current method of determining NIMS implementation\u2014states self- certification via the URT\u2014was not an effective method of determining  NIMS implementation, and officials in all of the FEMA regions and 8 of the  states we interviewed said that looking at how effectively a jurisdiction  responds during an exercise or real world event is the best way to assess  NIMS implementation. DHS also stated that the extent to which a  jurisdiction has implemented NIMS is nuanced and therefore impossible  to assess accurately from an AAR. The report does not suggest that  reviewing AARs would give a comprehensive and definitive assessment  of NIMS implementation but rather that it could provide FEMA an  additional way to assess and elaborate on the information states currently  provide. In fact, FEMA used AARs to conduct an assessment of NIMS in  2013, which resulted in some recommendations to help improve NIMS  implementation. Finally, as we have previously reported, the Post-Katrina  Act requires FEMA to carry out the National Exercise Program. The Act  established the Program, among other things, as a means for FEMA to  test and evaluate NIMS implementation efforts. As a result, we continue  to believe that AARs, an essential part of the National Exercise Program,  are an important part of FEMA\u2019s efforts to assess NIMS implementation  and we added a reference to this requirement to our final report. DHS did  not identify any specific steps to address this recommendation but said  that the National Preparedness Directorate would work with regional  NIMS coordinators and the states to explore options during calendar year  2016, with potential changes to be implemented in calendar year 2017.", "In its written comments, DHS concurred with our third, fourth, and fifth  recommendations related to enhancing the value of RACs.

If  implemented as planned, these actions should help address the intent of  the recommendation to ensure that regional offices routinely obtain input  from their RAC.", "Regarding the fourth recommendation that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct the FEMA administrator to develop a mechanism to update  RAC members on the status of recommendations made by RACs to  FEMA, DHS concurred and stated that it will build into each RAC meeting  a briefing by regional personnel on the status of recommendations, if any,  made during the previous meeting. The regional administrator or RAC  coordinator within the region will be responsible for the brief. Additionally,  if RAC members are not satisfied with the implementation of RAC  recommendations, it will be expected that the regional office will provide  information on why a specific recommendation was not adopted or why  implementation is delayed. DHS further stated that each region may have  its own method of dispensing updates to its RAC members between  meetings, including monthly email updates, posting on their website, or  informational calls. If implemented as planned, these actions should help  address the intent of the recommendation to update RAC members on  the status of its recommendations to FEMA.", "Regarding our fifth recommendation that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct the FEMA administrator to establish processes for  enhanced coordination and communication between the RACs and the  NAC, DHS concurred and stated that regional administrators will continue  to attend NAC meetings and provide FEMA regional updates that include  RAC activities with the regions. Moreover, regional coordinators will  ensure that RAC members are aware of any NAC meeting occurring in  their own region, and that the RAC sharepoint site will be used as a  platform to update RAC coordinators on impending NAC meetings to  share with their RAC members. If implemented as planned, these actions  should help address the intent of the recommendation to establish  processes for enhanced coordination and communication between the  RACs and the NAC.", "We are sending copies of this report to Secretary of Homeland Security,  appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

We also reviewed prior GAO reports on regional  preparedness, grant management, and consolidation of management  functions. We interviewed FEMA\u2019s Director of the Preparedness Grants  Division within GPD and other senior GPD officials to discuss  programmatic grant management as well as previous FEMA assessments  of the impact of moving management responsibilities to FEMA regional  offices. We also interviewed grant management officials from 4 FEMA  regional offices\u2014Regions III, IV, VI, and IX\u2014to discuss financial grant  management and coordination of monitoring activities with GPD. These  offices were selected in order to provide a mix of geographic locations,  types of disasters typically experienced, and whether the regional office  had been selected to participate in FEMA grant management pilot  programs. Similarly, we interviewed officials from 9 states or territories  (Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, Texas,  Virginia, and Washington, D.C.) from the 4 FEMA regions to discuss grant  management within the states as well as interactions with FEMA grant  management officials. These states were selected to reflect a diversity of  experiences within the 4 FEMA regions we chose. While the information  gained from these interviews cannot be generalized across all states, it  provides useful insights into the nature of FEMA GPD and regional  coordination with states with regard to grant management.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed NIMS-related documents  such as the NIMS Doctrine, NIMS Compliance Guidance, NIMS  implementation reports, and results of the NIMS implementation  questions in the Unified Reporting Tool (URT). We also reviewed  documents on the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program  (HSEEP) and on preparedness grants requirements. We compared  FEMA\u2019s efforts in NIMS implementation and verification with Homeland  Security Presidential Directive-5 and Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) Circular No. A-11, regarding data validation and verification. We  interviewed officials at FEMA\u2019s National Preparedness Directorate, which  includes the National Integration Center (NIC)\u2014the office responsible for  NIMS implementation\u2014to discuss the NIC\u2019s efforts in implementing  NIMS. To discuss NIMS implementation efforts at the regional and state  levels, interactions between regional and state officials, and mecha nisms  for verifying how well NIMS is being implemented, we also interviewed  officials from the 4 FEMA regional offices and the 9 states or territories  mentioned above. In addition, because of the recommendations of  officials in several regional offices and states, we interviewed an official  from a 10th state (Oklahoma) from within the selected FEMA regions.  Again, while the information gained from these interviews cannot be  generalized across all states, it provided useful insights into the various  efforts in implementing NIMS. Additionally, we analyzed all 35 full-scale  exercise after-action reports (AAR) that FEMA received for exercises  conducted during fiscal year 2014 and in the 4 regions we visited. We  used the AARs as they provide qualitative analysis of outcomes of  exercises, which are conducted in order to identify capability gaps and  areas for improvement. The purpose of the analysis was to determine if  they could be used to assess the level of participants\u2019 implementation of  NIMS. We did this by developing a crosswalk that linked the six NIMS  elements listed in the URT, and that states should incorporate into  exercises, to a core capability\u2014the unit by which exercises are evaluated.  In developing this crosswalk, we found three core capabilities that we  used as proxies for the six NIMS elements that are to be incorporated into  exercises\u2014operational coordination, operational communication, and  public information and warning. While aspects of NIMS implementation  could be gleaned from other core capabilities, for the purposes of this  analysis we used the three core capabilities identified through our  crosswalk. Of the 35 reports we analyzed, 33 assessed at least one, if not  two or all three, of the core capabilities we identified as proxies. In those  reports where one or more of the core capabilities were addressed, we  looked to see if there were issues associated with those core capabilities,  and the nature and extent of the issues, by reviewing various sections of  the reports. For the core capability of operational coordination, we also  looked at the exercise objectives to see if they aligned with some element  of NIMS components. If an AAR reported that the core capability that we  assessed either was performed with some challenges, was performed  with major challenges, or was unable to be performed, we included it in  our count of a capability that encountered some issues. From this we  could glean the extent to which various NIMS elements are working well  and those that still have room for improvement. While results of these  exercises are not generalizable to the country as a whole, they do provide  useful insights into NIMS implementation in some areas.", "To address the third objective, we interviewed FEMA headquarters and  regional office officials and analyzed FEMA and Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports with information  and findings relevant to RACs. We attended two RAC meetings in 2  regions that took place during the early part of our review, and obtained  documentation of agendas and other relevant materials for RAC meetings  that occurred between 2007 and 2014 for the RACs in all 10 FEMA  regions. We also reviewed agendas and meeting minutes for NAC  meetings that took place between August 2011 and September 2015. We  reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, federal internal controls  standards, and leading practices for program management.", "To identify the extent to which RAC members view their RAC experiences  as effective in conveying their concerns to FEMA, we conducted a self- administered, web-based questionnaire survey of RAC members of each  FEMA region\u2019s RAC; FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices identified an initial  population of 133 active RAC members. (See app. II for a copy of the  survey questionnaire and the results.)", "Using e-mail addresses provided by each of the FEMA regions for their  RAC members (which included the RAC members\u2019 names and, in most  cases, their place of work or other occupational identifier), we e-mailed  each RAC member a link to a secure survey website, along with a unique  identifier and password to control access to each member\u2019s  questionnaire. Most survey questions were closed-ended, in which RAC  members selected from a list of possible responses. To obtain additional  narrative and supporting context, survey respondents were given  opportunities to provide additional open-ended comments throughout the  survey.", "The survey began on May 27, 2015, and data collection ended on June  29, 2015. We e-mailed the survey link to 126 of the RAC members  identified by FEMA regional offices. Of these 126 e-mail contacts, e-mails  to 14 were initially undeliverable and 2 were e-mails for FEMA employees  who had been incorrectly listed as RAC members (FEMA employees  cannot be RAC members). Of the 14 non-FEMA RAC members, we  determined that 12 were no longer RAC members. Of the remaining 2,  one informed us that she had only recently been appointed to a RAC and  had not attended any RAC meetings, and the other told us in a follow-up  telephone call that he had not been a RAC member for at least 4 years.  On the basis of this information about RAC membership status, we  defined all 16 cases as ineligible and excluded them from the survey  population. Of the 110 contacted that were still presumed to be eligible  members, 77 responded to the survey, resulting in a 70 percent response  rate. Of the 77 respondents, 3 answered an initial screening question  stating that they were not currently members of the RAC in their region,  which left a total of 74 respondents whose responses were usable for our  analysis of the rest of the questions. During the course of survey data  collection, we sent periodic reminder e-mails to all nonrespondents to  encourage participation in the survey. We also conducted tailored follow- ups by e-mail or telephone with selected nonrespondents, for example,  those only partially completing their questionnaires.", "Because our survey was designed to include the entire population of RAC  members, our results are not subject to sampling error. However, the  practical difficulties of conducting any questionnaire survey may introduce  a variety of non-sampling errors. For example, differences in how a  particular question is interpreted, the sources of information available to  respondents, or the types of people who do not respond to the survey or  a particular question can introduce error into survey results. We included  steps in the survey design, data collection, and analysis stages to  minimize these types of non-sampling errors. To minimize measurement  error and nonresponse error, we designed draft questionnaires in  collaboration with GAO survey specialists. We conducted pretests by  telephone with three RAC members from three regions. On the basis of  survey specialist input and these pretests, we made revisions to  questionnaire drafts as necessary to reduce the likelihood of  measurement and nonresponse errors (the types of nonresponse  associated with the perceived burden, lack of question clarity or relevance  to the respondent). In addition, our analysts answered respondent  questions and resolved difficulties that respondents had in completing our  questionnaire. We asked open-ended comment questions at various  points in the questionnaire to allow respondents to explain or provide  context for their answers, which helped inform and corroborate our  interpretation and analysis of the survey results. We examined survey  results to identify and remediate any inconsistencies or other indications  of response error. Finally, we made multiple follow-up contacts with non- respondents throughout data collection to reduce nonresponse. To  minimize the possibility of data processing error, a second data analyst  independently verified the accuracy of all computer analyses. In addition,  RAC members made their responses directly into an automated web  survey instrument, preventing errors associated with manual data entry of  written answers.", "We conducted our work from October 2014 to February 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Results of GAO Survey of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Regional Advisory Council Members", "paragraphs": ["Below is the text of the survey as it was sent to Regional Advisory Council  (RAC) members.
