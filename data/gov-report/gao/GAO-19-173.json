DOD policy includes software maintenance as part of core logistics, and it requires the military departments to report biennially to Congress on their estimated workloads to sustain core logistics capabilities, including estimated costs of these workloads. However, while the Army and Air Force categorize and report software sustainment as part of core logistics, the Navy does not. Without the Navy's categorizing and reporting its software sustainment costs, DOD and Congress are not fully informed of the magnitude and cost of core software sustainment capability requirements. This impedes DOD's efforts to plan for a ready and controlled source of technical competence, and to budget resources in peacetime while preserving necessary surge capabilities.", "DOD's ability to track weapon system software sustainment costs is impeded by limitations in its collection of software cost data. First, GAO found that the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation's (CAPE) Cost and Software Data Reporting system did not collect weapon system cost data from DOD software centers. Recognizing this, CAPE directed in January 2017 that cost and software data efforts on major acquisition programs should begin to be collected from government organizations, including DOD software centers. However, CAPE acknowledges that it lacks an implementation plan to execute and monitor the requirement for these centers to submit cost and software data. Second, GAO also found that the military departments' operating and support cost systems have incomplete software sustainment cost data. DOD policy requires the military departments to collect and maintain actual operating and support costs, including software sustainment costs.

One such challenge is that the  Defense Acquisition System often focuses on near-term costs, schedule, and performance trade-offs to the detriment of long-term costs, even  though more than 70 percent of the life-cycle costs of a weapon system  are incurred in the system\u2019s operating and support phase. However,  long-term forecasting of sustainment costs can be difficult.", "Our prior work on software sustainment, which dates back nearly four  decades, has shown persistent challenges related to the management,  cost reporting, and technical data rights of software, among other issues.  More recently, our work on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has  identified challenges with software development, long-term sustainment  funding, and technical data rights. For example, in 2014 we found that  delays in developmental flight testing of the F-35\u2019s critical software could  hinder delivery of the warfighting capabilities the military services expect,  and that these delays were due largely to delays in software delivery,  limited capability in the software when delivered, and the need to fix  problems and retest multiple software versions. As we recommended,  DOD conducted an assessment of the specific capabilities that can be  delivered and of those that will likely not be delivered to each of the  services by their established initial operational capability dates.", "You asked us to review several issues relating to the sustainment of  operational system software for DOD weapon systems.

For  example, when hardware breaks, technicians can remove the broken  part\u2014such as tread on a tracked vehicle\u2014 and install a working part. In  contrast, sustaining software typically requires writing, testing, and  deploying lines of code. Software provides critical functionality to nearly  every hardware system that DOD uses: surface (for example, mobile  network systems); air (for example, secure communications arrays in  aircraft); sea (for example, submarine guidance systems); missile (for  example, targeting systems); ordnance (for example, Common Remotely  Operated Weapon Station); and space (for example, positioning  software), as shown in figure 2.", "Further, a weapon system may comprise numerous software systems,  each supporting different components of the system. Hundreds, or even  thousands, of software systems can be embedded in a single weapon  system.

For decades-old weapon systems, officials at some DOD  software centers stated that they use public-private partnerships to bridge  gaps for systems that lack access to the necessary data rights. For  example, an Air Force official at Robins Air Force Base told us that the C- 5 software sustainment workload has been successful due to a public- private partnership involving the C-5 System Program Office, the 402nd  Software Maintenance Group, and the contractor. As part of this  partnership, a C-5 software integrated laboratory was established at  Robins Air Force Base for DOD personnel to perform software  sustainment activities, including deficiency report investigations and  testing. In doing so, the 402nd Software Maintenance Group supports  $8.4 million in annual C-5 software sustainment requirements.", "Officials at DOD software centers further explained that they have the  expertise to optimize software that is transferred from a contractor to a  DOD software center or to reverse-engineer software for weapon  systems, if needed. In some cases, for example, a contractor may decide  that it is no longer profitable or advantageous to continue performing the  software sustainment; the activities can then be transferred to a DOD  software center. Air Force officials at the 402nd Software Maintenance  Group stated that on many occasions they have worked to take over  software from a contractor without any transition period. In 2013 this DOD  software center assumed sustainment responsibility from a contractor  without any transition period for a radar system on the F-15 aircraft in  order to maintain and upgrade its software. After assuming sustainment  responsibility, according to an Air Force official, this DOD software center  corrected latent defects and added new capabilities to adapt the radar to  a changing threat environment. According to the official, this occurred  because the contractor shifted focus to newer radar systems. Further, the  contractor priced the support for the older radar system above what the  Air Combat Command had budgeted for the updates.", "Officials at some DOD software centers told us that if they have the  source code but do not have the computer software documentation\u2014 such as manuals or instructions\u2014they may need to reverse-engineer the  software.

To illustrate  this, an Air Force official told us that the HH60W Combat Rescue  Helicopter program committed early in the life-cycle to securing the  necessary data rights for a DOD software center in the 402nd Software  Maintenance Group to perform the software sustainment activities.

Finally, we reviewed  statutory provisions in the fiscal years 2016 and 2018 National Defense  Authorization acts, which directed the Secretary of Defense to  commission studies related to DOD intellectual property, and we  interviewed officials to understand DOD\u2019s status on the provisions.", "Table 2 lists the offices that we visited or contacted during our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Select Software Sustainment Activities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact listed above, Sally Newman (Assistant Director),  Laura Czohara (Analyst-in-Charge), Steven Bagley, Steven Boyles,  Vincent Buquicchio, Amie Lesser, Janine Prybyla, Andrew Stavisky, and  Cheryl Weissman made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["GAO- F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: Development is Nearly Complete, but  Deficiencies Found in Testing Need to Be Resolved, GAO-18-321  (Washington, D.C.: June 5, 2018).", "GAO- F-35 Aircraft Sustainment: DOD Needs to Address Challenges  Affecting Readiness and Cost Transparency, GAO-18-75 (Washington,  D.C.: Oct. 26, 2017).", "GAO, Military Acquisitions: DOD Is Taking Steps to Address Challenges  Faced by Certain Companies, GAO-17-644 (Washington, D.C.: July  2017).", "GAO- F-35 Sustainment: DOD Needs a Plan to Address Risks Related to  Its Central Logistics System, GAO-16-439, (Washington, D.C., Apr. 14,  2016).", "GAO- F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: Preliminary Observations on Program  Progress, GAO-16-489T (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 23, 2016).", "GAO, Defense Contracting: Early Attention in the Acquisition Process  Needed to Enhance Competition, GAO-14-395 (Washington, D.C.: May 5,  2014).", "GAO- F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: Problems Completing Software Testing  May Hinder Delivery of Expected Warfighting Capabilities, GAO-14-322  (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 24, 2014).", "GAO- F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: Program Has Improved in Some Areas,  but Affordability Challenges and Other Risks Remain, GAO-13-500T  (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 17, 2013).", "GAO, Defense Acquisition: DOD Should Clarify Requirements for  Assessing and Documenting Technical-Data Needs, GAO-11-469  (Washington, D.C.: May 11, 2011).", "GAO, Federal Contracting: Opportunities Exist to Increase Competition  and Assess Reasons When Only One Offer Is Received, GAO-10-833  (Washington, D.C.: July 26, 2010).", "GAO, Weapons Acquisition: DOD Should Strengthen Policies for  Assessing Technical Data Needs to Support Weapon Systems,  GAO-06-839 (Washington, D.C.: July 14, 2006).", "GAO, Defense Management: Opportunities to Enhance the  Implementation of Performance-Based Logistics, GAO-04-715  (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 16, 2004).", "GAO, Defense Logistics: Opportunities to Improve the Army\u2019s and the  Navy\u2019s Decision-making Process for Weapons Systems Support,  GAO-02-306 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 28, 2002).", "GAO, Defense Logistics: Air Force Lacks Data to Assess Contractor  Logistics Support Approaches, GAO-01-618 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 7,  2001).", "GAO, Test and Evaluation: DOD Has Been Slow in Improving Testing of  Software Intensive Systems, GAO/ NSIAD-93-198 (Washington, D.C.:  September 1993).", "GAO, Mission Critical Systems, Defense Attempting to Address Major  Software Challenges, GAO/IMTEC-93-13 (Washington, D.C.: December  1992).", "GAO, Risk and Control of the Software Maintenance Process  (Washington, D.C.: January 1987).", "GAO, Federal Agencies\u2019 Maintenance of Computer Programs: Expensive  and Undermanaged, AFMD-81-25 (Washington, D.C., Feb. 26, 1981)."], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": ["Like anyone who owns a computer or smartphone, the Department of Defense has to continually update the software that keeps its weapon systems running smoothly.
