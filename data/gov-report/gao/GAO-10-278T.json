Case management agencies experienced challenges in delivering federally funded disaster case management services due to staff turnover and large caseloads, limited community resources, federal funding rules, and a lack of coordinated outreach. For example, case management agencies saw the ability to provide direct financial assistance for items such as home repair, clothing, or furniture as key to helping victims, yet case management agencies that provided services under FEMA-funded programs could not provide direct financial assistance. Long-term recovery committees were a resource for case management agencies to obtain direct assistance, but utilizing these committees was sometimes unsuccessful.

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused approximately $90  billion in property damage, destroyed over 300,000 homes, and displaced  more than 1 million people from some of the poorest communities in the  country when they struck the Gulf Coast in August and September 2005.  To assist victims with their recovery, the federal government stepped in  and, for the first time, provided more than $231 million to states and  nonprofit organizations to support several disaster case management  programs. Disaster case management involves helping victims access  services for a range of needs, including employment, housing, and health  care. In our report, we estimated that up to 116,000 families affected by  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita received federally funded disaster case  management services.", "My statement today, based on our July 2009 report, addresses the  following questions: 1) How did the federal government support disaster  case management programs after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and how  did federal agencies coordinate their efforts? 2) What challenges did case  management agencies experience in delivering disaster case management  services under federally funded programs? and 3) How will previous or  existing federally funded programs be used to inform the development of a  federal case management program for future disasters?", "To prepare the report, we reviewed the roles and responsibilities of the  federal government for disaster recovery services, as well as federal laws,  regulations, and guidance for the federally funded disaster case  management programs established to assist victims of Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita. We interviewed federal officials from the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), and the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS). We conducted site visits to Louisiana and Mississippi and  interviewed organizations involved in disaster case management in those  states. We also obtained data on clients in two disaster case management  programs and used only those data elements we found to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our work. We conducted the performance  audit from May 2008 to July 2009 and updated information in November  2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions. A detailed explanation of our methodology is included in  our July 2009 report.", "In summary, we found that FEMA, HHS, and HUD supported disaster case  management programs following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However,  breaks in federal funding and coordination challenges adversely affected  the delivery of disaster case management services to some hurricane  victims. Coordination challenges included a lack of accurate and timely  information sharing and incompatible data systems. In addition, case  management agencies experienced challenges in delivering services due to  large caseloads, limited community resources, federal funding rules, and a  lack of coordinated outreach. For future disasters, FEMA is developing a  federal case management program based on evaluations of several disaster  case management pilot programs. However, we found that FEMA had not  established a time line for developing this program, and some of the  evaluations had limitations, such as a lack of information on program  outcomes. In our report, we recommended that FEMA establish a realistic  and achievable time line for designing and implementing a single, federal,  disaster case management program for future disasters, conduct an  outcome evaluation to determine the results of the disaster case  management pilot programs, and ensure that the federal disaster case  management program it develops includes practices to enhance and  sustain coordination among federal and nonfederal stakeholders.

The Framework maintains  FEMA\u2019s responsibility for coordinating human services and specifically  includes disaster case management as a category of human services.  Moreover, the Framework requires federal agencies involved in mass care,  housing, and human services to coordinate federal response efforts with  the efforts of state, local, private, nongovernmental, and faith-based  organizations.", "In September 2009, the President announced the formation of a Long-Term  Disaster Recovery Working Group, co-chaired by the secretaries of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and HUD, to examine lessons  learned during previous catastrophic disaster recovery efforts, and areas  for improved collaboration between federal agencies and between the  federal government and state and local governments and stakeholders. As  part of this initiative, FEMA and HUD are co-chairing the National Disaster  Recovery Framework Working Group, which will define the federal, state,  local, tribal, private non-profit, private sector, and individual citizen\u2019s roles  in disaster recovery; design and establish an effective coordinating  structure for disaster recovery programs; identify gaps, as well as,  duplications, in recovery programs and funding; and establish  performance standards for the federal support of state and local recovery."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Supported Disaster Case Management Programs, but Breaks in Federal Funding and Coordination Challenges Hindered Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Multiple federal agencies provided resources for disaster case  management programs to help thousands of households cope with the  devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but breaks in federal  funding and coordination challenges adversely affected the delivery of  these services to some hurricane victims."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA, HUD, and HHS Supported a Variety of Disaster Case Management Programs for Hurricane Victims, but Breaks in Federal Funding Adversely Affected Services to Some", "paragraphs": ["More than $231 million of FEMA and HHS funds have been used to  support disaster case management programs to assist victims of  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

For example, as the first federally  funded disaster case management program, Katrina Aid Today (KAT),  drew to a close in March 2008, some case management agencies began to  shut down their operations. Some cases were closed not because clients\u2019  needs had been met, but because the program was ending, and it is  unknown whether these clients obtained assistance elsewhere or whether  their cases were eventually reopened under the Cora Brown Bridge  Program.", "Clients with open cases under the Bridge program were supposed to  seamlessly transition from the Bridge program into FEMA\u2019s new state  managed DCM-P program. However, in Mississippi, the state-managed  pilot program did not begin until approximately two months after its  scheduled start date, and many of the smaller case management  organizations had to lay off case managers with the hope of hiring them  back once they received federal funding. In addition, in Louisiana, the  state-managed pilot became operational in September 2009, approximately  15 months after it was scheduled to begin.

Key practices for coordination include establishing  mutually reinforcing or joint strategies and compatible policies,  procedures, and other means of operating across agency boundaries.", "Difficulties in coordinating disaster case management services resulted in  a lack of accurate and timely information sharing between federal  agencies and case management agencies. Case management agencies  providing federally funded disaster case management services said they  faced challenges in obtaining timely and accurate information from FEMA;  however, FEMA officials said requests for information often did not meet  their requirements. For example, FEMA approached HHS about serving  some victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita under its pilot disaster case  management program following Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. When the case  management agency implementing the HHS pilot requested client  information from FEMA, FEMA only provided aggregate data, which the  case management agency found unusable. According to FEMA officials, its  routine use policy precluded it from sharing client-level information for  this purpose. However, FEMA officials said they have fulfilled many  requests for information and worked with states on how to request  information. For example, FEMA provided information to the Louisiana  Department of Social Services so as to prevent duplication of efforts or  benefits in determining eligibility for disaster assistance. In a previous  report, we identified as a lesson learned the value of standing agreements  for data sharing among FEMA and state not-for-profit agencies as a means  to expedite recovery services. Such agreements can clarify what data can  be shared and the procedures for sharing it while protecting the data from  improper disclosure.", "Federally funded case management programs used different databases,  making it difficult to track clients across case management agencies, and  potentially allowing hurricane victims who applied to more than one  program to receive duplicate services. For example, clients who received  case management services through KAT may have also received services  through the LFRC disaster case management program, but because the  KAT and LFRC databases were not compatible, some case management  agencies for these two programs may not have been able to screen for  duplication of services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Case Management Agencies Experienced a Range of Service- Delivery Challenges, and As a Result, Some Hurricane Victims May Not Have Been Helped", "paragraphs": ["Case management agencies experienced a variety of challenges in  delivering federally funded disaster case management services.

In terms of caseload size, KAT and LFRC case  managers had larger caseloads than program guidance recommended. For  example, KAT case managers had caseloads ranging between 40 and 300  clients even though the guidance recommended an average of 20 to 30  cases.

For example, HUD\u2019s fair market rent for a two-bedroom unit in the  New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner metropolitan area increased from $676 to  $1,030, or about 52 percent, between fiscal years 2005 and 2009.

In addition, the unemployment rate in the  New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner metropolitan area more than tripled  between August 2005 and September 2005, and the unemployment rate  remained above pre-Katrina levels until March 2006. We previously  reported that transportation services can provide a vital link to other  services and to employment for displaced persons; yet multiple sources  stated that case management clients, particularly those living in FEMA  group sites, lacked transportation following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Case management officials said lack of access to transportation made it  difficult to connect clients living in remote group sites to services such as  employment, education, and child care. Federal agencies developed the LA  Moves program to provide free, statewide transit service for residents in  Louisiana group sites; however, LA Moves service was limited to FEMA  defined \u201cessential services,\u201d specifically, banks, grocery stores, and  pharmacies and did not include transportation to welfare-to-work sites,  employment, and human and medical services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case Managers Faced Challenges in Meeting Client Needs Due to Federal Funding Rules on Direct Assistance and Difficulties in Accessing Needed Resources Through the Long-Term Recovery Committee Process", "paragraphs": ["Case management agencies saw the ability to provide direct financial  assistance for items such as home repairs, clothing, or furniture as key to  helping clients with their basic needs; yet such assistance was not always  available.

Case  management agencies that were part of KAT or that provided services  under FEMA-funded programs, including the state-managed DCM-P  program in Mississippi and the Disaster Housing Assistance Program, were  not permitted to provide direct financial assistance. According to a FEMA  official, direct financial assistance was not part of these programs because  FEMA already provided funding for this purpose through the Individual  and Households Program. The maximum amount that an individual or  household may receive through the program is $25,000, adjusted annually  to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index; however, a FEMA official  noted that the maximum amount may not be enough to meet all disaster- related needs.", "While long-term recovery committees were a resource for case managers  to obtain direct assistance to address clients\u2019 unmet needs, in some cases,  the efforts to utilize these committees were unsuccessful.

FEMA agreed with our recommendations, and,  according to a FEMA official, the agency is hoping to formalize the  program in June 2010. Going forward, FEMA intends to implement disaster  case management services in two phases. In the first phase, HHS will  administer disaster case management services for up to 180 days using  FEMA funding. The second phase will be a state-managed disaster case  management program funded by a direct grant from FEMA to the affected  state.

A critical component of future recovery efforts is FEMA\u2019s timely  development of a single, federal disaster case management program. The  success of those efforts will depend, in part, on whether agencies can  improve coordination to help ensure that those most in need receive  services, and to prevent duplication of services.
