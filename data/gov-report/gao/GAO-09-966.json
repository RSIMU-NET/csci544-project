This information aids in, among other things, the processing and distribution of beneficiary payments and the delivery of services such as driver's license issuance and voter registration. SSA relies on its information technology (IT) infrastructure--its databases, applications, networks, and IT management practices--to support its current and future needs for exchanging data with its state and federal partners. GAO was asked to (1) determine the extent to which SSA's IT infrastructure effectively and efficiently supports current data exchanges, and any system-related problems affecting its exchange partners; and (2) describe SSA's efforts to ensure that its IT infrastructure can support the agency's and its partners' future data exchange environment. To do this, GAO analyzed agency documentation and interviewed SSA officials, as well as federal and state data exchange partners."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Systems-related problems that affect SSA's ability to support outgoing data exchange programs have been few, and the agency has established effective procedures and mechanisms for addressing the problems that do occur. In this regard, SSA provides help-desk and on-site support to data exchange partners to help prevent or resolve problems, and uses procedures supported by a problem-identification and tracking system to facilitate problem resolution. State and federal partners with whom GAO held discussions stated that these efforts resulted in quick responses from SSA and effective resolution of problems that occurred. For example, a system that provides information for two data exchange programs that support driver's license issuance and voter registration in all 50 states was reported to have had almost 100 percent availability during the hours specified in the agreements governing these data exchanges. Further, all of the data exchange partners with whom GAO held discussions reported that the data that SSA provided were reliable. As a result, these partners stated that their ability to conduct business operations that depend on SSA data was not adversely affected by systems-related problems associated with SSA's IT infrastructure. SSA and its partners anticipate that the number of requests for outgoing data exchanges will continue to increase and that the exchanges will become more complex as agencies request that these exchanges take place through online, real-time transactions. However, SSA officials stated that the agency's existing IT infrastructure may not be able to support the increased demand that they and their partners anticipate. To address overall agency needs for a more cost-effective and efficient computing environment, the agency is taking steps to modernize its computing capabilities and supporting infrastructure. For example, the agency is in the process of implementing an updated database environment and upgrading its software applications--steps that are intended to enable expanded and more efficient IT service delivery, including the electronic exchange of data. However, the agency has not fully implemented IT management practices specifically related to its outgoing data exchange environment, such as conducting thorough analyses to project the expected increase in requests for data and online access. Conducting these analyses and using this information as input to the agency's target architecture (i.e., a formal description of the agency's future environment) are important practices to clearly define future requirements to guide the direction of the agency's data exchange programs. Implementing these management practices is essential to ensuring that the agency is well positioned to meet the growing needs of its data exchange partners."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Through more than 3,000 agreements with federal and state agencies, the  Social Security Administration (SSA) both receives incoming data to  support its own programs and provides outgoing data to support state and  other federal agencies\u2019 programs.

Further, this information can  provide critical input to the agency\u2019s planning efforts, including the  development of a target architecture.", "Nevertheless, according to agency officials, SSA has not conducted  detailed analyses to project future workload requirements resulting from  the increasing demand and expanded need for outgoing electronic data  exchanges. Specifically, the agency has not projected increases in the  number of requests for data or the need for more online, real-time access  to its data exchange systems. The agency\u2019s Director of the Division of  Information, Verification and Exchange Services and the Director of the  Office of Systems Security Operations Management maintain that the  agency\u2019s tactical plans for delivering electronic services will be sufficient  to address future needs for data exchanges. However, these plans have not  yet been developed. Further, while the agency\u2019s strategic direction and  vision for its data exchange environment are important, they do not  substitute for the more detailed analysis that is essential to identifying the  specific business and technical requirements for its data exchange  programs and partners.", "Moreover, in the absence of such detailed analysis, SSA cannot be assured  that it will achieve the robust data exchange architecture that it envisions.  According to federal guidance, an agency should develop an enterprise  architecture, or modernization blueprint, that describes in both business  and technology terms how it operates today and how it intends to operate  and support projected needs in the future\u2014that is, its target architecture.  Federal guidance states that enterprise architectures should identify the  data that are to be exchanged, the frequency and nature of the exchanges,  and the business processes supported by the data exchanges. For SSA to  ensure that its target architecture provides for a future IT infrastructure  that will support its expanding data exchange environment, the agency  should conduct the analyses needed to project the numbers of data  exchange transactions along with the frequency and nature of the data  exchanges (that is, whether the transactions are batch or online, and how  frequently they will be conducted) expected from its partners in the  future.", "Agency officials have recognized the need for a target architecture that  addresses requirements for data exchanges. For example, in 2008, an SSA  workgroup conducted an analysis to address management and technical  issues related to its data exchanges, which was intended to support  planning for its growing data exchange program. Among other things, the  workgroup recommended to the Commissioner of Social Security that the  agency devote sufficient resources to develop a well-defined target  architecture that is sufficiently scalable to meet the agency\u2019s future needs  for supporting data exchanges.", "However, while SSA has developed a target architecture describing  applications and service components that are used to support the agency\u2019s  business operations, according to the Directors of the Division of  Information, Verification and Exchange Services, and of the Office of  Strategic Services, the agency has not developed a target architecture that  addresses specific business and technical requirements for supporting the  agency\u2019s data exchange programs. Moreover, these directors stated that  the current agencywide target architecture does not specifically address  data exchanges with external organizations.", "Lacking sound projections of future workloads, SSA will not be able to  clearly define specific requirements for meeting the increasing demands  on its data exchange environment. Moreover, without a target architecture  that addresses specific requirements for supporting the agency\u2019s data  exchange programs, the agency cannot be assured that its IT  infrastructure will provide the resources and levels of service required to  meet the future needs of its data exchange partners. Consequently, SSA\u2019s  ability to continue to effectively and efficiently support its partners\u2019 future  needs for electronic data exchange services could be jeopardized."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s existing IT infrastructure effectively supports its current outgoing  electronic data exchange environment and provides the agency\u2019s partners  with data that support and enhance their abilities to carry out business  operations.

However, the agency and its partners anticipate that the  demand for these exchanges will grow, and that the methods for  conducting the exchanges will become more complex. Nonetheless, SSA  has not performed the detailed analyses needed to project the workload  and performance requirements of a future data exchange environment.  While it has defined an agencywide target architecture, this architecture  does not address specific business and technical requirements for  supporting the agency\u2019s data exchange programs.

To determine whether  SSA\u2019s existing IT infrastructure is effective in supporting the agency\u2019s data  exchange programs, we first identified the components of the  infrastructure that support the agency\u2019s data exchange programs. To do  this, we obtained and analyzed agency documentation, such as internal  management reports; spreadsheets describing data exchange programs,  partners, and systems; descriptions of systems development and IT  management processes; and descriptions of IT infrastructure components.  To assess the reliability of the data provided by SSA, we held discussions  with agency officials who were knowledgeable about the agency\u2019s data  exchange infrastructure and determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our engagement.", "From our assessment of this information, we identified and selected  systems that are key to enabling the exchange of electronic data\u2014that is,  those that support the largest number of outgoing data exchanges, are  used by the most partners, and process the largest number of data  requests. We verified our selection through discussions with the Director,  Division of Information, Verification and Exchange Services. We held  discussions with additional agency officials, including the Associate  Commissioner, Office of Earnings, Enumeration and Administrative  Systems; Associate Commissioner, Office of Systems, Electronic Services;  Assistant Associate Commissioner, Office of Telecommunications and  Systems Operations; Director, Office of Systems Security Operations  Management; Director, Office of Electronic Information Exchange; and  Director, Office of Strategic Services. We also reviewed documentation  describing the agency\u2019s plans to make improvements to its IT  infrastructure and discussed these plans with agency officials.  Additionally, we interviewed state and federal data exchange partners to  obtain their views on the ability of SSA\u2019s IT infrastructure to provide data  that support their business operations.", "To determine the extent to which systems-related problems exist and  affect SSA\u2019s data exchange partners and their ability to carry out business  operations, and how the agency resolves these problems, we selected and  obtained the views of partners from multiple agencies in five states, a  third-party consortium that represents states and territories that  participate in two of SSA\u2019s data exchange programs, and four federal  agency partners. Together, these state and federal partners represented   24 programs that are supported by SSA\u2019s data exchanges. Our criteria and  methodology for selecting these partners are described later in this  appendix. We discussed with these partners their experiences with SSA\u2019s  data exchanges, including the extent to which their ability to conduct  business operations are affected by systems-related problems associated  with the agency\u2019s IT infrastructure. We reviewed and assessed  documentation provided to us that described the types of systems-related  problems that partners encountered in exchanging data. We also  interviewed two SSA regional office data exchange coordinators to discuss  any systems-related problems identified or reported to them by the  partners they support, and to obtain information about programs that  together fully utilize the IT infrastructure components that support the  data exchange environment.", "To describe SSA\u2019s efforts to ensure that its IT infrastructure can support  the agency\u2019s and its partners\u2019 future data exchange environment, we held  discussions with the agency officials and state and federal partners that  we have previously described and examined data provided by SSA that  illustrated increased transaction volume from 2007 to 2008. We also  obtained and reviewed documentation that described increased requests  for online access to certain data exchange systems over the past 24  months. Additionally, we reviewed relevant SSA strategic planning  documents, including its IT strategic plan and vision document to identify  plans related specifically to data exchanges. We assessed these plans to  identify activities specifically related to data exchanges and to determine  the extent to which they addressed projected data exchange workloads  and the IT resource requirements for efficiently and effectively supporting  future requirements. In addition, we interviewed SSA officials and data  exchange stakeholders familiar with the agency\u2019s data exchange programs  to identify the agency\u2019s plans for addressing future data exchange  workloads, including ensuring that its IT infrastructure can adequately  support future demands for outgoing data exchanges to other federal and  state agencies.", "We confirmed the information gathered from SSA\u2019s regional data exchange  coordinators and systems officials by corroborating it with selected other  state and federal exchange partners.
