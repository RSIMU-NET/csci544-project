Arriving at an acceptable rate for calculating royalties has been particularly challenging. Under the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002, small commercial webcasters reached an agreement with copyright owners that included the option of paying royalties for the period of October 28, 1998, to December 31, 2004, on the basis of a percentage of their revenues, expenses, a combination of both, or a minimum fee rather than paying the royalty rates set by the Librarian of Congress. During debate on the act, copyright owners raised concerns that small webcasters might have arrangements with other parties, such as advertisers, that could produce revenues or expenses that might not be included in their royalty calculations. In this context, the Congress mandated that GAO, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, prepare a report on the (1) economic arrangements between small webcasters and third parties and (2) effect of those arrangements on the royalties that small webcasters might owe copyright owners."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Small webcasters have a variety of economic arrangements with third parties, the most common being agreements with bandwidth providers and advertisers. Almost all of the webcasters that we interviewed reported arrangements with bandwidth providers, and many reported arrangements with advertisers. Less commonly reported arrangements included those with merchandise suppliers and companies that help small webcasters manage or obtain advertising for their Web sites, such as by inserting ads on the Web site or into the webcast itself or selling advertising based on the aggregate audiences of multiple webcasters. Third-party economic arrangements have had a minimal effect to date on royalties owed by small webcasters to copyright owners. Of the 27 small webcasters we interviewed that had agreed to the terms of the small webcaster agreement and provided us with financial data, 19 reported revenue and expense estimates below the levels that would result in royalty payments greater than the minimum fee. We found limited evidence to suggest that small webcasters may not be reporting revenues and expenses as required by the small webcaster agreement. Specifically, 2 of the 13 small webcasters who reported receiving free or reduced-price items did not report the value of these items as revenue for calculating royalties. However, the data we obtained in our survey may not reflect conditions that could develop as the webcasting industry matures. According to industry analysts, revenues of small webcasters are likely to increase as they attract more listeners and advertisers rely more on the Internet to reach customers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Internet has led to a new generation of content providers, commonly  known as \u201cwebcasters,\u201d who transmit digitized audio or video works over  the World Wide Web. The emergence of this new industry raised concerns  among record companies and performers because their works could be  widely disseminated, which might result in diminished sales of their  copyrighted works through record albums, compact discs, and other  prerecorded formats. To address these concerns and to support the  emergence of new digital technologies, the Congress extended limited  copyright protection to performances of sound recordings being digitally  transmitted.", "Webcasting consists of several steps: assembling the recordings to be  digitally transmitted over the Internet, translating them into digital format,  and then delivering performances of the recordings to listeners through an  Internet connection. The audio quality of recordings that are webcast  depends on the bandwidth used\u2014the number of bits of information  transmitted per second. Higher bandwidth results in better audio quality  and also allows a greater number of simultaneous listeners. Webcasters  typically contract with other entities (commonly referred to as third  parties), such as bandwidth providers, to supply different webcasting  services. In addition, webcasters may contract with other third parties,  such as companies who wish to advertise products on a webcaster\u2019s Web  site, to obtain revenue that can help offset the costs associated with  webcasting and return a profit to the webcaster.", "A copyright is a form of legal protection provided to the authors of creative  works, such as music and literature, that generally gives the owner certain  exclusive rights. These rights give the copyright owners control over their  works\u2014usually in exchange for compensation, known as a royalty.  Generally, copyright owners and parties seeking to use copyrighted works  voluntarily negotiate the rates at which royalties will be paid. However, the  Congress has, in some cases, established a process under which the  Librarian of Congress sets the royalty rates.", "In 1995 and 1998, two key pieces of legislation gave copyright owners the  right to control performances of sound recordings when they are digitally  transmitted and gave webcasters the automatic right to use the recordings  in certain circumstances in exchange for the payment of royalties under a  statutory license. The royalties were to be set at either a voluntarily  negotiated rate or at a rate set by the Librarian of Congress, based upon  hearings before a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel and the  recommendation of the Register of Copyrights. However, arriving at the  specific royalty rates that small commercial webcasters should pay to  owners for the use of their copyrighted recordings has been challenging. In  2002, the panel recommended royalty rates for webcasters that the  Librarian subsequently rejected. The Librarian established lower rates that  proved controversial to both copyright owners and to small webcasters.  Copyright owners believed that the new rates were too low, while small  webcasters believed that they were still too high, and small webcasters  sought legislative relief to lower the rates further. In response, the  Congress enacted the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002, which  allowed small webcasters and copyright owners to enter into an agreement  that provides for the payment of royalties based on a percentage of  revenues, expenses, both revenue and expenses, or a minimum fee, for two  time periods\u2014the historical period, which began on October 28, 1998, and  ended on December 31, 2002, and 2003 through 2004.", "During the debate on the Small Webcaster Settlement Act, copyright  owners also raised concerns about the economic arrangements that small  webcasters have with third parties, arguing that these arrangements could  produce revenues or expenses that might not be included in the calculation  of royalties that the small webcasters owed to them. To provide more  information on such arrangements, the Congress mandated that GAO, in  consultation with the Register of Copyrights, prepare a report on (1) the  economic arrangements between small webcasters and third parties and  (2) the effect of those arrangements on royalties that are based on a  percentage of the webcaster\u2019s revenues or expenses.", "As required by the act, we coordinated with officials from the U.S.  Copyright Office throughout the course of our work and incorporated their  technical and other comments into the report as appropriate. To respond to  the objectives of this study, we met with officials from organizations that  represent small webcasters, the Recording Industry Association of  America, and SoundExchange. We interviewed advertising agency staff, a  bandwidth provider, and industry analysts. We also reviewed relevant  copyright laws, regulations, and articles. In addition, we conducted  structured telephone interviews with 58 small webcasters located  throughout the country\u201430 that had agreed to the terms of the agreement  reached under the Small Webcaster Settlement Act and 28 that had not.

Although  personal computers have been available since the late 1970s and music in  digital form since the early 1980s, it was opening up the Internet to  commercial activity in 1992 that set the stage for webcasting. In webcasts,  sound recordings, such as records and compact discs, and live  performances can be transmitted to listeners over the Internet. The  popularity of webcasting is growing, with the number of listeners tripling  over the past 3 years.", "Webcasting and traditional radio broadcasting follow essentially the same  steps to deliver music to listeners (see figs. 1 and 2). Many webcasters and  traditional radio stations deliver music to listeners at no charge. A key  difference, however, concerns the number of potential listeners. In  traditional radio broadcasting, a station\u2019s signal is available to any number  of listeners within range of the transmitter. In contrast, the potential  audience for a webcast is anyone in the world whose computer is equipped  with a media player.", "Webcasting, also called Internet streaming, is the process of transmitting  digitized audio or video content over the Internet. The content can  originate from live performances, records, compact discs, or other  prerecorded formats. A webcast consists of several steps. The webcasters  must first assemble the music that will be transmitted and then translate it  into one or more digital formats. Music that is not streamed \u201clive\u201d must be  stored so that it is available to individuals who use their personal  computers to access the Web site created by the webcaster. The final step  is delivering the music through an Internet connection.", "Choices about the audio quality of the transmitted music and the size of the  audience affect the webcaster\u2019s operation costs. The quality of the resulting  music depends on the bandwidth\u2014the number of bits of information  transmitted per second\u2014used by the webcaster. Higher bandwidth results  in better sound quality of the transmitted music and allows a greater  number of simultaneous listeners. The size of the Internet connection to  the webcaster\u2019s server and the choice of bandwidth determine the potential  size of the audience. Although in its most basic form webcasting can be a  relatively inexpensive \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d operation using a minimum of two  computers and an Internet connection, the trade-off is lower sound quality  and smaller audience size. Alternatively, webcasters that hope to reach a  large audience with high-quality music frequently contract with one or  more third parties to provide the different steps. Such third parties can  provide a single service or some combination of services, including  translating the music into digital form and adjusting bandwidth needs to  accommodate the number of simultaneous listeners. Some may also  provide data on the number and location of listeners. Because webcasters  frequently deliver their music at no charge to listeners, webcasters may  contract with other third parties, such as companies that wish to advertise  products on the webcaster\u2019s Web site, to obtain revenue that can help offset  the costs associated with webcasting and return a profit to the webcaster.", "The Internet and the ability to digitally transmit sound recordings have  created opportunities for the recording companies that typically own the  copyrights in sound recordings to reach an unprecedented number of  listeners. Accompanying these opportunities are challenges for copyright  owners to maintain control over, and be compensated for, the use of their  copyrighted recordings. In the United States, the owners of copyrights in  sound recordings have not historically enjoyed the exclusive right to  control or authorize public performances of their recordings. Traditionally  these copyright owners generated royalties by selling copies of the  recordings in the form of albums, cassette tapes, and compact discs.  Although radio broadcasters pay royalties to publishers and writers for use of a musical work, they were not obligated to pay record companies for the  use of sound recordings.", "Two key pieces of legislation gave copyright owners the right to control  performances of sound recordings when they are digitally transmitted and  gave webcasters the automatic right to use the recordings under certain  circumstances in exchange for the payment of royalties under a statutory  license. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act, enacted in  1995, granted copyright owners the exclusive right to control or authorize  the use of recordings when they are digitally transmitted but not, for  example, when they are transmitted for use as background music in a  restaurant. In the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Congress  expanded the scope of this digital transmission right. Among other things,  the DMCA specifies that webcasters may operate under an automatic  license to use copyrighted works at either a voluntarily negotiated rate or  at a rate recommended by a panel known as a Copyright Arbitration  Royalty Panel (CARP), subject to review by the Librarian of Congress.  These rates, retroactive to October 1998, were to apply through December  2002. The act called for this procedure to be repeated every 2 years as the  webcasting industry developed, though it could be extended by agreement  between the copyright owners and webcasters.", "However, the legislation created conflict between record companies and  webcasters. The DMCA provided the opportunity to negotiate royalty rates  independently. But after negotiations between owners and webcasters  broke down, the Library of Congress convened a CARP to resolve the issue  and determine the appropriate rates. The CARP held hearings for 6 months,  during which both the copyright owners and webcasters presented their  cases. In February 2002, the CARP issued a royalty rate recommendation.", "In June 2002, the Librarian rejected some of the webcasting rates  recommended by the CARP and issued a regulation that set royalty rates  for Internet transmissions. Both record companies and webcasters  contested the Librarian\u2019s rates and sought relief in the courts. Some small  webcasters believed that the rates set by the Librarian were too high,  arguing that they would have to close their operations because they could  not pay the rates set by the Librarian and that these rates would put an end  to the promise of webcasting. Copyright owners believed the rates were  too low and did not reflect the true market value of their music, causing  them to, in essence, subsidize the webcasters. Moreover, they argued that  royalties are simply another cost of doing business, like buying bandwidth,  and webcasters that could not afford to pay them should not be operating.", "In response to these concerns, the Congress passed the Small Webcaster  Settlement Act of 2002. The act did not set new royalty rates but instead  allowed small webcasters and copyright owners another opportunity to  negotiate an agreement on royalty rates for the period beginning October  28, 1998, through December 31, 2004. These negotiated rates were to be  based on a percentage of revenue or expenses, or a combination of both;  were to include a minimum fee; and were to apply in lieu of rates set by the  Librarian of Congress (see table 1). This option was available to any small  webcaster that met the agreed-upon eligibility requirements. In December  2002 the U.S. Copyright Office published the resulting agreement under the  act. The agreement contained specific guidance for webcasters to follow  in determining the specific revenue and expense categories that were to be  included in the calculation of royalties due to copyright owners. The  guidance defines revenues and expenses in ways compatible with generally  accepted accounting principles and income tax reporting.", "As of October 2003, 35 small webcasters that had elected to follow the  royalty rates and terms set out in the agreement were in operation. As  shown in figure 3, these webcasters were located throughout the United  States, with one in Canada. We interviewed 30 of these webcasters. Rock  and pop are the types of music they most often delivered to listeners,  although they also webcast rhythm and blues, jazz, \u201coldies,\u201d and electronic  dance music. For 17 of these small webcasters, the targeted audience  includes both men and women, while the audience for the remaining 11 is  predominately men.

Seven percent of the small  webcasters reported that in 2003 they had economic arrangements with  companies that sell advertising based on the aggregate audience of multiple  webcasters. When an advertiser purchases advertising space from a  webcaster, the advertiser is purchasing the chance to present a message to  as many listeners as possible.

Of these 121 webcasters,  28 were no longer operating or did not appear to meet the definition of an  eligible small commercial webcaster, and 4 had signed the small webcaster  agreement (and thus were on the list of \u201csigners\u201d). We attempted to reach  the remaining 89 small webcasters. Forty-two small webcasters were  contacted. Interviews were completed with 28 that met the criteria of  \u201csmall webcaster.\u201d Fourteen webcasters refused to be interviewed. We  were not able to contact the remaining 47 webcasters, although we made  repeated attempts and left messages when we could. We did not calculate  the response rate for the group of small webcasters that did not sign the  agreement because we did not know how many of those not interviewed  were eligible small webcasters, and we did not have enough information to  reasonably estimate the percentage that might be eligible.", "To protect the confidentiality of the small webcasters we interviewed, we  randomly assigned each an identification number and documented their  responses to our interview questions with the identification number.  During the interviews, we asked the 58 small webcasters about economic  arrangements they had with third parties, whether they were currently  receiving or had previously received any free or reduced-price goods or  services, and requested estimates of their revenues, expenses, and third  party revenues. For those small webcasters that had signed the election  form to follow the terms of the small webcaster agreement, we asked for  their reasons for doing so. For those that had not signed the election form,  we asked for their reasons for not doing so. For many of the questions, we  asked small webcasters to provide separate responses for two different  periods to correspond with the reporting periods contained in the  agreement\u2014the historical period, which began on October 28, 1998, and  ended on December 31, 2002, and 2003 to 2004. We asked small webcasters  to provide information through the date of our interviews, which were  conducted in November and December 2003.", "We also asked each of the 30 small webcasters we interviewed who had  elected to follow the terms of the small webcaster agreement to sign a  release form allowing us to obtain access to the financial records they had  submitted to SoundExchange. We obtained signed release forms from 25 of  the 30 (83.3 percent) small webcasters. A representative of SoundExchange  subsequently informed us that it had no financial information for 9 of these  25 small webcasters. We reviewed the information the 16 remaining small  webcasters had provided to SoundExchange to determine whether it was  comparable to the information they had provided to us.", "To assess the effect that economic arrangements between small  webcasters and third parties have on the royalties due to copyright owners  and performers, we used financial information obtained during our  interviews with 27 of the 30 small webcasters that elected to follow the  terms of the agreement. Three of the 30 small webcasters declined to  provide any financial information. We calculated the threshold revenue  amounts that each of the 27 small webcasters would have had to exceed to  owe more than the minimum royalty fee. These revenue amounts were  calculated for both time periods\u2014October 28, 1998 through December 31,  2002, and for 2003\u2014and were based on the length of time the small  webcaster had been in operation. We then estimated the amount that each  small webcaster owed in royalties for each of the two time periods based  on the revenue and expense data that they provided to us. For small  webcasters that did not report revenue or expense estimates for the entire  year, we used their average monthly revenues to project their yearly gross  revenue and/or expenses. These estimated values were compared to the  threshold amounts and allowed us to determine whether the small  webcasters were subject to royalty payments above the minimum fee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of GAO\u2019s Survey of Small Webcasters", "paragraphs": ["Q1:  Number of Webcasters Who Began Operating Current Nonsubscription Webcasting  Service in Years 1997 to 2003  (N=30) (N=24) (N=58)", "Q3:  Percentage of Webcasters Streaming One or More Channels  (N=30) (N=24) (N=58)", "Sex of listeners  Mostly males  (N=28) (N=23) (N=55)", "Q6:  Percentage of Webcasters Who Track Size of Audience  (N=30) (N=24) (N=55)", "Q7:  Size of audience.
