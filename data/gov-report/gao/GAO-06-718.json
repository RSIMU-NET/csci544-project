A large majority of boomers have few financial assets to sell. The small minority who own most assets held by this generation will likely need to sell few assets in retirement. Also, most current retirees spend down their assets slowly, with many continuing to accumulate assets. If boomers behave the same way, a rapid and large sell off of financial assets appears unlikely. Other factors that may reduce the odds of a sharp and sudden drop in asset prices include the increase in life expectancy that will spread asset sales over a longer period and the expectation of many boomers to work past traditional retirement ages. A wide range of academic studies have predicted that the boomers' retirement will have a small negative effect, if any, on rates of return on assets. Similarly, financial industry representatives did not expect the boomers' retirement to have a big impact on the financial markets, in part because of the globalization of the markets. Our statistical analysis shows that macroeconomic and financial factors, such as dividends and industrial production, explained much more of the variation in stock returns from 1948 to 2004 than did shifts in the U.S. population's age structure, suggesting that demographics may have a small effect on stock returns relative to the broader economy. While the boomers' retirement is not likely to cause a sharp and sudden decline in asset prices, the retirement security of boomers and others will likely depend more on individual savings and returns on such savings. This is due, in part, to the decline in traditional pensions that provide guaranteed retirement income and the rise in account-based defined contribution plans. Also, fiscal uncertainties surrounding Social Security and rising health care costs will ultimately place more personal responsibility for retirement saving on individuals. Given the need for individuals to save and manage their savings, financial literacy will play an important role in helping boomers and future generations achieve a secure retirement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The aging of the U.S. population is expected to present great fiscal and  economic challenges in the decades ahead.

The retirement of the relatively large  baby boom generation, combined with other demographic trends, is  expected to strain the nation\u2019s retirement and health systems. This  impending event has also raised concerns about the potential market  effect should baby boomers sell off large amounts of financial assets in  retirement. If proportionally fewer workers are available to buy these  assets, some market observers fear that the increase in supply of stocks,  bonds, and other financial assets relative to demand may place downward  pressure on asset prices. At the extreme, some observers have raised the  possibility of a market \u201cmeltdown,\u201d a sharp decline in stock or other asset  prices, precipitated by the baby boom retirement.

From 1986 to 2004, U.S. 10- year Treasury notes have yielded an annual average of 3.4 percent,  adjusted for inflation. Importantly, returns on financial assets provide  retirement income for many Americans, accounting for 12.6 percent of  total income for Americans age 65 and over in 2004, and over half of this  cohort received some income from financial assets.

To identify the views of researchers and outside  experts on the financial effects of the baby boom retirement, we reviewed  simulation-based and empirical studies analyzing the baby boom  generation\u2019s impact on financial markets and interviewed financial and  public policy experts from mutual fund companies, pension funds, life  insurance companies, broker-dealers, financial planning organizations, and  financial industry trade associations.

The share of the U.S. population age 65 and  older is projected to increase from 12.4 percent in 2000 to 19.6 percent in  2030 and continue to grow through 2050. At the same time, life expectancy  is increasing. By 2020, men and women reaching age 65 are expected to  live another 17 or 20 years, respectively. Finally, falling fertility rates are  contributing to the increasing share of the elderly population. In the 1960s,  the fertility rate was an average of three children per woman. Since the  1970s, the fertility rate has hovered around two children per woman,  meaning relatively fewer future workers are being born to replace retirees.  The combination of these trends is expected to significantly increase the  elderly dependency ratio\u2014the number of people age 65 and over in  relation to the number of people age 15 to 64. In 1950, there was 1 person  age 65 or over for every 8 people age 15 to 64. By 2000, the elderly  dependency ratio had risen to 1 person age 65 for every 5 people of  traditional working age, and by 2050 this ratio is projected to rise further  to about 1 elderly to every 3 working age people (see fig. 1).  Consequently, relatively fewer workers will be supporting those receiving  Social Security and Medicare benefits, which play an important role in  helping older Americans meet their retirement needs.", "By causing a large shift in the U.S. population\u2019s age structure, some have  suggested that the baby boom generation may affect stock and other asset  markets when this cohort retires. This concern stems from hypothetical  spending and saving patterns over people\u2019s lifetimes, which economists  describe in the \u201clife cycle\u201d model. The model hypothesizes that people  attempt to smooth their consumption over their lifetime. As individuals\u2019  earnings typically grow over their working life, this suggests that younger  workers, with relatively low earnings, may save relatively little or borrow  to finance current consumption (or to buy a house); older workers may  save significantly more in preparation for retirement; and retirees may  spend down their savings. The model therefore predicts that the saving  rate is hump-shaped over an individual\u2019s lifetime.", "Over the course of their lives, individuals make decisions about not only  how much to save but also how to distribute their savings among a mix of  assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and bank accounts. For example,  older workers are expected to shift their portfolios toward less volatile  assets, such as bonds or cash accounts, because they will tend to prefer  assets with a more predictable flow of income since they will have less  time to weather potential price declines in riskier assets such as stocks.", "In addition to their saving and consumption patterns, baby boomers also  may affect stock returns in particular through broader macroeconomic  channels. Stocks represent claims on the profits earned by firms, and in  the long run the returns on these assets should reflect the productivity of  the firms\u2019 capital. Generally, economic theory states that capital becomes  more productive with more and better quality labor to use that capital.  Because the baby boom retirement is expected to reduce the growth rate  of the U.S. labor supply, it may reduce returns to capital, which could  reduce the returns to stocks. More generally, investors may price stocks in  relation to the underlying value of the firm, taking into account the value  of firm\u2019s current assets and stream of future profits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Evidence from Baby Boomers and Current Retirees Does Not Suggest a Sharp Decline in Asset Prices", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of national survey data indicates that the baby boom  generation is not likely to precipitate a sharp and sudden decline in  financial asset prices as they retire.

These wealthiest boomers may be able to support themselves  on the income from these investments without spending them down  significantly. About one-third of all boomers do not own any stocks,  bonds, mutual funds, or retirement accounts. As with the prior generation,  baby boomers may continue to accumulate financial assets in retirement  and liquidate their assets only gradually with the hope of leaving bequests.  The gradual entry of the boomers over a 19-year period into retirement  should further reduce the likelihood of a sudden decline in asset prices.  Further, boomers have indicated that they plan to retire later than  generations that retired in the recent past, with almost half not planning to  leave full-time employment until age 65 or later. Many may also continue  to work throughout retirement, reducing or delaying their need to sell  financial assets.

According to our analysis of the 2004 SCF, the wealthiest  10 percent of boomers owned over two-thirds of the approximately $7.6  trillion held by boomers in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, Individual  Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and other account-type retirement savings  plans in 2004. This wealthiest group held $1.2 million, on average, in these  financial assets, plus over $2 million in other assets such as home equity  and other investments. Figure 2 shows the concentration of financial  assets among boomers. This concentration of wealth is very similar to that  of current retirees and could mitigate a sharp and sudden impact on  financial asset prices if wealthy boomers need not spend down their  financial assets in retirement. Research on current retirees indicates that  the wealthiest of these individuals tend to not sell their financial assets,  contrary to what the life-cycle model would predict; instead, they choose  to live from the income these assets generate. Our analysis of the 2004  SCF also found that of the wealthiest 10 percent of current retirees born  before 1946, less than 16 percent spent money from their savings and  investments over and above their income during the previous year. In this  same group, over 65 percent responded that their income in 2003  exceeded their spending, indicating that they had accumulated more  assets without having a net sale from their holdings.", "The possibility of an asset meltdown is further reduced by the fact that  those households that would seem more likely to need to sell their  financial assets in retirement do not collectively own a large portion of the  total stocks and bonds in the market. Although the majority of baby  boomers hold some financial assets in a variety of investment accounts,  the total holdings for all boomer households, $7.6 trillion, account for  roughly one-third of the value of all stocks and 11 percent of bonds  outstanding in the U.S. markets, and the wealthiest boomers own most of  these assets (see figs. 3 and 4).  Those households that are most likely to  spend down their assets in retirement\u2014those not in the top 10 percent by  wealth\u2014collectively hold just 32 percent of all baby boomer financial  assets.

To the extent that baby  boomers behave like current retirees, a rapid and mass sell off of financial  assets seems unlikely. In examining retiree holdings in stocks, using  biennial data spanning 1994 to 2004 from HRS, we found that many people  continue to buy stocks in retirement. More than half of retirees own stocks  outside of an IRA, Keogh, or pension account and, among this group,  approximately 57 percent purchased stocks at some point over the 10-year  period in retirement. We found that from 2002 to 2004 the stock  ownership for most of these retirees either increased or remained at the  same level. Among those who owned stock, almost 31 percent reported  buying stocks during this 2-year period, while just fewer than 26 percent  reported selling. For the retirees who both bought and sold stocks,  approximately 77 percent purchased at least as much value in stock as  they sold.", "Additionally, although retirees might be expected to have a low tolerance  for market risk and will therefore divest themselves of equities in favor of  bonds, the SCF data does not suggest such a major reallocation.  Comparing households\u2019 holdings in stocks and bonds by age, we found  only a small difference in aggregate stock and bond allocation across  portfolios. Specifically, data from the 2004 SCF shows that of total wealth  among households headed by people over age 70, more is invested in  stocks than bonds. In 2004, households headed by those over age 70 had  roughly 60 percent of their investments in stocks and 40 percent invested  in bonds, while those households headed by someone aged 40 to 48 held  68 percent of their portfolios in stocks and 32 percent in bonds.", "Our finding that retirees slowly spend down assets is consistent with the  results of several academic studies. One recent study that examined asset  holdings of elderly households suggests there is a limited decline in  financial assets as households age. Prior work also finds evidence that  retirees spend down at rates that would leave a considerable portion of  their wealth remaining at the end of average life expectancy and a  significant number of retirees continue to accumulate wealth at old ages.  For example, a 1990 study estimated that most single women would have  approximately 44 percent of their initial wealth (at age 65) remaining if  they died at the average age of life expectancy. Other studies have shown  that over the last several decades the elderly have drawn down their lump- sum wealth at relatively conservative rates of 1 to 5 percent per year.", "Retirees may spend down assets cautiously as a hedge against longevity  risk. Private annuities, which minimize longevity risk, are not widely held  by older Americans. As life expectancy increases and people spend more  years in retirement, retirees will need their assets to last a longer period of  time and, thus, should spend them down more slowly. The average  number of years that men who reach age 65 are expected to live has  increased from 13 in 1970 to 16 in 2005, and is projected to increase to 17  by 2020. Women have experienced a similar rise\u2014from 17 years in 1970 to  over 19 years in 2005. By 2020, women who reach age 65 will be expected  to live another 20 years.", "Another factor that may explain the observed slow spending down of  assets among retirees is the bequest motive. National survey data show  that many retirees intend to leave a sizeable bequest, which may explain  their reluctance to spend down their wealth. Because more than three- quarters of retirees have a bequest motive, many may never sell all of their  assets. To the extent that retirees bequeath their assets instead of selling  them for consumption, the result could be an intergenerational transfer  rather than a mass sell-off that would negatively affect asset markets. In  addition to current retirees, data from the HRS indicates that the majority  of older baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1955) expect to  leave a bequest. Approximately 84 percent of these baby boomers expect  to leave a bequest, while 49 percent expect the bequest to be at least  $100,000.", "It is important to note that the baby boom generation\u2019s asset sale behavior  in retirement might differ from that of recent generations of retirees. First,  fewer baby boomers are covered by DB plans that typically pay a regular  income in retirement and increasingly have DC plans that build up benefits  as an account balance. To the extent that this shift means that boomers  have an increased share of retirement wealth held as savings instead of as  income, this may require boomers to sell more assets to produce  retirement income than did previous generations. Second, unanticipated  expenses, such as long-term care and other health care costs, may make  actual bequests smaller than expected. Although 2002 HRS data indicates  that only 8 percent of the leading edge of baby boomers have long-term  care insurance, recent projections show that 35 percent of people  currently age 65 will use nursing home care. If boomers are confronted  with higher than expected health care costs in retirement, they would have  a greater need to spend down their assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defined Benefit Pension Plans Unlikely to Sell Off Large Amounts of Stocks Solely as a Response to Boomer Retirement", "paragraphs": ["Households are not the only holders of financial assets that might shift or  draw down their holdings as the baby boomers age. DB pension plans,  which promise to provide a benefit that is generally based on an  employee\u2019s salary and years of service, hold assets to pay current and  future benefits promised to plan participants, which are either current  employees or separated or retired former employees. According to Federal  Reserve Flow of Funds Accounts data, private-sector plans as a whole  owned $1.8 trillion in assets in 2005. Of this amount, plans held  approximately half in stocks. According to the Employee Benefit  Research Institute (EBRI), federal government DB plans contained an  additional $815 billion in assets as of 2004.  However, most of these DB  plans invest in special Treasury securities that are non-marketable. State  and local plans held an additional $2.6 trillion in assets; however, the data  do not separate DB and DC assets for these plans. If DB plans hold  approximately 85 percent of state and local plan assets, as is the case for  federal government plans, and if DB plans held approximately half of their  assets as equities, this would mean state and local plans held an estimated  $1.1 trillion in equities. Thus, public and private DB plans held an  estimated approximate value of $2 trillion in stocks. Because of the  number of boomers, we would expect that, as they retire, DB plans would  pay out an increasing amount of benefits. This demographic shift could  cause plans to sell some of their holdings to provide current benefits.  Indeed, a 1994 study projected that the pension system would cease to be  a source of saving for the economy roughly in 2024.  We would also  expect plans to convert some stocks to less volatile assets, such as cash  and bonds, to better ensure that plans have sufficient money to pay  current benefits.", "While DB plans may shift their assets in response to demographic changes,  it is unclear whether they would cause major variations in stock and bond  prices. First, even though DB plans hold about $2 trillion in stocks, this  sum still represents a relatively small fraction of total U.S. stock wealth  ($16.1 trillion, as of 2004). Further, there are reasons why DB plans may  not appreciably shift their investments away from stocks. While the baby  boom retirement may increase the number of persons receiving benefits,  the DB participant pool has been aging long before the baby boom  approached retirement. The percentage of private-sector DB participants  made up of retirees has climbed steadily for the past 2 decades, from 16  percent in 1980 to over 25 percent in 2002. Over this time, we have  observed little evidence of a shift in investments by private DB plans away  from stocks and toward fixed-income assets. In 1993, private DB plans  held just below half of their assets in stocks, about the same proportion as  today; in 1999, at the recent stock market\u2019s peak, plans held about 58  percent of assets in stocks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gradual Entry into Retirement and Subsequent Employment Plans Suggest a Cumulative Rather Than Sudden Effect on Markets", "paragraphs": ["The gradual transition of the baby boomers into retirement suggests that  the sale of their financial assets will be spread out over a long period of  time, which mitigates the risk of a shock to financial markets.

An increase in employment at older ages could  facilitate the accumulation of financial assets over a longer period of time  than was typical for earlier generations (albeit also needing to cover  consumption over a longer life expectancy). Furthermore, continuing to  work for pay in retirement, often called partial or phased retirement,  would reduce the need to sell assets to provide income. In fact, some  degree of extended employment has already been evident since the late  1990s, as seen in figure 7. From 1998 to 2005, the labor force participation  rate of men and women age 65 and older increased by 20 percent and 34  percent, respectively.

For example, baby boomers cause changes in the labor  supply and aggregate saving as they progress through life, influencing the  demand for assets and productivity of capital and, thus, the rates of return.  Specifically, the models predicted that baby boomers cause financial asset  returns to increase as they enter the labor force and save for retirement  and then cause returns to decline as they enter retirement and spend their  savings. According to a recent study surveying the literature, such  simulation models suggest, on the whole, that U.S. baby boomers can  expect to earn on their financial assets around half a percentage point less  each year over their lifetime than the generation would have earned absent  a baby boom.

The study\u2019s lower returns reflect the decline  in the productivity of capital that results from fewer workers being  available (due to the baby boom retirement) to put the capital to  productive use. A third study\u2019s results suggest that fluctuations in the size  of the different generations induce substantial changes in equity prices,  but the study does not conclude that the baby boom\u2019s retirement will lead  to a sharp and sudden decline in asset prices.", "The simulation models we reviewed, by design, excluded or simplified  some factors that were difficult to quantify or involved uncertainty that  may cause the models to overstate the baby boom\u2019s impact on the  markets. For example, some models assumed that baby boomers will sell  their assets solely to a relatively smaller generation of U.S. investors when  they retire. Some researchers have noted that if China and India were to  continue their rapid economic growth, they may spur demand for the  assets that baby boomers will sell in retirement. Supporting this view,  other research suggests that global factors may be more important than  domestic factors in explaining stock returns in developed countries.  Some models assumed that individuals in the same generation enter the  labor force at the same time, work a fixed amount, and retire at the same  time. In reality, some may work full or part-time after reaching retirement  age. Likewise, the baby boomers\u2019 children, rather than working a fixed  amount, may delay their entry into the labor force and take advantage of  job opportunities created by retiring baby boomers. These factors could  dampen the effect of the baby boomer retirement on the markets. A few  of the models neglect that some investors may be forward-looking and  anticipate the potential effect of the aging baby boomers on the markets.  To the extent that such investors do so, current financial asset prices  would reflect, at least partially, the future effect of the baby boom\u2019s  retirement and thus dampen the event\u2019s effect on asset prices when it  actually occurs. Finally, the models typically do not include a significant  increase in immigration, but such an outcome would increase the labor  force and be expected to raise the productivity of capital and, thus, the  return on financial assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Empirical Studies", "paragraphs": ["Seven empirical studies of the U.S. financial markets we reviewed  suggested, on average, that the retirement of U.S. baby boomers will have  a minimal, if any, impact on financial asset returns.

These studies focused primarily on changes in  the size of the U.S. middle age population (roughly age 40 to 64) or its  proportion to other age segments of the population. People in this age  group are presumably in their peak earning and saving years and, thus,  expected to have the most significant impact on financial asset returns.", "These empirical studies are inherently retrospective. Therefore, care must  be taken in drawing conclusions about a future relationship between  demographics and asset performance, especially given that the historical  data do not feature an increase in the retired population of the magnitude  that will occur when the U.S. baby boomers retire. However, the  significant shift in the structure of the population that occurred as the  boomers entered the labor force and later their peak earning years should  provide an indication of how demographic change influences financial  asset returns.", "For stocks, four of the seven studies found statistical evidence implying  that the past increases in the relative size of the U.S. middle age  population have increased stock returns.

In contrast, two of the studies found little  evidence that past changes in the U.S. middle age population have had any  measurable effect on stock returns.

Using U.S. Census Bureau data, we extrapolated from three of the four  studies\u2019 results to estimate the average annual change in returns of the  Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500 Index that the studies would have  attributed to demographic changes from 1986 to 2004. During this period,  baby boomers first began to turn age 40 and the proportion of individuals  age 40 to 64 went from about 24.5 percent of the population to about 32  percent. We found two of the studies\u2019 results show that the increase in  the middle age population from 1986 to 2004 led stock returns, on average,  to increase by 0.19 and 0.10 percentage points each year, respectively. We  found that the third study\u2019s results showed a much larger average annual  increase of about 6.7 percentage points from 1986 to 2004. To put these  three estimates into context, the average annual real return of the S&P 500  Index during this period was around 10 percent. The last estimate,  however, may exaggerate the probable impact of the baby boom  retirement on stock returns. The fourth study\u2019s methodology did not  allow us to use U.S. census data to estimate the effect of its results on  stock returns from 1986 to 2004. Nonetheless, the study estimated that  demographically driven changes in the demand for stocks can account for  about 77 percent of the annual increase in real stock prices between 1986  and 1997 and predicted that stock prices will begin to fall around 2015 as a  result of falling demographic demand.", "Besides testing for the effect of demographic shifts on stock returns, five  of the seven studies included bonds in their analyses and largely found  that the baby boom retirement will have a small effect or no effect on bond  yields.

In turn, the finding suggests that the projected  decrease in the middle age population in the future would raise yields.  Extrapolating the results of one study, we find its estimates imply that the  increase in the U.S. middle age population from 1986 to 2004 reduced long- term bond yields by about 0.42 percentage points each year, compared to  actual real yields that averaged 3.41 percent over the same time period.  The other two studies tested how the demographic shift affected long-term  bond prices rather than yields, but an increase in prices would, in effect,  reduce yields. We found that the results of one of the studies showed that  the demographic shift from 1986 to 2004 raised bond prices by only about  0.05 percentage points each year. The other study\u2019s methodology did not  allow us to estimate the effect, but the study estimated that  demographically driven changes in the demand for bonds can account for  at least 81 percent of the annual increase in real bond prices between 1986  and 1997 and predicted that bond prices will begin to fall around 2015 as a  result of falling demographic demand.

For example, some mentioned the concentration of  assets among a minority of households, the long time span over which  boomers will be retiring, and the possibility for many boomers to continue  working past traditional retirement ages.

We undertook our own statistical  analysis, because many of the empirical studies we reviewed either did not  include relevant variables that influence stock returns in their models or  included them but did not discuss the importance of these variables  relative to the demographic variables. To broaden the analysis, we  developed a statistical model of stock returns based on the S&P 500 Index  to compare the effects of changes in demographic, macroeconomic, and  financial variables on returns from 1948 to 2004. As shown in figure 8,  fluctuations in the macroeconomic and financial variables that we selected  collectively explain about 47 percent of the variation in stock returns over  the period. These variables are the growth rate of industrial production,  the dividend yield, the difference between interest rates on long- and  short-term bonds, and the difference between interest rates on risky and  safe corporate bonds\u2014all found in previous studies to be significant  determinants of stock returns. These variables are likely to contain  information about current or future corporate profits. In contrast, our four  demographic variables explained only between 1 percent and 8 percent of  the variation in the annual stock returns over the period. These variables  were based on population measures found to be statistically significant in  the empirical studies we reviewed: the proportion of the U.S. population  age 40 to 64, the ratio of the population age 40 to 49 to the population age  20 to 29, and annual changes in the two.

However, of those known factors, the  majority of the explanatory power stems from developments other than  domestic demographic change. Simply put, demographic variables do not  vary enough from year to year to explain the stock market ups and downs  seen in the data. This makes it unlikely that demographic changes, alone,  could induce a sudden and sharp change in stock prices, but leaves open  the possibility for such changes to lead to a sustained reduction in returns.  At the same time, fluctuations in dividends and industrial production,  which are much more variable than demographic changes, may obscure  any demographic effect in future stock market performance. For example,  a large recession or a significant reduction in dividends would have a  negative effect on annual returns that would likely overwhelm any  reduction in returns resulting from the baby boom retirement.

The past few  decades have witnessed a dramatic shift from DB plans to DC plans. From  1985 to 2004, the number of private sector DB plans has shrunk from about  114,000 to 31,000. From 1985 to 2002 (the latest year for which complete  data are available), the number of DC plans almost doubled, increasing  from 346,000 to 686,000. Furthermore, the percentage of full-time  employees participating in a DB plan (at medium and large firms) declined  from 80 to 33 percent from 1985 to 2003, while DC coverage increased  from 41 to 51 percent over the period. The shift in pension design has  affected many boomers. According to the 2004 SCF, about 50 percent of  people older than the baby boomers reported receiving benefits from a DB  plan, but fewer than 44 percent of baby boomers have such coverage.  However, within the baby boom generation, there is a noticeable  difference: 46 percent of older boomers (born between 1946 and 1955)  reported having a DB plan, while only 39 percent of young boomers (born  between 1956 and 1964) had a DB plan (see table 1). According to the  SCF, the percentage of households age 35 to 44 with a DC plan increased  from 18 percent in 1992 to 42 percent in 2001.", "The shift from DB to DC plans places greater financial management  responsibility on a growing number of baby boomers and makes their  retirement savings more dependent on financial market performance.  Unlike DB plans, DC plans do not promise a specified benefit for life.  Rather, DC plan benefits depend on the amount of contributions, if any,  made to the DC plan by the employee and the employer, and the returns  earned on assets held in the plan. Because there is no guaranteed benefit,  the responsibility to manage these assets and the risk of having  insufficient pension benefits at retirement falls on the individual. Similar  to DB plans, some DC plans offer their participants the option of  converting their balance into an annuity upon retirement, but DC plan  participants typically take or keep their benefits in lump-sum format.", "Small changes in average rates of return can affect the amount  accumulated by retirement and income generated during retirement. For  example, if a boomer saved $500 each year from 1964 until retirement in  2008 and earned 8 percent each year, he or she would accumulate almost  $209,000 at retirement. The same worker earning 7 percent each year over  the same period would accumulate only $153,000 at retirement, a  difference in total saving of 27 percent. Moreover, rates of return can have  a similar affect on retirement income. With $209,000 at retirement, the  retiree could spend $19,683 each year for 20 years if he or she continued to  earn 8 percent each year in retirement. If the annual rate of return dropped  one percentage point to 7 percent, the same amount of retirement savings  would generate only about $18,412 each year for 20 years, a difference of  6.5 percent in annual retirement income. Retirees depending on converting  savings to income are particularly dependent on rates of return, since they  may have limited employment options. Similarly, workers nearing  retirement may be more affected by fluctuations in rates of return than  younger workers, who would have more working years to make up any  declines or losses.", "Although DC plans place greater responsibility on individuals for their  retirement security, statistics indicate that so far at least some have yet to  fully accept it. First, many workers who are covered by a DC plan do not  participate in the plan. Recent data indicate that only about 78 percent of  workers covered by a DC plan actually participate in the plan. Second,  even among baby boom participants, many have not saved much in these  accounts. Figure 9 shows the percentage of boomers with account  balances in their DC pensions and IRAs, which are personal accounts  where individuals can accumulate retirement savings. Over one-half of  households headed by someone born from 1946 to 1955 did not have a DC  pension; for those that did have a DC pension, their median balance was  $58,490, an amount that would generate just a $438 monthly annuity  starting at age 65. Similarly, only 38 percent reported having an IRA, and  the median IRA balance among those participating was only $37,000, an  amount that would generate a monthly annuity of only $277.", "These statistics may not provide a complete picture for some individuals  and households, since those with a small DC plan account balance also  may have a DB plan and thus may not have the same need to contribute to  their account. However, EBRI found that, as of 2004, median savings in  401(k) accounts, a type of DC plan, were higher for every age group up to  age 64 for those with a DB plan than those with only a 401(k). Also, the  median balances for those with only 401(k) plans may not be enough to  support them in retirement. For families with the head of family age 55 to  64 in 2004 with only a 401(k), EBRI estimated that their median balance  was $50,000; for those age 45 to 54, the median was $40,000. While many in  these age groups could continue to work for several years before reaching  retirement age, without substantially higher savings, these households may  be primarily dependent on income from Social Security during retirement.", "Extending our analysis of the allocation of baby boomer assets generally  reveals that financial assets are, in general, a small portion of boomers\u2019  asset portfolios.  Among all boomers, housing is the largest asset for the  majority of households, with vehicles making up the second largest  portion of wealth.  Figure 10 shows the allocation of baby boomer assets  among housing, cash, savings, pensions, vehicles, and other assets.  Not  including the top quartile by wealth, savings and pensions, the portions of  wealth that are invested in stocks and bonds are a small portion of overall  wealth, constituting no more than 20 percent of total gross assets per  household.  Among the bottom two quartiles by wealth, on average  boomers have more of their wealth invested in their personal vehicle  (automobile or truck), which depreciates over time, than in either savings  or pensions, assets that generally appreciate over time.  Overall, the  finding that most boomers do not hold a significant amount of financial  assets, measured both by account balance and by percentage of total  assets, mitigates this generation\u2019s potential effect on the asset markets as  boomers retire and highlights the fact that many boomers may enter  retirement without adequate personal savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Stress on Social Security, Medicare, and Health Expenditures May Create Uncertainties for Some Baby Boomers and Future Generations", "paragraphs": ["The uncertainties surrounding the future financial status of Social  Security, the program which provides the foundation of retirement income  for most retirees, also presents risks to baby boomers\u2019 retirement  security.

Medicare also faces very large long-term financial  deficits. According to the 2006 Trustees report, the Hospital Insurance  Trust Fund is projected to exhaust itself by 2018. The challenges stem  from concurrent demographic trends\u2014people are living longer, spending  more years in retirement, and have had fewer children\u2014and from costs for  health care rising faster than growth in the gross domestic product. These  changes increase benefits paid to retirees and reduce the number of  people, relative to previous generations, available to pay to support these  benefits.", "These financial imbalances have important implications for future retirees\u2019  retirement security. While future changes to either program are uncertain,  addressing the financial challenges facing Social Security and Medicare  may require retirees to receive reduced benefits, relative to scheduled  future benefits, while workers might face higher taxes to finance current  benefits. In addition, some proposals to reform Social Security incorporate  a system of individual accounts into the current program that would  reduce scheduled benefits under the current system, perhaps with  protections for retirees, older workers, and low-wage workers, and make  up for those reductions to some degree with income from the individual  accounts. Like DC plans generally, these accounts would give the  individual not only the prospect for higher rates of return but also the risk  of loss, placing additional responsibility and risk on individuals to provide  for their own retirement security. Similarly, tax-preferred health savings  accounts are a type of personal account to allow enrollees to pay for  certain health-related expenditures.", "The worsening budget deficits that are expected to result if fiscal  imbalances in Social Security and Medicare are not addressed could have  important effects on the macroeconomy. By increasing the demand for  credit, federal deficits tend to raise interest rates, which are mitigated to  the extent that foreign savings flow into the United States to supplement  scarce domestic savings. If foreigners do not fully finance growing budget  deficits, upward pressure on interest rates can reduce domestic  investment in productive capacity. All else equal, these higher borrowing  costs could discourage new investment and reduce the value of capital  already owned by firms, which should be reflected in reduced stock prices  as well.", "The fiscal challenges facing Medicare underscore the issue of rising retiree  health costs generally. Rising health care costs have made health  insurance and anticipated medical expenses increasingly important issues  for older Americans. Although the long-term decline in the percentage of  employers offering retiree health coverage has appeared to have leveled  off in recent years, retirees continue to face an increasing share of costs,  eligibility restrictions, and benefit changes that contribute to an overall  erosion in the value and availability of coverage. A recent study estimated  that the percentage of after-tax income spent on health care will almost  double for older individuals by 2030 and that after taxes and health care  spending incomes may be no higher in 2030 than in 2000 for a typical older  married couple. People with lower incomes will be the most adversely  affected. The study projected that by 2030, those in the bottom 20 percent  of the income distribution would spend more than 50 percent of their  after-tax income on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health care  expenses, an increase of 30 percentage points from 2000. The costs of  healthcare in retirement, especially long-term and end-of-life care, are a  large source of uncertainty for baby boomers in planning their retirement  financing, as typical private and public insurance generally does not cover  these services. Nursing home and long-term care are generally not covered  under Medicare but by Medicaid, which is the program that provides  health insurance for low-income Americans. Medicaid eligibility varies  from state to state, but generally requires that a patient expend most of  their financial assets before they can be deemed eligible for benefits. Most  private long-term care insurance policies pay for nursing home and at- home care services, but these benefits may be limited, and few elderly  actually purchase this type of coverage, with a little over 9 million policies  purchased in the United States by 2002. Thus, health care costs may cause  some baby boomers without long-term care insurance to rapidly spend  retirement savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Baby Boomers and Future Generations May Increasingly Rely on Their Own Investment Decisions, Highlighting Importance of Financial Literacy", "paragraphs": ["With more individuals being asked to take responsibility for saving for  their own retirement in a DC pension plan or IRA, financial literacy and  skills are becoming increasingly important in helping to ensure that  retirees can enjoy a comfortable standard of living.

For  this group, the federal government will play an especially key role in  retirement security through its retirement and fiscal policies. The  challenges facing Social Security and Medicare are large and will only  grow as our population ages. Legislative reforms to place Social Security  and Medicare on a path towards sustainable long-term solvency would not  only reduce uncertainty about retiree benefits, particularly for those  Americans who own few or no assets, but also help address the federal  government\u2019s long-term budget imbalances that could affect the economy  and asset markets.

This triennial survey asks extensive questions about household  income and wealth components; we used the latest available survey from  2004 and previous surveys back to 1992. The SCF is widely used by the  research community, is continually vetted by the Federal Reserve, and is  considered to be a reliable data source. The SCF is believed by many to be  the best source of publicly available information on U.S. household  finances.", "Some caveats about the data should be kept in mind. Because some assets  are held very disproportionately by relatively wealthy families, the SCF  uses a two part sample design, one of which is used to select a sample  with disproportionate representation of families more likely to be  relatively wealthy.  The two parts of the sample are adjusted for sample  nonresponse and combined using weights to provide a representation of  families overall.  In addition, the SCF excludes one small set of families by  design. People who are listed in the October issue of Forbes as being  among the 400 wealthiest in the United States are excluded. To enable the  calculation of statistical hypothesis tests, the SCF uses a replication  scheme. A set of replicate samples is selected by applying the key  dimensions of the original sample stratification to the actual set of  completed SCF cases and then applying the full weighting algorithm to  each of the replicate samples. To estimate the variability of an estimate  from the SCF, independent estimates are made with each replicate and  with each of the multiple imputations; a simple rule is used to combine the  two sources of variability into a single estimate of the standard error.", "We also analyzed recent asset sales by retirees and work and bequest  expectations of baby boomers, as well as gathered further financial  information on baby boomers and older generations, from data from the  Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1994 to 2004. The University of  Michigan administers the HRS every 2 years as a panel data set, surveying  respondents every two years starting in 1992 about health, finances, family  situation, and many other topics. Like the SCF, the HRS is widely used by  academics and continually updated and improved by administrators. We  also received expert opinions on the likely impact of the baby boom  retirement on asset and housing markets from interviews with various  financial management companies, public policy organizations, and  government agencies, particularly those agencies dealing with housing.", "To assess the conclusions of academics researchers and outside experts  on the financial impacts of the baby boom retirement, we read, analyzed,  and summarized theoretical and empirical academic studies on the  subject. Based on our selection criteria, we determined that these studies  were sufficient for our purposes but not that their results were necessarily  conclusive.  We also interviewed financial industry representatives from  mutual fund companies, pension funds, life insurance companies, broker- dealers, and financial industry trade associations. We also did our own  analysis of the historical importance of demographics and other variables  on stock returns by collecting demographic, financial, and macroeconomic  data and running a regression analysis. We performed data reliability  assessments on all data used in this analysis.", "To assess the role rates of return will play in providing retirement income  in the future, we synthesized findings from the analysis of financial asset  holdings to draw conclusions about the risk implications for different  subpopulations of the baby boom and younger generations. We also used  facts and findings on pensions and Social Security (from past GAO reports  and the academic literature) and insights from interviews with outside  experts to extend and support our conclusions.", "We conducted our work between August 2005 and June 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Bibliography of Simulation- Based and Empirical Studies", "paragraphs": ["Abel, Andrew B. \u201cWill Bequests Attenuate the Predicted Meltdown in  Stock Prices When Baby Boomers Retire?\u201d The Review of Economics and  Statistics, vol. 83, no. 4 (2001): 589-595.", "Abel, Andrew B. \u201cThe Effects of a Baby Boom on Stock Prices and Capital  Accumulation in the Presence of Social Security.\u201d Econometrica, vol. 71,  no. 2 (2003): 551-578.", "Ang, Andrew and Angela Maddaloni. \u201cDo Demographic Changes Affect  Risk Premiums?

For example, studies by  Poterba; Geanakoplos, Magill, and Quinzii (hereafter, GMQ); and Yoo use  only demographic variables as their independent variables. The omission  of relevant variables in regressions of this kind will result in biased  estimates of the size and significance of the effects under investigation.  Answering the second question serves to put the influence of  demographics on stock returns in perspective: How much of stock market  movements are explained by demographics as opposed to other variables?  To answer the questions we include a series of demographic variables  from the literature we reviewed in a multivariable regression model. We  relied primarily on information in a seminal study done by Eugene Fama  to develop our model.", "Data and Sample Selection  We analyzed the determinants of real (adjusted for inflation) total  (including both price changes and dividends) returns of the Standard and  Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500 Index from 1948 to 2004. We chose the S&P 500 Index as  our dependent variable not only because it is widely regarded as the best  single gauge of U.S. equities market and covers over 80 percent of the  value of U.S. equities but also because S&P 500 Index mutual funds are by  far the largest and most popular type of index fund. Due to changes in the  structure of financial markets over time, we chose a shorter time horizon  to minimize the likelihood of a structural break in the data. For our  independent variables, we selected macroeconomic and financial variables  that economic studies have found to be important in explaining stock  returns and were used in Fama\u2019s analysis to determine how much of stock  market variation they explained. We selected two demographic variables,  the proportion of the population age 40-64 and the ratio of the population  age 40-49 to the population age 20-29 (the middle-young or \u201cMY\u201d ratio),  that had statistically significant coefficients in several of the empirical  studies that we reviewed.

The error structure is modeled assuming White\u2019s  heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix. We first estimate the  equation without a demographic variable to measure the proportion of  variation explained by macroeconomic and financial indicators, followed  by estimating the regression equation four separate times to include each  of the demographic measures. For the benchmark model, we find no  evidence of serial autocorrelation or deviations from normality.", "Despite standard diagnostics and careful regression specification, some  limitations of our analysis remain. We cannot be certain that we have  chosen the best variables to represent the aspects of the economy that  move the stock market or the demographic variables that may influence  stock returns as well. We have attempted to choose appropriate variables  based on the existing empirical and theoretical literature on the economic  and demographic determinants of stock returns. Nevertheless, even these  variables may be measured with error. Generally, measurement errors  would cause us to underestimate the importance of those variables that  have been measured with error. This would be most problematic in the  case of our demographic variables, though measurement error in our  economic and financial control variables actually makes our estimates  conservative. Nevertheless, we assessed the reliability of all data used in  this analysis, and found all data series to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. As a result, we believe that the limitations mentioned here (and  related to the direction of causality in industrial production mentioned  above) do not have serious consequences for the interpretation of our  results.", "The regression results are presented in tables 2 through 6 below. Our  results are consistent with the literature on the determinants of stock  market returns, especially Fama\u2019s study, in that several of our  macroeconomic and financial variables are statistically significant, and  they account for a substantial proportion (roughly 47 percent) of the  variation in stock returns. The coefficient of determination in Fama\u2019s  study could be higher due to the inclusion of more industrial production  leads.", "The finding in Davis and Li\u2019s study that the 40-64 population had a  statistically significant impact on stock returns is not robust to alternative  specifications, as demonstrated in Table 6. The proportion of the  population 40-64 is no longer a statistically significant determinant of  stock returns, and the inclusion of the variable improves the R-squared by  less than 1.5 percent.
