GAO reviewed agreements and referral data between DEC and three of the nine HUD program offices that made referrals to DEC from fiscal years 2014 to 2017 (accounting for 73 percent of the total referrals during that period), and interviewed HUD staff in headquarters and field offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The three program offices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that GAO examined have a process in place for referring cases of potential noncompliance to the Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC), but two of the offices do not provide their staff with specific guidance on when to make referrals. The Office of Multifamily Housing makes referrals to DEC based on defined thresholds for noncompliance, such as for properties that do not pass physical inspections. In contrast, the Offices of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) and Community Planning and Development (CPD) have broad guidelines but not specific thresholds for when to refer an entity to DEC. These two offices do not provide field staff with specific guidance to help determine which housing agencies or grantees to refer to DEC for possible enforcement action. As a result, the offices cannot ensure that decisions on whether to make referrals are made on a well-supported and consistent basis, potentially limiting DEC's effectiveness in fulfilling its mission of providing independent oversight of HUD's programs. In addition, PIH and CPD have targets for how many annual referrals the program office will make to DEC, but the targets are not based on program risk. According to federal internal control standards, management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. Without a target number of referrals based on program risk, PIH and CPD cannot be confident that the number of cases referred to DEC is appropriate and that DEC resources are being used efficiently.", "DEC tracks some performance measures, but it largely measures outputs, such as number of work assignments completed, rather than outcomes, such as financial performance improvements resulting from its work, that would help assess the impact of its activities. DEC also does not track the status of recommendations it makes to program offices or measure indicators of its timeliness in completing its reviews for the referrals it receives. In addition, GAO found that DEC staff did not consistently record two key data elements (including the corrective action taken) in the spreadsheet used to track referrals. Improving DEC's performance measurement system and data recording would be consistent with federal internal control standards and allow DEC to better assess its effectiveness, ensure accountability, and identify potential improvements.", "DEC has experienced various information technology challenges that have affected its ability to carry out its mission. For example, DEC's current system is not designed to allow staff to easily determine the basis for certain referrals or identify and analyze trends in referrals over multiple years. In addition, DEC has experienced continuing outages and breaks in service. HUD has developed plans for a replacement system, but funding constraints have delayed the implementation of the new system. DEC staff also noted that the organizational location of DEC within the Office of General Counsel was a challenge to carrying out its mission because it limited DEC's ability to hold program offices accountable for corrections. HUD disagreed and also stated that the department has no plans to relocate DEC. Based on GAO's review, other factors, such as the lack of guidance for making referrals (discussed above), may better explain why DEC may not be utilized more effectively."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations to HUD related to DEC, including for staff guidance on when to make referrals; targets for the number of DEC referrals based on program risk; outcome measures to track performance; and controls to ensure consistent data recording.

In 1997, HUD announced a management reform  initiative, HUD 2020, designed to improve the agency\u2019s performance and  eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. One of the main reforms was to  implement a new system of assessment, monitoring, and enforcement to  ensure the quality of HUD-assisted housing. HUD established the  Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC) in 1998 to help ensure program  participants\u2019 compliance with HUD program requirements and consolidate  non-civil rights enforcement actions across HUD into a single center.

Collectively, these three  program offices accounted for 73 percent of the total referrals DEC  received from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. To address the first  objective, we reviewed the formal agreements between DEC and CPD,  MFH, and PIH, as well as the guidance these program offices developed  for monitoring multifamily properties, public housing agencies, and  grantees. We compared this guidance against internal control standards  for designing control activities and communicating internally. We  analyzed data from DEC\u2019s system for managing referrals from program  offices (extracted as of March 2018) and a spreadsheet DEC maintains to  track referrals from CPD and PIH (as of March 2018).

In  addition, as part of the plan, HUD created the Real Estate Assessment  Center (REAC) to help monitor public housing and HUD-insured  multifamily housing projects by providing independent assessments of the  physical quality and financial condition of public housing and multifamily  developments.", "DEC\u2019s current mission is to provide independent oversight of the  administration of HUD programs and its external partners. According to  HUD, DEC\u2019s primary goal is to bring owners to full compliance so that  there is no compromise in the quality of HUD-assisted housing. In  instances where owners do not bring properties up to standard, and  where physical and financial deficiencies persist, DEC can take  appropriate enforcement action. This includes administrative sanctions,  such as civil money penalties, suspension or debarment, as well as  possible referral to HUD OIG when criminal activity is suspected, or to the  Department of Justice for civil action. DEC also conducts more targeted  oversight reviews for some program offices. These reviews are intended  to provide program offices with an independent means to analyze and  evaluate the efficiency or vulnerability of their programs and operations.", "DEC has staff in HUD headquarters and five field offices. In general,  headquarters staff develops policy and coordinates the reviews of the  referrals DEC receives from the HUD program offices while field office  staff conducts the reviews. DEC works primarily with MFH and conducts  more targeted oversight reviews for PIH and CPD. (See Appendix II for a  breakdown of DEC referrals by program office and the state where the  property is located.) These program offices have staff in headquarters  and field offices, which are organized into 10 regions. There is at least  one field office or regional office in each state, and the number of field  offices varies by region.

Collectively, the properties MFH oversees  provided affordable rental housing to more than 1.2 million low- income households in 2017.", "PIH helps low-income families through a number of programs. PIH  provides assistance to state and local public housing agencies that  generally own and administer units for eligible tenants. The Housing  Choice Voucher program provides tenant-based rental assistance that  eligible individuals and families can use to rent houses or apartments  in the private housing market.

In addition,  according to MFH officials, MFH changed certain thresholds of financial  noncompliance from automatic to elective referrals in 2013, which officials  believe resulted in fewer referrals for those types of financial  noncompliance.", "MFH officials also noted that the increase in physical noncompliance  referrals in fiscal year 2016 likely resulted from the informal  encouragement given to field offices to make more elective referrals. In  addition, during this period HUD\u2019s inspection process came under  additional scrutiny due to concerns about a multifamily property in Florida.  The property had received a passing REAC inspection score in August  2015 but city code inspectors subsequently found multiple and serious  deficiencies.

In  addition, PIH does not provide direction to field offices on how to use the  results of their quarterly risk assessment to identify high-risk PHAs for  potential DEC referrals.

DEC has agreed with PIH and CPD  on a target number of elective referrals they should aim to make to DEC  each fiscal year.

DEC\u2019s staff level in fiscal year 2017 (an  estimated 95 full-time equivalents) represented its lowest staff level since  fiscal year 1999. HUD OIG reported in 2016 that limits on DEC  resources resulted in lost opportunities to improve program effectiveness  and strengthen conditions that discouraged waste, fraud, and abuse.  The report also noted that these limits had prevented DEC from extending  comprehensive enforcement activities to all program offices, which had  reduced its effectiveness. OIG\u2019s report further noted that DEC said it  would need additional staff to perform financial analysis and enforcement  if DEC were to expand its efforts with PIH and CPD. OIG recommended  that OGC provide DEC with the resources and support to strengthen  enforcement across HUD programs.", "HUD disagreed with the OIG\u2019s conclusion that staffing declines limited  DEC\u2019s ability to achieve its mission. HUD noted that DEC\u2019s decrease in  workload over time mitigated the effect of reduced staffing. In addition,  HUD said that despite its reduced resources, DEC had succeeded in  preventing some individuals from participating in MFH programs through  suspension or debarment, and in encouraging compliance. HUD stated  that DEC had sufficient staffing to handle MFH referrals under current  protocols and serve as HUD\u2019s troubleshooter by conducting oversight  reviews for CPD and PIH.

OIG reported in its 2016 report that DEC\u2019s initial  placement within the Deputy Secretary\u2019s office provided DEC with  independent enforcement authority. In addition, DEC officials told us  that DEC\u2019s initial placement highlighted HUD\u2019s commitment to  enforcement and that its current placement limits its authority to oversee  program areas and hold them accountable for corrections.", "In a December 2017 internal paper, DEC proposed returning to the  Deputy Secretary\u2019s office. It noted that DEC\u2019s oversight of programmatic  operations began to decline in 2016, and that PIH referrals to DEC  through December 2017 represented less than one-half of the goal of one  percent of PIH\u2019s inventory. DEC\u2019s paper also noted that a return to the  Deputy Secretary\u2019s office would highlight HUD\u2019s responsibility to develop  and maintain effective internal controls, independent of the program  areas. Finally, DEC stated that its placement within the Deputy  Secretary\u2019s office would provide an opportunity to consolidate the  department\u2019s enterprise risk management functions. According to HUD officials, as of August 2018, the department had no plans to move DEC  and did not request funding for such a move in HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2019  budget.", "In response to the 2016 OIG report, HUD stated that DEC\u2019s current  location within OGC had not affected DEC\u2019s ability to make referrals for  enforcement or initiate suspension or debarment actions. HUD added that  placing DEC within OGC achieved significant efficiencies by consolidating  DEC\u2019s administrative, information technology, and legal functions without  affecting the ability of either office to carry out its mission. OGC officials  told us that DEC\u2019s current placement within OGC is similar to the Federal  Bureau of Investigation\u2019s placement within the Department of Justice.  They also noted that DEC\u2019s enforcement and compliance analysts and  attorneys coordinate enforcement activities and that DEC field office  directors routinely seek legal advice from OGC attorneys. According to  OGC, returning DEC to the Deputy Secretary\u2019s office would have adverse  effects on the administrative efficiencies achieved.", "It is unclear whether DEC\u2019s placement within OGC has adversely affected  DEC\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission. We asked DEC staff for documentation  that would support a move to the Deputy Secretary\u2019s office, but the  information we received did not provide specific examples of how DEC\u2019s  current placement limited its ability to achieve its mission. Furthermore,  as part of their 2017 paper discussing a proposed relocation, DEC  officials did not identify how DEC\u2019s placement in OGC adversely impacted  it. Other factors besides DEC\u2019s current location may explain why DEC  may not be utilized more effectively. For example, we previously identified  findings related to the lack of guidance that might contribute to program  offices\u2019 underutilization of DEC. In addition, as we note above, the  absence of guidance on when program offices should make referrals may  limit DEC\u2019s ability to assess its enforcement efforts.

HUD  also anticipated assessing the current agreements between DEC and  HUD program offices and, where appropriate, revising those agreements  to incorporate current agency goals and priorities, among other things.

In its written comments, HUD said that developing \u201ctargets\u201d  for the number of referrals made to DEC could potentially be inconsistent  with the methodology of basing referrals on program risk and that a single  measure of risk-based referrals would be a more effective strategy. As  discussed in the report, the current target numbers of referrals for the  program offices to make to DEC appear to have been selected somewhat  arbitrarily and the officials could not explain the basis for selecting these  targets. By identifying a target number of referrals based on the  anticipated need for DEC reviews, the program offices can more  efficiently plan the use of their resources. Setting the targets will also  allow DEC and the program offices to better assess whether they are  achieving their goals and objectives, and may encourage program offices  to refer entities to DEC.", "HUD also disagreed with our sixth recommendation that DEC should  develop and implement performance measures that measure its  timeliness in completing reviews, noting that DEC has tracked the  timeliness of its oversight work since 2014. However, as we discuss in the  report, DEC has not included performance measures related to the  timeliness of its reviews, which is separate from tracking the information.  We revised the language in the final report to note that DEC tracks this  information, but has not created a related performance measure.", "HUD agreed with our remaining five recommendations and provided  information about planned steps to implement them.

To address the first objective, we reviewed DEC\u2019s formal  agreements with CPD, MFH, and PIH to determine the roles and  responsibilities of the parties, any criteria for making referrals, and any  goals on number of reviews. In addition, we reviewed guidance  developed by program offices for monitoring multifamily properties, public  housing agencies, and grantees to determine what, if any, criteria existed  for making referrals to DEC. We also observed demonstrations of the  system DEC uses to manage referrals and the risk assessment tool PIH  uses in its reviews of public housing agencies.
