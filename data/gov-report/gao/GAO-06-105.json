Drilling members in the reserve force by law are required to have a medical exam every 5 years and an annual certificate of their medical status. Also, DOD policies require an annual dental exam and an annual evaluation of physical fitness. Compliance with these routine requirements is the first step in determining who is fit for duty. Public Law 108-375 required GAO to study DOD's management of the health status of reserve members activated for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.

Although each reserve component employs a tracking system capable of monitoring compliance with medical exams, only one component has taken the necessary quality assurance steps to ensure the reliability of its data. While the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has the responsibility for overseeing medical and physical fitness policy and processes, it has not established a management control framework and executed a plan to oversee compliance with routine examinations. Specifically, this office has not enforced holding all responsible levels accountable, ensuring that all requirements are being met, and that complete and reliable data are being entered into the appropriate tracking system. For example, this office has not enforced its own requirement for the services to report on the components' physical fitness status. Without complete and reliable data, DOD is not in a sound position to provide the Secretary of Defense or Congress assurances that the reserve force is medically and physically fit when called to active duty. DOD has only limited visibility over the health status of reserve members after they are called to duty and is unable to determine the extent of care provided to those members deployed with preexisting medical conditions despite the existence of various sources of medical information. The components collect various types of medical data, but vary in their ability to systematically identify, track, and report information on those with temporary and permanent conditions that may limit deployability. In addition, medical information is captured on predeployment forms for all members and entered into a DOD-wide centralized database. GAO has previously reported that the database has missing and incomplete health data, and DOD is working to correct this through its quality assurance program. GAO found during this review that DOD has continued to make progress entering the data from the forms into the database, but the data are still incomplete and the reasons why members are determined medically nondeployable are not captured in a way that is easily discernable. While the Under Secretary of Defense continues to have responsibility for overseeing the medical and physical fitness of reserve members after they are called to duty, the combatant commanders, under the Joint Chief of Staff, have this responsibility for the theater. DOD is unable to determine the care provided to those deployed with preexisting medical conditions because DOD has not determined what preexisting conditions may be allowed into a specific theater and, thus, does not know what conditions to track. Evidence GAO developed suggests that members are deployed into theater with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, and cancer. The impact of those who are not medically and physically fit for duty could be significant for future deployments as the pool of reserve members from which to fill requirements is dwindling and those who have deployed are not in as good health as they were before deployment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) operations in time of war or national  emergency are currently dependent upon sizeable National Guard and  Reserve involvement and DOD expects future use of the reserve force to  remain high.

Even though all but 1,100 eventually  deployed, the nondeployable soldiers disrupted the mobilization process  because units had to undergo extensive efforts to replace nondeployable  reserve members with those who could be deployed. The report also noted  that some soldiers who had coronary bypass surgery, cancer, and  amputations had not been identified at their home stations and reported to  their mobilization station. In 1991, we reported that medical screenings  conducted at mobilization stations identified numerous problems that  impaired soldiers\u2019 ability to deploy, including ulcers, chronic asthma,  spinal arthritis, hepatitis, seizures, and diabetes. In 1992, we reported that  because many medical personnel were found nondeployable for various  reasons, including medical reasons, many units deployed with medical  personnel shortages and were not fully mission capable upon arrival in the  Persian Gulf. For example, two reserve component surgeons\u2014one who  was unable to stand for more than 30 minutes and another who had  Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014reported for duty but were unable to deploy due to  their conditions. A 1992 Sixth U.S. Army Inspector General report stated  that many soldiers deployed to Southwest Asia had to return to the United  States because of medical conditions that had not been previously  diagnosed.

One soldier had double kidney failure, one had muscular dystrophy, and  another had a gunshot wound to the head.

Specifically, the policy requires that all  military services and reserve components develop and use physical fitness  tests that evaluate aerobic capacity (e.g., a timed run), muscular strength,  and muscular endurance (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups), and that all  service members be formally evaluated and tested for the record at least  annually (unless they are under a medical waiver).", "The specific content of the physical fitness examination varies among the  components because different physical abilities are needed to meet the  services\u2019 different missions. The Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) is a  performance test that indicates a member\u2019s ability to perform physically  and handle his or her own body weight. The APFT is required annually for  the Army National Guard. As of October 2004, the Chief of the Army  Reserve required Army reservists to be tested twice a year, as are their  active component counterparts. The APFT consists of 2 minutes of push- ups, 2 minutes of sit-ups, and a 2-mile run (the same test is administered to  both the active and reserve component). The number of push-ups and sit- ups and the 2-mile run time are based on the soldier\u2019s age range and sex  (the physical fitness test required to enter the Army has the same  requirements for all ages, but different requirements for gender). All Navy  personnel, regardless of age and component (active or reserve), are  required to participate semiannually in a Physical Fitness Assessment that  includes a Body Composition Assessment and Physical Readiness Test  unless medically prohibited from doing so. Body composition is assessed  by an initial weight and height screening or an approved circumference  technique to estimate body fat percentage. Testing includes a series of  physical events designed to evaluate an individual\u2019s flexibility through a  sit-reach activity, muscular strength and endurance through curl-ups and  push-ups, and aerobic capacity through a 1.5-mile run/walk, or 500-yard or  450-meter swim. Individuals who fail either the Body Composition  Assessment or the Physical Readiness Test or both are considered to have  failed the entire assessment. The Marine Corps has also developed a Body  Composition Program and Physical Fitness Test to assess each Marine\u2019s  fitness level. Active component Marines are tested semiannually while  Marine Corps Reservists are tested annually. Body composition standards  are health- and performance-based limits for body weight and body fat.  Physical fitness testing includes pull-ups for males, flexed-arm hang for  females, a timed abdominal crunch event, and a timed 3-mile run. These  events are designed to test the strength and stamina of the upper body,  midsection, and lower body, as well as the cardiovascular system. The Air  Force fitness program requires an annual physical assessment to motivate  all members to participate in a year-round physical conditioning program,  including proper aerobic conditioning, strength/flexibility training, and  healthy eating. Fitness assessment results are based on a composite score  calculated from results of an aerobic assessment (1.5-mile run), muscular  fitness assessment (push-ups and crunches), and body composition  measurement (abdominal circumference measurement).", "Although DOD has directed the military physical fitness programs to  complement the health promotion program within OSD\u2019s Office of Health  Affairs and senior medical officials have told us that medical and physical  fitness go \u201chand-in-hand,\u201d physical fitness policies are not coordinated  with medical fitness policies at the OSD, service, reserve component, or  unit levels.

According to ANG officials, most physical fitness testing is  performed within the last few months of the calendar year. Because the  data are cumulative, the only time that physical fitness information can be  assessed for all members taking the test is at the end of the calendar year.  In other words, most reservists would appear out of compliance until they  take their annual exam even though they are probably still within their 1- year window for testing. Furthermore, information on the number of  reservists not tested at all or who are overdue is not captured by the ANG  Fitness Age database.

Thus, information  can be obtained from the centralized database on reserve and active  component members who were determined nondeployable during  mobilization due to medical reasons. The member also completes a health  assessment form after deployment. However, we have noted in previous  reports that the centralized database has missing and incomplete forms.

Unfortunately, the forms do not always capture information regarding the  reasons why members were found medically nondeployable or do not  capture that information in a systematic way. For example, although the  form has an entry for a narrative explanation to explain why a member is  medically nondeployable, an AMSA official informed us that these  explanations are often incomplete or not decipherable, and can not be  easily categorized. Furthermore, although the forms do provide space for  the member\u2019s deployment destination, this information is not always filled  in because, according to AMSA officials, deployment destination is often  not known by the member or is classified.

While  the Army Reserve had the highest percentage of nondeployable  servicemembers among the reserve components, at about 9 percent, the  active Army had the highest percentage of nondeployable servicemembers  among the active components, at almost 6 percent. According to medical  officials, some of these nondeployable personnel, such as those who had  suffered multiple heart attacks, should have been discharged prior to the  time that they received their mobilization orders. Others had temporary  conditions, such as broken bones and pregnancies, that did not warrant  medical discharges but made the servicemember nondeployable at the  time of the assessment.", "The predeployment health assessment forms capture information on  specific medical referrals given to members by the reviewing health care  official during mobilization, which is useful in gaining some insight into  the care that members may have required during mobilization. These data  are not as helpful in determining why a member was not medically  deployable since they are not always related to why a member was  determined to be nondeployable. According to a senior OSD official,  although any indicated referral may be related to a disposition of  nondeployable, this is not always the case. Three common scenarios  illustrate this relationship: (1) a member is found to be clearly  nondeployable from a medical standpoint, and no referral is made; (2) a  member is referred for further evaluation for a condition for which  deployability is questionable, in which case there is a direct relation  between the referral and the determination of deployable or  nondeployable; or (3) a member is found to be deployable, but has a minor  medical issue for which the health provider provides a referral for  treatment. According to a senior OSD official, the last scenario is a fairly  uncommon reason for a referral. Examples might include a referral for a  routine preventive test, such as a Pap test in a gynecological clinic. The  Pap test is a desired preventive medical test, but depending on the date  and result of the last Pap exam and the individual\u2019s personal history and  risk factors, it is not always necessary to perform one prior to deployment.", "More than 50,000 referrals were made on the predeployment health  assessments from November 2001 through June 2005 for both the active  and reserve components.

In accordance with  this policy, reserve component servicemembers identified in the first 25  days as having a medical condition that renders the individual  nondeployable may be released from active duty immediately. As a result  of this policy change, the Army was able to demobilize reserve component  members who were found to be nondeployable within the first 25 days of  their mobilization.

This updated guidance stated that  servicemembers who have existing medical conditions may deploy if all of  the following conditions were met: (1) an unexpected worsening of the  condition is not likely to have a medically grave outcome; (2) the condition  is stable; and (3) any required ongoing health care or medications must be  immediately available in theater in the military health system, and have no  special handling, storage, or other requirements, such as electrical power.  The criteria provided a list of conditions that may preclude medical  clearance for DOD civilians and contractors (including current heart  failure, history of heat stroke, and uncontrolled hypertension); however,  according to CENTCOM officials, this list of conditions did not apply to  servicemembers because they were already covered by service-specific  guidelines.

In addition, the Air Force\u2019s Air Surgeon Chief of Medical Services  Directorate commented on January 17, 2003, in response to a case  involving an Air National Guard member who had been sent into theater  with an obvious major preexisting dental condition, that it is unreasonable  to expect deployed doctors and dentists to perform remedial procedures  and provide care that should have been accomplished at home because it  takes too much time away from treating injured and ill in theater, and it  results in lost man hours for the gaining unit that it needs to accomplish its  war-fighting requirements. In our small group discussions with Army  National Guard, one servicemember said that he was told that he would  receive dental care in theater, although this care was never provided. At  one Air National Guard unit command we visited, officials informed us of  a member who was mobilized and subsequently deployed with preexisting  dental problems in late 2003, because (1) the dental condition was not  disclosed by the member and (2) the unit command did not have a current  dental exam in his medical records to prove otherwise.

A Navy official, for example, stated that a Navy officer with  hypertension did not disclose his medical condition in order to deploy to  Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Congress recently directed OSD to develop and implement a  comprehensive plan to improve management of the health status of the  reserve component.

DOD did not concur with our recommendation that it  establish a management control framework and execute a plan for issuing  guidance, establishing quality assurance for data reliability, and tracking  compliance with routine medical examinations. DOD did not state that it  disagreed with our findings; however, DOD stated that it had initiatives  underway that addressed our recommendation. DOD further noted that  because policies, programs, and instructions are already in place or in  process, it did not see the need for any additional action. We disagree with  DOD\u2019s conclusion because, based on our review, we do not believe that  DOD\u2019s initiatives are far enough along to dismiss further action, and we  continue to believe that our recommendation has merit. We agree that the  initiatives DOD cited in its written comments are positive steps toward  correcting the identified problems, but management and planning remain a  concern. We have not seen enough evidence to agree that DOD has put in  place a management control framework that will enforce holding all  responsible levels accountable, ensuring that all routine medical  requirements are being met, and that complete and reliable data are being  entered into the appropriate tracking systems. As noted in our report, the  problems with determining the health status of the reserve force were  revealed during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and in the  decade that has passed since then DOD has made little progress to correct  the identified problems. As a result, in 2004, Congress directed DOD to  establish a Joint Medical Readiness Oversight Committee to oversee the  development and implementation of a comprehensive medical readiness  plan. As also noted in our report, the committee held its first meeting in  February 2005, and a plan to improve medical readiness was being  developed during this review. We do not believe that a committee can be  held accountable for ensuring that such actions take place. Ultimately, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, in concert with  the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs, are accountable for enforcing  the requirements for routine medical examinations.", "Moreover, DOD stated that it has established a new quality assurance  program that monitors electronic data with validation through medical  record reviews of a wide range of force health protection measures. We  did not find this to be true during our review. With the exception of the  Navy Reserve, the reserve components do not monitor electronic data of  routine medical examinations with validation through medical record  reviews. Further, we found the data in the reserve components\u2019 tracking  systems to be unreliable for purposes of determining compliance with  routine medical examinations. As noted in our report, compliance with  these routine medical examinations is the first step toward determining  who is medically fit or ready for duty. DOD stated that its compliance- monitoring Individual Medical Readiness program regularly reports the  overall medical readiness status for each servicemember. However, we  found that the Individual Medical Readiness program\u2019s outcomes are  derived from data in the reserve components\u2019 tracking systems, which we  have found to be unreliable, with the exception of the Navy Reserve, for  the purposes of determining compliance with routine medical  examinations. DOD stated that its Individual Medical Readiness program\u2019s  data are being incorporated into overall unit readiness status reports,  providing visibility of reserve component medical readiness throughout  the line command structure. We believe that until top management at DOD  ensures that complete and reliable data on routine medical examinations  are being entered into its tracking systems, DOD and Congress will  continue to have a false picture of medical readiness for the reserve  components. We believe that our first recommendation still has merit.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that DOD take steps to enforce  the services\u2019 reporting requirement on the status of their members\u2019  physical fitness. DOD stated that DOD instruction 1308.3, dated November  5, 2002, among other things, requires the active and reserve components to  provide an annual report to the Principal Deputy of the OUSD/P&R not  later than March 31. DOD stated that the Air Force, the Navy, and the  Marine Corps have submitted their reports. DOD noted that exceptions to  the reporting requirement for the Air Force and the Army had been  approved. However, during our review we were told that none of the  reports had been submitted to the Principal Deputy as required. We raised  concerns in this report about the data reliability of the tracking systems  for physical fitness. We found that the reserve components are unable to  report complete and reliable data on compliance with routine physical  fitness examinations on a componentwide basis due to incomplete and  unreliable data. Just as we found with routine medical examinations, we  also found that DOD lacked quality assurance of the data on compliance  with physical fitness examinations in its tracking systems. We do not know  what data reliability issues DOD will cite in its annual reports on physical  fitness. We note that the responsible office for physical fitness oversight,  the Office of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation, does not participate in the  Joint Medical Readiness Oversight Committee that is directed to oversee  improvements in medical readiness, nor are we aware of any DOD plans to  include improvements in the oversight of physical fitness in its  comprehensive medical readiness plan. Therefore, we have expanded our  first recommendation to include routine physical fitness examinations in  the actions to be addressed.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that DOD oversee the  development of the reserve components\u2019 tracking systems to identify and  track members\u2019 temporary and permanent medical conditions that limit  deployability. DOD stated that it is already actively adapting existing  systems, and in some cases creating new ones, that can be used to track  the medical status of active and reserve members, to include those known  conditions that could limit an individual\u2019s deployability. DOD noted that it  continues to pursue better integration between medical and personnel  data systems to improve visibility regarding deployment-limiting medical  conditions, whether temporary or permanent, but the overall effectiveness  will continue to be limited by lack of access to civilian medical records of  reserve component members.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation that DOD modify the  medical predeployment form to better capture reasons for nondeployment  and medical referrals. DOD stated that the best sources of accurate  information about what medical reasons kept service members from  deploying are the permanent medical records. This may be the case, but  we continue to believe our recommendation has merit because DOD has  no way to systematically analyze the information to determine why  servicemembers are medically nondeployable. Because the predeployment  form is used to document whether a servicemember is deployable, this  existing form could be modified to better capture the reasons for  determining why a servicemember is determined nondeployable. Although  the form has an entry for a narrative explanation to state why a member is  medically nondeployable, AMSA officials informed us that these  explanations are often not decipherable, incomplete, and can not be easily  categorized. DOD also stated that the existing predeployment form already  includes a list of the most common referral categories to simplify the  documentation process for the health care provider. In addition, DOD also  noted that data from the forms are captured electronically and are readily  available to monitor for trends in referral patterns, among other things. We  do not believe that any meaningful analysis for referrals can be determined  from these forms because we found that the top medical referral category  for the reserve and active components was \u201cother\u201d. This heavy use of the  category \u201cother\u201d does not provide any insight as to what medical care a  member is receiving after being called to duty. Given that the rate of  medical referrals for the reserve components was almost 40 percent and  for the active components was almost 50 percent, we continue to believe  that DOD should modify the predeployment form to better capture reasons  for nondeployment and medical referrals.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that DOD determine  what preexisting medical conditions should be allowed into a specific  theater of operations, especially during the initial stages of operations, and  take steps to consistently utilize these criteria for determining medical  deployability. DOD stated that certain conditions clearly should render a  member nondeployable, and the services have made strides in defining  these conditions and incorporating them into their applicable policies and  procedures. But DOD also noted that due to the ever-changing nature of a  theater of operations and the inexact nature of medicine, a list of  nondeployable preexisting conditions will never be fully comprehensive or  fully enforceable. We agree that a list of nondeployable preexisting  medical conditions can never be fully comprehensive; however, we still  believe DOD could establish a list of what preexisting medical conditions  should be allowed into specific theaters of operations, especially during  the initial stages of operations, so that in future deployments DOD would  not experience situations such as those that occurred with members being  deployed into Iraq who clearly had preexisting conditions that should have  prevented their deployment.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that DOD explore using  existing tracking systems to track those who have treatable preexisting  medical conditions in theater. DOD noted that refinements to medical  tracking system are ongoing. We wish to note that before DOD\u2019s tracking  systems can be used to track those who have treatable preexisting medical  conditions in theater, DOD must determine what preexisting medical  conditions should be allowed into a specific theater of operations as called  for in our fifth recommendation.", "DOD noted in its overall comments that the reserve and active forces use  many of the same reporting tools within each service and face the same  basic challenges in ensuring data quality. DOD stated that where tracking  systems are shared, the reserve components depend on the active  components to develop and fund those systems, and that priority for  deployment of large systems has historically been given to the active  component. DOD also pointed out that our report indicates that the health  status of members deteriorates with multiple deployments and that the  data we used are self-reported and should be taken with great caution and  in the proper context. We used the self-reported data from  postdeployment health assessments to help demonstrate the importance  of good visibility over the reserve forces. We noted that the demand for  reserve personnel, especially within the Army components, continues, and  the pool of reserve members used to fill requirements is dwindling.  Further, the health status of returning reserve and guard members is not  as good as it was before deployment as our analysis of the pre- and  postdeployment health assessments showed. Therefore, it becomes even  more important that DOD have good visibility over the health status of  remaining reserve force to help determine what is left for future  deployments.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix II.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of  the Marine Corps; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the  Director, Office of Management and Budget.

We discussed  these statutes and guidance with senior officials in the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. We reviewed and  discussed service policies and regulations for medical and physical fitness  with military officials within the service surgeons\u2019 general offices and  other service headquarters\u2019 officials responsible for physical fitness in the  service personnel and operations functions. We also reviewed and  discussed reserve component policies and guidance for medical and  physical fitness examinations with officials within the reserve component  surgeons\u2019 general offices and other reserve component officials  responsible for physical fitness in the respective reserve component  personnel and operations functions. We interviewed cognizant officials  involved with policy development, administration, tracking, and reporting  on compliance with medical and physical fitness examinations from the  following offices or commands:  Office of the Secretary of Defense    Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Deployment Health    Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs; and    Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness,  the Office of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation.", "Assistant Secretary of the Army, Manpower and Reserve Affairs;    U.S. Army Office of the Surgeon General and Commanding General, Army    U.S. Army Reserve Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia;    National Guard Bureau;    Army National Guard;    First U.S. Army, Fort Gillem, Georgia;    U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia;    Army Fitness School, Ft.

We chose units that had deployed for  Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom. During these visits we  collected and analyzed information from available medical and personnel  files to assess the reserve component members\u2019 compliance with routine  medical and physical fitness examinations. We also documented  difficulties the units had in ensuring that all members complied with  medical and physical fitness examinations. Finally, during the site visits,  we conducted group discussions with unit members regarding their  experience with routine examination requirements.", "To gain a better understanding of how the components collect data about  their members\u2019 compliance with routine medical and dental examinations  and physical fitness assessments, we assessed the reliability of data  produced by several services\u2019 databases. Assessing the reliability of the  services\u2019 data included consideration of issues such as the completeness  and currency of the data from the respective database system\u2019s program  managers, administrators, and contractors; assurances that all members  are included and the information is up to date; and examination of who is  using the data and for what purposes, and the users\u2019 assessment of  reliability. We also examined whether the data tracked through the  services\u2019 systems was subjected to quality control measures, such as  conducting periodic testing of the data against medical records, to ensure  the accuracy and reliability of the data. In addition, we reviewed existing  documentation related to the data sources and interviewed knowledgeable  agency officials about the data. Overall, the reserve components\u2019 data we  assessed regarding compliance with routine medical and dental  examinations and fitness assessments did not accurately reflect the total  population of service members, had limited data quality assurance, and  were unreliable for the purposes of this report; however, we determined  that the Navy Reserve\u2019s medical data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. Data from the Navy Reserve\u2019s Medical Readiness Reporting  System were found reliable because Readiness Commands conduct  inspections that include examining the data for accuracy, Medical  Department Representatives verify 10 percent of the updated medical  records after each weekend drill, and the data are reported to the  Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command biweekly. Further, we did  not assess the reliability of the Marine Corps Reserve\u2019s medical data  because the Marine Corps was in the process of changing from the  Shipboard Automated Medical System, a stand-alone non-Web-based  system, to the Navy Reserve\u2019s system. All reserve components\u2019 physical  fitness data that we reviewed had missing or incomplete information, had  limited data quality controls, or did not accurately reflect the total  population of service members due to limited access to the database.  Therefore, we determined the data to be unreliable for the purposes of  assisting us in determining reserve component members\u2019 compliance with  physical fitness examinations.", "To assess DOD\u2019s visibility over reserve components\u2019 health status after  they are called to duty and the care, if any, provided to those deployed  with preexisting conditions, we collected and analyzed information from a  variety of sources throughout DOD. We interviewed officials at the six  reserve component headquarters and officials responsible for mobilizing  the reserve components. We also observed the mobilization of Army  National Guard and Army Reserve members at Fort Bliss, Texas, to obtain  information on their health status during this process. We obtained and  analyzed data provided on medical deployability from the DOD-wide  centralized database on pre- and postdeployment health assessments,  maintained at the Army Medical Surveillance Activity, and discussed  available data with these officials. We also obtained and analyzed data on  Army servicemembers who were held at mobilization stations for medical  reasons from the Army\u2019s medical holdover database (Medical Operational  Data System). Based on our review of databases we used, we determined  that the DOD-provided data were reliable for the purposes of this report.  To address the extent of medical care provided in theater for preexisting  medical conditions, we reviewed the Joint Chiefs of Staff procedures for  Deployment Health Surveillance and Readiness and information provided  by the U.S. Central Command Surgeon\u2019s General office regarding medical  deployment criteria for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.  We also collected and reviewed the services\u2019 medical instructions,  memoranda, policies, and medical data. We reviewed several databases for  relevance regarding collecting in theater medical data on preexisting  conditions. Specifically, we obtained information and discussed the  following databases: Joint Medical Workstation, the U.S. Transportation  Command Regulating Command and Control Evacuation System, the Joint  Patient Tracking Application, and the Air Force Institute for Operational  Health Disease Nonbattle Injury database.", "However, we did not identify any databases used to collect information on  members that may have had preexisting conditions when deployed.
