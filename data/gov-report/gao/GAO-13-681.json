This report answers the following questions: (1) What programs, activities, and resources does DHS have abroad to help combat terrorism? (2) How, if at all, has DHS contributed to U.S. missions and what, if any, factors have affected contributions? (3) To what extent has DHS aligned resource use abroad with strategic priorities?", "GAO analyzed DHS expenditures for fiscal years 2008-2012, personnel data for May 2013 and documents, such as national strategies and management directives. GAO also interviewed DHS and State officials in headquarters and 10 countries, selected on the basis of factors such as the size of DHS's presence. The results from site visits cannot be generalized but provided insights. GAO also surveyed DHS and State personnel in all 57 U.S. missions where DHS has a presence."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) carries out a variety of programs and activities abroad within its areas of expertise that could have the effect of thwarting terrorists and their plots while also combating other categories of transnational crime, and DHS expended approximately $451 million on programs and activities abroad in fiscal year 2012. For example, through the Visa Security Program, DHS has deployed personnel abroad to help prevent the issuance of visas to people who might pose a threat. As of May 2013, DHS has stationed about 1,800 employees in almost 80 countries to conduct these and other activities. In addition, DHS has delivered training and technical assistance in areas such as border and aviation security to officials from about 180 countries to enhance partner nations' security capacities.", "GAO identified five types of contributions DHS has made to U.S. missions (e.g., embassies and consulates), 12 factors that support DHS's ability to contribute, and a range of challenges and impacts related to DHS contributions. On the basis of surveys of DHS and State officials abroad, GAO found that DHS has significantly or moderately contributed to combating terrorism goals for each of the types of contributions GAO identified, including building relationships, identifying threats, and sharing information. The factors GAO identified that facilitated DHS's ability to contribute fell into two general categories: (1) facilitating a collaborative climate and (2) leveraging resources and clarifying roles and responsibilities. GAO also identified a variety of challenges, including DHS domestic management effectively coordinating with personnel abroad and partners at U.S. missions understanding of DHS's role. Fewer than half of respondents identified any challenge as moderate or significant. For impacts arising from these challenges, less than one-third of respondents identified them as causing a significant or moderate impact.", "DHS has taken actions to increase organizational and programmatic alignment, but has not established mechanisms to ensure that resource use abroad aligns with department-wide and government-wide strategic priorities. DHS has a stated objective to improve alignment across the department, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for agencies to implement mechanisms to help ensure achievement of their objectives. Although DHS conducted a onetime review of the department's international footprint and created a departmentwide international engagement plan, DHS has not established mechanisms to help ensure that decisions to deploy resources abroad--which are made at the individual component level--align with department-wide and government-wide strategic priorities. Specifically, DHS (1) has not established department-wide strategic priorities for international engagement, such as specific types of activities or target regions to further combating terrorism goals; (2) does not have a mechanism for monitoring alignment between resource deployment abroad and strategic priorities; and (3) does not have reliable, comparable cost data for its programs and activities abroad and has not established a standardized framework to capture these data. Strategic priorities, a mechanism to routinely monitor alignment between strategic priorities and resource deployment abroad, and reliable cost data could provide DHS with critical information to make informed resource deployment decisions and help achieve its objective to improve organizational alignment across components."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS establish (1) department-wide strategic priorities, (2) an institutionalized mechanism to review resource alignment abroad, and (3) a method to collect reliable and comparable cost data for resources abroad.

Therefore, U.S. missions are uniquely positioned to  provide leadership, resources, and knowledge to U.S. efforts to combat  terrorism, in collaboration with various other U.S. government agencies  working abroad, including DHS, as well as with foreign partners.", "One current priority of DHS leadership is better aligning its efforts across  the department with the aim of strengthening effectiveness, improving  decision making to address shared issues\u2014 such as managing  international affairs and combating terrorism \u2014and prioritizing resource  use in an era of fiscal constraint. In this context, you asked us to examine  DHS\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism abroad and how DHS\u2019s resource use  abroad aligns with other U.S. efforts, including those carried out by U.S.  missions. This report answers the following questions:  1.  What programs, activities, and resources does DHS have abroad to  help combat terrorism?  2.  How, if at all, has DHS contributed to U.S. missions\u2019 efforts to combat  terrorism, and what factors, if any, have facilitated or hampered those  contributions?  3.  To what extent has DHS taken action to align its resource use abroad  with departmental and government-wide strategic priorities?", "To address our questions, we reviewed key government-wide strategies  related to combating terrorism, including the May 2010 National Security  Strategy and the June 2011 National Strategy for Counterterrorism. We  reviewed documentation such as DHS\u2019s Quadrennial Homeland Security  Review (QHSR) and DHS component documentation describing goals,  objectives, and operations for DHS programs abroad. We also  interviewed officials with responsibility for programs and activities abroad  in DHS and component headquarters offices for the six operational  components that have missions related to combating terrorism\u2014U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Coast Guard  (USCG), and U.S. Secret Service (USSS). In addition, we interviewed  officials in DHS\u2019s Office of International Affairs (OIA) and DHS\u2019s Office of  Policy-Counterterrorism division, who have department-level  responsibilities for DHS\u2019s deployments abroad and counterterrorism  policy, respectively. We reviewed documentation about State programs  and activities on which DHS collaborates and interviewed officials in  Department of State Bureaus for Counterterrorism, Diplomatic Security,  and Consular Affairs, because DHS coordinates and collaborates with  them in its activities abroad. We also reviewed our prior work on specific  programs related to activities DHS carries out abroad, such as container  security, visa security, and foreign airport assessments. In addition, we  reviewed and discussed findings with the DHS Office of Inspector  General officials responsible for a 2008 report that made a number of  recommendations designed to enhance DHS\u2019s management of  international affairs.", "To address the first question, we first developed an operational definition  of combating terrorism, using information from government-wide strategy  documents and from interviews with DHS officials with responsibility for  programs abroad that have a nexus with counterterrorism and  antiterrorism efforts. We then identified the programs and activities DHS  carries out abroad that met that definition and verified the list of programs  and activities with officials in DHS OIA and the six operational  components in our review. Because many of DHS\u2019s missions involve  carrying out the same set of activities with multifaceted purposes\u2014such  as facilitating legitimate trade and travel while countering threats to the  homeland\u2014we determined it would not be possible to isolate  expenditures for combating terrorism-related activities abroad from other  DHS activities abroad. Instead, we collected from each component in our  review expenditures for all activities conducted abroad for fiscal years  2008 through 2012. We collected data on full-time-equivalent employees  (FTE) from DHS\u2019s Overseas Personnel and Activities Locator report for  May 2013, the most recent month available at the time of our work. We  reviewed the expenditure and FTE data provided for reasonableness and  discussed the actions taken to help ensure its reliability with  knowledgeable agency officials. We determined that the expenditure and  FTE data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting general  information about DHS expenditures abroad and the number of FTEs by  country for a specific point in time. We also collected, from each of the six  operational components in our review, information on training and  technical assistance activities. Because of challenges such as  inconsistent data definitions, we determined that there were not  sufficiently reliable and comparable data to allow us to report  expenditures specific to training and technical assistance abroad, but  information could be reported about the foreign nation whose officials  have received the training and technical assistance.", "To address the second question, we visited U.S. missions in 10 countries  where one or more DHS components had FTEs stationed. We selected  the locations based on a range of factors, including the nature and scope  of DHS presence abroad; indicators of terrorist activities; and logistical  concerns, such as security and the opportunity to leverage resources. At  these locations we conducted interviews with DHS officials and State  officials about the opportunities for and the quality of collaboration  between DHS and other federal partners. The results from our visits to  these 10 countries cannot be generalized; however, the interviews  provided insights into how DHS contributes to U.S. missions\u2019 combating  terrorism efforts, what is working well, and any barriers to effective  contributions.", "We conducted two surveys to collect information about the kinds of  contributions DHS has made to U.S. missions, the factors that were  important to facilitate DHS\u2019s contributions in the U.S. mission  environment, challenges DHS and the U.S. missions faced facilitating  DHS\u2019s contributions, and the impacts of any such challenges. We  administered one survey to all DHS attach\u00e9s and the other to all deputy  chiefs of mission (DCM) at all U.S. missions where DHS has permanently  stationed FTEs in the embassies\u201457 U.S. missions in total. The overall  response rate to the surveys was 82 percent for DHS attach\u00e9s and 72  percent for DCMs.", "To address the third question, we analyzed prescriptions in the February  2010 QHSR for maturing the department. These prescriptions include  improving organizational alignment\u2014particularly among operational  components\u2014and enhancing programmatic alignment to the homeland  security missions. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government calls for control activities\u2014that is, policies, procedures,  techniques, and mechanisms\u2014to enforce management\u2019s directives. this respect, we evaluated the extent to which DHS had control activities  to help achieve the goals of organizational and programmatic alignment  and efficient, effective management processes around its resource  deployment abroad. To do this, we reviewed documentation, such as  DHS\u2019s Management Directive describing roles and responsibilities for  DHS\u2019s international affairs. In addition, we interviewed officials in OIA and  the six DHS components in our review about the extent to which they  undertake efforts to facilitate programmatic and organizational alignment  across the set of resources and efforts DHS deploys abroad.

This official at this embassy noted that the action may seem  simple but was nevertheless a critical signal to all the federal personnel at  the embassy that the management valued collaborative action.", "Another related factor a majority of DHS attach\u00e9 and DCM respondents\u2014 33 of 47 and 34 of 40, respectively\u2014identified as very important is having  routine formal mechanisms for information sharing. One such mechanism  U.S. missions use to facilitate effective contribution of DHS skills and  expertise is law enforcement working groups focused on counterterrorism  or security issues. Working groups, which are routine, formal meetings of  diverse agency personnel with similar goals or functions, provide an  opportunity for parties carrying out ongoing activities to share information  and avoid conflicts. At two U.S. missions we visited, officials we  interviewed pointed to the working groups as an essential collaboration  mechanism.", "Our October 2005 work on practices to enhance and sustain interagency  collaboration called for agencies to address needs by leveraging  resources and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. Among the factors  we identified that relate to this is DHS\u2019s participation in developing U.S.  mission strategic goals, and 35 of 41 DCMs and 43 of 47 DHS attach\u00e9s  responded that the factor was very or moderately important in facilitating  DHS\u2019s contributions. With some exceptions, such as military activities,  federal activities abroad are conducted through the embassies under the  authority of the chief of mission. DHS receives funding from State for a  number of its training and technical assistance programs abroad, through  programs like the Regional Strategic Initiative and the Antiterrorism  Assistance program. For State, funding decisions are based in part on the  product of planning processes undertaken at each individual U.S.  mission. Therefore, the ability for DHS and State to share information  about both strategic and programming decisions, particularly through U.S.  mission planning processes, is an important element in DHS\u2019s ability to  make the maximum possible contribution to U.S. mission efforts.", "During our fieldwork we saw variation in the extent to and manner in  which U.S. mission management integrated DHS into planning  processes. In addition, open-ended comments on our survey reflected  some frustrations with DHS integration\u2014though these concerns did not  appear to be pervasive or systemic. We visited two missions where  officials expressed positive remarks about DHS\u2019s opportunities to  collaborate with its federal partners in the respective U.S. mission. In both  of these missions, the DCM stressed to us the importance of fully  integrating the DHS attach\u00e9 into U.S. mission strategic planning. At these  same two U.S. missions, the DHS attach\u00e9s said they make a focused  effort to ensure that the other federal partners understand the roles and  responsibilities of DHS and all of its components\u2014whether or not their  personnel are stationed at the embassy.", "At another U.S. mission we visited, the DCM told us that the DHS attach\u00e9  had an opportunity to participate in a strategic planning process and was  later able to comment on the final product. However, this DHS attach\u00e9  told us that he did not fully understand the purpose of the planning  meeting he attended nor did he believe he had been provided  encouragement or channels for further participation beyond the single  meeting. At this U.S. mission, DHS personnel reported frustrations about  limits on their ability to contribute, while U.S. mission management raised  questions about DHS\u2019s value to their mission. At another U.S. mission  with border security concerns, DHS officials said the embassy\u2019s border  working group had not been addressing DHS priorities or activities.  According to the DHS officials, the embassy was not encouraging a  \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach that recognizes the value of DHS  contributions.", "Although few DCMs and DHS attach\u00e9s reported that DHS does not  participate in helping to develop U.S. mission strategic goals, some  respondents discussed issues in open-ended comments with DHS\u2019s  integration and clarity of roles within U.S. missions. For example, in open- ended survey responses, one DCM said DHS personnel are individually  cooperative, but internal stove-piping limits DHS\u2019s ability to contribute.  Another DCM commented that DHS is organized and deployed in a  manner that limits its ability to bring its knowledge and skills to bear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Respondents Reported Facing Some Challenges, but Few Indicated Impacts Were Significant", "paragraphs": ["We identified 14 potential challenges that could hinder the contribution of  DHS knowledge and skills abroad to combating terrorism efforts.

For example, one DHS respondent stated  that DHS domestic management, through contact with foreign embassies  in the United States, has come into conflict with DHS operations in  country. A DCM respondent indicated that when issues arise, they often  originate from insufficient coordination with DHS domestic management,  with State, and with DHS in the field. Another DCM respondent indicated  that DHS domestic management regularly gets involved in international  affairs without informing DHS field office or embassy management. In  addition, a DCM respondent indicated that challenges come primarily  from the U.S. side (rather than DHS personnel at the embassy). In  addition, officials we spoke with mentioned that sometimes  miscommunication or misalignment between DHS domestic management  and embassies causes problems. For example, at one U.S. mission we  visited, the DCM and DHS personnel described an instance in which DHS  domestic operations took down a communication link used by  transnational criminals in the country without consulting anyone at the  embassy, including DHS personnel. However, DHS\u2019s law enforcement  partners were monitoring the link for more strategic purposes and the  action negatively affected their operation\u2014an outcome that DHS  personnel at the embassy could have alerted them to had they been  consulted.", "Some respondents elaborated about the extent to which the availability of  U.S. mission resources to sponsor programs that would call for  contributions of DHS knowledge and skills is a challenge. For example,  one DCM respondent indicated that the embassy is an old facility that is  not sized adequately to house all the federal agencies and space  restrictions affect the U.S. mission\u2019s ability to accommodate DHS\u2019s  presence. In addition, at two sites we visited, officials indicated that space  is scarce, especially given rapidly growing needs, so making room for  DHS staff, or any other federal stakeholder, is challenging and requires a  strong cost-benefit case. In addition, officials we spoke with mentioned  constrained or unpredictable budgets hampering planning and the ability  to dedicate resources to DHS programs or personnel. One DHS survey  respondent commented that with little to no budget, it is difficult to build  contacts with foreign partners, effectively communicate meeting  outcomes, and develop long term strategic plans.", "Some respondents elaborated about the extent to which U.S. mission  understanding of DHS\u2019s role is a challenge. For example, one DHS  respondent commented that in larger embassies the mission of  counterterrorism is focused on other agencies, and DHS sometimes does  not have the opportunity to discuss what it can offer. Another DHS  respondent indicated that other mission personnel do not understand  exactly the role of DHS and how it contributes to mission-related  objectives.", "We also surveyed DCMs and DHS attach\u00e9s about the extent to which the  challenges they have experienced have affected DHS\u2019s ability to  contribute\u2014for example, by creating conflicts, missed opportunities,  project delays, or unnecessary overlap.

DHS is tasked with a variety of responsibilities that are not  directly aimed at preventing terrorist attacks. In the course of efforts to  secure the homeland, some activities focus more broadly on transnational  crime such as narcotics and human smuggling, money laundering, and  immigration fraud that could be, in some cases, enablers for terrorist  networks.

In this way, it helps  ensure programmatic alignment to homeland security missions at a high  level. However, it does not establish specific priorities to help guide  resource decision making. For example, our analysis of DHS\u2019s  International Engagement Plan found that although there were goals  listed for each region, there was no ordering of priorities by region, by  source of terrorism, by function, or by goal (e.g., combating international  terrorism). Because the plan covers all mission activities described within  the QHSR without clear, specific priorities, it does not convey information  about what might be most important when deciding how to deploy scarce  resources.", "The lack of specific department-wide strategic priorities for resource use  abroad also creates limitations in DHS\u2019s ability to help ensure alignment  of its priorities and abilities with government-wide efforts. Officials in the  Office of Counterterrorism Policy and in OIA stated that DHS\u2019s highest  priority for resource use abroad is prevention of attacks on the homeland.  Focusing on preventing attacks on the homeland is consistent with the  National Security Strategy\u2019s and the National Strategy for  Counterterrorism\u2019s calls for the use of homeland security tools to promote  national security and counter terrorism. However, DHS\u2019s Office of  Counterterrorism Policy officials told us that because the regional plans  within DHS\u2019s International Engagement Plan covers all countries with  which DHS engages, from Canada to Afghanistan, the plan does not  represent a clear priority focus on countries with factors that represent  more immediate threats to the homeland. They noted that in their  engagement with the White House and other federal partners for  government-wide counterterrorism efforts, DHS\u2019s International  Engagement Plan\u2014because it covers all DHS missions, not just  counterterrorism\u2014does not help them demonstrate DHS\u2019s  counterterrorism priorities within its overall international engagement.", "According to OIA officials, the International Engagement Plan lays out in  one place for the first time all of DHS\u2019s international activities in an effort  to improve organizational and programmatic resource alignment.

They noted that  having a crosscutting view of all the activities and goals across the  international footprint is a significant step forward for the department.  They also said that more clarity on strategic priorities in future iterations  would help ensure better organizational and programmatic alignment, but  current priorities are largely determined independently by each  component, and the department has not established a routine and  crosscutting process for clarifying department-wide priorities.

(3)  To what extent has DHS taken action to align its resource use abroad  with departmental and government-wide strategic priorities?", "To define the scope of activities and resources to be included in this  performance audit, we reviewed and analyzed key government-wide  strategies related to combating terrorism\u2014the May 2010 National  Security Strategy and the July 2011 National Strategy for Combating  Terrorism. We also reviewed DHS documents designed to establish its  mission and goals such as the 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security  Review (QHSR), DHS\u2019s Strategic Plan FY2012-2016, and DHS\u2019s  Performance and Accountability Report 2011-2013.

In addition, we interviewed officials from the  Department of State\u2019s (State) Bureaus for Counterterrorism, Diplomatic  Security, and Consular Affairs about the nature and scope of their  coordination between their efforts and DHS efforts abroad, because these  bureaus have efforts that involved collaboration with DHS abroad. On the  basis of those document reviews and interviews, we determined that the  DHS operational components with mission activities most relevant for a  review of DHS efforts abroad to combat terrorism included U.S. Customs  and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S.  Coast Guard (USCG), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  (USCIS), and U.S. Secret Service (USSS).", "To identify the programs and activities that DHS has to help combat  terrorism abroad, on the basis of our interviews with the DHS components  and offices and the State bureau officials, we established a definition of  combating terrorism for the purposes of identifying and collecting data on  programs and activities: Any DHS program or activity that in the course of  its normal operation may have the effect of thwarting terrorists or their  plots whether designed solely and specifically for that purpose or not.  Using that definition and through reviews of our prior work and DHS  program documentation, we independently identified the list of programs  and activities that constitute DHS\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism abroad.  We then verified the list with DHS officials responsible for various  programs, refining it, as appropriate.", "To identify resources used abroad in support of these programs and  activities, we asked DHS to provide expenditure and related data. On the  basis of our interviews with OIA and budget officials from the six DHS  operational components in our review, we determined that because  DHS\u2019s missions involve carrying out activities for multifaceted purposes, it  would not be possible to isolate expenditures abroad for combating  terrorism from expenditures abroad to carry out other mission activities.  Therefore, we asked OIA and the six operational components in our  review to provide data separately on all expenditures abroad, as well as  data specific to training and technical assistance activities that met our  definition for combating terrorism, for fiscal years 2008 through 2012.", "For the 5 years of expenditure data, we checked for consistency and  reasonableness and discussed data reliability controls with OIA and each  component office that provided it to determine how the data were  collected and what controls were in place to help ensure its accuracy,  among other things. We found that because of the differences in missions  and methods for tracking expenditure data, the data sets provided by the  components had some variations in the elements included in the data  sets and limitations in the ability to isolate expenditures by country. In  these cases, we attempted to harmonize the data definitions across the  component data sets and worked with DHS component officials to agree  on methods for estimating expenditures by country. For example, the  individual country break-down of travel costs in USCIS\u2019s Refugee Affairs  Division was not consistently tracked separately by country, because the  program\u2019s activities commonly involved multicountry trips. To obtain travel  costs for this program, USCIS joined three different sets of data:  obligations, itineraries, and the central bill account for travel  reimbursements. In fiscal year 2012, there were approximately 500  international travel authorizations. Of these, about 400 were for a single  country. For the remaining multicountry itineraries, USCIS calculated  expenditures by country by using the number of days spent in each  country to calculate a percentage and divide the total itinerary cost. For  example, on a $10,000 trip visiting country A for 4 days and country B for  6 days, expenditures would be calculated as $4,000 in country A and  $6,000 in country B.", "We noted any remaining differences among component expenditure data  sets, as necessary (see also app. III). On the basis of our discussions  with knowledgeable DHS officials and the actions we took, we found that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing a general  estimate of expenditures abroad for fiscal years 2008 through 2012, with  the additional information provided. The full-time-equivalent employees  (FTE) stationed abroad are monitored at DHS through its Overseas  Personnel and Activities Locator, which is maintained by DHS Office of  Operations Coordination and Planning. The locator is updated monthly  with self-reported data from the components, which may capture some  personnel on travel duty in additional to permanently deployed FTEs. We  collected these data for May 2013, the most recent month for which DHS  was able to provide the data during the period of our study. On the basis  of discussions about the system and relevant control activities with the  responsible officials, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting FTEs abroad during the specified  month in which they were collected.", "For the data we gathered on training and technical assistance activities  for fiscal years 2008 through 2012, we attempted to obtain the number of  personnel and expenditures dedicated to staff who conducted training  and technical assistance on a temporary basis, but some components  were unable to provide data for multiple fiscal years, and we encountered  numerous challenges, such as inconsistent data definitions and lack of  confidence by DHS officials in the accuracy or completeness of the data.  As a result, we did not include this information in our report. However, we  determined that information the six DHS operational components in our  review were able to provide was sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  reporting the foreign nation whose officials received DHS-delivered  training and technical assistance. We made this determination on the  basis of checks for reasonableness and discussions with responsible  DHS officials about the steps taken to help ensure accuracy of the data.", "To examine how DHS has contributed to U.S. missions\u2019 efforts to combat  terrorism and the factors that have facilitated or hampered those  contributions, we reviewed documentation about DHS\u2019s component  activities abroad and State programs and activities on which DHS  collaborates. We also relied on our interviews with agency officials and  web-based surveys of deputy chiefs of mission (DCM) and DHS attach\u00e9s  in U.S. missions where DHS components were stationed in the embassy.

On  the basis of advice from State and DHS personnel at each U.S. mission,  as well as availability and relevance, we also interviewed some officials  from the Departments of Defense and Justice that may collaborate with  DHS abroad. We conducted a total of 70 interviews. During these  interviews, we asked questions and gathered specific examples of how  DHS works abroad with federal partners under the authority of the chief of  mission to help support government-wide efforts to combat terrorism.", "To provide balance and diversity, we selected the 10 U.S. mission sites  based on a range of factors, including  the nature and scope of DHS\u2019s presence abroad\u2014for example, the  number of components represented and the size of the overall DHS  deployment;  indicators of terrorism risk\u2014specifically we considered (1) inclusion in  CBP\u2019s Aliens from Special Interest Countries, (2) State\u2019s country  reports on terrorism, (3) designation as a terrorist safe haven, and (4)  advice from DHS and State subject matter experts;  safety, security, and related logistical concerns\u2014based on State  advice; and the opportunity to leverage resources.", "We visited Mexico City, Mexico; Panama City, Panama; Buenos Aries,  Argentina; Manila, the Philippines; Tokyo, Japan; Jakarta, Indonesia;  Singapore; Amman, Jordan; Kabul, Afghanistan; and Abu Dhabi and  Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The results from our visits to these 10  countries cannot be generalized; however, the visits provided insights on  how DHS contributes to U.S. mission combating terrorism efforts, what is  working well, and any barriers to effective contribution.", "We analyzed the responses to our interviews about the nature and scope  of DHS activities abroad and DHS counterterrorism activities with State  and DHS officials at headquarters and with federal officials in the first 3 of  the 10 site visits, to identify types of knowledge and skill contributions  DHS has made to U.S. missions and any challenges and impacts DHS  and its federal partners have encountered. We also relied on this set of  interviews to identify factors that helped to facilitate DHS contributions in  the U.S. mission environment. Because a U.S. mission is an inherently  interagency environment, in addition to the interview responses, we  considered the practices and considerations for promoting effective  interagency collaboration outlined in two prior GAO reports when  identifying factors that facilitate DHS\u2019s ability to contribute its knowledge  and skills.", "We used this analysis to develop two web-based surveys to be  administered to all DCMs and DHS attach\u00e9s in U.S. missions where one  or more DHS components had FTEs stationed in the embassy. We  identified all DCMs and DHS attach\u00e9s meeting this definition from lists  provided to us by State for DCMs and DHS OIA for DHS attach\u00e9s. Our  final survey populations included DCMs and DHS attach\u00e9s in 57 U.S.  missions. We selected DCMs to provide a perspective from State  because the DCM supervises department heads within the U.S. mission  and handles many issues pertaining to the day-to-day operation of the  mission. We selected DHS attach\u00e9s to provide a perspective from DHS  because these officials act as the in-country representatives for DHS.", "We conducted survey pretests with five DHS attach\u00e9s and three DCMs, a  mix of officials with whom we had already met and with whom we had  never discussed the purpose of our evaluation. During the pretests, we  worked with the respondents to ensure the clarity and appropriateness of  the language and questions in the survey. We also discussed with  respondents the comprehensiveness of the lists we had developed\u2014DHS  contributions, facilitation factors, challenges, and impacts. On the basis of  pretest feedback, we further refined our analysis of these items. In  addition, to provide further assurance that our analysis was  comprehensive in identifying DHS contributions, facilitation factors,  challenges, and impacts, we included in our survey questionnaires open- ended questions that allowed respondents to provide additional  information about these items.", "We administered the surveys between April 16, and July 19, 2013, to  DCMs and DHS attach\u00e9s in the 57 U.S. missions. We sent follow-up e- mail messages on April 24, 2013, May 1, 2013, and May 13, 2013, to  those who had not yet completed the survey. Overall, we received  responses from 41 DCMs and 47 DHS attach\u00e9s, yielding a response rate  of 72 percent and 82 percent, respectively. We ran comparative tests on  the responses for factors, challenges, and impacts on the responses  provided by DCMs and DHS attach\u00e9s, and found no significant  differences between the two groups. Additionally, in the survey we asked  both groups to identify which facilitation factors were important, and in  separate questions asked them to identify which were in place and  operating effectively. We checked the responses for the factors most  frequently identified as important against the factors in place and  operating effectively and found no meaningful systematic trends  indicating that any single factor was not in place across the embassies we  surveyed.", "Because this was not a sample survey, it has no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example,  difficulties in interpreting a particular question, sources of information  available to respondents, or entering data into a database or analyzing  them can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took  steps in developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing  them to minimize such nonsampling errors. In addition to pretesting our  survey questionnaires as already mentioned, we worked with our social  science survey specialists to design the questionnaire, and the  questionnaires went through internal reviews with independent survey  experts. When we analyzed the data, an independent analyst checked all  computer programs. Since this was a web-based questionnaire,  respondents entered their answers directly into the electronic  questionnaire, eliminating the need to key data into a database,  minimizing error. See appendix IV for survey results for contributions,  challenges, and impacts.", "To evaluate the extent to which DHS has taken action to align its  resource use abroad with departmental and government-wide strategic  priorities, we analyzed DHS\u2019s QHSR, in particular its prescriptions for  maturing the department. These prescriptions include improving  organizational alignment\u2014particularly among operational components\u2014 enhanced programmatic alignment to the homeland security missions,  and more efficient and effective management processes, including  strategic planning, performance management, and accounting structure.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for control  activities\u2014that is policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms\u2014to  enforce management\u2019s directives. In this respect, we evaluated the  extent to which DHS had control activities in place to help achieve the  goals of organizational and programmatic alignment and efficient,  effective management processes around its resource deployment abroad.  To evaluate the extent to which DHS had mechanisms in place designed  to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its stated goal of  department-wide organizational and programmatic alignment in the  allocation and deployment of resources abroad, we reviewed  documentation such as DHS\u2019s Management Directive that describes roles  and responsibility for managing international affairs. We also interviewed  officials in OIA, the six DHS components in our review, and DHS\u2019s Office  of Policy about how decisions to deploy resources abroad are made and  the extent to which they undertake efforts to facilitate programmatic and  organizational alignment across the complete set of resources and efforts  DHS deploys abroad. We also interviewed officials in the Office of  Counterterrorism Policy within DHS\u2019s Office of Policy about how DHS and  government-wide counterterrorism goals inform resource use decisions.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 to September  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
