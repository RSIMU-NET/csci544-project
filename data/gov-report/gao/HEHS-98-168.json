The TANF block grant replaced the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which in 1996 made more than $20 billion in benefit payments to a monthly caseload of about 4.6 million families. Before this welfare reform legislation, 14 states had adopted time-limited welfare programs under federally approved waivers. The increased emphasis on the temporary nature of assistance makes child support, along with employment, a more important means for families receiving aid to become self-sufficient or to support themselves once they reach their time limits. Historically, however, the state-operated, federally supervised child support enforcement program has never been able to obtain collections on more than about 13 percent of its AFDC child support cases. As a result, there is a great deal of interest in the extent to which the child support program can ensure that all families receive child support before and after their cash welfare benefits are terminated.", "This report responds to your request for information on how successful states are likely to be in obtaining child support for families whose benefits are subject to time limits. Specifically, it addresses how successful states that experimented with time-limited benefits before welfare reform have been in obtaining child support for families who reach their limits; how successful states have been in obtaining child support for families within a 5-year period, the maximum time a family may receive TANF benefits; and the implications time limits have for states and families.", "To determine how successful states were in obtaining child support for families reaching time limits for welfare benefits under state waivers, we analyzed child support outcomes for families terminated from welfare in Connecticut, Florida, and Virginia, the first states to enforce time limits. These states\u2019 time limits were 21 months, 2 or 3 years, and 2 years, respectively. To ascertain how successful states had been in obtaining child support for families within a 5-year period, we analyzed child support outcomes on a set of new AFDC child support cases that began in 1992 and remained open for 5 years in two states selected because of their high performance in providing child support services\u2014Minnesota and Washington. Finally, to assess the implications of time limits for families and states, we analyzed the results from the two sets of states and discussed the results with officials from the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the states we reviewed. Although we did not verify the accuracy of the states\u2019 databases, the automated case files are considered the official state case files. We conducted our work between April 1997 and February 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The program\u2019s original purpose was to strengthen state and local efforts for obtaining child support for families receiving AFDC and for any non-AFDC individuals who apply for child support services. The program provides a broad range of services, including basic services such as locating the noncustodial parent or parents, establishing paternity through genetic tests or other means, establishing support orders obligating noncustodial parents to pay specific amounts, and collecting the payment of support owed. While the ultimate goal under the program is to collect child support for each case, any one case may need a different combination of basic services before collections can begin. To illustrate these different combinations of needed services, figure 1 gives a breakdown of the services Virginia\u2019s child support cases needed when time limits began. For example, at the beginning of the 2-year time limit, 4 percent of the custodial parents already had a support order in place but the noncustodial parents needed to be located and their support orders needed to be enforced through wage-withholding or other means. Appendix II describes the basic child support enforcement services.", "Child support enforcement is a joint federal and state responsibility. Within the federal government, OCSE is responsible for providing leadership, technical assistance, and standards for effective state programs. States or local offices under state supervision deliver child support services to families. The federal government and the states share administrative costs at the rate of 66 percent and 34 percent, respectively. In fiscal year 1996, administrative costs for the program were $3 billion and collections totaled $12 billion. About 13 percent of the 7.4 million AFDC child support cases and 28 percent of 9.3 million non-AFDC child support cases nationwide received at least one support payment in 1996.", "The new welfare reform law significantly changed our nation\u2019s welfare policy. Since 1935, AFDC had entitled single-parent families to receive monthly cash assistance generally for as long as they met income and other eligibility criteria and had children under age 18. TANF represents a significant departure from this approach, placing a 5-year limit on federal aid designed to ensure that assistance is temporary for most recipients.Before the welfare reform law passed, however, 14 states were granted waivers under section 1115 of the Social Security Act allowing them to experiment with assistance time limits ranging from 18 months to 5 years.Although state policies regarding exemptions and extensions varied, these state waivers were the first efforts to make assistance temporary based solely on a specified period of time. Table 1 summarizes some provisions of the time-limited programs adopted in the three states we reviewed.", "The Congress also wanted to encourage parental responsibility by requiring OCSE and the states to strengthen the existing child support enforcement program by adopting new enforcement tools. These tools include federal and state registries of child support orders, federal and state directories of new employee hires, and state reporting of quarterly wage reports to help locate noncustodial parents and enforce support orders. As all states move to implement these tools, many states are also working to complete the statewide automated systems required by federal law. From fiscal year 1981 through fiscal year 1997, the states have spent about $3.2 billion in federal and state funds to develop these systems to manage their caseloads. However, as of March 30, 1998, only 25 of the 54 child support enforcement systems had been certified by HHS.", "In addition, the welfare reform legislation established new custodial parent cooperation requirements and penalties to strengthen existing requirements and to simplify the paternity establishment process. The law also included additional tools such as the matching of data with states\u2019 financial institutions and the revocation of noncustodial parents\u2019 driver\u2019s, professional and occupational, and recreational licenses to enforce the payment of child support.

At these wage levels, many working families\u2019 earnings are near or below the federal poverty level. Although these families\u2019 incomes may be increased through the earned income tax credit and they may benefit from receiving other aid, including food stamps and medical assistance, they also may incur significant work-related expenses. For such families, child support payments could further enhance family incomes or reduce their need for public assistance. A study released in 1993 focusing on divorced women in Wisconsin found that receiving even minor amounts of child support can play a significant role in keeping families self-sufficient. However, for those families without earnings, child support is unlikely to replace families\u2019 lost cash assistance.

In addition, they expected the new custodial parent cooperation requirements to result in more accurate and more complete noncustodial parent information at welfare intake, which should help them locate noncustodial parents.", "However, officials in Connecticut, Florida, and Virginia also said they were challenged by rising caseloads and resource limitations.
