Older park units have the most deferred maintenance, with $10.5 billion in fiscal year 2015 in park units established more than 40 years ago.", "The Park Service uses several tools to determine an asset's importance and condition and assign maintenance priority. Park unit staff assess the condition of the asset and identify maintenance projects. Once identified, park unit staff use the agency's Capital Investment Strategy to evaluate and rank projects. Projects score higher if they target critical assets with deferred maintenance. Fiscal year 2015 was the first budget year in which projects ranked using the strategy were funded, and regional and park unit officials said that it is too soon to determine if the strategy is meeting its objectives, such as maintaining the condition of its most important assets. However, the Park Service does not have a plan or timeframe for evaluating whether the strategy has been successful. A senior official said that the agency has not determined what is needed to begin such an evaluation and that it would be beneficial to verify that the Capital Investment Strategy is achieving intended outcomes. According to the National Academies Federal Facilities Council, it is important that agencies track the outcome of investments to improve decision making and asset management.

We obtained information about how park unit staff make  asset maintenance decisions and about actions they use to help address  deferred maintenance needs by using a semistructured interview at visits  to 3 park units and through telephone interviews with officials at 18 other  park units. In selecting these 21 park units, we included a park unit in  each of the seven Park Service regions that (1) had the greatest amount  of deferred maintenance, (2) was identified by regional officials as taking  actions to address maintenance needs, and (3) reflected a smaller  amount of deferred maintenance.

Maintenance can range from work needed for visible assets, such as  buildings, roads, and trails, to less visible needs, such a water and  sewage systems.

Park unit staff  calculate the current replacement value of an asset using the Park  Service\u2019s current replacement value calculator. According to Department  of the Interior policy, current replacement value is defined as the  standard industry cost and engineering estimate of materials, supplies,  and labor required to replace an asset at its existing size and functional  capability, and to meet applicable regulatory codes.", "The Park Service\u2019s use of FCI as part of its process for making asset  maintenance decisions is consistent with the Federal Real Property  Council\u2019s Guidance for Real Property Inventory Reporting, which  identified this type of condition index as a performance measure. In  addition, in 2005, the National Academies Federal Facilities Council found  that many agencies use FCI to measure the current condition of assets to  assess how much work, if any, is recommended to maintain or change  their condition to acceptable levels to support organizational missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Optimizer Bands", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service uses the ratio of an asset\u2019s API and FCI to assign the  asset to an optimizer band, which is used to determine the priority level  for maintenance. The agency began using optimizer bands in 2012 to  help determine which projects would obtain project funds and ensure that  limited funds are allocated to the most important assets.", "According to Park Service guidance, optimizer bands act as a triage  framework for allocating limited funds. For example, optimizer band 1  assets are the highest-priority assets. The agency defines them as critical  to the operations and mission of a park unit or as having high visitor use.  They are to be considered first for funding to keep them in good condition.  In contrast, optimizer band 5 assets are the lowest-priority assets. The  agency does not need them for the operations and mission of the park,  and many of these assets may be candidates for disposal. To ensure that  the highest-priority assets are maintained to the greatest extent possible,  the Park Service established minimum levels of funding park units are to  allocate for preventive maintenance. Specifically, park units are to use  funds from the operations budget category to address a minimum of 55  percent of the preventive maintenance work needed to maintain optimizer  band 1 assets in good condition. The minimum levels of funding for  optimizer bands 2 and 3 are 50 and 25 percent, respectively, and there  are no minimum levels of funding for bands 4 and 5.", "Park unit staff have some flexibility in assigning assets to optimizer  bands. Park Service officials said that park units may reassign an asset to  a different optimizer band, but that these changes are to be approved by  regional officials. Officials we interviewed at some of the park units said  that they had changed optimizer bands for some assets. For example,  one park unit changed the optimizer band of the building where park unit  staff work from optimizer band 3 to optimizer band 2. Officials at this park  unit said that the building is vital to the park because it is the only building  space in or near the park that staff can use to perform the administrative  duties required for managing a park unit, including maintaining FMSS.  However, the building had been assigned to optimizer band 3 because it  has no visitor use, which meant that the asset was not a priority for  maintenance funding and therefore difficult to keep in acceptable  condition. Officials at other park units identified reasons to change the  optimizer band levels. For example, officials at two park units noted that  the quality of housing can be poor because of low maintenance priority,  which can affect both the ability of staff to do their jobs well and the visitor  experience. According to Park Service officials, housing can also  deteriorate past the point of acceptable living conditions, at which point  park units would no longer be able to use those assets to house  employees.", "Park unit staff report asset optimizer bands, as well as API and FCI, in  their Park Asset Management Plans. Many of the park unit officials we  interviewed said that they had most recently established these values for  their assets within the last 7 years, often as part of updating the park  unit\u2019s Park Asset Management Plan. According to Park Service asset  management guidance, a Park Asset Management Plan is a strategic and  operational plan that park units are to develop to articulate how the park  unit intends to manage its asset portfolio over a 10-year period based on  the analysis of asset data. Park Service officials said that park units use  them to assess all of their assets and determine the amount of funds  needed to maintain assets in good condition.", "The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2015 Capital Planning Guide  does not use the term optimizer band but notes that graphical  representations of a distribution of assets graphed by their importance to  mission and their condition can be a useful tool in segmenting and  presenting asset portfolios. Specifically, by plotting an asset according to  API and FCI, an agency can determine when an asset no longer supports  the mission of the site or bureau or is a candidate for disposal because it  has a low API and high FCI."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Park Unit Staff Conduct Periodic Assessments to Identify Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service\u2019s asset management plan instructs park units to  determine the condition of park assets through annual condition  assessments\u2014high-level inspections that identify obvious and apparent  deficiencies\u2014and comprehensive condition assessments\u2014more detailed  assessments of assets performed every 5 years. The plan also instructs  park unit staff to record condition assessment information in FMSS and  update the projected cost of repairs of the asset.", "Officials we interviewed at several of the park units said that for annual  assessments staff regularly visually inspect assets during the normal  course of business, such as opening buildings for seasonal use or  performing maintenance on nearby assets. Some officials also said that  comprehensive assessments are either performed by park unit staff with  expertise or contractors. For example, a regional official said that park  units in the region hired contractors to inspect sewer lines as part of a  comprehensive assessment, since they do not have in-house expertise to  do so. The Park Service provides guidance to park unit staff on how to  perform comprehensive assessments for each of the asset categories.  Officials we interviewed at several park units said that they organize  comprehensive condition assessments to account for 20 percent of park  assets annually, so that they can complete a comprehensive condition  assessment for all park assets within a 5-year period.", "Officials we interviewed at more than half of the park units said that they  were unable to complete annual or comprehensive assessments of all  assets on schedule because of other duties or scheduling challenges.  Specifically, staff who are to conduct the assessments perform other  duties, such as overseeing asset maintenance and entering and  maintaining asset data in FMSS. Park unit officials also said that Park  Service headquarters makes frequent data requests\u2014for example, for  electric utility metering data, or for verification of square footage values in  FMSS\u2014and that these data requests can interfere with park unit staff\u2019s  ability to complete tasks, including condition assessments, on time. In  addition, some park units are located remotely or in challenging climates,  making it difficult to inspect all assets on the recommended schedule. For  example, officials we interviewed at three park units said that they had to  hike or fly to certain assets because they are located remotely or the  assets are inaccessible in the winter because of snow; however, winter  might be the only time the park unit had staff available to conduct  assessments.", "For Park Service paved roads and bridges, the Department of  Transportation conducts condition assessments for the Park Service.  According to Department of Transportation officials, they typically  conducts condition assessments of major paved roads\u2014thoroughfares in  large parks with more than 10 miles of roadway\u2014within each park unit  once every 5 years and of secondary paved roads once every 10 years.  In addition, the department conducts condition assessments of all bridges  within each park unit once every 2 years in accordance with National  Bridge Inspection Standards. Specifically, a team of six to eight  Department of Transportation staff, working in teams of two, drive a  vehicle with special equipment that can assess the condition of the  pavement along park roads. Department of Transportation officials  estimate that these teams have assessed about 5,900 road miles in the  last 4 years; by comparison, the Park Service has 5,500 miles of paved  roads. Once a road is assessed, the Department of Transportation  provides the condition data to relevant park unit staff who enter the data  into FMSS and determine if a work order is needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Park Unit Staff Combine Work Orders to Generate Projects and Identify Fund Sources", "paragraphs": ["Based upon the condition assessments, Park Unit staff create one or  more work orders in FMSS that document an asset\u2019s deficiencies. They,  in turn, combine work orders to generate projects to conduct the  maintenance work needed to address identified deficiencies. Specifically,  according to Park Service officials, staff bundle a series of work orders to  address multiple deficiencies\u2014such as replace a door, paint a wall, or fix  the roof\u2014in one building as part of the same project. Work orders  generally contain a basic description of the work needed and an estimate  of the material and labor costs, among other things. Park units submit  these maintenance projects annually to the regional offices as part of an  agency-wide call for projects, which marks the beginning of the Park  Service\u2019s budget formulation cycle. Park Service headquarters officials  provide guidance to help park units to identify which fund sources can be  used for a project, among other things. The staff may also choose to  address a deficiency directly, using the park unit\u2019s facility operations  funds rather than applying for project funds. Some park unit officials we  interviewed said that they typically do this for maintenance work that is  routine in nature, such as grounds keeping.", "The Park Service\u2019s most recent agency-wide call for projects was for  projects to be funded in fiscal year 2019, and it directed park units and  regional offices to have projects ready for review by headquarters by April  3, 2017. As part of doing this, park unit staff identify which of the Park  Service\u2019s fund sources would be appropriate to use for the various  maintenance projects. To identify the appropriate fund source, park unit  staff use information about the nature of the maintenance work needed as  identified in the project\u2019s work orders, as well as the annual fund source  guidance that the Park Service provides. The guidance for each fund  source includes questions about the projects to help determine if the  project is eligible for a particular fund source. For example, to obtain  cyclic funds for a project, fund source guidance has directed park unit  staff to explain how the project supports or extends the life cycle of the  asset or how funding the project will positively affect visitor health and  safety, among other things. Park unit staff also enter projects into the  agency\u2019s Project Management Information System.

Agency officials  stated that the Capital Investment Strategy was created to help ensure  that park units do not allow assets to fall into a severe state of disrepair  before repairing them. According to the Park Service\u2019s Capital Investment  Strategy Guidebook, the strategy is designed to promote several of the  agency\u2019s mission goals, including the repair and improvement of assets  that parks commit to maintain in good condition and the disposition of  nonessential facilities to reduce deferred maintenance. In addition, one of  the strategy\u2019s objectives is to enable the Park Service to demonstrate to  Congress and others that the agency optimizes taxpayer dollars to  preserve high-priority assets. To meet this objective, the Capital  Investment Strategy uses a formula based on asset information to score  projects and gives preference to projects that address assets in optimizer  bands 1 or 2.", "As part of the agency-wide call for projects, park unit staff use the Capital  Investment Strategy to score projects that will be funded by the cyclic  maintenance, repair and rehabilitation, line item construction, Federal  Lands Transportation Program, and recreation fees fund sources in the  Project Management Information System. The formula used in the Capital  Investment Strategy scores projects from 1 to 1,000 by, in part,  individually evaluating each work order in a project according to FMSS  data in four elements: financial sustainability, resource protection, visitor  use, and health and safety. For example, the visitor use element  considers investment in assets that directly enable outdoor recreation as  well as interpretive media. The most points within this element are  awarded to those projects that improve and sustain the experience of the  greatest number of visitors. Projects are scored higher if they target  optimizer band 1 or 2 assets for deferred maintenance reduction and  optimizer band 5 assets for disposition.", "Park Service officials, either at the regional office or headquarters, review  and approve projects for funding based on the fund source guidance  provided as part of the agency-wide call for projects. For all fund sources  except for line item construction, Park Service regional officials determine  which maintenance projects are to receive funding by convening expert  panels, which review the scored projects provided by the park units in  their regions. For maintenance projects associated with the repair and  rehabilitation fund source that are estimated to cost less than $1 million,  the Park Service convenes a nationwide panel of experts to determine  which will be funded. For line item construction projects estimated at  more than $1 million, Park Service headquarters staff review and select  which projects will receive funding. The Park Service identifies the line  item construction projects the agency wants to fund by name, description,  estimated cost, and project score in its annual budget justification  submission to Congress.", "Fiscal year 2015 was the first budget year in which projects ranked using  the strategy were funded, and as such some regional and park unit  officials said that it is too soon to determine if the Capital Investment  Strategy is meeting its objectives, such as maintaining the condition of its  high-priority assets. Officials we interviewed at more than half of the park  units said that the Capital Investment Strategy so far has helped them  identify their park units\u2019 most important maintenance needs. However,  several regional and park unit officials said that the Capital Investment  Strategy\u2019s focus on optimizer band 1 and 2 assets could result in  continued deterioration of assets in other optimizer bands, leading to  increased deferred maintenance.", "The Park Service does not have a plan or time frame for evaluating  whether the strategy has been successful. A senior official said that the  agency had not determined what is needed to begin such an evaluation  and that it would be beneficial to verify that the Capital Investment  Strategy is achieving intended outcomes and if changes need to be  made. According to the National Academies Federal Facilities Council,  investments made in assets are not often immediately visible or  measurable but are manifest over a period of years, and it is important  that agencies track the outcomes of those investments to improve  decision making about those investments and to improve asset  management. Moreover, according to the council, to understand the  outcomes of facilities investments, federal agencies need to establish  facilities asset management performance goals that have a time frame for  attainment, among other things. By evaluating the Capital Investment  Strategy and its results after it has been in place for a few years, the Park  Service may be able to determine if the strategy is achieving its intended  outcomes or if changes need to be made.

These  actions include the following:", "Using philanthropic donations. The Park Service receives  donations from several philanthropic sources to enhance park assets  and, in some cases, address maintenance needs. For example, the  National Park Foundation intends to raise up to $350 million to  support the Park Service as part of its Centennial Campaign for  America\u2019s National Parks. The foundation reported in February 2016  that it had raised about $200 million toward this goal. Some of these  funds are to be used to address asset maintenance, such as repairing  trails at Jenny Lake in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming and  rehabilitating Constitution Gardens, part of the National Mall, in  Washington, D.C. Stemming from the National Park Foundation\u2019s  efforts, in July of 2014 the Park Service announced a donation of  about $12 million to restore and improve access to Arlington House,  the Robert E. Lee Memorial, which is located in Arlington National  Cemetery. In addition, philanthropic funds are available through the  Centennial Challenge program. From fiscal years 2015 through  2016, Congress appropriated $25 million for this program. For  projects funded by this program, at least 50 percent of the costs must  come from nonfederal donations. According to Park Service  documents, the agency has selected more than 150 projects to be  funded by the program, which as of October 20, 2016, had received  more than $45 million in matching funds from philanthropic donors.  Some of the projects are to directly address deferred maintenance,  such as a project at the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National  Historical Park that will rehabilitate the Conococheague Aqueduct in  Maryland.", "Working with volunteers. Volunteer groups are providing assistance  to several parks to help address asset maintenance needs. For  example, at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, in North  Carolina and Tennessee, a local volunteer group maintains several of  the park\u2019s trails. Park unit officials said this arrangement has reduced  the deferred maintenance for the park\u2019s trails by about $1 million since  2009. Officials at some of park units we interviewed said volunteer  groups perform a variety of maintenance duties that help address  deferred maintenance, including grounds and facilities cleanup,  clearing roadways of vegetation, and campground maintenance.", "Leasing properties. Several park units are leasing assets to other  parties in exchange for the lessee rehabilitating or maintaining the  assets. According to Park Service documents, all net income from  such leases is to be reinvested to fund historic preservation, capital  improvements of historic properties, park infrastructure, or any  deferred maintenance needs. For example, the Park Service leases  several buildings at the Golden Gate National Recreational Area in  San Francisco. The Park Service also leases several historic  buildings at Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas. Park unit officials  said that the buildings at Hot Springs were in serious disrepair prior to  being leased. The officials said that the lessees are to repair and  rehabilitate the structures in lieu of rent for the first several years of  their lease terms, thereby reducing the park\u2019s deferred maintenance.  Officials at some of the park units we interviewed said that they were  considering implementing leasing programs, in part, to help reduce  their deferred maintenance. To help facilitate leasing, the Park  Service hired a national leasing manager in 2015 to formalize its  leasing program, and some parks units and regions have developed  active leasing programs.", "Engaging partners. The Park Service is engaged in partnerships  where outside organizations are assuming some asset maintenance  responsibilities. For example, the Park Service entered into a  partnership with a nonprofit organization to operate and maintain the  visitor center associated with Independence National Historical Park  in Philadelphia. In this case, the Park Service owns the visitor center  and contributes funds\u2014about $800,000 annually\u2014to cover some of  its basic operating costs, but the nonprofit organization covers the  majority of the facility\u2019s operating and maintenance costs. Park unit  officials said that the 30-year agreement with the nonprofit  organization provides the park with a modern visitor center that  maintenance staff do not have to physically maintain, and provides a  location where rangers can be stationed to answer questions about  the park.", "Entering into other arrangements. The Park Service is taking steps  to reduce, or in some cases eliminate, the need to allocate  maintenance funds to some park assets by entering into  arrangements with other entities to manage those assets. For  example, officials at two of the park units we interviewed said that  they had turned over the some of their campgrounds to concessioners  to operate and maintain.", "Partnering with states for transportation grants. The Park Service  has worked with states to submit joint applications for a variety of  Department of Transportation grants. For example, the Park Service,  jointly with the District of Columbia\u2019s Department of Transportation,  received a $90 million grant from the Department of Transportation\u2019s  Fostering Advancements in Shipping and Transportation for the Long- Term Achievement of National Efficiencies (or FASTLANE) grant  program to rehabilitate the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which links the  District of Columbia to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. In  addition, the Tennessee Department of Transportation received a $10  million Department of Transportation grant\u2014Transportation  Investment Generating Economic Recovery (or TIGER) grant\u2014to  complete a section of the Foothills Parkway that runs through Great  Smoky Mountains National Park, in North Carolina and Tennessee.  The Park Service contributed an additional $10 million and the state  contributed an additional $15 million in funds toward the $35 million  project.", "Park Service officials said that these actions have helped address  deferred maintenance at some park units, but that not all of these  activities are well-suited to all park units or all maintenance needs.

According to the Park Service, deferred maintenance data from the end of  fiscal year 2015 were the most current data available when we began this  review. We analyzed the data to determine the amount of funds the Park  Service had allocated in each year to the eight fund sources the agency  uses for maintenance work: cyclic maintenance, repair and rehabilitation,  facility operations, line item construction, recreation fees for routine  maintenance, recreation fees for capital improvements, recreation fees for  deferred maintenance, and Federal Lands Transportation Program. We  assessed the reliability of these data through interviews with Park Service  officials who were familiar with these data and reviews of relevant  documentation. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives. We also examined Park Service  budget documents, including several agency budget justifications, and  interviewed relevant Park Service officials at headquarters, regional  offices, and park units to better understand the fund sources used for  maintenance work.

We also interviewed Park Service staff at the  headquarters, regional, and park unit levels to better understand deferred  maintenance. We began our data analysis with fiscal year 2009 because  it is the first year the Park Service reported deferred maintenance for all  of the assets under its management. From fiscal years 2006 through  2008, the Park Service reported deferred maintenance for eight major  asset categories as agreed with the Office and Management and  Budget\u2014paved roads, buildings, campgrounds, housing, trails, unpaved  roads, water systems, and waste water systems. In fiscal year 2009, the  Park Service began reporting deferred maintenance for an additional  category called all others to convey the deferred maintenance for assets  that did not, by definition, fall into one of the other eight categories. The  all others category used by the Park Service includes assets such as  marinas, railroads, and interpretive media.", "We determined how the amount and composition of deferred  maintenance had changed from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2015 by  obtaining Park Service reports generated from FMSS on the amount of  deferred maintenance for each fiscal year by major asset category.  According to the Park Service, deferred maintenance data from the end of  fiscal year 2015 are the most current data available and include 409 park  units as well as other properties under Park Service jurisdiction, such as  regional offices. Park Service officials said that the data provided for each  fiscal year were a snapshot in time that reflected the asset categorization  methods in place at the time each report was generated. For example,  officials said that some assets categorized as one type may have been  treated as another type in a subsequent year. We analyzed these data  over this period in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms.", "We also obtained detailed data for fiscal year 2015 from FMSS for each  of the Park Service\u2019s more than 75,000 assets. We analyzed these data  to identify how deferred maintenance varied according to certain key  characteristics, such as asset priority, asset category, park unit age, and  region. We assessed the reliability of the data by interviewing Park  Service officials familiar with these data, observing those officials use  FMSS, and reviewing relevant documentation. We found these data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To determine how the Park Service makes asset maintenance decisions  and to identify actions the Park Service is taking to help address  maintenance needs, we interviewed relevant officials at the headquarters  level. We also interviewed Department of Transportation officials who  described the process the department uses to assess the condition of  Park Service roads and bridges; park unit staff use these assessments to  make maintenance decisions about those assets. In addition, we  analyzed relevant documents, such as the Park Service\u2019s Asset  Management Plan, asset maintenance guidance documents, the Capital  Investment Strategy Guidebook, and fact sheets, to obtain additional  information about the process and tools. We compared information we  learned about the Park Service\u2019s process for making asset management  decisions to the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Capital  Programming Guide, the Federal Real Property Council\u2019s Guidance for  Real Property Inventory Reporting, and the National Academies Federal  Facilities Council\u2019s Key Performance Indicators of Federal Facilities  Portfolios. We supplemented our analysis with information obtained from  our prior reports. In addition, we interviewed the chief facility  management official at each of the Park Service\u2019s seven regions to  understand the role they play in overseeing and managing maintenance  needs at the park units within their regions.
