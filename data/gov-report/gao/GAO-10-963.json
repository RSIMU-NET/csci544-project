Aware of concerns that PCAs might cost more than using IRS staff, IRS began studying the collection costs and performance of PCAs and IRS. In March 2009, IRS announced that it would not renew its PCA contracts based on the study and announced plans for increasing collection staffing. As requested, GAO is reporting on whether (1) the study was sound as primary support for IRS's PDC decision and (2) IRS has planned or made changes to its collection approach based on its PCA experience and PDC study. GAO compared IRS's study to federal and other guidance on what should be included in analyses to support program decisions and analyzed IRS's changes given expectations that IRS would consider PCAs' best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS's comparative study of the PDC program was not soundly designed to support its decision on whether to continue contracting out debt collection. Although the study was not originally intended or designed as primary support for the decision, IRS officials nonetheless used it as such. IRS did not have guidance for program managers on the type of analysis that should be done to support decisions to create, renew, or expand programs. IRS had not retained sufficient documentation on the sample used in the study or documented some analyses that would have been helpful if performed. The study results may be overstated or understated because the study sample was not generalizable to the program as a whole. The study had a narrow objective of comparing results for IRS working the same cases as PCAs had, and as a result, the study design did not consider other factors recommended by Office of Management and Budget and other guidance on conducting program analysis. For example, the study did not analyze alternatives to program scale, such as expanding it or scaling it back. Program analysis guidance states that to the extent possible all costs and benefits should be counted and alternative means of achieving a program's goals should be considered. But the study did not identify important costs and benefits, such as whether taxpayers' compliance costs would be different if IRS or PCAs work debt cases. Nevertheless, neither GAO nor IRS officials know whether the study results and decision on the program would have differed significantly if it had been designed to be primary support for IRS's PDC program. In commenting on a draft of GAO's report, IRS disagreed that the PDC study was not soundly designed. GAO stands by its analysis detailing the study's errors, narrow scope, and lack of adherence to guidance. These design and methodology deficiencies limited the study's usefulness in supporting IRS's decision. IRS has not made or planned changes to its collection approach based on its PCA experience and study. In authorizing the use of PCAs, Congress required IRS to report to Congress its measurement plan to identify any of the PCAs' best practices that IRS could adopt to improve its own collection operations. IRS did not continue to report to Congress as required. In an unpublished draft report, IRS asserted that it had reviewed a number of PCA practices and found no immediate opportunities to change its collection approach. IRS did not provide GAO documentation on the study to support that conclusion. In part because PCA-type cases had previously been considered low priority, IRS officials were surprised by the PDC study results, which indicated that IRS staff might have better results working PCA-type cases than some of the cases IRS normally works. IRS officials said that they initiated a pilot study in 2009 to help them decide whether to use IRS staff to work selected types of PCA cases. As GAO concluded its review, IRS provided conflicting information on the role of the pilot study. On one hand, IRS said a collection selection system to be implemented in January 2011 overtook the need for the study. On the other hand, an IRS official said that the results from PCA-type cases were not used in the development of the new case selection system."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS (1) establish guidance on analyses to support program decisions, (2) establish a policy requiring documentation of program studies, and (3) ensure that PCA-type case results are considered for IRS's new case selection model.

Some in Congress  and elsewhere in the tax community, including the National Taxpayer  Advocate, expressed concerns that using PCAs might result in higher costs  as compared to increasing IRS resources to collect the debts. Aware of  these concerns, IRS officials said that if Congress authorized the use of  PCAs, IRS would study the comparative performance of PCAs and IRS in  collecting unpaid taxes. The law authorizing the program also required  that IRS create a measurement plan to identify and capture information on  the best practices used by PCAs compared with IRS\u2019s practices to identify  any that IRS could adopt to improve its own collection operations.

Such guidance came from Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Circular A-94, a previous GAO publication on evaluating federal  programs, an academic research paper on costs and benefits that should  be considered in making decisions on resources for tax enforcement  programs, and accepted quantitative analysis criteria on sampling cases  and projecting results.

We  recommended instead that IRS compare the use of PCAs to a collection  strategy that officials determine to be the most effective and efficient  overall way of achieving collection goals.  In September 2006, we reported that IRS\u2019s planned PDC study approach  would not meet the intent of our 2004 recommendation. Because the  study would not count the fees paid to PCAs as program costs, it would  not compare the results of using PCAs with the results IRS could get if it  was given the same amount of resources, including the fees to be paid to  the PCAs.

Although IRS met part of our 2006  recommendation in that the PDC study included fees paid to PCAs as  program costs, the PDC study did not fully implement our  recommendation to include the best use of federal funds because, as  discussed further below, the study had methodological errors and a  narrow scope.", "IRS\u2019s PDC study report results were released on March 5, 2009, along with  IRS\u2019s announcement that it was ending the program.

The PDC study documentation mentioned a design that could  represent the full population of PCA-type cases based on sample cases  drawn from various groupings of PCA-type cases. However, IRS did not  generalize the study results back to the full PCA case population, limiting  its analysis to the sample cases. It is common for study results to differ  significantly between results for the sampled cases and results when  generalized back to the full population.

Guidance states that program analyses should include alternative  means of achieving program objectives by examining different program  scales, methods of provision, and degrees of government involvement.", "The PDC study included three alternatives: (1) PCAs attempting to collect  unpaid tax debts for the inventory assigned to them, (2) IRS taking  collection action on the types of cases that were assigned to PCAs, and   (3) IRS taking collection action on another type of inventory normally not  worked. However, beyond not addressing whether to continue the PDC  program, the study did not analyze alternatives for program scale, such as  expanding the PDC program or scaling it back to a segment of cases that  might be more cost effective for PCAs to work than IRS. For example, in  deciding whether to scale back rather than eliminate the PDC program,  IRS could have analyzed the types of cases, if any, where PDC  performance was better than IRS performance. Assuming that this analysis  pointed to favorable types of cases for PCAs, IRS then could have limited  the program to working those cases, unless the benefit of doing this was  so limited that running a separate PDC program with fixed costs would  not be cost beneficial. According to IRS officials, IRS had effectively  scaled back the program during its course because after the initial wave of  cases assigned to PCAs, IRS had difficulties in obtaining a sufficient  volume of cases appropriate for PCAs to work.", "In addition, IRS did not compare the PDC program to what it judged to be  the best overall strategy for improving tax collections, as we had  recommended IRS do in our 2004 report, even though the Commissioner  of Internal Revenue agreed with our recommendation. In 2004, we  concluded that IRS should do a study in line with federal guidance, such as  comparing the results of using PCAs to the results from using the same  amount of funds to be paid to PCAs in an unconstrained manner that IRS  determined to be the most effective overall way of achieving its collection  goals. After our report, Congress authorized the PDC program and  included the provision making 25 percent of PDC collections available to  IRS. Conceptually, Congress effectively made available funds for the PDC  program totaling the amounts paid to PCAs plus the up to 25 percent of  PDC collections that IRS could use for enforcement purposes. We  continue to believe that a comparison of results of the PDC program\u2014as  authorized by Congress\u2014to results IRS would achieve if given the same  funds to use in what it judged to be the best possible manner would have  better supported a decision on the PDC program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not All Benefits and Costs Were Included", "paragraphs": ["To inform a decision on whether to continue a program, government  officials need complete and reliable information on all the program\u2019s  benefits and costs.

As cited in IRS\u2019s  announcement of the decision to not renew PCAs\u2019 contracts, the study  showed that when working the same types of cases as PCAs, IRS had  better results than PCAs. Specifically, IRS\u2019s cost was $0.07 to collect a  dollar itself while the government\u2019s cost using PCAs was $0.24 for each  dollar collected. According to IRS officials, IRS\u2019s results on the cases it  worked were comparable to or better than the results of working its  normal cases.", "In addition to direct revenues, the study did not estimate or otherwise  discuss indirect revenue (for example, determine whether other taxpayers  are more or less likely to pay their due taxes when IRS works the cases  than when PCAs do). Indirect revenues are difficult to estimate, but the  study could have explored whether any logical reasons exist to indicate  that indirect revenue would have varied based on which party worked the  PCA-type cases.", "As discussed further below, the PDC study also did not include potentially  important program costs and benefits for a tax enforcement program, such  as    costs to taxpayers to comply with requirements to pay their delinquent  taxes (are costs to taxpayers lower under IRS or PCAs);    equity (is IRS or are PCAs more effective in collecting taxes from  taxpayers in different income groups, for example); and    economic efficiency (is IRS or are PCAs more effective at working cases  involving taxpayers in different industries, for example, resulting in more  or less distortion of activity across types of businesses).", "IRS officials said that these benefits and costs were not addressed in the  study because they are difficult to measure. However, IRS could have  followed OMB guidance to, at a minimum, list and discuss these omitted  costs and benefits in the final report. As a result, the decision to end the  program rests, in part, on the assumption that important differences do  not exist between IRS and PCA handling of these cases related to these  costs and benefits. If IRS assumed that no such differences existed, this  should have been stated in the report with the supporting rationale.", "Some important differences might exist. For example, it is not clear that  taxpayer costs would be the same regardless of which party worked on  collecting their tax debt. Taxpayer compliance costs could be lower when  IRS collects taxes because 90 percent of the cases IRS worked were  eligible for systemic actions, such as systemic levies of taxpayer\u2019s assets.  Such actions might incur little cost for the taxpayer beyond reading IRS\u2019s  notification of intent to levy assets, as compared to a PCA case, which  required that a taxpayer first make a payment or answer or return a phone  call in response to a PCA\u2019s letter or call. Policymakers do not know  whether costs to taxpayers differed between IRS and PCA collections  because IRS did not consider this and other circumstances that could  affect taxpayers\u2019 costs.", "The study also did not include a type of collected revenue\u2014which IRS  called noncommissionable revenue\u2014that IRS officials tracked in a  measure to assess the PDC program\u2019s performance and, in some cases,  might have gone uncollected otherwise. For example, IRS did not pay  PCAs a commission when debt was collected within a 10-day window after  being assigned to a PCA. In establishing the program, an IRS official told  us that IRS expected that many dollars would be collected within this 10- day window because taxpayers would send in payment after receiving  notification that their debts were being assigned to a PCA. To the extent  this occurred, not taking these revenues into account in the study may  have led to an underestimate of the collections attributable to the PDC  program. Other noncommissionable revenue included collections through  actions IRS systemically took regardless of whether a case was assigned to  a PCA, such as refund offsets. According to IRS officials, such revenues  were not included in the PDC study for either PCAs or IRS collections. IRS  data through fiscal year 2007 show that total collections for the PDC  program were about $32.1 million with $7 million (22 percent) of the total  being noncommissionable; for fiscal year 2008, the total was $37.3 million  with $9.6 million (26 percent) noncommissionable; and for fiscal year  2009, the total was $28.8 million with $11.5 million (40 percent)  noncommissionable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "For the Types of Government Costs IRS Chose to Include, the Study Was Consistent with Selected OMB Guidance", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019s PDC study focused on just a few types of government costs.

Table  2 identifies these types of costs.", "IRS used a variable costing methodology rather than a full costing  approach to compare the costs of PCAs and IRS working inventory that  they determined to be similar. According to IRS, the variable costing  approach included expenses that would vary depending on an increase or  decrease in the inventory assigned to either the PCAs or IRS. The study  did not include previous costs, such as costs in setting up the PDC  program. In general, this overall approach to including costs is consistent  with OMB guidance. That guidance says that analyses should be based on  incremental costs and benefits and sunk costs should be ignored.", "IRS did not include management oversight or information technology  since such costs would not vary with the volume of cases handled. For  example, IRS did not include the costs of a PDC program oversight unit  that among other things was responsible for monitoring PCA performance.  Although these costs likely would not vary greatly with changes in the  volume of cases handled by IRS or PCAs, if the absolute costs were  significantly greater either for IRS or PCAs, the difference may have  affected the cost comparison, especially over relatively small numbers of  cases. IRS did not document whether these costs varied significantly  based on who handled the cases.", "To determine the cost for the PCAs, IRS used historical cost data of the  PDC program for fiscal year 2008 that were generated from IRS\u2019s  Integrated Financial System. IRS apportioned those costs to the number of  cases in its study.", "Unlike the PCAs cost data, the IRS costs were not system generated but  were calculated based on estimates and assumptions. For example, IRS  identified the transactions (such as phone calls made or notices sent to  taxpayers) taken on each case in the sample by manually reviewing  individual data posted in the taxpayers\u2019 case files in the Integrated Data  Retrieval System. To then calculate direct labor hours per case, IRS used  information from inventory handling time reports and call handling time  reports. IRS determined an average minutes per transaction, which it  applied to the sampled cases in the study. Because the PCA-type cases  were at least somewhat different than cases ACS normally handled,  applying the average minutes from typical transactions may or may not  have accurately reflected the time actually taken on the PCA-type cases.

According to IRS officials, the pilot  study\u2019s goals were to (1) provide coverage for a segment of the unpaid tax  debt inventory that would not be worked because of the end of the PCA  contract and (2) provide information on which types of cases IRS could  fruitfully work in the future.", "IRS placed approximately 19,000 pilot cases with ACS over a 4-month  period beginning in September 2009. IRS officials said that the agency  randomly drew the cases from the database of cases that IRS had used to  assign cases to the PCA staff. IRS employees cannot identify which of their  assignments are PCA-type cases. As of July 2010, the status of these cases  was as follows:    8,559 cases (45 percent) had been closed, for example, through some form  of payment or other action;    4,954 cases (26 percent) were being worked; and    5,552 cases (29 percent) had yet to be worked.", "As of June 2010, IRS officials said that they expected that the work on  these pilot study cases would be finished by December 2010. For these  cases, IRS collected data on its activities (such as liens and levies) and the  results (such as dispositions and dollars collected). Of the 8,559 cases  closed as of July 1, 2010, IRS had received payment in full in 931 cases (11  percent) and had entered into installment agreements in 2,878 cases (34  percent).", "IRS officials said they had planned to use the collected data to determine if  changes should be made to the case selection criteria to assign certain  types of PCA-type cases to the IRS active collection inventory. According  to IRS officials, after the pilot cases were worked, IRS\u2019s Office of Program  Evaluation and Risk Analysis (OPERA) was to study the collected data to  see what happened with the cases. IRS expected that the OPERA study  would take a year to complete (i.e., until about December 2011). IRS  officials said that the agency was then to determine whether more PCA- type cases should be routinely worked in IRS and, if so, which ones.", "Following guidance on conducting program analyses helps ensure that  relevant information is considered and a sound methodology is used,  including stated study objectives and a clear and appropriate study design  for answering the objectives. As we have reported in the past, these  principles are essential when developing an analysis or evaluation plan.  For example, this plan should not only be written but have sufficient detail  to answer questions such as the following:    Are the test goals and objectives of IRS\u2019s pilot study clearly stated?    Has IRS identified the types of data to be collected?    What specific types of analysis will be performed?", "The documentation IRS had available describing the pilot study\u2014a draft  plan prepared in December 2009\u2014addressed summarizing and providing  data on the sampled cases (such as collection action taken, e.g., liens and  levies) and the results (such as the disposition or current status of the  cases and the dollars collected). But as of June 24, 2010, IRS had not  produced an approved plan on how it intended to analyze the pilot study  data even though it had worked about three-fourths of the cases selected  for the pilot. According to IRS officials, progress in developing an analysis  plan for the pilot study had been delayed by efforts to implement  Consolidated Decision Analytics (CDA). Among other things, CDA is to  implement new models to better predict the collection potential of unpaid  tax debt cases to help ensure the best use of IRS\u2019s collection resources.  Officials said that any plan for analyzing the pilot study\u2019s data would need  to ensure that the pilot study results will be useful given IRS\u2019s plans to  more fully implement CDA in January 2011.", "Beyond not knowing how the pilot study data will be analyzed, IRS had  not clarified its criteria on how it would use the results of any analyses to  make a decision about assigning more PCA-type cases to be worked in  IRS. Specifically, IRS had no documentation on the criteria that officials  would use in making this decision and what factors, if any, beyond the  analyses of the pilot study data would contribute to those criteria or that  decision. Developing criteria would be important to ensure that the  variables measured in the study would be useful in supporting the decision  on whether to change case selection criteria to regularly pursue such  cases.", "As we concluded our review, the status of the pilot study and whether or  how PCA-type cases would be included in active collection case inventory  became less clear. IRS provided conflicting information about determining  whether PCA-type cases have sufficient collection potential to be included  in its collection inventory. On one hand, officials said that CDA models  were built by tracking the characteristics and collection potential of actual  collection cases. On the other hand, PCA-type cases generally have not  been worked by collection staff, which is why IRS began its pilot study of  PCA-type cases to determine their collection potential. In its comments on  our draft report, IRS said that the CDA models that would be implemented  in January 2011 had overtaken the need to complete the pilot study.  Examining the CDA models was outside the scope of our review.  Therefore, we had not reviewed documentation on what types of data  were used in developing the CDA models.

Based on IRS data, ACS staffing levels\u2014as  measured by full-time equivalent (FTE) positions\u2014have increased since  fiscal year 2008.

Although a  study that adhered to federal guidance on analyzing programs would have  better informed IRS\u2019s decision on the fate of the PDC program, it is not  possible to know whether such a study would have had materially  different results or changed IRS\u2019s decision on the program. However it  would have provided more complete information for policymakers to  consider. To the extent possible, and especially for significant program  decisions, IRS should adhere to OMB and other guidance for economic  analyses to better ensure that policymakers have adequate information to  support their decisions. IRS does not have guidance for managers on the  types of analyses that should be done and documented to support program  decisions. Such analyses can yield significant benefits by helping inform  decision making, but they also incur costs. Therefore, careful  consideration of the potential risks and positive impacts of various study  designs is necessary to select an appropriate study design and scope to  answer the relevant questions in a methodologically sufficient manner.", "IRS\u2019s PDC study suggested that at least certain PCA-type cases, which IRS  had not been working, may be worth including in ACS\u2019s inventory for  collection action. To the extent that these results are valid and reliable,  IRS may be able to make a relatively low-cost investment in certain PCA- type cases to collect tax debts. However, as we concluded our audit, IRS  provided conflicting information about determining whether PCA-type  cases have sufficient collection potential to be included in its collection  inventory. Given the conflicting information available to us, we believe it is  important that PCA-type case results are considered and incorporated as  appropriate into the CDA models.

IRS said the study\u2019s comparison of the cost-effectiveness  of PCAs and IRS working similar cases provided meaningful data that  aided its decision making. IRS cited an independent review of the PDC  study that found the results to be reasonable, even though the study had  limitations and constraints. We continue to believe that the study was not  a soundly designed cost-effectiveness comparison for supporting IRS\u2019s  decision. Our report discusses our reasoning in detail, focusing on the  study\u2019s methodological errors, narrow scope, and lack of adherence to  guidance for doing such studies. For example, IRS did not do the analysis  necessary to generalize the study results to the full PCA case population  even though study results could differ significantly when generalized to  the full population.

These models are intended to select cases with the best potential for  collection action in one of IRS\u2019s work streams. IRS said that to measure  the impact of the PCA-type cases, as was the plan when the PCA project  was terminated, is no longer necessary.", "We had discussed with IRS officials the continued need for the pilot study  when IRS told us in July 2010 that it planned to implement CDA in January  2011. IRS officials, including the Acting Director, Collection Business  Reengineering, said that while CDA selection would focus on collection  potential and not type of case (i.e., PCA-type), the pilot study of  approximately 19,000 PCA-type cases might provide data useful for  improving CDA models. Officials affirmed that they initiated the pilot  study because the PDC study showed that PCA-type cases might have high  collection potential at low cost. Accordingly, our draft report  recommended that IRS document the methodology and criteria for its pilot  study. Information provided in IRS comments on the report and in  response to our subsequent questions suggests that whether and how PCA- type cases may be selected for active collection inventory is uncertain.  Although IRS\u2019s comments on the draft report said that the need for  completing the pilot case study was overtaken by the development of the  CDA models, in separate technical comments IRS officials said they were  continuing to work the pilot cases and provided no indication that they  would stop working them before CDA is implemented in January 2011.  Further, in response to our question about whether PCA-type case results  were used in developing the CDA models, an IRS official said that they had  not been used. In response to IRS\u2019s comments and absent evidence that  CDA will be implemented as planned and that its models will include IRS\u2019s  experience in attempting collection of PCA-type cases, we revised the  third recommendation to better focus on ensuring that PCA-type case  results are considered and incorporated as appropriate into the CDA  models.
