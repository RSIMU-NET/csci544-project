The panel and others have noted that WMATA's lack of a significant dedicated revenue source may affect its ability to keep the system in good working order. Proposed federal legislation would make $1.5 billion available to WMATA if the local governments established dedicated funding. This report addresses (1) the characteristics of dedicated funding and its effects on transit agencies and governments; (2) how potential revenue sources compare in terms of stability, adequacy, and other factors; (3) major actions needed to establish dedicated funding for WMATA and the progress made to date; and (4) issues that dedicated funding poses for the region and WMATA. To address these issues, GAO reviewed financial data for the nation's 25 largest transit agencies, interviewed officials from 6 transit agencies and from the state and local governments that support WMATA, and reviewed literature on the financing of mass transit. GAO provided a draft of this report to WMATA and the Department of Transportation for review. Officials from these agencies provided technical clarifications that were incorporated in the report, as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Dedicated funding, an important source of revenue for many transit agencies, is described by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) as a specific revenue source--such as a sales or gas tax--that is designated to be used for transit and is not subject to appropriations. According to data transit agencies report to FTA, 23 of the 25 largest transit agencies have dedicated funding, although the transit agencies GAO spoke with vary in the extent to which their dedicated funding corresponds to FTA's description. Most transit agencies with dedicated funding receive such funding from multiple sources and use it on both operations and capital expenses. Generally, dedicated funding is subject to the same oversight as other expenditures and is viewed by transit agencies as having a positive effect on their financial health, particularly with regard to long-range planning. However, dedicated funding has potential drawbacks: For example, it is vulnerable to economic cycles, and it limits the budgetary flexibility of state and local governments. Selecting a dedicated funding source for WMATA involves consideration of the funding source's year-to-year stability and its longer-run adequacy. For state and local governments, another consideration is the political feasibility of the tax or fee rate required to collect a specified amount of revenue from a particular funding source. Revenue sources that GAO analyzed--the sales tax, payroll or income tax, motor vehicle fuels tax, property tax, access fees, and vehicle registration fees--have different characteristics when assessed using these considerations. If governments increase their overall tax and fee revenues to provide additional funding for WMATA, there may be equity, efficiency, and administrative cost issues for their tax systems. To establish dedicated funding and conform to the requirements of the proposed federal legislation, WMATA's supporting jurisdictions would need to enact separate legislation to direct a specific revenue source to WMATA and to amend the WMATA Compact. As of April 2006, legislation to dedicate a portion of sales tax revenues to WMATA had been enacted in the District of Columbia, but neither Maryland nor Virginia had enacted comparable legislation. The only jurisdiction to introduce a bill to amend the Compact has been Maryland, and this legislation was later withdrawn. The District of Columbia and Virginia have not begun steps to amend the Compact. The federal government and the jurisdictions that support WMATA will need to resolve several issues should they choose to provide WMATA with dedicated funding, including (1) the proportion of the jurisdictions' payments to WMATA that come from dedicated funding and how to mitigate its risks; (2) whether dedicated funding will result in a net increase in payments to WMATA and how the size of each jurisdiction's payment will be determined; (3) whether dedicated funding should be used for operations, capital expenditures, or both; and (4) whether increased oversight of WMATA is needed to ensure dedicated funds are properly accounted for."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  (WMATA) has faced serious financial and budgetary problems as well as  continuing challenges related to the safety and reliability of its transit  services.

Over the years, the federal government has provided WMATA  with about 60 percent of the funds used to construct the Metrorail subway  system, and Congress has a continued interest in the viability of WMATA  due to the system\u2019s importance to the functioning of the federal  government and the orderly movement of people during major events and  times of regional or national emergencies.", "The Metro Funding Panel\u2014a regional panel cosponsored by the  Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the Greater  Washington Board of Trade, and the Federal City Council\u2014reported in  2005 that WMATA, under its current revenue structure, will have  budgetary shortfalls of $2.4 billion over 10 years, in spite of an agreement  in 2003 from the WMATA Compact (Compact) jurisdictions to provide an  additional $1.5 billion for the agency\u2019s critical capital needs. This panel  and others have noted that WMATA\u2019s lack of any significant dedicated  source of revenue may affect WMATA\u2019s ability to carry out essential  equipment and infrastructure projects needed to keep the system in good  working order. Past efforts to provide stable and reliable sources of  funding for WMATA were difficult due to the agency\u2019s complex  governance structure and the political nature of decisions related to how  much each of the local governments should pay.", "Legislation introduced in Congress and approved by your committee  would make $1.5 billion in federal funding available to WMATA if, among  other things, the local governments established dedicated sources of  revenue.

We reviewed  the reliability of these data and concluded that they were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We also conducted semistructured interviews  with officials at six transit agencies, which we selected based on their  similarity to WMATA and their use of a range of dedicated revenue  sources. We reviewed the legislation establishing dedicated funding at  some of these agencies, and interviewed state and local government  officials in the Washington, D.C., region and experts on transportation  finance. To assess how potential revenue sources that could be used for  dedicated funding or for addressing WMATA\u2019s projected budgetary  shortfall compare in terms of key considerations, we reviewed and  synthesized economics literature on mass transit funding, and interviewed  experts in transportation planning and finance. To determine the actions  required to establish dedicated funding for WMATA and the progress made  in carrying out those actions, and to identify issues that dedicated funding  poses for the region and WMATA, we reviewed and analyzed the proposed  federal legislation that would make additional funding available to  WMATA (H.R. 3496) and the related legislation proposed in the District of  Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. We also interviewed officials from all of  the state and local jurisdictions supporting WMATA, members of the  general assemblies of Virginia and Maryland and the District of Columbia  City Council, and representatives from the Northern Virginia  Transportation Commission and the WMATA Board of Directors.

WMATA provides transportation to  and from work for a substantial portion of the federal workforce, and  federal employees\u2019 use of WMATA\u2019s services is encouraged by General  Services Administration guidelines that instruct federal agencies to locate  their facilities near mass transit stops whenever possible. WMATA also  accommodates increased passenger loads and extends its operating hours  during events related to the federal government\u2019s presence in Washington,  D.C., such as presidential inaugurations and funerals, and celebrations and  demonstrations on the National Mall.

In January 2001, WMATA completed the originally  planned 103-mile Metrorail system, which included 83 rail stations on five  rail lines. As of March 2006, the transit system encompasses (1) the  Metrorail subway system, which now has 86 Metrorail stations on five rail  lines and a fleet of about 948 railcars; (2) the Metrobus system, which has  a fleet of about 1,451 buses serving 340 routes; and (3) the MetroAccess  ADA complementary paratransit system, which provides specialized  transportation services, as required by law, to persons with disabilities  who are certified as being unable to access WMATA\u2019s fixed-route transit  system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA Funds Its Operations and Capital Activities through a Variety of Directly Generated Revenues and through Other Local, State, and Federal Sources", "paragraphs": ["WMATA funds its operations through a combination of revenues from  passenger fares, nonfare revenues such as parking and advertising fees,  and payments from state and local governments.

The formulas for determining capital  cost allocation\u2014other than for extension projects, which are paid for by  the sponsoring jurisdiction\u2014are based on the amount that the  jurisdictions pay for operating costs. Under these formulas, jurisdictions  with higher populations and service levels (indicated by factors such as  the number of Metrorail stations and miles of bus routes) generally pay  more than jurisdictions with smaller populations and lower service levels.  The operating subsidy and capital program payments for 2006 as  determined by the formulas are shown in figure 3.", "The Compact jurisdictions of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and  Virginia vary in the sources they use for payments to WMATA:    District of Columbia.

Payments to WMATA for Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s  counties are made from the Maryland Transportation Trust Fund. The  trust fund\u2019s revenue sources include a gas tax, vehicle title tax, and other  motor vehicle taxes and fees, along with other sources such as federal aid.  Trust fund revenues are also used for operating and capital expenses for  various modes of transportation in the state including transit, ports, and  aviation, as well as for local road construction. Maryland is required by  state law to make payments for the share of WMATA\u2019s operating expenses,  capital equipment replacement, and debt service for which Montgomery  and Prince George\u2019s Counties are responsible.", "Virginia. The individual cities and counties are responsible for making  payments to WMATA.

NVTC holds, in trust, funds from a variety of sources that are used to pay  for its members\u2019 public transit systems\u2014including WMATA and local bus  systems such as the Fairfax Connector and Alexandria\u2019s DASH bus.  Sources include a 2 percent Northern Virginia retail motor vehicle fuel tax  and state sources such as transit assistance grants and state bonds issued  for WMATA.

The District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia took the  following actions to comply with the requirement:    District of Columbia. The city adopted a law in 1982 to earmark funds for  WMATA by establishing a Metrorail/Metrobus account within its general  fund. The account was supported by earmarking existing revenues that  came from sources receiving direct or indirect benefits from mass transit,  including sales taxes on hotels, meals, and gasoline, as well as vehicle  registration fees and parking meter fees. The earmarked revenues were  sufficient to cover the District of Columbia\u2019s share of WMATA\u2019s operating,  debt service, and capital expenses. This account is no longer the source of  WMATA payments. As described above, the District of Columbia now  provides payments to WMATA from its general revenue fund and general  obligation bonds.", "Maryland. The state enacted legislation in 1980 to require the Maryland  Transportation Trust Fund to assume a portion of the costs WMATA  allocated to Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties. The legislation  also provided the trust fund with new sources of revenue, including motor  vehicle fuel taxes, a portion of the corporate income tax, and all revenues  of the state motor vehicle administration. The trust fund was used to pay  all of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties\u2019 share of WMATA\u2019s  capital costs, and 75 percent of the counties\u2019 share of operating costs and  debt service. Montgomery County provided for the balance of its  obligation to WMATA through a property tax earmarked for mass transit,  and Prince George\u2019s County met the remainder of its obligation by  establishing the Mass Transit Special Revenue Fund and earmarking  revenues from the state real property tax grant program in the event that  county appropriations to the fund fell short. State legislation in 1992 and  1998 made the state\u2019s transportation trust fund the source of all payments  to WMATA.", "Virginia. In 1980, the state enacted a 2 percent sales tax on the retail price  of gasoline within the Northern Virginia counties and cities in the WMATA  service area and dedicated the proceeds of the new tax to WMATA,  effective in July 1982. The state also increased its biennial appropriation to  NVTC, increasing the amount of state money available for payment to  WMATA. At the same time, the Northern Virginia counties and cities  enacted local ordinances stating their intention to fund WMATA\u2019s debt  service and operating assistance on an annual basis and designating their  general fund revenues as the source of funding for what the gasoline tax  and state aid did not cover.", "In 2005, the Metro Funding Panel estimated that under its current revenue  structure, WMATA would have a total budgetary shortfall of $2.4 billion  during fiscal years 2006 through 2015 if it went forward with the projects  remaining in its 10-year capital improvement plan, not including those that  involved expanding the current system. The panel\u2019s report noted that  WMATA\u2014unlike almost all other large transit systems\u2014does not have a  substantial dedicated source of revenue, such as a local sales tax, whose  receipts are directed to the transit authority. As a result, the panel  concluded that the Washington, D.C., region needs to develop a dedicated  source of funding for WMATA, and recommended specifically that a  regionwide sales tax be implemented. In the course of its work, the panel  analyzed a number of revenue options for dedicated funding for WMATA,  including estimating the tax or fee rate that would be required to raise  sufficient revenue to address the projected shortfall.", "In our July 2005 testimony before the House Committee on Government  Reform, we stated that the actual projected shortfall could, in fact, be  much greater because the Metro Funding Panel did not include in its  estimate costs associated with providing paratransit service, which is  required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. These costs are  significant; in fact, the panel estimated that these services could result in  an additional shortfall for WMATA of about $1.1 billion over the 10-year  period.", "The Brookings Institution in June 2004 issued a report that similarly  concluded that WMATA\u2019s lack of dedicated revenues makes its core  funding uniquely vulnerable and at risk as WMATA\u2019s member jurisdictions  struggle with their own fiscal difficulties.

Many ballot measures for local  option sales taxes target a mix of transportation programs, including  highways and transit. A transportation economist we spoke with noted a  recent trend in ballot measures for sales taxes for capital projects and said  that an advantage of these taxes is that they bring about fiscal discipline  because the agencies have to deliver results (such as a completed capital  project) within a specified time. According to this economist, in 2002,  there were 43 such ballot measures, and in 2004, there were 44; in both  years, roughly half of them passed.

With regard to raising revenue through  the issuance of bonds, all of the agencies we spoke with have used  dedicated funds to issue bonds for capital programs and projects. In  addition, four of the six agencies we interviewed said that dedicated  funding either allowed them to issue bonds or improved their credit rating.  An improved credit rating generally allows agencies to issue bonds at a  lower rate, thereby decreasing the cost of borrowing for capital projects.  For example, SEPTA used the funds from a 1992 dedicated funding  package to support the issuance of bonds for capital needs.

According to this analyst, who has expertise in transit, dedicated  funding can provide better access to the capital markets, but any effect on  the cost of borrowing will depend on how the dedicated funding is  structured. For example, a dedicated revenue stream is more stable if the  legislation creating it is difficult to reverse. Additionally, requiring that  revenues be spent first on debt servicing is looked upon favorably by bond  rating agencies. This analyst also noted that the credit-rating history of  transit agencies\u2014including WMATA\u2014is based partly on that of the local  or state jurisdictions that provide the agency with subsidy payments.  WMATA has a good, steady credit-rating history in part because of the high  credit ratings of its member jurisdictions. The key downside to WMATA\u2019s  current funding arrangement is the appropriations risk\u2014that local  jurisdictions might not make their payments or might be late. However,  the analyst noted that the jurisdictions supporting WMATA had a long  history of making payments on time, which, to a certain degree, offsets the  risk of appropriations. Furthermore, although dedicated funding could  also offset the appropriations risk\u2014if the dedicated revenue source were  structured so that it was not subject to appropriations\u2014it could increase  the risk associated with the revenue source, such as economic  fluctuations.", "Despite the advantages of dedicated funding, there are risks of revenue  volatility and a loss of budgetary flexibility for governments supporting  transit agencies. Although the transit agencies we spoke with cited the  predictability of revenue as an advantage of dedicated funding, they also  acknowledged that a risk of dedicated funding is that it may be too volatile  or not meet funding expectations. For example, BART is largely dependent  on local sales tax revenues for operating expenses; when the local  economy began declining in 2000, revenues were no longer sufficient,  leading BART to cut operating costs and raise fares.", "According to three transit agency officials we spoke with, it can be  difficult or impossible to obtain additional money from state and local  governments that have already provided the agencies with dedicated  funds. For example, although SEPTA officials told us that their dedicated  revenues were too small a proportion of their overall funding to enhance  the agency\u2019s long-term planning ability, they said that they had been  unsuccessful in obtaining additional dedicated funding. Moreover, not all  transit agencies have the authority to raise tax rates or fees themselves. In  addition, local option taxes for capital projects are a potentially  problematic means of providing dedicated funding in that, although they  do provide agencies with additional funds, they often expire after a certain  number of years, requiring agencies to have another ballot measure or to  find other ways to increase revenue.", "However, some transit agencies benefit from laws that mitigate the risk of  revenue fluctuations associated with dedicated funding sources. MBTA,  for example, is protected by legislation designating that 20 percent of the  statewide sales tax revenues go to the agency; this legislation specifies a  base revenue level that changes each year with the inflation rate. If  revenues do not meet the base level, the state makes up the difference.  MTA also has access to additional funding if the local matching shares for  state operating assistance are insufficient. If localities are unable to  provide the matching funds to MTA, the state takes out the shortfall from  the amount the locality would have received in state aid, and provides it  directly to MTA. Additionally, some agencies have reserve funds they can  draw on if revenues are not sufficient.", "Officials in the Washington, D.C., region identified similar concerns when  discussing what they believe the effects of dedicated funding for WMATA  might be. An official from one local jurisdiction stated that a dedicated  funding system is only as reliable as its funding source; another local  official said that revenues dedicated to WMATA from a specific source  may fluctuate from year to year with changing economic conditions.", "Regarding the loss of budgetary flexibility, we have previously reported  that setting government funds aside for a specific use\u2014such as with  federal trust funds\u2014may affect the funding available for other spending  priorities. We also reported that constituencies may create pressure to  spend revenues that are set aside for a specific purpose, regardless of the  need for the spending at the moment or the priority that would otherwise  be given such spending. Some of the officials in the Washington, D.C.,  region we interviewed also cited disadvantages related to state and local  budgeting. Maryland officials from the state Department of Transportation  and a local jurisdiction noted that funding dedicated strictly for WMATA  may reduce funds available for other transportation programs.

The two issues are not  necessarily linked since implementing a dedicated revenue source does  not automatically require a change in revenue sources or in the amount of  revenue collected. Important considerations in selecting a revenue source  or sources to be dedicated to WMATA are the stability and long-run  adequacy of the revenue source, as well as the political feasibility of the  size of the tax or fee rate necessary to provide sufficient revenue to  WMATA.

Year-to- year revenue stability refers to the degree to which both short-term  fluctuations in economic activity (the business cycle) and other factors not  directly linked to the business cycle influence dedicated tax revenues. The  revenue stability of different taxes and fees with respect to economic  fluctuations is often compared by estimating the percentage change in  year-to-year revenues that results from a 1 percent change in year-to-year  income levels. The variability in these estimates is then used to evaluate  the relative magnitude of fluctuations not related to the business cycle. A  greater degree of variability in the estimate of economic response  indicates a higher degree of instability from noncycle variations.", "Year-to-year revenue stability is an important consideration because it  influences the ability of a government or agency to carry out effective  planning and budgeting. A stable revenue source is not subject to  substantial year-to-year fluctuations, making it easily predictable. Greater  predictability leads to more accurate revenue forecasts and allows for  better budgeting and planning as it reduces the probability of a significant  funding shortfall (or surplus) in any given year.", "In the longer run, an important consideration for WMATA\u2019s financial  health is that the revenues yielded by a dedicated source adequately keep  pace with increases over time in transit expenditure demands. Although  many economists used to believe that there was a trade-off between year- to-year stability and long-run revenue growth, current research suggests  that a revenue source can exhibit relatively high long-run growth and be  relatively stable. Long-run revenue adequacy is measured by how revenues  are expected to grow over time as income grows. The relationship  between income levels and the revenue generated by a tax or fee is a  convenient benchmark for comparing different revenue sources. However,  to assess the adequacy of a revenue source for transit spending, one would  need to know how transit demand (and, consequently, spending) is related  to income. There is considerable uncertainty, however, about the  relationship between income growth and growth in demand for transit  services. As a result, it is uncertain what relationship between revenue  growth and income growth over the longer run is necessary to ensure that  revenues will adequately keep pace with transit expenditure demands.", "Estimates of long-run revenue growth rates for a given revenue source  often differ at the state or county level, creating further potentially  important budgetary and political implications for dedicated funding for  WMATA, which has a service area that encompasses multiple jurisdictions.  From a budgeting perspective, these jurisdictional differences should be  taken into account to arrive at accurate forecasts of transit revenues.  Political concerns might arise because of different revenue growth rates in  the Compact area, which could mean that the allocation of payments  among jurisdictions could change over time unless tax or fee rates are  adjusted or floors and ceilings are placed on contribution levels.", "Another key consideration in choosing a revenue source to be dedicated to  WMATA is the tax or fee rate required to dedicate a specified amount of  revenue from that source\u2014that is, the rate required may influence the  choices of state and local officials among various revenue sources. In  general, the rate required will be smaller when the tax or fee is applied to a  larger base.", "As part of its analysis of WMATA\u2019s funding issues, the Metro Funding  Panel estimated the tax or fee rate required to generate specified amounts  of dedicated revenue from six potential revenue sources. The specified  amounts were based on different categories of WMATA\u2019s spending that  could be covered by dedicated local revenues. For example, the panel  estimated the tax or fee rate required to dedicate $148 million in 2010. That  amount represents 50 percent of what the panel estimated would be  needed for capital spending to renew aging components of the WMATA  system and add system capacity to meet growing demands, plus operating  spending related to this capital investment.

Economic estimates suggest that sales tax revenues are more stable if the  tax base includes items for which purchases remain relatively constant.  These items are commonly referred to as necessities, including food,  clothing, and prescription drugs.

Economic estimates also suggest that tax bases that  include food have lower levels of long-run growth than those that exclude  food, although bases including food tend to be more stable.

Two  studies provide conflicting estimates of the relative volatility of income tax  revenues in Virginia and Maryland, with one study suggesting more  volatility in Virginia and the other suggesting more volatility in Maryland.

Income tax revenues grow faster than income  levels because of the progressive nature of most income taxes: People  with higher incomes typically pay a larger percentage of their income in  taxes than those with lower incomes. This progressivity occurs because of  graduated tax rates that get higher as incomes grow and deductions and  credits that are often phased out at higher income levels. Payroll tax  revenues may not increase as much as income tax revenues due to  economic growth because a payroll tax might not have graduated tax  rates.

These costs include items  such as computer systems, forms, and collection devices, as well as the  time spent by government employees and the individuals paying the tax or  fee.", "However, if the state and local jurisdictions served by WMATA implement  a regionwide tax or fee\u2014an approach proposed by the Metro Funding  Panel but which does not have strong support among the Compact  jurisdictions\u2014then there could be substantial additional administrative  costs as well as effects on equity and efficiency. Administrative costs  might be high because no regional collection mechanism is already in  place and implementation would require the coordination of collection  and enforcement measures across multiple state and local jurisdictions.  Equity and efficiency effects are also likely to be greater with the  implementation of a regionwide tax because it would change the  interjurisdictional allocation of WMATA payments for the shortfall.  Changes in equity and efficiency would likely be even larger if a regional  tax or fee were used to fund the entirety of state and local WMATA  payments, not just the shortfall, because of the additional revenue  involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Different Potential Revenue Sources Have Different Characteristics When Assessed Using the Key Considerations of Administrative Cost, Equity, and Efficiency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sales Tax", "paragraphs": ["Administrative costs associated with collecting additional revenue from a  sales tax are likely to be relatively low, especially when compared with  those associated with access fees and fuel taxes. Sales taxes are one of the  two main funding sources at the state level (along with income taxes) and  are often used to generate revenue at the local level and in special service  districts; thus, tax collection procedures already exist in many places.  Administrative costs could be more substantial if jurisdictions are faced  with new collection requirements, such as implementing a local option tax  where one does not already exist.", "In terms of equity based on the ability-to-pay principle, economists have  traditionally viewed the sales tax as regressive (although less so when  food purchases at grocery stores are excluded from taxation); those with  lower income levels pay a higher percentage of their income in sales tax  than those with higher income levels. However, more recent analyses have  identified some factors that suggest that sales taxes may be closer to  proportional and less regressive than previously believed.", "One factor is the economic incidence of the sales tax, or who actually  bears the burden of a revenue source. In taxation, the individuals who  bear the burden of a tax may or may not be the same individuals who  remit the revenue to the government. For example, when a sales tax is  added to a product, retailers remit the revenue to the government but they  may or may not actually be bearing the burden of the tax. Retailers may  leave the price of the product unchanged and simply add the sales tax to  the price, in which case the consumer pays the full amount of the tax.  Retailers might also reduce the price of the product by the amount of the  tax so as not to lose sales, in which case the retailer bears the burden of  the tax. Another possibility is that the price of the product might fall, but  not by the full amount of the tax, in which case retailers and consumers  share the burden of the tax. Traditional analyses of the sales tax have  generally assumed that consumers bear the full burden of the tax, but  more recent analyses have questioned that assumption. If the burden is  borne in part by retailers, then the sales tax may be less regressive than  previously believed.", "Another factor is the definition of income used in measuring progressivity  or regressivity. Traditional analyses that have found the sales tax to be  regressive have used annual income levels as the measure of income. More  recent research has shown that lifetime income might be a more relevant  measure of income as long as there are not severe constraints on an  individual\u2019s ability to borrow. Using lifetime income, the sales tax appears  roughly proportional. That is, people with varying levels of income spend  approximately the same percentage of their lifetime income on  consumption.", "In terms of efficiency, evidence from theoretical and empirical studies  suggests that the sales tax is distortionary in that it alters individuals\u2019  decisions about where and what to purchase. The sales tax diverts  purchases from taxed items toward untaxed or lightly taxed alternatives  (e.g., leisure, services, Internet sales, and retail in neighboring  jurisdictions). However, the increase in the sales tax needed to collect the  revenue associated with funding a WMATA shortfall is likely to be small  enough to generate only minor changes in efficiency. The biggest  distortions are likely to occur for purchases of items for which consumers  are sensitive to small changes in the price of these items, which might  happen if there are untaxed or lightly taxed alternatives that are close  substitutes.", "With respect to the benefit principle of equity and the accountability  component of efficiency, the sales tax roughly matches the users of  WMATA\u2019s services with the costs of those services to the extent that all  local residents benefit from transit, and visitors to the Washington, D.C,  region, who pay sales taxes while they are in that area, are also likely to  use the services. However, from an equity perspective, the adherence to  the benefit principle is limited because funding a shortfall with a sales tax  does not guarantee that those who receive greater benefits pay more tax;  that is, a sales tax is not well targeted toward transit beneficiaries.

A  regional, state, or local payroll tax might also generate significant  compliance costs for employers (in the case of a payroll tax collected at  the employer level) if it requires additional record keeping and submitting  revenues to a new source.", "Regarding the ability-to-pay principle for equity, the economics literature  has reached a general consensus that the burden of the tax is likely borne  by employees in the case of payroll taxes and in proportion to income in  the case of income taxes. The economic evidence suggests that employees  probably bear most of the burden of a payroll tax through lower wages,  even when legislation requires employers to pay half of the tax liability. As  lower-income households rely more heavily on wage and salary income,  the payroll tax is generally regressive, particularly at the bottom part of  the income distribution, but the tax will be less regressive if there is a  minimum threshold of wages for paying the tax and more regressive if  there is a cap on the amount of income to which the tax applies. It is  generally accepted in the economics literature that income tax liabilities  are borne by individuals who remit the tax to the government; that is, the  tax is not shifted to other individuals. Most income taxes are structured to  be progressive: People with higher incomes typically pay a larger  percentage of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes. Thus,  the income tax is generally thought to be consistent with ability-to-pay  principles.

Generally,  payroll or income taxes that alter decisions about whether to work, how  many hours to work, and how hard to work can cause distortions in the  economy, but estimates of the behavioral responses to income taxes vary  widely.

Studies indicate that higher-income households  own more cars and drive more total miles, suggesting that they will pay  more in motor vehicle fuel taxes than lower-income households, but it is  uncertain whether this larger amount of tax paid will represent a larger or  smaller share of household income. Given that rates of automobile  ownership are fairly high at all income levels beyond the very lowest, the  motor vehicle fuel tax may be regressive throughout much of the income  range. In addition, higher fuel costs increase the cost of travel and of  transporting goods. This added cost is more likely to be reflected in the  prices of goods for which the demand is relatively unresponsive to  changes in prices, or necessities such as food, clothing and prescription  drugs, rather than in the prices of goods and services that are considered  to be more luxury items. As lower-income households spend a larger  portion of their incomes on necessities, this effect of the motor vehicle  fuel tax would be expected to be regressive.", "The motor vehicle fuel tax has an ambiguous effect on efficiency with  respect to behavioral distortions from a conceptual viewpoint, and there is  too little empirical evidence to arrive at a conclusion. Motor vehicle fuel  tax increases within a region decrease efficiency to the extent that they  lead drivers to waste resources traveling to service stations outside the  region to find lower prices.
