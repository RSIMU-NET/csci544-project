GAO was asked to (1) examine available estimates of the vented and flared natural gas on federal leases, (2) estimate the potential to capture additional gas with available technologies and associated potential increases in royalty payments and decreases in greenhouse gas emissions, and (3) assess the federal role in reducing venting and flaring. In addressing these objectives, GAO analyzed data from Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and others and interviewed agency and industry officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Estimates of vented and flared natural gas for federal leases vary considerably, and GAO found that data collected by Interior to track venting and flaring on federal leases likely underestimate venting and flaring because they do not account for all sources of lost gas. For onshore federal leases, operators reported to Interior that about 0.13 percent of produced gas was vented or flared. Estimates from EPA and the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP) showed volumes as high as 30 times higher. Similarly, for offshore federal leases, operators reported that 0.5 percent of the natural gas produced was vented and flared, while data from an Interior offshore air quality study showed that volume to be about 1.4 percent, and estimates from EPA showed it to be about 2.3 percent. GAO found that the volumes operators reported to Interior do not fully account for some ongoing losses such as the emissions from gas dehydration equipment or from thousands of valves--key sources in the EPA, WRAP, and Interior offshore air quality studies. Data from EPA, supported by information obtained from technology vendors and GAO analysis, suggest that around 40 percent of natural gas estimated to be vented and flared on onshore federal leases could be economically captured with currently available control technologies. According to GAO analysis, such reductions could increase federal royalty payments by about $23 million annually and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equivalent to about 16.5 million metric tons of CO2--the annual emissions equivalent of 3.1 million cars. Venting and flaring reductions are also possible offshore, but data were not available for GAO to develop a complete estimate. As part of its oversight responsibilities, Interior is charged with minimizing vented and flared gas on federal leases. To minimize lost gas, Interior has issued regulations and guidance that limit venting and flaring during routine procedures. However, Interior's oversight efforts to minimize these losses have several limitations, including that its regulations and guidance do not address some significant sources of lost gas, despite available control technologies to potentially reduce them. Although EPA does not have a role in managing federal leases, it has voluntarily collaborated with the oil and gas industry through its Natural Gas STAR program, which encourages oil and gas producers to use gas saving technology, and through which operators reported venting reductions totaling about 0.4 percent of natural gas production in 2008."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To reduce lost gas, increase royalties, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, GAO recommends that Interior improve its venting and flaring data and address limitations in its regulations and guidance.

The Department of the Interior  (Interior) manages lands that account for nearly a quarter of domestic oil  and gas production. In fiscal year 2009, companies that leased these lands  paid about $6 billion in royalties to the federal government on the sale of  oil and gas produced offshore in federal waters, and about $3 billion for  production on federal lands, making revenues from federal oil and gas one  of the largest nontax sources of federal government funds.

Offshore, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as  amended, gives Interior the responsibility for leasing and managing  approximately 1.76 billion acres. BLM and BOEMRE are responsible for  issuing permits for oil and gas drilling; establishing guidelines for  measuring oil and gas production; conducting production inspections; and  generally providing oversight for ensuring that oil and gas companies  comply with applicable laws, regulations, and department policies. This  oversight includes the authority to ensure that firms produce oil and gas in  a manner that minimizes any waste of these resources. Together, BLM and  BOEMRE are responsible for oversight of oil and gas operations on more  than 28,000 producible leases.", "Interior\u2019s MRM program, which is managed under BOEMRE, is charged  with ensuring that the federal government receives royalties from the  operators that produce oil and gas from both onshore and offshore federal  leases. MRM is responsible for collecting royalties on all of the oil and gas  produced, with some allowances for gas lost during production.  Companies pay royalties to MRM based on a percentage of the cash value  of the oil and gas produced and sold. Currently, royalty rates for onshore  leases are generally 12.5 percent, while rates for offshore leases range  from 12.5 percent to 18.75 percent.", "The production of oil and gas on these federal leases involves several  stages, including the initial drilling of the well; clearing out liquid and mud  from the wellbore; production of oil and gas from the well; separation of  oil, gas, and other liquids; transfer of oil and gas to storage tanks; and  distribution to central processing facilities. Throughout this process,  operators typically vent or flare some natural gas, often intermittently in  response to maintenance needs or equipment failures. This intermittent  venting may take place when operators purge water or hydrocarbon  liquids that collect in well bores (liquid unloading) to maintain proper well  function or when they expel liquids and mud with pressurized natural gas  after drilling during the well completion process. BLM and BOEMRE  permit operators of wells to release routine amounts of gas during the  course of production without notifying them or incurring royalties on this  gas. In addition, production equipment often emits gas to maintain  proper internal pressure, or in some cases, the release of pressurized gas  itself is the power source for the equipment, particularly in remote areas  that are not linked to an electrical grid. This \u201coperational\u201d venting may  include the continuous releases of gas from pneumatic devices\u2013\u2013valves  that control gas flows, levels, temperatures, and pressures in the  equipment and rely on pressurized gas for operation\u2013\u2013as well as leaks, or  \u201cfugitive\u201d emissions. It also includes natural gas that vaporizes from oi condensate storage tanks or during the normal operation of natur al gas  l or  dehydration equipment. Until recently, the industry considered these  operational losses to be small, but recent infrared camera technology ha shed new light on these sources of vented gas, particularly from  condensate storage tanks. According to oil and gas industry  representatives, the cameras helped reveal that losses from storage tanks and fugitive emissions were much higher than they originally thought ( to video). In addition, recent calculations from EPA suggest that  emissions from completions and liquid unloading make larger  contributions to lost gas than previously thought possible. Operators can  use a number of techniques to estimate emissions based on gas and oil  characteristics and well operating conditions, such as temperature and  pressure, without taking direct measurements of escaping gas.", "While venting and flaring of natural gas is often a necessary part of  production, the lost gas has both economic and environmental  implications. On federal oil and gas leases, natural gas that is vented or  flared during production, instead of captured for sale, represents a loss of  royalty revenue for the federal government. Venting and flaring natural  gas also adds to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In general, flaring  emits CO, while venting releases methane, both of which the scientific  community agrees are contributing to global warming. Methane is  considered particularly harmful in this respect, as it is roughly 25 times  more potent by weight than CO Other  hydrocarbons and compounds in vented and flared gas can also harm air  quality by increasing ground-level ozone levels and contributing to  regional haze. Volatile organic compounds, present in vented gas, are  contributors to elevated ozone and haze, and ozone is a known  carcinogen, according to EPA analysis. In some areas in the western  United States, the oil and gas industry is a major source of volatile organic  compounds. According to EPA, in many western states, including in many  rural areas where there is substantial oil and gas production and limited  population, there have been increases in ozone levels, often exceeding  federal air quality limits. Interior is required to conduct environmental  impact assessments in advance of oil and gas leasing and generally works  with state environmental and air quality agencies to ensure that oil and gas  producers will comply with environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act  or Clean Water Act and the related implementing regulations. However,  the state agencies may be charged with maintaining the standards  established by the federal government in law and regulation, and often  have primary responsibility in this regard.", "While much of the natural gas that is vented and flared is considered to be  unavoidably lost, certain technologies and practices can be applied  throughout the production process to capture some of this gas according  to the oil and gas industry and EPA. The technologies\u2019 technical and  economic feasibility varies and sometimes depends on the characteristics  of the production site. For example, some technologies require a  substantial amount of electricity, which may be less feasible for remote  production sites that are not on the electrical grid. However, certain  technologies are generally considered technically and economically  feasible at particular production stages, including the following:    Drilling: Using \u201creduced emission\u201d completion equipment when cleaning  out a well before production, which separates mud and debris to capture  gas or condensate that might otherwise be vented or flared.", "Production: Installing a plunger lift system to facilitate liquid unloading.", "Plunger-lift systems drop a plunger to the bottom of the well, and when  the built-up gas pressure pushes the plunger to the surface, liquids come  with it. Most of the accompanying gas goes into the gas line rather than  being vented. Computerized timers adjust when the plunger is dropped  according to the rate at which liquid collects in the well, further  decreasing venting.", "Storage: Installing vapor recovery units that capture gas vapor from oil or  condensate storage tanks and send it into the pipeline.", "Dehydration: Optimizing the circulation rate of the glycol and adding a  flash tank separator that reduces the amount of gas that is vented into the  atmosphere.", "Pneumatic devices: Replacing pneumatic devices at all stages of  production that release, or \u201cbleed,\u201d gas at a high rate (high-bleed  pneumatics) with devices that bleed gas at a lower rate (low-bleed  pneumatics).", "In 2004, we reported that information on the extent to which venting and  flaring occurs was limited.

In implementing our recommendations for  offshore operators, BOEMRE now requires operators to report venting  and flaring separately and to install meters to measure this gas on larger  platforms. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) also collects  data from oil and gas producing states on venting and flaring, but our 2004  work found that EIA did not consider these state-reported data to be  consistent and, according to discussions with EIA officials, these data  have not improved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Estimates of Vented and Flared Natural Gas Vary, but Volumes Reported to OGOR Are Likely Underestimated because They Do Not Include Some Sources", "paragraphs": ["Available estimates of vented and flared natural gas on federal leases vary  considerably, and we found that estimates based on data from MRM\u2019s  OGOR data system likely underestimate these volumes because they  include fewer sources of emissions than other estimates, including EPA\u2019s  and WRAP\u2019s.

Onshore leases showed the largest variation between  OGOR data and others\u2019 estimates of natural gas venting and flaring.  Operators reported to MRM\u2019s OGOR system that about 0.13 percent of the  natural gas produced on onshore federal leases was vented or flared each  year between 2006 and 2008. BLM uses guidance from 1980, which sets  limits on the amount of natural gas that may be vented and flared on  onshore leases, requires operators to report vented and flared gas to  OGOR, and in some cases to seek permission before releasing gas.  Although the guidance states that onshore operators must report all  volumes of lost gas to OGOR, it does not enumerate the sources that  should be reported or specify how they should be estimated. Staff from  BLM told us that the reported volumes were from intermittent events like  completions, liquid unloading, or necessary releases after equipment  failures; however, operators did not report operational sources such as  venting from oil storage tanks, pneumatic valves, or glycol dehydrators. In  general, BLM staff said that they thought that vented and flared gas did not  represent a significant loss of gas on federal leases. In addition, we found a  lack of consistency across BLM field offices regarding their understanding  of which intermittent volumes of lost gas should to be reported to OGOR.  For example, staff from some of the offices said that they thought that  intermittent vented and flared gas was not to be reported if operators had  advance permission or where volumes were under BLM\u2019s permissible  limits, while others said that they thought that operators still needed to  report this gas. Our discussions with operators reflected this lack of  consistency from BLM field office staff. Operators we spoke with said that  they generally did not report operational sources, and in some cases did  not report intermittent sources as long as they were under BLM\u2019s  permissible limits for venting and flaring.", "In contrast, EPA\u2019s estimate of venting and flaring was approximately 4.2  percent of gas production on onshore federal leases for the same period  and consistently included both intermittent and operational sources. EPA  estimated these emissions using data on average nationwide oil and gas  production equipment and their associated emissions (see table 1). As  noted earlier, venting from operational sources had not previously been  seen as a significant contributor to lost gas. With these additional sources,  EPA\u2019s estimates are around 30 times higher than the volumes operators  reported to OGOR. According to EPA\u2019s estimates, the amount of natural  gas vented and flared on onshore leases totaled around 126 billion cubic  feet (Bcf) of gas in 2008. This amount is roughly equivalent to the natural  gas needed to heat about 1.7 million homes during a year, according to our  calculations. See figure 2 for a comparison between EPA\u2019s estimated gas  emissions and the volumes reported to OGOR as a percentage of gas  production on federal onshore leases.", "Similarly, analysis of WRAP data for five production basins in the  mountain west in 2006 indicated as much as 5 percent of the total natural  gas produced on federal leases was vented and flared. WRAP based its  estimates, in part, on a survey of the types of equipment operators were  using, and provided a detailed list of sources to be reported. WRAP\u2019s data  included similar sources as EPA\u2019s data, as well as estimates of emissions  from fugitive sources like leaking seals and valves. Although estimates  based on WRAP data varied from basin to basin\u2014between 0.3 and 5  percent\u2014they were consistently much higher than the volumes operators  reported to OGOR. The average vented and flared gas as a percentage of  production was 2.2 percent across the five basins. See table 2 for a list of  the key sources in one of the five basins.", "In figure 3, which compares estimates based on WRAP data with the  volumes operators reported to OGOR for 2006, for the Uinta basin, the  WRAP estimate was about 20 times higher than the volumes reported to  OGOR, and for two other basins (i.e., Denver-Julesburg and N. San Juan)  no volumes of vented and flared gas were reported to OGOR.", "Offshore leases. Offshore leases showed less variation between OGOR  data and others\u2019 estimates of natural gas venting and flaring than onshore  leases, but the volumes that operators reported to MRM\u2019s OGOR were still  much lower than the volumes they reported to BOEMRE\u2019s GOADS system  and estimates from EPA. Operators reported to OGOR that between 0.3  and 0.5 percent of the natural gas produced on offshore leases was vented  and flared each year from 2006 to 2008; however, they reported to GOADS  that they vented and flared about 1.4 percent\u2014about 32 Bcf\u2013\u2013of the  natural gas produced on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico in 2008.  Although regulations require offshore operators to report all sources of  lost gas to OGOR, BOEMRE officials said that that this did not include  fugitive emissions. Furthermore, these officials also said that operators  likely reported volumes from some operational sources as \u201clease-use\u201d gas  instead of including it in the venting and flaring data, thus contributing to  the differences between OGOR and GOADS. GOADS data included  sources similar to those included in EPA\u2019s and WRAP\u2019s data for onshore  production, including the same operational sources. Further, guidance to  operators for reporting to GOADS explicitly outlines the sources to be  reported and how they should be estimated, while guidance for OGOR  does not. Table 3 outlines the emission sources for volumes operators  reported to the GOADS system for 2008. In addition, EPA\u2019s offshore  estimates showed that around 2.3 percent of gas produced on offshore  federal leases\u2013\u2013as much as 50 Bcf\u2013\u2013was vented and flared every year from  2006 to 2008. According to our analysis of EPA\u2019s work, additional venting  from natural gas compressors, used to maintain proper pressure in  production equipment, accounted for the majority of the difference  between the offshore EPA and GOADS volumes.", "On several occasions BOEMRE has made comparisons between data on  vented and flared volumes in the OGOR and GOADS systems, according to  BOEMRE officials. In 2004, BOEMRE compared data from the 2000  GOADS study with data from OGOR for a subset of offshore leases and  found reported vented and flared volumes were not always in agreement\u2014 attributing this difference to different operator interpretations of GOADS  and OGOR reporting requirements. BOEMRE officials said they revised  reporting procedures for the 2005 GOADS study. More recently, BOEMRE  made similar comparisons between data from the 2008 GOADS study and  OGOR data for a subset of leases and found they were in closer  agreement. BOEMRE officials told us they will continue to make such  comparisons to try to ensure the accuracy of the data in each system. In  reporting volumes of vented and flared gas to both systems, operators can  choose from a broad array of software packages, models, and equations to  estimate emissions, and these techniques can yield widely varied results.  For example, one study found that various estimation techniques to  determine emissions from oil storage tanks either consistently  underestimated or overestimated vented volumes. OGOR reporting  instructions for both onshore and offshore operators, as noted, do not  specify how operators should estimate these volumes.", "As part of our review, we analyzed 2008 OGOR and GOADS data for the  Gulf of Mexico and found that the OGOR data likely underestimated the  volumes of vented and flared natural gas on federal offshore leases. To do  this analysis, we compared 2008 data from GOADS\u2019s vent and flare source  categories with OGOR data for the same categories\u2014looking at these  source categories allowed us to directly compare the two data systems. In  doing this analysis, we accounted for OGOR\u2019s exclusion of fugitive  emissions and the reporting of sources, like pneumatic valves, as lease-use  gas. Our analysis found that the volumes operators reported to OGOR\u2013\u2013 about 12 Bcf\u2013\u2013were much lower than the volumes operators reported to  GOADS\u2014about 18 Bcf. Neither we nor MRM and BOEMRE officials could  account for or explain these differences in the two data systems. BOEMRE  officials said that they are still working to improve reporting to OGOR and  GOADS and expect these two data systems to converge in the future.", "To improve reported data, BOEMRE recently released a final rule, in  response to the recommendations in our 2004 report, that requires  operators on larger offshore platforms to route vented and flared gas from  a variety of sources through a meter to allow for more accurate  measurement, among other things. BOEMRE officials said that these  meters would help to improve the accuracy of data reported to both  OGOR and GOADS. However, BOEMRE officials said they have had to  address questions from some operators who were not sure which sources  of vented gas should be routed through the newly required meters. In this  regard, these officials said it may be useful to enumerate the required  emission sources for reporting to OGOR in future guidance to offshore  operators. They also noted that BOEMRE is planning a workshop in  October 2011 to stress to operators the need for accurate reporting on  their submissions to both GOADS and OGOR systems. In a similar way,  EPA has taken action to improve the reporting of emissions from the oil  and natural gas industry. EPA recently proposed a greenhouse gas  reporting rule that would require oil and gas producers emitting over  25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to submit detailed data on  vented and flared gas volumes to allow EPA to better understand the  contribution of venting and flaring to national greenhouse gas emissions.  For onshore leases, the proposed EPA rule provides details on the specific  sources of vented and flared gas to be measured and proposes  standardized methods for estimating volumes of greenhouse gas emissions  where direct measurements are not possible. For offshore leases,  operators would use the GOADS system to report venting and flaring. Data  collection would begin in 2011 if the rule becomes finalized in 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Technologies Could Reduce About 40 Percent of Natural Gas Estimated to Be Lost to Venting and Flaring on Onshore Federal Leases, Potentially Increasing Federal Royalty Payments and Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "paragraphs": ["Data from EPA, supported by information obtained from technology  vendors and our analysis of WRAP data, suggest that about 40 percent of  natural gas estimated to be vented and flared on federal onshore leases  could be economically captured with currently available control  technologies, although some barriers to their increased use exist.

If, as EPA estimates, 40 percent of  this lost gas could have been economically captured and sold, federal  royalty payments could increase by approximately $23 million annually,  which represents about 1.8 percent of annual federal royalty payments on  natural gas.", "Reducing natural gas lost to venting and flaring from federal leases could  also reduce greenhouse gases to the atmosphere according to our  calculations. Because methane is about 25 times more potent as a  greenhouse gas over a 100-year period, and almost 72 times more potent  over a 20-year period according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change, reducing direct venting of natural gas to the atmosphere has a  significantly greater positive effect, in terms of global warming potential,  than does reducing flaring. Again using EPA\u2019s estimates, if a total of 98 Bcf  of natural gas was vented and 28 Bcf was flared annually, those releases  would account for about 41 million metric tons of carbon dioxide  equivalent released to the atmosphere, which would be roughly equivalent  to the emissions of almost 8 million passenger vehicles or about 10  average-sized coal-fired power plants. Capturing 40 percent of this volume  would result in emissions reductions of about 50 Bcf, which is equivalent  to the emissions of 3.1 million passenger vehicles or about 4 average-sized  coal-fired power plants, according to our analysis.", "Some EPA officials also told us that they believed that federal efforts to  reduce venting and flaring could also have a spillover effect\u2013\u2013that is, it  could lead operators to use these technologies on state and private leases  as well.

However, EPA officials told us  that opportunities for reducing emissions from venting and flaring from  offshore production platforms likely exist. For instance, EPA found that  various production components, including valves and compressor seals,  contribute significant volumes of fugitive emissions, but that these  emissions could be mitigated through equipment repair or retrofitting. One  estimate based on EPA analysis of 15 offshore platforms in 2008, suggests  that most of the gas lost through compressor seals could be recovered  economically\u2014saving about 70 percent of the overall gas they estimated to  be lost on those platforms.

If operators request permission to exceed these  limits, BLM is to assess the economic and technical viability of capturing  additional gas and require its capture when warranted. Although BLM  guidance sets limits on venting and flaring of natural gas and allows  flexibility to exceed them in certain cases, it does not address newer  technologies or all sources of lost gas. Specifically, BLM guidance is 30  years old and therefore does not address venting and flaring reduction  technologies that have advanced since it was issued. For example, since  the guidance was written, technologies have been developed to  economically reduce emissions from well completions and liquid  unloading\u2014namely the use of reduced emission completion and  automated plunger lift technologies respectively. These two sources of  emissions were important contributors to vented and flared volumes that  we discussed earlier. Despite this fact, the use of such technologies where  it is economic to do so is not covered in BLM\u2019s current guidance. In  general, BLM officials said that they thought the industry would use  venting and flaring reduction technologies if they made economic sense.  Similarly, new lower-emission devices could also reduce venting and  flaring from other sources of emissions that are not covered by BLM\u2019s  guidance, such as pneumatic valves or gas dehydrators\u2013\u2013two sources that  contribute to significant lost gas. In discussions with BLM staff about their  guidance, staff acknowledged that existing guidance was outdated given  current technologies and said that they were planning to update it by the  second quarter of 2012.", "Offshore leases. Like BLM, BOEMRE has regulations that limit the  allowable volumes of vented and flared gas from offshore leases to  minimize losses of gas from routine operations. Operators can also apply  for permission to exceed these limits and, like BLM, BOEMRE would  evaluate the economic and technical viability of capturing additional gas.  Further, BOEMRE inspects offshore platform facilities each year and, as  part of these inspections, reviews on-site daily natural gas venting  records. BOEMRE officials told us that the agency requires operators to  keep these venting records and that it uses them to, among other things,  identify any economically viable opportunities for an operator to install  control equipment. Overall BOEMRE officials said that operators were  required to install venting and flaring reduction equipment where  economic, even if they would make as little as $1 in net profit from the  captured gas. According to agency officials, due to the type of production  and operations offshore, reduction opportunities mostly consist of  installing vapor recovery units, and these officials said that they generally  believe that companies have installed such equipment where it is  economic to do so. Although BOEMRE conducts regular inspections, the  daily venting records do not include all sources of vented gas. For  example, emission estimates from sources of gas such as pneumatic valves  and glycol dehydrators are not included, and therefore inspectors are not  able to make assessments of the potential to reduce emissions from these  sources. Both of these sources were contributors to lost gas offshore from  the 2008 GOADS study, suggesting potential reduction opportunities.  BOEMRE officials said that the agency considers these sources lease-use  gas, and as a result, believed that they could not legally consider the  economic and technical viability of this gas and require its capture when  warranted. However, based on our review of BOEMRE regulations and  authorizing legislation, it appears that BOEMRE has the authority to  require operators to minimize the loss of this gas, including requiring its  capture where appropriate.

While BLM regulations authorize and direct BLM officials  to offer technical advice and issue orders for specific lease operations to  minimize waste, BLM does not explicitly assess options to minimize  waste from vented and flared gas before production. For example, we  identified two phases in advance of production where BLM could assess  venting and flaring reduction options\u2014during the environmental review  phase and when the operator applies to drill a new well. However, the  agency does not explicitly assess these options, or discuss them with  operators, during either phase. For example, during the environmental  review phase, BLM works with states to assess emissions from oil and gas  production, and that air quality assessment may include venting and  flaring reduction requirements. According to BLM officials, since states  generally have primary responsibility to implement and enforce air quality  standards, the standards drive these requirements, and states focus only  on the role venting and flaring plays in air pollution, rather than the  minimization of waste. Therefore in production basins where air quality  standards are being met, or where only minimal use of technology is  required to meet them, BLM would not assess venting and flaring  reduction technologies to the full extent that they could economically  reduce vented and flared gas. One official noted that some BLM officials  felt constrained in their ability to consider the use of venting and flaring  reduction technologies because of this. Similarly, during the phase when  operators apply to drill new wells, BLM assesses detailed technical and  environmental aspects of the project, but BLM officials told us their  assessment does not include a review of options to reduce venting and  flaring.", "Offshore leases. Similar to BLM, BOEMRE assesses venting and flaring  reduction options in advance of production to determine whether vented  and flared gas from offshore platforms would harm coastal air quality, but  again, the focus is on meeting air quality standards rather than assessing  whether gas can be economically captured. Therefore, when BOEMRE  does not anticipate harm to coastal air quality, as is often the case  according to officials, the agency does not further consider venting and  flaring reduction options at this phase.

As such, it could be  difficult for BLM to identify opportunities to reduce venting and flaring or  estimate the potential to increase the capture of gas that is currently  vented or flared. For example, while BLM guidance provides that the  natural gas vaporizing from storage tanks must be captured if BLM  determines recovery is warranted, BLM does not collect data on the use of  control technologies and available OGOR data do not contain the volumes  of lost gas from storage tanks. Thus BLM may be overlooking  circumstances where recovery could be warranted. In addition, according  to BLM officials we spoke with, although infrared cameras can be used to  identify sources of lost gas, BLM has not used them during inspections of  production facilities. Although relatively expensive, infrared cameras  allow users to rapidly scan and detect vented gas or leaks across wide  production areas.

Nonetheless,  based on our review of the GOADS data system, by not analyzing such  data, BOEMRE is not able to identify emission-reduction opportunities. As  a case in point, we found that emissions from pneumatic valves in the 2008  GOADS study made noticeable contributions to overall lost gas, which  might suggest the potential to expand the use of low-bleed pneumatics in  some cases. BOEMRE officials also noted that, unlike BLM, its inspectors  had used infrared cameras to look for obvious sources of vented and  flared gas in a few sample locations close to shore. In this regard, they said  expanded use of infrared cameras could be useful to help enforce their  new rule that requires the use of meters for vented and flared gas.

BOEMRE also uses GOADS as part of an  impact analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act.  GOADS data capture specific information on a variety of sources of air  pollutants and greenhouse gases resulting from offshore oil production.  BOEMRE provided us with actual volumes of natural gas released from  the vented and flared source categories. For the other sources, we used  the emissions that were reported in GOADS in tons of methane per year,  and we converted these to volumes of methane and then to natural gas,  assuming a 78.8 percent methane content for natural gas.

EPA\u2019s nationwide venting and flaring volumes were based on  publicly available empirical data on national oil and gas production for  2006, 2007, and 2008, combined with knowledge of current industry  practices, including usage rates and effectiveness of venting and flaring  reduction technologies. For example, EPA used data on the number of  well completions per year and data on the average venting per completion  to estimate a yearly nationwide total from that source, with similar  approaches used for estimating total venting and flaring from other key  sources. EPA adjusted its estimates to account for the industry\u2019s efforts  to control some venting and flaring emissions. EPA\u2019s analysis was limited  in some ways, however. For instance, lacking empirical data on actua l  nationwide rates of use of certain control technologies, EPA based its  analysis on anecdotal information in some cases.

These estimates may be conservative,  however, because they did not incorporate reductions from a number of  other potential venting and flaring opportunities catalogued by the Natural  Gas STAR program. These estimates were not based entirely on  comprehensive usage data collected from the oil and gas industry, but  were based, in part, on publicly available evidence collected through years  of experience with the oil and gas industry.
