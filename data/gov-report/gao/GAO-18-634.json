HHS-funded research centers monitor rural hospitals' profitability and other financial indicators, and study access to facilities and specific services. HHS uses the results of monitoring activities to inform future areas of research and disseminate information.", "GAO's analysis of data from HHS and an HHS-funded research center shows that 64 rural hospitals closed from 2013 through 2017. This represents approximately 3 percent of all the rural hospitals in 2013 and more than twice the number of closures of the prior 5-year period. GAO's analysis further shows that rural hospital closures disproportionately occurred in the South, among for-profit hospitals, and among hospitals that received the Medicare Dependent Hospital payment designation, one of the special Medicare payment designations for rural hospitals.", "According to literature GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed, rural hospital closures were generally preceded and caused by financial distress. In particular, rural hospitals that closed typically had negative margins that made it difficult to cover their fixed costs. According to these sources, financial distress has been exacerbated in recent years by multiple factors, including the decrease in patients seeking inpatient care and across-the-board Medicare payment reductions.

To identify additional  information on the characteristics of the rural hospitals that closed and  what is known about the factors that have contributed to those closures,  we conducted a literature review.

The intent was to control  Medicare costs by giving hospitals financial incentives to deliver services  more efficiently and reduce unnecessary use of inpatient services by  paying a hospital a predetermined amount.

CMS administers  five rural hospital payment designations, in which rural or isolated  hospitals that meet specified eligibility criteria receive higher  reimbursement for hospital services than they otherwise would have  received under Medicare\u2019s standard payment methodology. A rural  hospital may qualify as a Critical Access Hospital, Sole Community  Hospital, or Medicare Dependent Hospital\u2014each of which has  different eligibility criteria and payment methodologies. With the  exception of Critical Access Hospitals, rural hospitals may also qualify  as Low Volume Hospitals and Rural Referral Centers, in which eligible  hospitals receive additional payments or exemptions. The largest of  the five designations is the Critical Access Hospital program, which  represented 56 percent of rural hospitals in 2017 and pays eligible  small, rural hospitals based on their reported costs (instead of the  standard rates under the inpatient prospective payment system).

The largest of these is the Medicare Rural Hospital  Flexibility grant program, in which FORHP provides funds to states to  support Critical Access Hospitals to stabilize their finances, foster  innovative models of care, and support other improvement activities.  In 2017, 45 states received $25 million in Flex grants.

As of June 2018, the largest of these rural models and  demonstrations was Medicare\u2019s Accountable Care Organization  Investment Model. Groups of providers in rural and underserved  areas participating in this model, potentially including small hospitals,  agree to be held accountable for the cost and quality of care to their  Medicare patients. The model tests providing pre-paid shared savings  as an incentive for providers in rural and underserved areas to form  Accountable Care Organizations and for these organizations to  transition to arrangements with greater accountability for financial  performance.

One such factor was a decrease in  patients seeking inpatient care at rural hospitals due to the following:  Increased competition for the small volume of rural residents.  Rural residents may choose to obtain services from other health care  providers separate from the local rural hospital, for example from an  increasing number of federally qualified health centers or newer  hospital systems outside of the area. The competition for the small  volume of rural residents between rural hospitals and other health  care providers potentially increased due to the shift to paying for value  instead of volume, and technology changes. This increased  competition for a small volume of rural residents could explain  disproportionate closures among hospitals receiving the Low Volume  Hospital Medicare payment designation, hospitals that by definition  have a low Medicare volume and that research has found have lower  margins than other rural hospitals. In addition, representatives from  the American Hospital Association told us that technological advances  have allowed more services to be provided in outpatient settings.  For example, changes in health care technology have expanded the  provision of outpatient surgical procedures.", "Declining rural population. The years 2010 through 2016 marked  the first recorded period of rural population decline. According to  literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed, the recent  population decline in rural areas was likely associated with the recent  decline in rural residents seeking inpatient services.", "Another factor highlighted by literature we reviewed and stakeholders we  interviewed as contributing to rural hospitals\u2019 increased financial distress  was across-the-board Medicare payment reductions. Rural hospitals are  sensitive to changes to Medicare payments because, on average,  Medicare accounted for approximately 46 percent of their gross patient  revenues in 2016. A 2016 study found that Medicare Dependent  Hospitals\u2019 operating margins decreased each year from 2012 through  2014, which could explain the disproportionate number of closures among  the Medicare Dependent Hospital payment designation. The literature  we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed highlighted the recent  Medicare payments cuts as contributing to rural hospital closures, which  included the following:", "Reductions in nearly all Medicare reimbursements. Under  sequestration \u2013 the cancellation of budgetary resources under  presidential order implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended \u2013 each fiscal year  since 2013, nearly all Medicare\u2019s budget authority is subject to a  reduction not exceeding 2 percent, which is implemented through  reductions in payment amounts.

Under the Middle  Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Medicare bad debt  reimbursements for hospitals were reduced beginning in fiscal year  2013. According to stakeholders, Medicare bad debt cuts have been  one of the most important factors contributing to the recent increase in  rural hospital closures.", "The literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed also  identified factors that likely strengthened the financial viability of rural  hospitals. Chief among these factors was the increased Medicaid  eligibility and enrollment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act. A 2018 study found that Medicaid expansion was associated with  improved hospital financial performance and substantially lower likelihood  of closure, especially in rural markets and counties with large numbers of  uninsured adults before Medicaid expansion. Another 2017 study found  that from 2008-2009 and 2014-2015 the drop in uninsured rates  corresponded with states\u2019 decisions to expand Medicaid on or before  January 1, 2014. The increase in Medicaid coverage and decline in  uninsured were both largest in the small towns and rural areas of those  expansion states. Additionally, our analysis of data from the North  Carolina rural health research center and CMS shows that from 2013  through 2017, rural hospitals in states that had expanded Medicaid as of  April 2018 were less likely to close compared with rural hospitals in states  that had not expanded Medicaid (see fig. 5)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment.
