According to officials, ILAB takes steps to maximize competition, such as publishing Notices of Intent to give applicants more time to develop proposals.", "Incomplete documentation makes it difficult to determine if Labor is following its grant award procedures, including conducting due diligence on financial viability and past performance of applicants. Based on GAO's review of 26 grant award files, over half of the files were missing some documentation, and 4 were missing all pre-award documents (see figure). Officials said that the procurement office has been trying to improve the organization of the files so that it is easier to follow the steps of the award process. For example, procurement officials said they are trying to more consistently use a checklist to record the documents the office receives, such as past performance information. However, use of this checklist is not required, and Labor guidance does not clearly state what documents must be retained in award files.

ILAB officials said that office directors from both  the trade and labor office and child labor office meet every week with the  office of the deputy undersecretary for international affairs to discuss  issues. For example, trade and labor office officials told us a current  priority is building the capacity of other governments to enforce their labor  laws by, for instance, improving the capacity and skills of labor inspectors.  Officials also said that if there is a significant event, such as the garment  factory fires and factory collapse in Bangladesh, their priorities can adjust  to reflect new situations. In addition, officials from the child labor office  said that in the 1990s, they funded projects targeting child soldiers and  commercial sexual exploitation. However, they found that to have greater  impact, they needed to develop projects that intervene earlier, before  children become soldiers or sex workers. Officials told us they have  increased their focus on prevention in addition to removing children from  child labor.", "ILAB officials said the criteria they use for project development and  selection are not formally weighted and the importance of individual  criteria can vary depending on the situation. For example, ILAB officials  told us that regardless of the severity of a problem, they generally do not  provide assistance in a country where the government does not welcome  an ILAB project. ILAB officials told us they look for opportunities for  discernible impact and likelihood of success. They define success as not  only meeting the goals of the project, but also developing strategies that  could be applied more widely. Officials from the child labor office told us  that their main criterion is the nature and extent of exploitative child  labor, but other factors can take precedence in determining where to  provide technical assistance. For example, they do not necessarily target  their assistance to the countries with the highest incidences of child labor  or with the worst forms of child labor. The projects we reviewed, for  instance, include countries where the percentage of children working  varies from about 7 percent in Panama to 50 percent in Ethiopia,  according to recent statistics in ILAB\u2019s Findings on the Worst Forms of  Child Labor. However, child labor officials said that, even taking into  account other factors, their projects generally result in a focus on the  worst forms of child labor or hazardous work. For example, of the six  solicitations for direct services in our sample that were posted in 2011  and 2012, half explicitly mention children engaged in the \u201cworst form of  child labor\u201d or \u201chazardous work\u201d as the target population.

ILAB guidance  also states that they will consult with stakeholders, including other U.S.  government agencies and the U.S. embassy in the target country, and  obtain written approval from the host country government to implement  the project. According to ILAB guidance, Labor publishes a Notice of  Intent on the grants.gov web portal to notify the public and potential  bidders that ILAB intends to issue a solicitation.

The panel uses a competitive range, established prior  to the review of the applications, in its evaluation process to screen out  applicants that do not achieve a minimum point value. According to ILAB  officials, the main criteria they use to evaluate applications are (1) project  design and budget, (2) organizational capacity, and (3) personnel and  project management. The point value assigned to each criterion varies  across solicitations depending on the type of project; for example, a  global project may assign more points to organizational capacity than a  single country project. Applicants\u2019 past performance is assessed under  the organizational capacity criterion. The procurement office asks the  panel chair for questions to send to the applicants\u2019 references and then  provides the references\u2019 answers on past performance to the evaluation  panel. Officials also said that they assess the management systems and  capacity of applicants to manage grant funds during the panel evaluation  by examining the audit submitted by the applicant, budget narrative and  outputs-based budget, past performance, management structure for the  project, and organizational capacity.

The request for a  noncompetitive or limited competition award is then sent to the Labor  Procurement Review Board which is composed of representatives from  various Labor offices.

In addition, child labor grants, have  many different components, such as direct services, research, and  capacity building. In addition, the difficult implementing environment for  some projects decreases the pool of applicants. For example, it can be  difficult to find organizations that are willing to work in environments that  are remote, contain security concerns, or lack basic infrastructure.  Furthermore, according to ILAB officials, the size and complexity of grants  are based on several factors, including ensuring that the grant has  sufficient resources to address the problems identified in the solicitation.  Moreover, according to ILAB officials, large grants are generally the same  amount of work and involve the same procedures to develop and oversee  as small grants. ILAB officials said that some potential grantees stated  that ILAB\u2019s grants were too large for their organization. Those grantees  said they had the capacity to manage a $100,000 grant but not a $10  million grant, which generally has a large multifaceted scope that will be  implemented in multiple locations.

The objectives of this report examined (1) how ILAB develops  its technical assistance projects; (2) how ILAB selects recipients of its  funding; and (3) how Labor manages its grant award documentation.", "To describe how ILAB develops its technical assistance projects, we  reviewed operations manuals of the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor,  and Human Trafficking (OCFT, referred to here as the child labor office)  and the Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA, referred to here as the  trade and labor office). These manuals contain chapters on project  selection criteria, planning, and design. In addition, we reviewed ILAB\u2019s  three annual reports on international child labor and forced labor:  Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor; the List of Goods Produced  by Child Labor or Forced Labor; and the List of Products Produced by  Forced or Indentured Child Labor. We met with knowledgeable officials  from the child labor and trade and labor offices to understand how they  develop project ideas.", "We also selected a nongeneralizable sample of 26 projects out of a total  of 98 projects that were active in calendar years 2011, 2012, and 2013.  To select this sample, we used lists of projects from fiscal years 2003  through 2012. These project lists are maintained by the child labor and  trade and labor offices in ILAB. To determine the reliability of these lists,  we met with the responsible officials and discussed how the lists are  updated and maintained. We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting ILAB\u2019s funding and selecting our  sample of awards to review. We selected the sample based on several  factors, such as dollar value and geographic location. The sample  represents about 44 percent of ILAB funding over these years and  includes 7 of the 9 grants with the highest dollar value ($10 million or  above). Our sample includes projects that are single-country;  multicountry; completed; ongoing; direct services; capacity building; and  in most geographic regions. Because our sample is nongeneralizable, it  cannot be used to make inferences about the population of ILAB grants.", "To describe how ILAB selects recipients of its funding, we reviewed Labor  guidance for the evaluation panels that review and assess the grant  applications and the procurement office checklist for determining that  applicants responded to the solicitation. We also met with knowledgeable  officials from ILAB to discuss procedures for reviewing solicitations and  evaluating applicants, the process for awards made using less than full  and open competition, and steps ILAB takes to maximize competition. In  addition, we met with grantees at their headquarters in Washington, D.C.,  and in Ecuador, Peru, Cambodia, and Thailand, to obtain their  perspectives on the grant application process. We selected these  locations based on, among other factors, size of grant, geographic  location, and phase of the project.", "To examine ILAB\u2019s management of grant award records, we developed a  data collection instrument that we used to review the grant award files in  our sample for key documents, including excluded parties list results,  Labor Procurement Review Board approval for less than full and open  competition, panel evaluation worksheets for assessing competitive grant  applications, and past performance information. We identified these  documents based on ILAB policy documents such as guidance for the  solicitation evaluation panels, the applicant evaluation worksheet  template, and the solicitation for cooperative agreement template; OMB  circular A-110; and interviews with Labor officials. In addition to the file  review, we obtained and reviewed relevant documents such as Office of  Procurement Service memos; the Department of Labor Management  Series chapter on grant and procurement management; the procurement  office file checklist; and Retention and Access Requirements for Records,  29 C.F.R. \u00a7 97.42. We met with officials from ILAB and the Labor  procurement office to discuss issues related to award file documentation.  We used GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government to assess Labor\u2019s grant award process including  management of the award file documentation.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2013 to May 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: ILAB Criteria for Developing New Projects", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (trade and labor office) has several  criteria for project development, including:", "Support for the broader foreign policy goals of the U.S. government as  reflected in various trade legislation and other policy initiatives.", "Commitment by the stakeholders, including the government and  workers' and employers' organizations, to protect the basic rights of  workers and to the proposed project itself.", "Demonstrated need for technical assistance.", "Feasibility.", "Sustainability.", "Ability of the host government to absorb project resources.", "Ability to leverage additional support.", "Identification of a unique opportunity to provide resources that  generate synergy and complement a national program or programs of  other donor agencies.", "Anticipated risk.", "The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (child  labor office) also has several criteria for project development, including:", "Nature and extent of exploitative child labor in a country.", "Contribution of proposed project to advancing the U.S. government\u2019s  foreign policy objectives.", "Extent of a foreign government\u2019s acknowledgement of and  commitment to eliminating the worst forms of child labor.", "Past performance of Labor-funded child labor projects in a given  country.", "Presence and support of U.S. government field operations (i.e., U.S.  embassies and the U.S. Agency for International Development).", "Likelihood that project interventions will have long-term and  sustainable impact in reducing the incidence of exploitative child labor  in the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact:", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements:", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Leslie Holen (Assistant Director),  Rachel Girshick, Jeff Isaacs, Jill Lacey, Grace Lui, Seyda Wentworth, and  Christina Werth made key contributions to this report.
