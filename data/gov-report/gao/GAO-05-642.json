However, State has not developed a comprehensive strategy that clearly identifies safety and security requirements and resources needed to protect U.S. officials and their families abroad from terrorist threats outside the embassy. State officials raised a number of challenges related to developing and implementing such a strategy. They also indicated that they have recently initiated an effort to develop a soft targets strategy. As part of this effort, State officials said they will need to address and resolve a number of legal and financial issues. Three State initiated investigations into terrorist attacks against U.S. officials outside of embassies found that the officials lacked the necessary hands-on training to help counter the attack. The investigations recommended that State provide hands-on counterterrorism training and implement accountability measures to ensure compliance with personal security procedures. After each of these investigations, State reported to Congress that it planned to implement the recommendations, yet we found that State's hands-on training course is not required, the accountability procedures have not been effectively implemented, and key embassy officials are not trained to implement State's counterterrorism procedures. State instituted a program in 2003 to improve security at schools, but its scope has not yet been fully determined. In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, Congress earmarked $29.8 million for State to address security vulnerabilities against soft targets, particularly at overseas schools. The multiphase program provides basic security hardware to protect U.S. officials and their families at schools and some off-compound employee association facilities from terrorist threats. However, during our visits to posts, regional security officers were unclear about which schools could qualify for security assistance under phase three of the program. State's program to protect U.S. officials and their families at their residences is primarily designed to deter crime, not terrorism. The Residential Security program includes basic security hardware and local guards, which State officials said provide effective deterrence against crime, though only limited deterrence against a terrorist attack. To minimize the risk and consequences of a residential terrorist attack, some posts we visited limited the number of U.S. officials living in specific apartment buildings. To provide greater protection against terrorist attacks, some posts we visited used surveillance detection teams in residential areas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. government officials and their families living and working overseas are  at risk from terrorist threats.

The act directs the Secretary of State to develop and implement  policies and programs, including funding levels and standards, to provide  for the security of U.S. government operations of a diplomatic nature and  establishes within State the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS). The  mission of DS is to provide a safe and secure environment for the conduct  of U.S. foreign policy. Within DS, there are a number of offices that address  and implement security policies and practices to protect facilities and  personnel at posts. At posts abroad, the chiefs of mission are responsible  for the protection of personnel and accompanying family members at the  missions. Additionally, regional security officers (RSOs) administer all  aspects of security programs at posts.

State has required that its  officials attend predeparture security briefings, such as Serving Abroad for  Families and Employees, since 1987. The briefing covers a variety of post- related issues, including alcoholism, fires, crime, sexual assaults, and  terrorist surveillance. Once officials arrive at their posts, they receive  country-specific security briefings by the RSO. In addition, RSOs can  provide threat-specific security briefings on a case-by-case basis.

State offers DSAC as an elective to post officials and spouses going  to high- and critical-threat posts. State does not track the number of  officials who have taken DSAC; thus it is not clear how many officials have  received this training. State officials estimate that 10 percent to 15 percent  of department officials have taken the course, and this appears consistent  with our findings at the five posts we visited. DSAC consists of 2 days of  surveillance detection training, 2 days of counterterrorism driving, and 1  day of emergency medical training.", "During our visits to five posts, we found significant disparities in the levels  of security briefings and training of post personnel.

We found that post officials from law enforcement, intelligence, and  defense communities had generally received rigorous hands-on training in  areas such as surveillance detection, counterterrorism driving, emergency  medical procedures, and weapons handling. Officials who had completed  DSAC-type training agreed that hands-on training was needed to give  people the skills and confidence to identify and respond to terrorist threats.  In contrast, relatively few other officials, including those from State, had  received DSAC-type counterterrorism training. For example, we found that  roughly 10 percent of State Department officials indicated they had taken  hands-on training; the figure was even smaller for other employees.  Officials gave several reasons for not attending DSAC: they were not aware  the course was offered, did not believe they were eligible, or were under  pressure to quickly transfer to their new posts. They also told us that the  course often conflicted with other training offered by State.", "Senior DS officials said they recognize that security briefings, like Serving  Abroad for Families and Employees, are no longer adequate to protect  against current terrorist threats.

The proposal would provide  training, at an estimated cost of about $3.6 million, to about 775 officials,  including 95 eligible family members, from all agencies working at critical- threat posts. DS officials said that DSAC training should also be required  for all officials, but that issues related to costs, adequacy of training  facilities, and the ability to obtain Overseas Security Policy Board  agreement were constraining factors.

However, State never implemented this accountability  mechanism. According to State officials, they dropped the accountability  features out of concern that the review would be too time consuming.", "We found that State had not issued any guidance on how these new policies  and practices should be implemented or monitored. For example, the  Foreign Affairs Manual does not specify how managers are to provide for  the \u201creasonable\u201d oversight of their staff\u2019s personal security practices or  how to provide for compliance and oversight. As a result, post staff were  not sure how these new policies should be implemented. In addition, RSOs  lacked guidance on how to promote these new policies. RSOs and  supervisors stated that they have no responsibility or authority to monitor  post employees for compliance with the new security policies, and the  officials we spoke with at five posts said they did not have, and did not  want, this responsibility.", "In discussing our preliminary findings with DS officials, they noted a range  of challenges associated with improving security for officials outside the  post. State\u2019s primary focus has been, and will continue to be, protecting  U.S. officials inside the post since posts are considered higher value targets  symbolically and because of the potential for mass casualties. In explaining  why posts were not aware of the new personal security regulations, DS  officials noted that posts were often overwhelmed by work and may have  simply missed the cables and changes in the Foreign Affairs Manual. They  also noted that changes like this take time to be implemented globally.", "Nonetheless, improving security outside the embassy is critical and,  according to a number of State officials, improvements in this area must  start with the ambassador and the deputy chief of mission.

For example, based on our observations  at the training courses and a review of the course material, the ambassador,  deputy chief of mission, and RSO training courses did not address how  State\u2019s personal security guidelines can be best promoted.

Each post is responsible for designing and implementing its  Residential Security program based on factors that include host country  law enforcement capabilities, the post-specific threat environment, and  available funding. The Residential Security program includes basic security  hardware, such as alarms, shatter-resistant window film, access control  measures, and local guards. As the threat increases, hardware and guard  services can be correspondingly increased at the residences. The standards  used to determine the minimum acceptable level of residential security  protection are guided by threat ratings established in the Security  Environment Threat List. For the Residential Security program, DS uses the  standards for the threat rating categories of political violence and crime,  though not for terrorism. Standards for residential security also differ  depending on the types of residences.", "Security at the residences can be augmented by the use of local guards.  Local guard functions vary by threat ratings for crime and political violence  and by the type of residence protected. The local guard program for  residential security may include mobile patrols, quick reaction forces, and  stationary guards. Figure 9 provides an illustration of a stationary guard at  a residence. The mobile patrols are assigned responsibility for visiting  residences periodically, and respond to alarms at residences or when  emergencies arise. All posts we visited utilized local guards for some  aspect of residential security; some posts, due to the higher threat levels,  had more comprehensive local guard coverage than others. For example,  all posts we visited had mobile patrols for residential neighborhoods, while  only two posts had stationary guards at residential housing. Moreover,  some posts with mostly apartment housing had a guard or doorman  stationed at the entrance of the building to provide a first line of security,  primarily against crime.", "Post officials, including RSOs, told us that the Residential Security program  provides effective deterrence against crime and could provide some  deterrence against a terrorist attack, though State officials felt it could  provide little or no deterrence against a terrorist attack. State and post  officials indicated that the biggest concern at residences, when considering  the type of security to implement, has been the threat from crime.", "However, as the threat environment has changed and terrorists have  changed tactics from kidnapping to detonating car bombs outside of  residences, some posts have changed their housing profile. Some posts we  visited limited the number of U.S. officials living in specific apartments or  neighborhoods to minimize the risk and consequences of a residential  terrorist attack. For example, post management at two of the posts we  visited have decided to limit the number of Americans in apartment  housing to 25 percent of the entire building population to minimize the  impact of a car bomb detonated outside residential housing. Some senior  DS officials told us that the best residential scenario for posts is to have a  variety of housing options, including apartments and single-family homes.

The  mission of the program is to enhance the ability of all posts to detect  preoperational terrorist surveillance directed against primary diplomatic  facilities, such as the embassy. According to State\u2019s Surveillance Detection  Operations Field Guide and the Foreign Affairs Handbook, surveillance  detection units can be used to cover other facilities, such as off-compound  employee association facilities and residences, only if there is a specific  threat directed against such areas. In addition, surveillance detection can  be used to cover large official functions.", "At many of the posts we visited, the RSOs were routinely utilizing  surveillance detection units to cover areas outside key embassy facilities,  such as residences, school bus stops and routes, and schools where U.S.  embassy dependents attend. RSOs told us that the Surveillance Detection  program is instrumental in providing deterrence against potential terrorist  attacks. Furthermore, some RSOs told us that the use of surveillance  detection at school bus stops and outside schools provides a sense of  comfort for post officials and their spouses who have dependents in  international or American schools. During our post visits, some RSOs  argued that the current program guidelines are too restrictive and that  State should allow flexibility in using surveillance detection for areas  outside the embassy deemed appropriate by the RSO.

We agree that State does not have an official definition of soft targets  and modified the text, where appropriate, to make this clear. Given this  absence, we relied upon a State Department travel warning that  included the specific language used in the draft report.  2. State indicated that, had we used a narrower definition of soft targets, it  could have dramatically changed the conclusions of our work. We  disagree. Our report focuses on State Department efforts to protect  U.S. officials and their families from terrorist threats, at their homes,  recreation centers, schools, commuting, and living outside the embassy  compounds. 3. Although State, in its comments, indicated that it has long had a  \u201csecurity strategy\u201d to protect U.S. officials and their families outside the  embassy, it was never able to produce such a document. In addition,  while State has a number of programs and activities designed to protect  U.S. officials and their families at soft target areas, senior DS officials  agreed that these programs are not tied together in an overall strategy.  In January 2005, State agreed that it should develop a comprehensive  soft target strategy, and as part of that effort, undertake a formal  evaluation of how existing programs can be more effectively integrated  and whether new programs might be needed to fill any potential gaps.  State said it planned to complete the strategy by June 1, 2005. 4. We have taken out reference to \u201cother Americans\u201d throughout the  report, except in reference to the Soft Targets Program, which covers  U.S. children and teachers who have no affiliation with the U.S.  government. We have also modified the scope and methodology to  show that our focus is \u201cprimarily\u201d on the protection of U.S. government  officials and their families. 5. We have clarified the sentence by indicating that RSOs were unclear  about which schools could qualify for security assistance under phase  three of the Soft Targets Program. Phase three, because it can  encompass all schools in a country with one or more Americans, can  potentially include vastly more schools than in phase one or two of the  program. We recognize that the department\u2019s Soft Targets Working  Group is currently defining parameters for which schools could qualify  under phase three, in addition to identifying other vulnerable off- compound facilities. We believe that a soft target strategy could help  identify which schools most urgently need security improvements.  6. We clarified the report to stipulate that these reports focused on the  security of U.S. officials. 7. See GAO comment 1. We have also changed the word \u201cdefines\u201d to  \u201cconsiders.\u201d", "8.", "It is not uncommon for GAO to clarify, add specificity and thus make  adjustments or changes to a requested engagement, provided that these  adjustments and changes are discussed and agreed upon by the  requester.

The appropriations subcommittee report language is within the scope  of the GAO review because it covers U.S. officials and their dependents,  which is the primary focus of our review. Moreover, this language was  based on testimony provided by AFSA out of concern that the  department was not providing adequate security for U.S. diplomats and  their families while they are outside of the embassy compound. GAO  agrees that the subcommittee report language is not binding and we are  not judging the department\u2019s performance against this language.  However, we agree with the subcommittee, as State has, that State  should develop a comprehensive soft targets strategy.  13.
