Depreciation costs accounted for the majority of the fixed costs, as table 3 shows.", "Our analysis showed that a charge of $655 per lithotripsy procedure was not sufficient to recover the center\u2019s fixed costs. This can be seen by comparing the revenues such a charge would produce against the total fixed costs of $360,387 that Albuquerque incurred. Collecting $655 for each of the 155 lithotripsy procedures conducted in 1993 would recover about $101,525, leaving a shortfall of about $258,862 or $1,670 per procedure.", "This shortfall occurred because the Albuquerque center\u2019s charges were based on an unrealistically high estimate of the total number of lithotripsy procedures it would perform in 1993.

Using such a long recovery period increases the risk that its costs will not be recovered before the treatment of kidney stones moves on to new equipment or other types of medical procedures. In this regard, Southwest Therapies told us that they are depreciating their lithotripters over a 5-year period.", "VA policy calls for annual depreciation costs to be calculated using the actual purchase price, less any assigned salvage value, divided by the number of years of expected useful life. In its 1993 depreciation determination, the Albuquerque center assumed a 5-year useful life, with no resulting salvage value. On this basis, the annual depreciation for the lithotripter was $249,645, which represents one-fifth of the lithotripter\u2019s purchase price ($1,248,225). Because of the low utilization, the center realized only $120,360 of the almost $500,000 (less than 25 percent) expected during the first 2 years of operation. As a result, the center has yet to realize $1,127,865 in depreciation costs.", "VA policy does not provide guidance for developing a change in the estimated useful life of equipment. However, generally accepted accounting principles provide that when a change in estimated useful life is determined to be necessary, the remaining value of the asset is to be divided by the remaining estimated life. In setting the 1994 charges, the center\u2019s officials extended their estimate of the lithotripter\u2019s useful life from 5 years to 9 years. This gave the center 7 years (1994-2000) to depreciate the remaining acquisition costs rather than the 3 years remaining from their original estimate of a 5-year useful life.", "This change should have resulted in an annual depreciation cost of $161,124, or a per-procedure charge of $322 spread over the center\u2019s annual workload estimate of 500 procedures, if done in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, the center\u2019s officials decided to ignore the first 2 years of accumulated depreciation realized ($120,360) and divided the total acquisition costs of $1,248,225 by the estimated 7 years of remaining useful life. This resulted in an annual depreciation cost of $178,318, or a per-procedure charge of $357 spread over 500 procedures annually. In effect, this approach would fully depreciate the lithotripter\u2019s costs in a little over 6 years.", "To illustrate the effects of these assumptions on the center\u2019s basic lithotripsy charge, we evaluated what would happen if the center had used a more reasonable workload estimate of 223 procedures (computed as suggested by VA\u2019s policy) rather than 500 and a depreciation period of 5 years (as used in 1993 pricing structure) rather than 9 years. In all, changing the assumptions in this way would result in a 1994 charge of about $3,271 rather than $1,451. For the lithotripter and technician, the charge would rise from $658 to about $2,168, of which $1,686 represents depreciation costs.

For example, a hospital may have a different charge for certain types of insured patients and those paying individually. In addition, an insurer may have a policy of not paying beyond a specified amount, even if the hospital\u2019s charge is higher. Also, one insurer may negotiate a rate that is different from the rate the hospital submits to other insurers or to individual patients.", "For most of 1993, UNM appears to have greatly benefited by its contract with VA. While UNM paid the Albuquerque VA center only $1,469 for each procedure, UNM\u2019s lithotripsy charge to individuals and insurance companies was the highest in the area. UNM kept some or all of the savings in the form of increased revenues. Table 6 shows the breakdown of charges under the most prevalent UNM rate during 1993 and under one of the private hospital/Southwest Therapies packages. While UNM\u2019s total charges under the two packages were the highest, the charges were relatively comparable ($9,029 vs. $7,977). However, the breakdown of charges for service components shows major differences, two in particular. First, the center\u2019s charge of $755 for the lithotripter and technician was about one-quarter of Southwest Therapies\u2019 charge of $2,920. Second, the combined Albuquerque VA\u2019s and UNM\u2019s charges of $5,750 for facilities support were over twice the $2,617 charge of the private hospital.", "Toward the end of 1993, changes in UNM\u2019s pricing for lithotripsy services may have had the effect of passing the savings to UNM patients, insurers, and health maintenance organizations in the form of lower rates. In October 1993, UNM reduced its existing charge for lithotripsy from $9,029 to $6,950, a 23-percent reduction. UNM\u2019s Chief Financial Officer said that UNM did so after deciding that its charges for lithotripsy were too high. The reduction came entirely from UNM\u2019s portion of facilities support.", "At about the same time, UNM also negotiated an even lower lithotripsy rate of $3,550 with a local health maintenance organization. This 49-percent reduction in the $6,950 rate, came from two places: a reduction of $1,180 in the urologist\u2019s fee, and a reduction of $2,220 in UNM\u2019s facilities support charges. Table 7 shows a breakdown of these two new rates.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Vice President for Health Services, UNM, explained the rationale for the reduction. A large percentage of the discount, she said, is because patients enrolled in this health maintenance organization have their prelithotripsy work-up and postlithotripsy follow-up performed by private urologists, and the UNM urologists and UNM clinical facilities are engaged for only that portion of care directly associated with delivery of lithotripsy treatment. She noted that the remainder of the discount is associated with increased volume, case management, and similar factors that ordinarily provide the basis for offering discounts from usual and customary charges to managed care organizations.", "During 1994, UNM discussed the possibility of providing lithotripsy services with another health maintenance organization. This health maintenance organization purchases lithotripsy from one of the private Albuquerque hospitals. The negotiations have included a number of factors, including cost.

This occurs because the center\u2019s price is only one of many variables, including access and re-treatment rates, that may affect decisions about which providers of lithotripsy services to use.", "On the basis of price, it appears that the Albuquerque center could comply with VA policy by charging enough to fully recover its costs and still offer a price that is competitive with the services provided by Southwest Therapies and other providers. For example, the center\u2019s 1994 price for use of the lithotripter and technician is $658; Southwest Therapies\u2019 price is $2,920. If the center charged a price that fully recovered costs within 5 years, the charge for this portion of its services would be about $2,168\u2014still below Southwest Therapies.", "Likewise, it appears, on the basis of price, that UNM could pay the Albuquerque center for the full costs and still charge insurers and others a price that is competitive in the Albuquerque market.

If the center charged a price for its lithotripter and technician ($2,168) and facilities support and anesthesiology ($1,103) that fully recovered costs within 5 years, the charge to UNM would need to increase by about $1,820 over the $1,451 now charged. If UNM passed on all of these costs to patients and insurers, its regular charge would increase to about $8,770.", "In theory, patients have the flexibility to choose among the various lithotripsy providers. Clearly, patients who pay their own medical bills or who have medical insurance, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield, have greater latitude in selecting providers. If they belong to a health maintenance organization, patients seeking lithotripsy treatment may have less choice in where they can go to obtain services. Such organizations may have contracts with specific hospitals for such services. For example, HealthPlus, a local organization, contracts for services from Kaseman Presbyterian Hospital.

The lower charge could recover initial equipment acquisition costs over a 9-year period, whereas the higher charge could achieve full recovery in 5 years.

He explained that this practice involves a different methodology for determining the amount of equipment depreciation costs to be recovered per procedure than the one previously used in 1993 and 1994. In 1993 and 1994, the center used a methodology that allocated the equipment acquisition costs ($1,248,225) over the number of procedures to be actually performed during the equipment\u2019s useful life (9 years). For example, the center expected to recover $178,318 in each of the 9 years and, using a projected workload of 500 procedures in 1994, included a charge of $357 in its basic lithotripsy price ($1,451) for that year.", "The 1995 methodology bases the depreciation charge on the number of procedures the equipment is capable of performing during its useful life. In this case, the center estimates that the equipment can perform 4,500 procedures in its life and, as such, decided to recover depreciation costs of $250 per procedure, or 1/4,500 of the equipment acquisition cost ($1,248,225 minus salvage value of $124,823).", "We find the Secretary\u2019s approval of this methodology to be troublesome for several reasons. In general, it exposes the medical center (and taxpayers) to an unreasonably high risk of a large unrecovered equipment acquisition cost; ignores local market conditions, which seem to indicate that a faster recovery of equipment cost (and lower risk of unrecovered costs) is possible; and ignores the impact that such pricing practices may have on the competitive environment in the Albuquerque lithotripsy market."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Full Recovery of Costs", "paragraphs": ["The Albuquerque medical center\u2019s 1995 pricing methodology would result in a slower recovery of equipment acquisition costs than the center\u2019s previous pricing practice\u2014a situation that greatly increases the likelihood of potentially large unrecovered costs.

This seems unrealistic in that (1) the manufacturer has guaranteed parts for and maintenance of the lithotripter for only 10 years and (2) advances in medical technology would likely render the equipment obsolete well before the end of 25 years.", "It appears that VA will need an almost three-fold increase in utilization (about 500 procedures) if it is to fully recover costs within 9 years under its pricing policy.

Two key assumptions in the center\u2019s calculations make it unlikely that this rate will be sufficient for VA to recover the costs of providing lithotripsy services to UNM patients.", "The first assumption is the estimate of the number of procedures that will be performed. The center estimated the number as 500. As of June 30, 1994, however\u2014halfway through the year\u2014the center had performed 97 procedures.", "The second assumption is the length of time for recovering the lithotripter\u2019s cost. The center used an approach that had the effect of extending the total period for recovering the cost to 9 years\u20144 years longer than the period used for the 1993 estimate.", "This appendix compares the center\u2019s estimated charges for the major cost components of its basic lithotripsy service to the amounts that would be chargeable, using different assumptions regarding workload and investment recovery period.

The center, however, will experience a significant shortfall if it performs less than half of the expected procedures, a situation that appears likely given the workload generated during the first half of 1994. As the following sections show, most of the shortfall will be related to the center\u2019s charge for operating the lithotripter and only a small portion will be attributable to its facilities support charge."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lithotripter and Technician", "paragraphs": ["Under the assumptions we used, the Albuquerque center\u2019s charge for its lithotripter and technician would be $2,168 rather than the $658 charged.

Two main factors contributed. One was the methodology the center used for changing the lithotripter\u2019s useful life. The other was the estimated number of lithotripsy procedures over which the 1994 depreciation amount could be spread.", "In determining the annual amount of depreciation for the pricing computation, the center made two adjustments to its 1993 procedures.First, it used the acquisition price of the equipment rather than the amount that had been obligated to purchase the equipment. As we pointed out in appendix V, this was the more appropriate figure to use as a starting point. Second, it changed the lithotripter\u2019s useful life from 5 years to 9 years. VA policy does not provide guidance for developing a change in the estimated useful life of equipment, but general accounting procedure does. The method to be used is as follows: when a change in estimated useful life is determined to be necessary, the remaining value of the asset, less any salvage value assigned, is to be divided by the remaining estimated life.", "The center did not follow this approach. Instead, it based its calculation on the full value of the asset (its original acquisition cost) and divided by the remaining 7 years of the 9-year useful life. In so doing, the center determined that an annual depreciation cost of $178,318 over 7 years would recover the initial acquisition costs of $1,248,225. Given the center\u2019s estimated annual workload of 500 procedures, officials determined that a charge of $357 would be sufficient to realize the annual depreciation cost.", "The effect of this approach was to overstate the portion of the lithotripter\u2019s cost to be depreciated each year, as well as the resulting charge per procedure. Because the center\u2019s lithotripter had been operational for 2 years, and 295 procedures had been performed since that date, the center should have recognized an accumulated depreciation of $120,360, based on the $408 depreciation amount per procedure in the original rate (see table V.1). By adjusting the initial acquisition costs to reflect this accumulated depreciation, the remaining value of the lithotripter would be $1,127,865, which represents the amount to be depreciated over the remaining useful life. This approach would have yielded a depreciation charge of $322 per procedure over the center\u2019s estimated workload of 500 procedures.", "By ignoring the accumulated depreciation, the center would recover more than the cost of the asset over its useful life. For example, if 500 procedures are performed for each of the next 7 years, the center would have a total recognized depreciation of $120,360 more than the $1,248,225 purchase price.", "Our recalculation of the amount to be depreciated is based on a 5-year useful life rather than a 9-year life. We used this shorter period in order to remain more consistent with the center\u2019s previous methodology for determining costs and because we regard 5 years as a more appropriate period for recovering costs on equipment that can quickly become technologically obsolete even though it is still operable. Since 2 years of the period have gone by, 3 years remain over which to depreciate the equipment. We adjusted the purchase price by the $120,360 in accumulated depreciation and divided the remaining balance by the remaining 3 years to obtain an annual amount of depreciation of $375,955.", "This compares with the center\u2019s computation of $178,318 in depreciation to be recovered during 1994.", "The other adjustment we made was to divide our annual depreciation amount by an estimate of 223 procedures to be performed during the year.
