The Congress required GAO to examine Medicare's payment methods for ultrasound procedures and whether the technicians that conduct them--called sonographers--should be subject to qualification standards, such as having to undergo a certification process called credentialing. This report addresses (1) the ultrasound procedures commonly used to diagnose medical conditions of Medicare beneficiaries, particularly for beneficiaries in a skilled nursing facility (SNF), (2) the financial impact of changing how Medicare pays for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation for beneficiaries in a SNF, and (3) the factors for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to consider in determining whether to establish credentialing or other requirements for sonographers. For this review, GAO analyzed Medicare claims data and conducted interviews and literature reviews."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three-fourths of the approximately 41 million ultrasound procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries in 2005 in any setting were one of two types: (1) echocardiograms to diagnose heart conditions or (2) noninvasive vascular procedures used to monitor blood flow and detect blockage or injury in veins and arteries. Ultrasound procedures consist of the ultrasound exam itself and the physician's interpretation of the exam. Nearly all of the ultrasound exams provided under Medicare Part B, which covers physician, hospital outpatient, diagnostic testing, and certain other services, were performed in physicians' offices and hospital outpatient departments. Of these exams, less than 1 percent were conducted in SNFs or homes, generally using ultrasound equipment that was transported to these settings by a mobile provider. Among beneficiaries in SNF stays not covered by Medicare who received ultrasound exams in SNFs, noninvasive vascular exams were the most prevalent type performed. Two ultrasound procedure payment changes affecting SNF beneficiaries that GAO examined would likely increase expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. If CMS had paid to transport ultrasound equipment to beneficiaries in SNF stays not covered by Medicare, which is not currently done, Medicare expenditures could have increased by an estimated $9.8 million and beneficiary cost sharing could have been about $2.6 million higher in 2005, assuming the number and location of services would not change in response to this policy. Moreover, paying separately for ultrasound exams and related transportation during beneficiaries' Medicare-covered SNF stays, as opposed to bundling these and other services into a single daily payment as CMS currently does, could have increased Medicare payments by about $22.0 million and beneficiary cost sharing by about $13.4 million in 2005, assuming no change in service use due to the revised policy. The actual financial impact for Medicare could differ from these estimates if, for example, providers increased their service provision due to these policy changes. Factors for CMS to consider in determining whether to establish credentialing or other qualification requirements for sonographers include the evidence of the value of setting such requirements and variation in federal requirements for sonographers. The skill of the sonographer conducting an ultrasound is critical for its use to support a physician's correct diagnosis; poorly captured images can lead to misdiagnoses or unnecessarily repeated exams. Findings from several peer-reviewed studies, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and ultrasound-related professional organizations support requiring that sonographers either have credentials or operate in facilities that are accredited, where specific quality standards apply. In some localities and practice settings, CMS or its contractors have required that sonographers either be credentialed or work in an accredited facility. Medicare's inconsistent requirements undermine assurance that beneficiaries are receiving high-quality services across the country."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare spending on imaging services nearly doubled from $5.7 billion in  1999 to $10.9 billion in 2004, in part due to growth in the number of  procedures. Diagnostic ultrasound procedures, an imaging service which  uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal body organs  and blood flow, accounted for about one-fourth of this spending in 2004.  Growth in the use of diagnostic ultrasound procedures has been due in  part to technological advances, which have improved the quality of  ultrasound images and physicians\u2019 ability to employ them to diagnose  medical conditions. Technological advances also have led to the  development of ultrasound devices that are smaller and more portable.  The enhanced portability of ultrasound equipment has made it easier for  beneficiaries to receive ultrasound exams in skilled nursing facilities  (SNF) or beneficiaries\u2019 homes to which ultrasound equipment generally  must be transported by a mobile provider.", "Ultrasound procedures consist of two parts\u2014the ultrasound exam itself  and the physician\u2019s interpretation of the exam. The first part of the  procedure\u2014the ultrasound exam\u2014generally involves an ultrasound  technician called a sonographer taking the image. The second part of the  procedure is the physician\u2019s interpretation of images from the ultrasound  exam. Medicare, administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), pays for the ultrasound exam and the physician\u2019s  interpretation of it separately or together.", "Medicare covers ultrasound and other imaging procedures and certain  related transportation under Part A and Part B of the program, and  beneficiaries are responsible for part of the cost of these services through  cost sharing. For all beneficiaries, Medicare covers the physician\u2019s  interpretation of ultrasound exams under Part B. For beneficiaries in a  Part A-covered SNF or hospital inpatient stay, Medicare covers most  services under Part A and pays for them through a prospective payment  system (PPS), which involves bundling payment for multiple services.  Specifically, for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, payment for  ultrasound exams and medically necessary ambulance transportation is  bundled with other services into a single daily rate. A PPS gives providers  the incentive to furnish services efficiently because if the actual cost of  services is less than the bundled payment, the provider keeps the  difference. For beneficiaries who are not in a Part A-covered SNF or  hospital inpatient stay, which includes those in a noncovered SNF stay,  Medicare covers ultrasound exams and medically necessary ambulance  transportation under Part B.", "The rapid growth in spending for imaging has contributed to interest in the  Congress and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC)  about whether Medicare\u2019s payment methodology for these services creates  the proper incentives for appropriate use. Further, MedPAC has expressed  concern that not all imaging providers have the ability to conduct quality  exams, and several ultrasound-related professional organizations have  raised this issue with regard to sonographers. Becoming credentialed by a  nationally recognized organization, which can require obtaining a  combination of training and experience and passing an examination, is one  way for sonographers to demonstrate that they have the necessary skill  level to perform quality exams. In addition, accreditation is a mechanism  for facilities that conduct ultrasound procedures to demonstrate that their  affiliated sonographers meet the standards necessary to perform quality  exams. For example, to work in an accredited facility, sonographers may  be required to have certain credentials or be working toward obtaining  them.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 required that we assess issues associated with providing ultrasound  procedures to Medicare beneficiaries. As discussed with the committees  of jurisdiction, we address the following issues in this report: (1) the types  of ultrasound procedures commonly used to diagnose medical conditions  of Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those in SNFs, (2) the financial  impact of changing how Medicare pays for ultrasound exams and  associated equipment and ambulance transportation for beneficiaries  receiving care in a SNF, and (3) the factors to consider in determining  whether CMS should establish credentialing or other qualification  requirements for sonographers.", "To examine the types of diagnostic ultrasound procedures provided to  Medicare beneficiaries and the sites of service where the exams were  performed, we analyzed Medicare claims data for 2005. Our analysis of the  types of procedures provided to all Medicare beneficiaries was based on  claims for physicians\u2019 interpretations of ultrasound exams, which are paid  under Part B regardless of whether the exam itself was covered under   Part A or Part B. Our analysis of the site of service of ultrasound  procedures was based on claims for ultrasound exams that were paid  under Part B because Part A payments for these exams are bundled with  other services and not separately reported in the Medicare claims data. To  understand clinical issues associated with the site of service, we  performed a literature search; conducted structured interviews with  representatives of gerontological, radiological, and other ultrasound- related professional organizations; and reviewed CMS documents. To  estimate the financial impact to Medicare and its beneficiaries of providing  payments for ultrasound equipment transportation and of paying  separately for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance  transportation for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, we analyzed  Medicare claims data for ultrasound exams and ambulance services in  2005 and for exams in 1995 through 1997. We found the Medicare claims  data we analyzed to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. To identify factors to consider in determining whether CMS  should establish credentialing or other requirements for sonographers, we  reviewed Medicare regulations, CMS documents, Medicare carriers\u2019  credentialing requirements for sonographers, and relevant literature and  also interviewed officials from agencies and organizations such as CMS,  MedPAC, and those that credential sonographers.

To perform a diagnostic  ultrasound exam, a sonographer applies a hand-held medical device called  a transducer to the skin through which the ultrasound machine emits and  receives sound waves. As the sonographer moves the transducer around  the patient\u2019s body, an image of the various organs or blood flow under  study appears on a monitor. The sonographer electronically stores what he  or she considers as the most diagnostically useful images.", "The ultrasound systems that sonographers use differ along multiple  dimensions, including their types of transducers, documentation  capabilities, and cost. The type and number of transducers on a given  ultrasound system depend on the parts of the body to be examined and the  conditions intended to be diagnosed. In addition, some ultrasound systems  have additional documentation capability, which allows sonographers and  other health care personnel to electronically transmit and display  ultrasound images. According to the ultrasound device manufacturers with  whom we spoke, an ultrasound machine can range in price from $20,000 to  $200,000 or more.

CCI allows sonographers without formal education, but with  experience in the field, to take its credentialing exam, but ARDMS requires  that all sonographers have a combination of education and experience to  take its exam.", "Sonographers can obtain formal training through numerous education  programs. For example, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health  Education Programs lists 151 programs for diagnostic medical  sonographers, including associate\u2019s degree programs from community  colleges as well as bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Individuals we spoke with  from ultrasound-related professional organizations noted that, although  sonographers are more likely than in the past to undergo formal training,  there are still practicing sonographers who do not have it.", "Several organizations offer accreditation for facilities that conduct  ultrasound procedures as a way to demonstrate that they meet the  standards necessary to perform quality exams. To work in an accredited  facility, sonographers may be required to have certain credentials or have  received a minimum number of training hours. For example, sonographers  working in facilities that are accredited by the Intersocietal Commission  for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) must either be  credentialed or have a specified level of training and experience in  sonography. Similarly, for a facility to become accredited by the American  Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), the sonographers who work  there must either be credentialed by ARDMS or become credentialed  before re-accreditation, which occurs every 3 years. This allows new  sonographers to obtain experience conducting exams, which they need to  be eligible to take a credentialing exam, such as from ARDMS and CCI.

How Medicare pays for  ultrasound exams and associated ambulance transportation for  beneficiaries in a SNF depends on whether Medicare covers the stay under  Part A. For beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, Medicare bundles  payment for one part of the ultrasound procedure\u2014the exam\u2014as well as  associated ambulance transportation into the daily Part A PPS payment.

In general, they said that the risks and benefits  depend on the patient\u2019s condition\u2014such as whether the beneficiary  requires emergency care, the most appropriate setting for follow-up care,  and the type of ultrasound services provided. For example, there are risks  in transporting elderly patients, particularly those with certain medical  conditions including dementia, who can become disoriented in new  surroundings. Some geriatricians, medical directors of SNFs, and long- term care providers said that moving patients could increase their risk of  falls or fractures. A gerontologist and a geriatrician further noted that pain  is a major issue to consider in caring for frail, bedridden patients.  Transporting patients with deep vein thrombosis and pressure sores may  expose them to skin tears and pain. On the other hand, certain ultrasound  exams may be best performed in hospitals or physician offices, according  to organization representatives that we contacted. For example, some  beneficiaries may require emergency care, and therefore require  hospitalization. Others who need ultrasound exams may have conditions  that involve risks of serious complications that could require surgical or  other interventions more readily provided in a hospital. In addition, a  hospital or physician\u2019s office may be the best setting for certain types of  procedures, such as ultrasound guidance for needle placement during  biopsies, which requires the presence of a physician during the  performance of the procedure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Changing Ultrasound Payment Methods Would Likely Increase Expenditures and Beneficiary Cost Sharing", "paragraphs": ["We addressed two potential changes to Medicare payment methods  related to ultrasound procedures, both of which are likely to increase  Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. The first potential  change we addressed, which would involve paying to transport equipment  to SNFs during noncovered SNF stays for ultrasound exams, could have  increased Medicare expenditures by an estimated $9.8 million and  beneficiary cost sharing by an estimated $2.6 million in 2005, assuming  that this policy change would not affect the number and location of exams  provided. The second potential change in Medicare payment methods  involves paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and  associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A- covered SNF stays, as opposed to bundling payments for these services as  is done now.

However, because these revised payment policies could affect  the use of these services, the actual financial impacts could differ from our  estimates. For instance, paying separately under Part B for ultrasound  exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during  Part A-covered SNF stays could cause the use of these services to grow  because the PPS incentive to provide services efficiently would be absent,  so the actual impact of this policy could exceed our estimates.

If this policy also  applied to mobile exams conducted in other sites of service, the financial  impact could be greater. For example, if Medicare made separate Part B  payments to transport ultrasound equipment to beneficiaries\u2019 homes, as is  the case for the transportation of portable X-ray equipment, the financial  impact could be higher by about $4.4 million for Medicare expenditures  and $1.2 million higher for beneficiary cost sharing. Similarly, paying to  transport ultrasound equipment to custodial care and assisted living  facilities could have increased the financial impact of this policy further  (see table 2).", "The actual financial impact of paying to transport ultrasound equipment to  SNFs would differ from our estimates if this policy caused the number of  mobile exams provided to increase or decrease, but this would not affect  our determination that this policy would likely lead to higher Medicare  expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. The mobile providers we spoke  with noted that Medicare payments to transport ultrasound equipment  would allow them to expand their service area and thus could increase the  number of exams they provide. For example, one provider noted that  transportation payments might allow it to serve beneficiaries in rural areas  where doing so would have proved cost prohibitive before. Thus,  payments to transport ultrasound equipment could potentially increase the  number of mobile exams and provide more beneficiaries with access to  these services.", "Increasing access to mobile ultrasound exams could possibly lessen the  need for ambulance services to transport beneficiaries from a SNF to  another location for an ultrasound exam, which could in turn reduce the  financial impact of this policy. Mobile providers stressed that Medicare  and its beneficiaries save money when beneficiaries in SNF stays receive  mobile exams in a SNF as opposed to being transported to another  location, in part because payments and beneficiary cost sharing to  transport ultrasound equipment are less than for an ambulance round trip.  We identified about 13,900 exams that potentially could have been  conducted in a SNF during a noncovered SNF stay rather than using  ambulance transportation to travel to another location for the exam. If  the increased availability of mobile exams allowed all of these 13,900  exams to be conducted in a SNF rather than in the locations (such as a  hospital outpatient facility) where they actually took place, the financial  impact of this policy would have been about $3.0 million lower for  Medicare expenditures and about $1.2 million lower for beneficiary cost  sharing.", "However, if mobile providers increased the number of ultrasound exams  conducted in SNFs and other locations, it is also possible that this increase  could lead to larger than estimated increases in Medicare expenditures  and beneficiary cost sharing. Some of the exams conducted for  beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays likely were conducted in other sites  of service (for example, physicians\u2019 offices or hospital outpatient  departments) but did not involve Medicare-covered ambulance services to  transport the beneficiary there. If mobile providers furnished more  ultrasound exams in SNFs by expanding their service area, some of these  beneficiaries might have received exams in this site of service rather than  in other locations. As a result of this change in the site of service for these  exams, our estimated impacts on Medicare expenditures and beneficiary  cost sharing could (1) increase because Medicare would be paying for the  additional ultrasound equipment transportation cost that would otherwise  not have been necessary and (2) change due to the different cost of the  exams themselves in the new locations. However, data constraints do not  allow us to estimate the extent to which this would occur.", "Based on what mobile providers told us, one might expect the number of  mobile exams to increase in response to the provision of payments to  transport ultrasound equipment. However, our analysis of the effect of  ceasing to pay for ultrasound equipment transportation in 1996 indicates  that the opposite might occur. In 1995, Medicare carriers in 14 states and  Northern California paid to transport ultrasound equipment, but these  payments ceased in all localities as of January of 1996. We compared the  growth rate in the number of exams conducted in SNFs in the 14 states  where Medicare paid to transport ultrasound equipment in 1995 and  stopped doing so thereafter to the rate across all other states where this  change did not occur. The number of exams conducted in SNFs grew by  about 237 percent from 1995 to 1997 in states where Medicare paid to  transport ultrasound equipment in 1995 and ceased doing so thereafter,  which was substantially greater than the 62 percent growth rate in other  states where Medicare had not paid to transport ultrasound equipment.  This suggests that the elimination of Medicare payments to transport  ultrasound equipment may have led to an increase in the number of mobile  exams as the amount paid per exam decreased.", "These results raise the possibility that mobile providers might maintain or  decrease the number of exams they provide if Medicare began paying to  transport ultrasound equipment. A decrease in the number of exams  conducted in SNFs, if it occurred, could require that more beneficiaries  use ambulance services to be transported to other locations for the  exams.

Although we did not find  published studies specific to ultrasound or certain other imaging  modalities predicting that this would occur, one of our previous reports  found that bundling SNF services into a single PPS payment caused the  use of therapy services to decrease. This suggests that paying separately  under Part B for these services could possibly have the opposite effect and  cause use to grow, which could also cause the actual financial impact of  this policy to exceed our estimates. Similarly, MedPAC has reported that  there are efficiency gains from bundling payments. In addition, both we  and MedPAC have previously noted that bundling Medicare payments for  certain end-stage renal disease drugs together with other items for this  condition could improve efficiency by eliminating the financial incentive  to overuse separately billable drugs.

Congress chose to do this on a previous occasion. Thus, if Congress  instituted separate Part B payments for ultrasound exams and associated  equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A-covered SNF  stays, these payments could possibly be made budget neutral by a  reduction in the Part A PPS payment.

When conducting diagnostic ultrasound  procedures, the sonographer is responsible for obtaining quality images of  internal body parts to enable the physician to make correct diagnoses of  patients\u2019 diseases and medical conditions. Two studies have shown that  poor quality images can lead to misdiagnosis or unnecessarily repeated  exams. Representatives of some ultrasound-related professional  organizations that we interviewed noted that the increased use of  ultrasound procedures in clinical practice and sophistication of the  equipment have heightened the need for sonographers to undergo formal  training.

In contrast to diagnostic ultrasound procedures, the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) established and enforces national quality standards  for mammography services, which appear to have improved the quality of  these procedures. Among other provisions in these standards, FDA  established qualifications and continuing training requirements for  mammography personnel, such as radiological technologists who perform  the examinations, and also required facility accreditation. We previously  reported that these quality standards, in conjunction with state inspection  programs, have increased mammography facilities\u2019 adherence to accepted  quality assurance standards and improved the quality of X-ray images.", "Furthermore, MedPAC and various ultrasound-related professional  organizations with which we spoke support the implementation of a  Medicare policy establishing requirements for the qualifications of  sonographers.

At  the federal level, CMS has not developed a national policy, such as an  NCD, regarding the qualifications needed by sonographers as a condition  for payment of ultrasound services.

For example, as of  April 2007, carriers in 24 states and the District of Columbia have  established one or more LCDs that require that noninvasive vascular  diagnostic ultrasound procedures be performed by a credentialed  sonographer (one that has undergone a certification process) or in an  accredited facility that may require sonographers to meet certain  qualification requirements. Carriers\u2019 rationale was that the quality of  these ultrasound procedures depends on the knowledge, skill, and  experience of the sonographer. Carriers in 17 states have LCDs that  recommend that noninvasive vascular diagnostic ultrasound procedures  be performed by a credentialed sonographer or in an accredited facility.  However, in the remaining 9 states, Medicare carriers have not established  requirements through an LCD specifying the qualifications for  sonographers who conduct noninvasive vascular ultrasound procedures.

While carriers in  12 states had developed LCDs as of April 2007 that require that these  procedures be performed by a credentialed sonographer or in an  accredited laboratory and carriers in 4 states had LCDs that recommended  these types of qualifications for sonographers, the remaining states and  the District of Columbia have no such LCDs.

For example, CMS has developed  standards for nonphysician personnel that could be applicable to  sonographers who perform diagnostic ultrasound procedures in  independent diagnostic testing facilities (IDTF), but has not done so for  physicians\u2019 offices. For IDTFs, CMS requirements specify that  nonphysician personnel, including sonographers, who perform diagnostic  ultrasound procedures, must demonstrate the basic qualifications to  perform those procedures and have appropriate training and proficiency.  To meet this requirement, in the absence of a state licensing board,  sonographers must be credentialed by an appropriate national  credentialing body. Furthermore, the IDTF must maintain documentation  available for review that Medicare credentialing requirements are being  met.", "Although there are no Medicare standards specifically related to the  qualifications of sonographers working in hospitals, Medicare providers  need to abide by the relevant Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP),  some of which appear to be applicable to the performance of ultrasound  procedures. There are CoP provisions that include specific standards for  medical staff and for radiology, nuclear medicine, and outpatient  services. According to the Medicare CoP for medical staff, hospitals are  responsible for the quality of medical care provided to patients and must  examine the qualifications and credentials of applicants for medical staff  positions. If the hospital provides outpatient services, the CoP also  requires that services must meet the needs of the patients in \u201caccordance  with acceptable standards of practice.\u201d Further, hospital outpatient  departments are required to have appropriate professional and  nonprofessional personnel available. In 2003, over 80 percent of hospitals  met the applicable conditions of participation through accreditation from  the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint  Commission)\u2014a nonprofit organization created to provide voluntary  health care accreditation for hospitals.", "In contrast to IDTFs and hospitals, there are no Medicare standards that  apply specifically to diagnostic ultrasound procedures conducted in  physicians\u2019 offices aside from those relating to the level of physician  supervision required.

This time constraint could be problematic given that representatives of  various ultrasound-related societies and organizations we interviewed  generally suggested a phase-in period of 2 or more years to allow  noncredentialed sonographers time to comply with the newly imposed  requirements. Finally, establishing an NCD could be difficult, according to  the CMS official, if it limited access to services for some beneficiaries,  such as for those that lived in locations where no credentialed  sonographer was readily available.", "A second option would be to issue a regulation that establishes a  requirement that sonographers either be credentialed or work in an  accredited facility as a condition for Medicare payment.
