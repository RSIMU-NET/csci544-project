In the Strategy, ONDCP established seven goals related to reducing illicit drug use and its consequences to be achieved by 2015. As of March 2013, GAO's analysis showed that of the five goals for which primary data on results were available, one showed progress and four showed no progress. GAO also reported that ONDCP established a new monitoring system intended to provide information on progress toward Strategy goals and help identify performance gaps and options for improvement. At that time, the system was still in its early stages, and GAO reported that it could help increase accountability for improving progress. In November 2015, ONDCP issued its annual Strategy and performance report, which assess progress toward all seven goals. The Strategy shows progress in achieving one goal, no progress on three goals, and mixed progress on the other three goals. Overall, none of the goals in the Strategy have been fully achieved.", "ONDCP has assessed the extent of overlap and potential for duplication across federal drug abuse prevention and treatment programs and identified opportunities for increased coordination, as GAO recommended in March 2013. According to ONDCP's July 2014 assessment, these programs generally serve distinct beneficiaries in distinct settings, which helps prevent overlap and duplication. However, ONDCP found that programs that provide drug abuse prevention and treatment services to address homelessness would benefit from greater coordination. ONDCP noted that it was taking steps to address this issue.", "GAO reported in April 2013 that ONDCP-funded High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Investigative Support Centers and four other types of field-based information sharing entities had overlapping analytical and investigative support activities. However, ONDCP and the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ)\u2014the federal agencies that oversee or provide support to the five types of field-based entities\u2014were not holding entities accountable for coordination or assessing opportunities to implement practices that could enhance coordination, reduce unnecessary overlap, and leverage resources. ONDCP agreed with GAO's recommendations to work with DHS and DOJ to develop measures and assess opportunities to enhance coordination of field-based entities. Since July 2015, the agencies have worked through an interagency committee to make plans for collecting data on field-based collaboration, but have not yet fully addressed GAO's recommendations.", "ONDCP has connected each of the systems that HIDTAs use to coordinate law enforcement activities, as GAO recommended in April 2013. Specifically, GAO reported in 2013 that HIDTAs and Regional Information Sharing System centers operated three systems that duplicate the same function\u2014identifying when different law enforcement entities may be conducting a similar enforcement action, such as a raid at the same location\u2014resulting in some inefficiencies.

ONDCP is responsible for, among other things, overseeing and  coordinating implementation of national drug control policy across the  federal government to address illicit drug use. In this role, ONDCP is  required annually to develop a National Drug Control Strategy (the  Strategy), which is to set forth a comprehensive plan to reduce illicit drug  use through programs intended to prevent or treat drug use or reduce the  availability of illegal drugs, as well as to develop a National Drug Control  Program Budget proposal for implementing the Strategy. Additionally,  ONDCP administers grants to support HIDTAs, which aim to support the  disruption and dismantlement of drug-trafficking and money-laundering  organizations through the prevention or mitigation of associated criminal  activity. While HIDTAs have a distinct mission, the analytic and  investigative services they provide can overlap with those of other field- based information sharing entities operated or supported by the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice  (DOJ), making coordination paramount in leveraging resources and  avoiding unnecessary duplication. HIDTAs also operate event  deconfliction systems that identify when different law enforcement entities  may be conducting similar enforcement actions, such as a raid at the  same location, to help ensure officer safety.", "ONDCP reported that about $26.3 billion was provided for drug control  programs in fiscal year 2015, and coordination of these programs remains  an important step in insuring the effectiveness of these funds. Today, I  will discuss the extent to which (1) progress has been made toward  achieving National Drug Control Strategy goals and ONDCP has  mechanisms in place to monitor progress, (2) ONDCP has assessed the  extent of overlap and potential duplication across federal drug abuse  prevention and treatment programs and identified coordination  opportunities, (3) ONDCP holds HIDTAs accountable for coordination  with other field-based information sharing entities and has assessed  opportunities for coordination to reduce overlap and duplication, and (4)  ONDCP has achieved interoperability among existing deconfliction  systems.

The annual updates  are to provide an implementation progress report as well as an  opportunity to make adjustments to reflect policy changes. ONDCP  established two overarching policy goals in the 2010 Strategy for (1)  curtailing illicit drug consumption and (2) improving public health by  reducing the consequences of drug abuse, and seven subgoals under  them that delineate specific quantitative outcomes to be achieved by  2015, such as reducing drug-induced deaths by 15 percent.

Specifically, we reported that drug abuse prevention and  treatment programs were fragmented across 15 federal agencies that  funded or administered 76 programs in fiscal year 2011, and identified  overlap in 59 of these programs because they can provide or fund at least  one drug abuse prevention or treatment service that at least 1 other  program can provide or fund, either to similar population groups or to  reach similar program goals. For example, 6 programs reported that they  can provide or fund drug abuse prevention services for students and  youth in order to support program goals of preventing drug use and abuse  among young people. All 6 of these programs also reported that they can  provide or fund services to conduct outreach and educate youth on drug  use.", "As part of our review, we also conducted a more in-depth analysis in two  selected areas where we identified overlap\u2014programs for youth and  programs for offenders. We reported that agency officials who administer  programs in these two areas took various efforts to coordinate  overlapping programs or services, which can serve to minimize the risk of  duplication. For example, using an interagency agreement, the  Department of Education jointly administers the Safe Schools/Healthy  Students program with the Departments of Justice and Health and  Human Services to provide complementary educational, mental health,  and law enforcement services to prevent youth violence and drug use.", "We found in March 2013 that although the agencies\u2019 coordination efforts  in these two areas were consistent with practices that we had previously  reported federal agencies use to implement collaborative efforts, not all of  the programs surveyed were involved in coordination efforts with other  federal agencies. Specifically, officials from 29 of the 76 (about 40  percent) programs surveyed reported no coordination with other federal  agencies on drug abuse prevention or treatment activities in the year prior  to our survey. Furthermore, we reported that although ONDCP  coordinates efforts to develop and implement the Strategy and National  Drug Control Program Budget, it had not systematically assessed drug  abuse prevention and treatment programs to examine the extent of  overlap and potential for duplication and identify opportunities for greater  coordination. As a result, we recommended that ONDCP conduct such an  assessment.", "ONDCP concurred with our recommendation and has implemented it. In  July 2014, ONDCP published an assessment of drug abuse prevention  and treatment programs in its fiscal year 2015 Budget and Performance  Summary, which was released with the annual Strategy. ONDCP  reported that it conducted this assessment by (1) preparing an inventory  of federal agency drug abuse prevention and treatment program  activities, starting with those in our report; (2) mapping the beneficiaries  and services provided by each program activity to determine the extent of  overlap; and (3) reviewing overlapping programs to assess the level of  coordination activities, among other steps. The assessment found that  these programs generally serve distinct beneficiaries in distinct settings,  which helps prevent overlap and duplication. In the cases where overlap  could occur, ONDCP\u2019s review of grant awards made under the programs  determined that duplication did not occur over a 3-year period ending in  2013. Further, according to the assessment, the agencies managing  overlapping programs have coordinated through interagency  collaboration, coordinated grant applications, and other activities.  However, ONDCP found that programs that provide drug abuse  prevention and treatment services to support efforts to address  homelessness would benefit from greater coordination. In August 2014,  ONDCP stated that it is working to ensure additional coordination in this  area by, for example, providing guidance to relevant agencies during the  office\u2019s budget and oversight review process on improving coordination of  grant programs that offer similar treatment and recovery support services  to homeless clients.", "ONDCP\u2019s assessment states that the office will continue to monitor the  programs that overlap, as well as any new federal programs that are  added to prevent and treat substance use disorders. According to the  assessment, this monitoring is to include requiring regular reporting from  the agencies as a part of interagency drug abuse prevention and  treatment working group meetings and working with the agencies to  ensure greater coordination and opportunities to consolidate programs as  a part of the annual budget process.

Specifically,  we found that while the five types of field-based entities have distinct  missions, roles, and responsibilities, their activities can overlap. For  example, across the eight urban areas that we reviewed, we identified 91  instances of overlap in some analytical activities\u2014such as producing  intelligence reports\u2014and 32 instances of overlap in investigative support  activities, such as identifying links between criminal organizations. These  entities conducted similar activities within the same mission area, such as  counterterrorism, and for similar customers, such as federal or state  agencies. Across the eight urban areas, 34 of the 37 field-based entities  we reviewed conducted an analytical or investigative support activity that  overlapped with that of another entity. We reported that this can lead to  benefits, such as the corroboration of information, but may also burden  customers with redundant information.", "In our April 2013 report, ONDCP, DHS, and DOJ officials acknowledged  that field-based entities working together and sharing information are  important, but they do not hold their entities accountable for such  coordination. For example, HIDTA Investigative Support Centers have a  performance measurement program that holds the centers accountable  for referring leads to other HIDTAs and other agencies, but the program  does not include measures about the HIDTA\u2019s ability to coordinate with  other field-based entities. Further, ONDCP, DHS, and DOJ officials stated  that they ultimately rely on the leadership of their respective field-based  entities to ensure that successful coordination is occurring because the  leaders in these entities are most familiar with the other stakeholders and  issues in their areas, and are best suited to develop working relationships  with one another.", "Officials at 22 of the 37 entities we reviewed agreed that successful  coordination depends most on personal relationships, but they noted that  coordination can be disrupted when new leadership takes over at an  entity. Officials at 20 of the 37 entities also stated that measuring and  monitoring coordination could alleviate the process of starting over when  new personnel take over at a partner entity and ensure that maintaining  coordinated efforts is a priority. We concluded that a mechanism\u2014such  as performance metrics\u2014that holds entities accountable for coordination  and enables agencies to monitor and evaluate the results of their efforts  could help provide the agencies with information on the effectiveness of  coordination among field-based entities and help reduce any unnecessary  overlap in entities\u2019 efforts. We recommended that the agencies  collaborate to develop such a mechanism.", "Similarly, our April 2013 report found that ONDCP, DHS, and DOJ had  not assessed opportunities to implement practices that were identified as  enhancing coordination. Officials at each of the 37 entities in the eight  urban areas we reviewed described how practices such as serving on  one another\u2019s governance boards or, in some cases, colocating with other  entities allowed or could allow them to achieve certain benefits. These  include better understanding the missions and activities of the other  entities, coordinating the production of analytical products, and sharing  resources such as subject matter experts. In their view, this helped to  increase coordination, leverage resources, and avoid or reduce the  negative effects of unnecessary overlap and duplication in their analytical,  tactical, and dissemination activities. We recommended that the agencies  collaborate to perform a collective assessment of where these and other  practices that can enhance coordination could be implemented.", "ONDCP and DHS concurred with both of our recommendations and DOJ  generally agreed with the intent of the recommendations. Since our April  2013 report, the agencies have taken steps to address them. Specifically,  ONDCP, DHS, and DOJ have existing forums they can use to work  together in developing metrics and conducting assessments to better  ensure coordination, and collectively monitor and evaluate results  achieved. These forums include, for example, the Fusion Center  Subcommittee of the Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy  Committee. In July 2015, the subcommittee met and agreed to modify  its 2015 work plan to address the collection, analysis, and reporting of  data pertaining to field-based information sharing entities. According to  DHS officials, these data are to focus on field-based collaboration,  including governance, colocation, and other information sharing, analytic,  and conflict-avoidance topics. Since the July 2015 meeting, DHS has  assisted ONDCP and DOJ in developing an assessment template, based  on common data elements it collects in its annual assessment of state  and major urban area fusion centers.", "Although ONDCP, DHS, and DOJ have taken actions to address our  recommendations, the agencies do not yet have a collective mechanism  that will hold field-based entities accountable for coordinating with one  another and allow the agencies to monitor progress and evaluate results  across entities. Such a mechanism could help entities maintain effective  relationships when new leadership is assigned and avoid unnecessary  overlap in activities, which can also help entities to leverage scarce  resources. Further, the agencies have not conducted a collaborative  assessment of where practices that enhance coordination can be applied  to reduce overlap, collaborate, and leverage resources for their respective  field-based information sharing entities. Such an assessment would allow  the agencies to provide recommendations or guidance to the entities on  implementing these practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ONDCP Has Connected the Systems That Deconflict Operations, Reducing Risks to Officer Safety and Inefficiencies", "paragraphs": ["ONDCP has connected each of the systems that HIDTAs use to  deconflict operations, an action that can reduce risks to officer safety and  inefficiencies. Our April 2013 report found that the HIDTA and RISS  programs operate three separate systems that have event or target  deconfliction functions to determine when multiple federal, state, or local  law enforcement agencies are conducting enforcement actions\u2014such as  raids, undercover operations, or surveillances\u2014in proximity to one  another during a specified time period. As we reported in 2013, HIDTAs  have used the SAFETNet system, which has had event deconfliction  functions, among other functions, since 2001 to help ensure officer safety.  In 2009, the HIDTA program introduced deconfliction features into the  Case Explorer system that differed from SAFETNet by providing a free  service that is tied to its performance management process. In 2009,  the RISS program developed RISSafe to provide event deconfliction to its  members and those not being served by another system. Accordingly,  HIDTAs and RISS centers were operating duplicative deconfliction  systems\u2014that is, systems that aim to ensure that law enforcement  officers are not conducting enforcement actions at the same time in the  same place or investigating the same target\u2014which could pose risks to  officer safety and lead to inefficiencies. Table 3 provides details about the  features of these three systems.", "Law enforcement officers generally enter events into a deconfliction  system electronically or by calling a watch center. Individuals operating a  watch center plot the location of the event on a map and notify the officer  for whom contact information is available in the systems of other officers  who have entered conflicting events into the same system. When events  are not deconflicted, officer safety can be at risk. For example, HIDTA  and RISS officials described instances when officers did not deconflict  drug busts, which led to undercover officers from different agencies  drawing guns on one another thinking the other officers were drug  dealers. The officials added that, had the events been deconflicted, the  officers would have been aware of one another\u2019s presence. As shown in  figure 1, entities within a state can use one or more of the systems.", "In our April 2013 report, we found that HIDTA and RISS officials had  taken steps to connect target deconfliction systems\u2014those that inform  agencies when they are investigating the same individuals, weapons,  vehicles, or businesses\u2014and two of three event deconfliction systems.  However, HIDTA officials had not finalized plans to make the remaining  event deconfliction system, SAFETNet, interoperable with the other two  systems. Accordingly, we recommended that the Director of ONDCP work  with the appropriate HIDTA officials to develop milestones and time  frames for actions needed to make SAFETNet interoperable in order to  prevent unnecessary delays in reducing risks to officer safety and  lessening the burden on law enforcement agencies that are currently  using multiple systems to notify agencies when they are conducting  conflicting enforcement actions. ONDCP concurred with the  recommendation and, in May 2015, completed the steps to achieve  interoperability among the three event deconfliction systems.
