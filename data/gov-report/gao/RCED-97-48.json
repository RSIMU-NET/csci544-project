GAO also noted that: (1) two principal objectives have typically been cited by other nations and by the United States for selling government assets: (a) eliminating or reducing the government's presence in an activity that some view as best done by the private sector; and (b) improving the government's fiscal situation; and (2) these two objectives will affect many subsequent decisions needed to implement a sale, including: decisions about such concerns as what specific assets to sell, how to group these assets, what conditions and liabilities to transfer to the buyer, and what sales mechanism to employ. Finally, if, based on a broad policy evaluation of the pros and cons of privatization, a decision to divest federal hydropower assets is reached, several key issues specifically related to hydropower would need to be addressed, including: (1) balancing how water is used among the multiple purposes of federal water projects; (2) determining how to repay or otherwise address the federal capital investment in irrigation facilities of the affected projects; (3) assigning the numerous contractual obligations and liabilities of the Bureau, the Corps, and the PMAs; (4) handling Native Americans' claims to water, property and tribal artifacts; (5) determining the future responsibility for protecting the environment and endangered species--a commitment that already constrains the operations of many projects; (6) deciding the future regulatory treatment of divested hydropower assets; (7) the potential effects of a divestiture on wholesale and retail electric rates, and the regional economies; and (8) these impacts, to a large degree, would be determined by the prevailing wholesale electric rates of the local utilities in the region in which power from the PMA is sold, the region's reliance on this power, and the availability of other sources of power."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you requested, this report provides information on (1) the profiles of three power marketing administrations, including their similarities and differences and their interactions with the agencies that operate federal water projects; (2) the general parameters of the process by which federally owned assets can be sold; and (3) the factors that would have to be addressed in a divestiture of federal hydroelectric assets, such as the relationship between power generation and the other purposes of federal water projects.

The PMAs are separate and distinct organizational entities within the Department of Energy (DOE). They are required to market hydropower primarily on a wholesale basis at the lowest possible rates consistent with sound business principles. By law, the PMAs give preference in the sale of federal power to public bodies and cooperatives (called \u201cpreference customers\u201d), such as federal agencies, irrigation districts, municipalities, public utility districts, and other public agencies.

In addition to providing hydropower, the dams at which hydropower plants are located serve a variety of other purposes, such as promoting fish and wildlife conservation and habitat enhancement and providing flood control, irrigation, navigation, recreation, water supply, and improved water quality. Each project must be operated in a way that balances its multiple purposes. In most instances, because generating power is not the project\u2019s sole purpose, the amount of hydropower generated and marketed is affected by the availability and use of water for the project\u2019s other purposes.", "The PMAs generally do not own, operate, or control the facilities that actually generate the electric power; almost always, they own, operate, and control the facilities that transmit power, and they market the power that is generated at the federal water projects. The power-generating facilities are controlled by other federal agencies\u2014most often by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) or the Department of the Army\u2019s Corps of Engineers (Corps)\u2014referred to as \u201coperating agencies.\u201d Appendix II lists and describes various laws that guide the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 management of federal water projects and hydropower plants.", "The federal power marketing program, which began in the early 1900s, has developed incrementally over the years. In 1937, the Bonneville Project Act created the Bonneville Power Administration to market federal power in the Pacific Northwest. In 1943, a decision by the Secretary of the Interior established Southwestern under the President\u2019s war powers. The Congress provided the authority to create permanent PMAs with the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1944. The Secretary of the Interior established Southeastern in 1950 and the Alaska Power Administration in 1967. The last PMA, Western, was authorized under the DOE Organization Act of 1977 when the four existing PMAs were transferred from the Department of the Interior to DOE.", "Many hydropower plants provide electric power for the multiple needs of a federal water project, and the project\u2019s operations have first priority for using it. The PMAs sell the hydropower that exceeds the project\u2019s operational requirements on a wholesale basis to their preference customers and use the revenue earned to repay the costs to generate, transmit, and market power. Revenues from the sale of hydropower are also used to pay for a portion of the irrigation costs assigned for repayment through these revenues where the project serves irrigation. The sale of federal hydropower has also served social and economic development goals. This power is required to be sold at rates that are as low as practicable, consistent with sound business principles, to encourage its widespread use. The PMAs helped make electricity available for the first time to many consumers who lived in rural areas.", "Nonfederal hydropower projects also generate electricity subject to their multiple purposes. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses and regulates these projects and their hydropower plants that affect the nation\u2019s navigable waterways. FERC\u2019s operating licenses for these hydropower plants are in effect for up to 50 years, after which relicensing must occur. Under provisions of such legislation as the Federal Power Act, as amended by the Electric Consumers Protection Act, FERC\u2019s licensing and regulatory activities establish the conditions under which the project must operate, consistent with legal and policy developments. In licensing and relicensing nonfederal hydropower projects, FERC is required to give equal weight to both \u201cdevelopmental factors\u201d (such as power, irrigation, and flood control) and \u201cnondevelopmental factors\u201d (such as protecting fish and wildlife habitat, conserving energy, and providing recreation).", "FERC\u2019s regulatory activities with respect to electricity from the PMAs are limited to the authority delegated to it by the Secretary of Energy. FERC\u2019s review of the PMAs\u2019 rates is limited to (1) whether the rates are the lowest possible consistent with sound business principles; and (2) whether the revenues generated by the rates are enough to recover, within the period allowed, the costs of producing and transmitting electricity, including the repayment of the capital investment allocated to generate power and the costs assigned by acts of the Congress for repayment.

The order also allows the PMAs to defer payments on O&M expenses if the PMAs do not generate sufficient revenue in a particular year because of the variability of hydropower. Because O&M expenses that are deferred are amortized with interest, the amount of deferred expenses accrues interest until it is fully repaid and may require the PMA to increase its rates.", "The federal investment in water projects has nonreimbursable and reimbursable components. The nonreimbursable component refers to costs that are not reimbursable by revenues collected from the projects\u2019 beneficiaries. The reimbursable component refers to costs that are recovered from the project\u2019s ratepayers and other beneficiaries, such as power and irrigation users. This component includes the construction costs as well as the O&M expenses for power generation, transmission, and marketing; the construction costs allocated to irrigation and O&M expenses for irrigation, if applicable; and the construction costs allocated to municipal and industrial water supply as well as the related O&M expenses.

These bills have proposed selling only the PMA and its assets; the PMA and the related hydropower assets of the Bureau and the Corps; or all of these assets plus the related dams and reservoirs. For example, in 1996 legislation introduced in the House of Representatives proposed to divest, among other things, the PMAs and the associated power-generating assets through a competitive bidding process. The bill proposed that FERC be directed to grant a 10-year operating license to the buyers of the federal hydropower plants. It also exempted the divestiture from certain federal laws pertaining to the disposal of surplus federal property and to environmental protection, such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In response to divestiture proposals, on January 18, 1996, 39 Members of Congress requested that we examine the issues related to the divestiture of the PMAs and related federal hydropower assets.

Therefore, measuring the customers\u2019 reliance on the PMAs in terms of their purchases of electric energy (measured in kWh) does not accurately capture the situation of some preference customers, particularly those of Southeastern and Southwestern, that rely more on the PMAs to meet their peak demands for electricity.

Although Western is implementing a program to set aside some existing capacity to serve new customers, becoming a new PMA customer is difficult because few customers are willing to give up their power allocations from a PMA and almost no new federal hydropower plants will be coming on line in the foreseeable future.", "Many factors contribute to the PMAs\u2019 ability to sell electricity at generally lower rates than other neighboring utilities. Importantly, their electricity is primarily generated from hydropower plants, making their power generally less expensive than other sources of power because it has no fuel cost. In addition, because most of these hydropower plants were built when construction costs were lower than more recent construction, the PMAs have lower imbedded costs to recover through their rates. Also, as we discussed in our 1996 report, their rates do not fully recover all of the costs associated with production of power. In some cases, the PMAs are not required to recover some costs (for example, certain environmental costs and the full costs of federal pensions and postretirement health benefits) because of specific legal provisions or because the DOE implementing order excludes the costs or is not specific about them. Also, unlike IOUs, the PMAs do not pay federal income taxes nor do they set their rates to earn a profit. In addition, while the PMAs in our study do not have to build new capacity to meet future demand, IOUs have an obligation to serve all existing and future customers in their service areas.

For instance, under provisions of the Clean Water Act, state agencies issue water quality certificates that affect how federal dams are operated and the amount and timing of water that can be released from a reservoir. Moreover, compacts to apportion water among states affect the availability of water for various purposes. The Bureau and the Corps must also frequently consider state environmental laws when managing water resources. For instance, in operating the Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, the Bureau follows a decision by the California State Water Resources Board that directs the CVP and the state water project to meet the state\u2019s standards for fish habitat and water quality, such as the salinity standards for the San Francisco Bay area. To accomplish these standards, the Bureau and the management of the state water project operate under an agreement that describes how water supplies should be shared and who would be responsible for environmental issues.

In addition, the 1992 Energy Policy Act required that a utility make its transmission lines accessible to other utilities (called \u201copen transmission access\u201d), thus enabling customers to obtain electricity from a variety of competing utilities. As the market has become increasingly open, spot and futures markets in bulk power have grown and power marketers and brokers now offer services so wholesale customers can buy the cheapest power available.", "The tax advantages and other subsidies the PMAs receive give them unfair advantages over their competitors. As we recently reported, federal hydropower is cheaper than wholesale power sold by IOUs and publicly owned generating utilities, in part because hydropower has no fuel cost, but also because the PMAs have received low-interest financing and have flexible repayment terms.If federal hydropower assets are sold, the private sector would operate these assets more efficiently. Proponents believe that the federal agencies do not adequately operate, maintain, and repair these assets. As we recently testified, the government\u2019s capital planning and budgeting systems do not enable federal agencies to fulfill these responsibilities adequately. Furthermore, according to proponents, the private sector would make better decisions about maintenance and investment because the decisions would be based on market signals rather than the federal government\u2019s appropriations and budget cycles. In responding to a draft of our report, Corps officials pointed out that, in some instances, the Corps\u2019 efforts to better operate, maintain, and repair its hydropower plants have paid off, and they cited that the Corps\u2019 South Atlantic Division (Atlanta, Georgia) has improved the generating availability of its hydropower plants to over 90 percent for fiscal year 1996.

This can include reducing the size or activities of the government. Some policymakers propose selling the federal hydropower assets to improve the federal government\u2019s fiscal position: They believe the cost of the federal hydropower program exceeds its value to the government because, among other reasons, the rates the PMAs charge do not recover all of the costs associated with generating, transmitting, and marketing electricity. If the government would sell these assets, the lump-sum payments would reduce the federal government\u2019s current borrowing requirements. The government would also save money on the annual appropriations that would no longer be needed for the three PMAs and the operating agencies for operating, maintaining, and repairing those assets. While the U.S. Treasury would no longer receive annual revenues from the sale of federal hydropower, proponents of divestiture believe that the sales proceeds the federal government would receive from the divestiture and the reduced government expenditures would more than offset the forgone revenues from electricity sales. Some proponents also contend that a divestiture would eliminate any subsidies to PMA ratepayers.", "However, assessing the full financial impact on the government from a sale of hydropower assets requires that other indirect costs to the government also be considered. Furthermore, assessing the full financial impact requires examining a variety of revenue and expenditure components, expressing these in present value terms that reflect their timing as well as magnitude, and addressing underlying uncertainties through sensitivity analyses. For instance, the government would incur transactions costs\u2014associated with preparing for and carrying out a divestiture\u2014if it sells the assets. These costs could be significant, particularly in the case of a large-scale public stock offering. Additionally, a variety of labor costs, such as providing severance packages to terminated employees of the PMAs and/or operating agencies, and other costs associated with the disposition of their pension and postretirement benefits would need to be accounted for. Furthermore, a divestiture could create more regulatory responsibilities, and the costs of meeting those increased responsibilities would have to be considered a cost of the divestiture if those costs would not have been incurred otherwise and would be borne by the government.", "Proponents contend that some of these additional costs may be offset by the additional tax revenues the federal government would receive from sales of electricity if the PMAs and related hydropower assets were sold to IOUs or independent power producers. The Edison Electric Institute (the trade association of IOUs and a strong advocate of divesting federal hydropower assets) maintains that, if the three PMAs in our study were sold to private utilities, the present value of potential federal income taxes on purchasers and bond buyers could equal about $1 billion. However, these taxes may reduce how much a potential purchaser would offer for the PMAs by an amount approximately equal to the tax liabilities. Thus, counting the expected additional tax revenues without considering the offsetting effect on the expected sales price would overstate the financial benefits of the sale.", "Finally, it is important to note that the budgetary treatment of a sale of federal assets does not reflect the full, long-term financial impact of the sale on the Treasury. For example, current budget rules use a 5-year budget window for scoring government revenues and expenditures.Many observers believe that this period is not long enough to evaluate an asset sale in which lump-sum sales proceeds are compared to changes in expenditure and revenue streams that may continue for up to 50 years. In addition, without legislative change, the sales proceeds from a divestiture could not be used to finance new spending or offset revenue losses. Furthermore, the congressional committees that have jurisdiction over the entities being sold could not count the sales proceeds toward the deficit reduction goals specified under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, as amended. This means the committees could not use the proceeds to offset additional expenditures within their budget allocation.

For example, as an \u201caid to irrigation,\u201d power revenue is counted on to repay about 70 percent of the federal government\u2019s (nominal) capital investment in irrigation facilities at federal water projects in the West. Parties that favor continued government ownership argue that the sale of federal hydropower promotes competition. They also assert that private-sector generation and marketing of hydropower formerly provided by the PMAs would lead to greater monopoly power in the electricity industry and higher rates to consumers, especially those in remote rural, low-income areas.

First, a PMA itself could be sold, including any transmission assets and/or the right to sell the hydropower generated at the Bureau\u2019s or the Corps\u2019 hydropower plants. In a second alternative, a PMA, including its transmission assets and its right to sell power, as well as the Bureau\u2019s or the Corps\u2019 powerplants could be divested. In a third, more complicated alternative, a PMA and all of the aforementioned items as well as the remaining assets related to the water projects (e.g., the dams and the reservoirs) could be divested.", "An alternative to selling an entire PMA and any related hydropower assets could be to package the assets of a specific project for sale. For instance, Bureau officials in Sacramento, California, opined that the Central Valley Project could be sold to the state of California because the project is contained fully in that state and complements the existing water project that is managed by the state. Another option could be to sell all the federal hydropower plants on a river system together to preserve operating efficiencies because the releases of water from upstream facilities to downstream ones could be more easily coordinated under one-party ownership\u2014an important consideration for flood control and other water management purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade-Offs Between Liabilities to Be Transferred or Restrictions on Divestiture and the Bids Received Would Need to Be Considered", "paragraphs": ["Along with defining the specific assets to be divested, policymakers would have to consider the explicit and implicit liabilities borne by the government and which of those liabilities to transfer to a buyer. As a policy matter, the government may want to retain certain liabilities associated with the assets being divested or place specific restrictions on their postdivestiture use of these assets. However, policymakers would need to consider that assets that are sold with many or relatively onerous restrictions (from the viewpoint of a prospective purchaser) or assets that are in poor condition are correspondingly less attractive and would likely result in lower sales proceeds than otherwise. While the government may still choose to place restrictions or to assign or retain certain liabilities, the financial consequences in terms of the sale price should be assessed.", "Many combinations of assets and liabilities could be grouped for sale. Both defining and valuing the specific liabilities that the federal government could retain are important because the government may be in a better position to bear certain risks. In general, the government could receive larger sales proceeds by retaining certain liabilities because a purchaser could substantially discount its bid if the purchaser would assume the financial risks associated with those liabilities. For instance, in the proposed divestiture of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), the government would retain liability for the environmental cleanup associated with the prior production of enriched uranium. According to a contractor\u2019s report, decontamination and decommissioning activities at uranium enrichment plants could cost as much as $17.4 billion in 1994 constant dollars. The PMAs are liable for environmental cleanup associated with use of polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous waste. While no precise estimates have been made, these liabilities could total many millions of dollars.", "Assets that are in better operating condition are more likely to receive larger bids than assets in poor condition. We testified recently that federal hydropower plants in the Southeast have experienced significant outages and that these outages occur because of the age of the plants and the way they have been operated. If these hydropower assets were to be sold without reducing the current backlog of necessary maintenance, bids would be lowered. However, a 1995 World Bank review of international experience with divestitures found that in preparing a government enterprise for divestiture, a government should generally refrain from making new investments to expand or improve that enterprise because any increase in sales proceeds is not likely to exceed the value of those investments.", "Imposing restrictions on operating the assets could also reduce the value to potential buyers. For instance, significant restrictions on using water to generate hydropower at the Glen Canyon Dam have been implemented to protect a variety of natural and cultural resources that are located downstream. According to the Bureau, these restrictions reduced the dam\u2019s generating capacity by an amount exceeding 400 MW, even though total energy production over the course of a day or a season will be largely unchanged. It is almost certain that a new owner of the Glen Canyon Dam would continue to bear the responsibility to operate the dam\u2019s hydropower plants according to these restrictions. As a practical matter, bids by prospective purchasers of the rights to market hydropower produced at Glen Canyon Dam would presumably reflect the diminished revenue potential. Thus, the government would incur much of the financial cost associated with the current restrictions in the form of reduced proceeds from the sales, just as the government would continue to bear this cost if its continued ownership and operation of the dam were maintained. Moreover, uncertainty about the extent of such restrictions likewise increases the uncertainty of expected future revenues and would likely reduce proceeds from the sale.", "In previous deliberations over divesting federal hydropower assets, including the PMAs, policymakers debated the desirability of ensuring regional control of divested federal hydropower assets. While a decision to limit bidders on particular assets to certain geographic areas would foster a goal of local or regional control of those assets, it could reduce the proceeds from the sale if other potentially interested buyers were precluded from making offers. For example, in the divestiture of the Alaska Power Administration\u2014the only PMA to be offered for sale\u2014an overriding concern was to protect the PMA\u2019s ratepayers from possible increases in electricity rates. This concern led decisionmakers to restrict the eligibility of bidders to only ones from within the state. It also led decisionmakers to accept a sales price approximating the present value of future principal and interest payments that the Treasury would have received instead of establishing the price by selling the assets in an open, more competitive fashion to the highest bidder."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Specific Sales Mechanism and Process Need to Be Determined", "paragraphs": ["The objectives underlying a divestiture help determine the most appropriate sales method.

Alternatively, if the major motivation were a desire to transfer operations to the private sector\u2014with an emphasis on a smooth transfer\u2014the government could choose to negotiate a sales price with a selected buyer.", "In general, we have supported the principle that the federal government should seek the full market value in selling its assets. Sales methods that allow for competitive bidding are more likely to generate this result and lead to the transfer of assets to those buyers who value them most highly. A World Bank survey of international experiences with divestiture indicates that open bidding among competitors is preferable to sales that rely on negotiations with selected bidders because the former method offers less opportunity for favored buyers to receive special treatment at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.", "In practice, the size of the assets to be sold, in terms of value and scale of enterprise, has influenced the type of sales process used. Trade sales and public stock offerings are general processes, with trade sales used more often to sell smaller enterprises or assets, and public offerings used to sell larger ones. Also, within each type, sales can be organized using competitive bidding methods or negotiations. A brief description of these processes follows: \u201cTrade sales\u201d draw on the idea that an existing set of businesses competing in the relevant line of business (or trade) are likely to offer more and higher bids for the assets. Three key attributes of the PMAs and the electricity industry may lend themselves to a trade sale: (1) The PMAs and related hydropower assets are part of an established industry with capital market connections experienced in the valuation, grouping, and sale of electricity-generating assets. (2) Sales of significant electricity-generating assets are not unusual. (3) There would likely be several bidders for at least large portions of the PMAs and their related assets, depending on how those assets are grouped for sale. A trade sale can be a negotiated sales process between the government and a buyer or can be accomplished using an auction to determine both the sales price of the asset or assets as well as the buyer or buyers.", "Stock offerings have been used domestically, most recently in the sale of Conrail in 1987, as well as internationally to divest large public enterprises. This method of sale would most likely require creating a government corporation or corporations out of the PMAs and their associated assets. Some of these assets could be grouped for sale, and some could be excluded from the sale, depending on the policy trade-offs discussed. In the case of some federal water projects, for example, the government could decide to retain control of the dam and reservoir to satisfy increasingly significant restrictions on the use of water because of concerns about the environment or endangered species. The stock of the government corporation would be subsequently sold through standard financial market methods, such as a private placement through negotiations between particular investors and the government or through a sale to the general public by using competitive bidding.", "In cases where auction methods might be selected to sell government assets, recent government experience indicates the importance of carefully choosing the specific format for an auction. That is, a policy decision to choose a competitive auction format requires making many subsequent decisions to define the specific rules leading to an appropriate operational auction. For example, the Federal Communications Commission has chosen to auction the leases of electromagnetic spectrum licenses for use in mobile communications. While generating a large amount of revenue was a less important goal than achieving an efficient geographic allocation of spectrum licenses to communications firms, the auctions generated more revenue than had been predicted by some potential bidders, according to auction analysts. In large part, the success of these auctions was due to careful consideration of the auction format and the identification of particular problematic features of auctions of similar assets in other countries.", "Most domestic and international divestitures have relied on private capital market firms as consultants and managers because of their frequent experience with complicated and high-valued transactions governing the transfer of assets in the private sector. Particularly in the case of public offerings but also for trade sales, the government would likely incur substantial costs to prepare its assets for sale or to pay for services performed by its financial advisers. For example, in the sale of Conrail, the government employed a variety of financial advisers and, in a key role, a prominent law firm with expertise in a variety of fields, including tax and employment law.", "Within the government, a variety of possible divestiture management options exist to guide the divestiture process and implement the decisions that must be made. In the Conrail divestiture, the Department of Transportation was primarily responsible for managing the sale. In the ongoing Alaska Power Administration sale, DOE is the lead agency. In our review of the USEC divestiture, we recommended that the Secretary of the Treasury lead the privatization process because that official will not be affected by the privatization and the Secretary\u2019s mission is clearly defined in terms of protecting taxpayers\u2019 general interests."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Many Specific Issues Related to Federal Hydropower Would Need to Be Addressed Before a Sale", "paragraphs": ["Besides the general decisions that arise from any complex divestiture, many specific issues related to federal hydropower would need to be addressed before a divestiture of federal hydropower assets could be completed.

The potential effects on wholesale and retail electric rates, including potential regional economic effects, would also need to be considered. Although determining how wholesale rates would be affected by a divestiture is difficult, the impacts would be influenced by the extent to which customers buy a large portion of their power from the PMAs and the prevailing wholesale rates in the regional market. The impact on retail rates and any regional economic impacts would depend on the extent to which a PMA\u2019s customers would absorb any cost increases or pass them on to their retail customers.", "A divestiture of hydropower assets would require time and resources.

Many federal projects serve multiple purposes, such as fish and wildlife habitat protection, flood control, hydropower generation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water uses, navigation, recreation, and water quality improvements. Unless the legislation that authorized a divestiture exempted the water projects from these laws, the statutory provisions would continue to affect how the new owners would manage the projects and how much electricity the new owners could generate. See appendix II for a description of relevant federal statutes.", "As described in chapter 2, under current arrangements the Bureau and the Corps manage the allocation of water in federal water projects to balance their multiple purposes. The uses of the water are sometimes complementary and sometimes competitive with one other. For example, water is stored in and is released from the reservoir to provide for recreation, but its release through the turbines could be scheduled to generate electricity in a way that is intended to maximize revenues. In contrast, Western\u2019s office in Billings, Montana, forecasts decreases in power revenues in the long-term because water, which would otherwise be used to generate electricity, will increasingly be used for irrigation and other purposes. In its fiscal year 1995 repayment study, Western predicted that revenues from the sale of hydropower could decrease from about $253 million in 2001 to about $213 million (in constant 1995 dollars) in fiscal year 2080 for the Pick-Sloan Program.", "Under authorizing legislation, such as the Flood Control Act of 1944 and the various reclamation acts, the Bureau and the Corps enjoy some latitude in managing water for various purposes. These agencies\u2019 role in arbitrating between multiple uses becomes especially visible during times of drought. For example, according to Western officials, during the drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s, water was increasingly assigned to irrigation. As a result, power generation suffered significantly in Western\u2019s service area. The role of the Bureau and the Corps has also become increasingly important as population and economic growth have intensified the competition over how water is used. For example, competition for water is now emerging even in areas with abundant rainfall, such as the Southeast. For several years, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia have been contesting the uses of water on two river basins in the Southeast (the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint) that are managed by the Corps. Georgia, which contains the headwaters of the waterways in question, needs increased water supplies to provide for the growing population of the Atlanta area, as well as for farming and industry. Florida is concerned about the effects of water levels on its barging industries. It is also concerned about upstream pollution because water from the Chattahoochee and other rivers flows into Apalachicola Bay\u2014a rich source of shellfish and shrimp. Alabama is also concerned about the cumulative impacts of potential water resource actions. In the 1980s, the Corps, responding to requests from several Georgia communities for additional water withdrawals from reservoirs, planned to reallocate water away from generating hydropower to increase the water supply. In June 1990, Alabama sued the Corps, challenging the adequacy of documentation about the environmental impacts of those reallocations and the Corps\u2019 procedures for operating its reservoirs. However, in January 1992, after Alabama put aside the lawsuit, the governors of the three states signed an agreement with the Corps to work together through a study to resolve their issues.

Because of these restrictions, the PMAs have forgone power revenues of millions of dollars since the late 1980s.", "In an example affecting Southeastern, the South Carolina Department of Wildlife and Marine Resources sued the Corps in 1988, alleging violations of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 at the Richard B. Russell Dam. The Russell project has eight hydropower units with a combined capacity of 600 MW\u2014four conventional hydropower units (the last of which came into commercial operation in 1986) and four pumpback units (which have never been in commercial operation). The U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina found that the Corps had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to complete an environmental impact statement (EIS) and issued an injunction against the installation and operation of the pumpback units. However, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit partially reversed the district court and allowed the Corps to install the pumpback units but not operate them until another EIS had been completed. This supplemental EIS was completed and a settlement agreement was negotiated that allowed environmental testing. According to Southeastern, the PMA has lost power revenues of about $36.1 million per year since 1994 because of the shutdown.", "In another example that affects Western, the obligation to protect endangered species has had a significant impact on the CVP\u2019s operations. Bureau officials said that, in response to the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the winter run of the Chinook salmon as endangered. According to these officials, to protect the needs of the salmon, the Bureau has restricted the use of the five hydropower units at the CVP\u2019s Shasta powerplant. They added that since 1987 these restrictions have resulted in additional costs of about $50 million to purchase power to meet Western\u2019s contractual obligations.", "According to officials from the Bureau, FERC, and the PMAs, as well as from environmentalist groups and trade associations, environmental restrictions on water usage to generate power will likely continue in the future. The effects will continue to include lost power revenues or, conversely, increased costs to procure alternative power supplies. For example, waterflow restrictions that are included under the preferred alternative of the final EIS of the Glen Canyon Dam could result in lost generating capacity of 442 MW in the winter and 470 MW in the summer. According to the Bureau, the cost to replace the lost capacity is about $44.2 million per year. The preferred alternative, also known as the \u201cmodified low fluctuating flow\u201d alternative, features river flows that are substantially reduced from historic levels, including flows that vary for purposes of maintaining the habitat.

If only the PMA (including the transmission assets) and/or the federal powerplants were divested, then the government\u2019s responsibilities would generally remain the same, unless specified otherwise in the divestiture legislation. If the government were to sell the dams and reservoirs, however, the responsibilities and costs of actions to mitigate environmental impacts would need to be allocated or reassigned.", "Moreover, with new and more comprehensive actions to mitigate environmental impacts, the uncertainty surrounding the availability of power would also need to be addressed. These actions frequently entail restrictions on releases of water to generate electricity or potentially significant, but unknown, future costs to mitigate environmental impacts. If the PMA and/or powerplants were divested, then uncertainty about the amount of power available for marketing could lower the price that buyers would be willing to pay or discourage some potential buyers from submitting bids. Likewise, if the dams and the reservoirs were divested, uncertainty about the amount of power that could be generated as well as uncertainty over the costs of future environmental mitigations could likewise lower the bids or discourage some prospective buyers from bidding. In addition, the existence of more competitive electric markets would also affect the attractiveness of purchasing the federal hydropower assets.", "Alternatively, if the government assumes some of the future liability for the costs of actions to mitigate environmental impacts, taxpayers may be forced to bear a significant, but currently unknown, future liability. Moreover, according to officials of DOE\u2019s PMA liaison office, because environmental laws could require an EIS, testing, and cleanup when federal property is sold, additional costs to sell the federal hydropower assets could be incurred.

In addition, according to Western officials, the PMA is reserving some of its capacity for Native American tribal entities that are expected to become new preference customers.", "The rights of Native Americans to water must be considered in a divestiture. Several Native American tribal entities hold reserved water rights with senior priority dates (for example, from time immemorial or the 1850s or 1860s) on river systems with federal water projects. Many of these entities have reserved water rights that have yet to be quantified and have water uses that have yet to be determined. The amounts of water associated with these rights and the manner in which the rights are exercised would likely affect hydropower operations and the distribution of power revenues. For example, according to Bureau officials, one legal settlement with tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation, Montana, included rights to about 1 million acre-feet of water from the Missouri River.", "Other potential claims of Native Americans would affect a divestiture of PMAs and related hydropower assets. For example, under federal legislation, excess federal real property in Oklahoma is subject to transfer to the Secretary of the Interior in trust for Oklahoma Native American tribal entities. According to Southwestern officials, this legislation would complicate a divestiture, although the extent of potential claims by Native Americans under this legislation is difficult to determine because of the lack of information about the prior ownership of lands on which the federal assets are located. According to PMA officials, the PMAs have 880 miles of transmission lines located on rights-of-way that traverse the lands of Native American tribal entities. In the event of a divestiture of a PMA\u2019s transmission assets, if the Native Americans agreed to a transfer of these rights-of-way to a buyer, they could expect compensation. Finally, under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, certain Native American cultural artifacts found on federal locations must be returned to the relevant Native American tribal entity. Corps officials responsible for managing federal water projects from which Southwestern markets power explained that they have been involved in numerous cases in the past several years involving this law.", "Providing federal hydropower to Native Americans would also affect a divestiture. According to Bureau and Western officials, in part because the federal government has a trust responsibility with Native American tribal entities and because those entities are expected to become new preference customers, Western is entering into a process to reallocate the power it will sell to its current and future customers. For example, it is setting aside at least 4 percent of its existing hydropower capacity at the Pick-Sloan Program for Native Americans and other new customers. Western is also changing its rules concerning power reallocations to make it easier for Native American tribal entities to buy federal power. These obligations would complicate a divestiture because they would involve selling power to new preference customers and extending existing contracts\u2014for example, for 20 years (until the year 2020) at the Pick-Sloan Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Licensing and Regulating Divested Hydropower Assets Would Introduce Uncertainty Into the Divestiture Process", "paragraphs": ["Before a sale could be completed, the regulatory treatment of the divested hydropower assets would need to be addressed. While many options for regulating the operations of divested hydropower assets exist, including regulatory regimes that could be established by federal, state, or regional authorities, FERC currently licenses the operation of nonfederal hydropower assets. With the proper resources, FERC officials believe they could license and regulate divested hydropower assets. They stated that the Bureau and the Corps have been able to accommodate emerging issues at federal water projects, such as environmental restrictions on water uses, with more flexibility than FERC\u2019s quasi-judicial licensing process. They also stated that the Commission\u2019s limited flexibility and the timing of its actions on licensing stem from the authority of other federal and state agencies to attach conditions to the license. Currently, FERC primarily regulates the reasonableness of wholesale rates charged by the PMAs and does not provide more detailed oversight of them and the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 assets and operations.", "According to FERC officials, the extent of its regulation after a divestiture would depend upon the specific assets divested. A FERC operating license would not be needed if only the PMA\u2019s assets (its right to market hydropower and, in the case of Southwestern and Western, also the transmission facilities) were divested because the operating agencies would continue to own and operate the powerplants. The operating agencies would continue to manage the water as in the past and the existing restrictions would likely remain in effect. The buyer would market the power subject to the same conditions as the former PMA\u2014subject to the existing purposes of the water project.", "If a divestiture included the powerplants, the new owner would then be required to obtain a FERC operating license, unless the requirement for FERC\u2019s licensing and regulatory activities were specifically exempted by legislation. Licensing a divested hydropower plant could take a long time; FERC\u2019s licensing process averages 2.5 years but it has taken as long as 10 to 15 years. In granting an operating license for a hydropower plant, FERC is required to weigh the plant\u2019s impact on such \u201cnondevelopmental values\u201d as the environment and recreation. The licensing action involves such numerous studies as the powerplant\u2019s impact on fish, plant, and wildlife species; water use and quality; and any nearby cultural and archeological resources. Moreover, the government of each affected state would perform a water quality certification. In addition, to accommodate any \u201cnondevelopmental values,\u201d FERC could restrict the use of water for generating electricity, resulting in hydropower generating units that have been \u201cderated\u201d\u2014that is, their generating capacity has been reduced. For example, according to studies by the Electric Power Research Institute,from 1984 to 1989, 16 hydropower plants that had been relicensed were actually derated while 8 powerplants increased their capacity. FERC officials cautioned that if the powerplant, dam, and reservoir were sold, then FERC\u2019s licensing process could revisit the management and uses of the water and possibly change the available electric-generating capacity. The uncertainty regarding the length of time to complete FERC\u2019s licensing process as well as the amount of generating capacity after licensing is completed could reduce the number and amounts of bids for the resources. However, if the new owners of a hydropower plant were allowed to operate the plant without a FERC license, they would have a competitive advantage against other operators who are subject to FERC\u2019s licensing requirements.", "A congressional bill introduced on July 23, 1996, contained provisions that would have provided an operating license with a 10-year term for divested hydropower assets. The owners would then have been subject to a FERC license. In congressional testimony in 1995 regarding divestiture of the PMAs, the Chair of the FERC suggested that divestiture legislation specify an automatic grant of the 10-year operating license and require that the divested powerplants continue to operate according to the preexisting operating agreements. Following a divestiture, FERC would then subject the facility to the normal FERC licensing procedure.", "According to FERC officials, FERC would be able to regulate divested multipurpose federal hydropower assets because the Commission already has this responsibility for 1,000 nonfederal hydropower facilities. They said that most nonfederal hydropower plants have widespread impacts and multiple uses because their associated dams and reservoirs store water, thereby affecting water upstream, downstream, and across state lines.

According to PMA and industry officials, many of these customers are smaller ones located in geographically remote areas. Other factors, such as increasing competition in the wholesale market or mandated limits on rate increases could mitigate the rate increases for these customers. The change in retail rates to end-users (i.e., residential, industrial, and commercial customers) would depend on how much rates increase for the preference customers that serve them.

For example, if a customer buys 90 percent of its power from the PMA and the buyer of that PMA increases the former PMA\u2019s rates by 50 percent, the preference customer would see its overall rate for power from all sources increase by about 41 percent, if all other factors were held constant. In contrast, if a preference customer buys only 10 percent of its power from the PMA, it would see its overall rate for wholesale power from all sources increase by about 3 percent.", "Because preference customers differ in how much they use the PMAs for their power, they will not be affected equally by a divestiture.

They believe that, after a PMA is divested, preference customers who relied heavily on that PMA will be able to buy power from independent power producers, energy brokers, or energy marketers at a relatively low cost. In addition, they contend that many municipal and cooperative utilities already are competitive participants in the wholesale market. However, representatives of PMAs and their preference customers believe that having access to alternate supplies of electricity is not enough. They note that even in cases where preference customers may buy most of their electricity from alternate sources, these customers often rely on the PMA for power during hours of peak demand, particularly in regions in which Southeastern and Southwestern sell power. Having access to inexpensive power during times of peak demand is important to these customers because typically power sold to meet this demand is more expensive than power sold at other times.", "Finally, the ongoing deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry contributes to the difficulty of assessing the potential impacts of a divestiture.

Limited available studies have shown the economic impacts of a rate change by the PMAs to be minor on industrial and residential customers because preference customers have relied on power from PMAs for only a small portion of their total power and electricity has been a relatively small portion of the cost of doing business for most commercial enterprises and industries as well as a small portion of household expenditures. But regional economies that rely on such electricity-intensive industries as primary metals and chemicals would see the greatest amount of economic harm from any rate increases after a divestiture. According to officials of the Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON), the cost of electricity for such industries as aluminum smelters, glass, and chemicals can reach from 30 percent to 40 percent of production costs. For example, in response to TVA\u2019s double-digit rate increases of the 1970s, industries in its service area ceased their operations and in some cases relocated to where electrical rates were lower.
