Nonfederal entities are required to undergo a single audit if their expenditures of federal awards in a fiscal year exceed a certain threshold. A single audit is an audit of the award recipient's expenditure of federal awards and of its financial statements and can identify deficiencies in the award recipient's compliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements and in its financial management and internal control systems. Correcting such deficiencies can help reasonably assure the effective use of federal funds and reduce federal improper payments.", "Of the five agencies in GAO's study\u2014the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Transportation\u2014some of the agencies' subagencies that GAO reviewed did not effectively design policies and procedures to reasonably assure the timely submission of single audit reports by award recipients. The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) guidance requires that federal awarding agencies ensure that award recipients submit single audit reports within certain time frames. This can help assure that single audit findings are timely corrected.", "Most of the selected subagencies in GAO's review did not effectively design policies and procedures to reasonably assure that they issued timely management decisions containing the information required by OMB guidance. This guidance requires agencies to evaluate each award recipient's audit findings and corrective action plans and issue a management decision within 6 months of receipt of the single audit report as to the actions award recipients must take to correct each single audit finding. Such decisions may add clarity about the agency's position on the single audit finding and the corrective action.", "Only the two selected subagencies in Education had policies and procedures for using risk-based approaches to manage high-risk and recurring single audit findings. High-risk single audit findings may be seriously detrimental to federal programs and could result in improper payments. Recurring single audit findings have persisted for more than one audit period and may need more attention or resources to correct. With over 30,000 single audit reports submitted for fiscal year 2015 and constraints in resources for conducting federal oversight, managing single audit findings using a risk-based approach can assist in identifying and prioritizing problem areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 21 recommendations.

According to the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB), outlays for federal awards to state and local governments  totaled over $600 billion in fiscal year 2015. Federal agencies have  oversight responsibilities under the Single Audit Act of 1984, as amended  (Single Audit Act), for the funds that they award to nonfederal entities.  Federal award recipients that expend $750,000 or more in federal awards  in a fiscal year are required to undergo a single audit, which is an audit of  an entity\u2019s financial statements and federal awards, or a program-specific  audit, for the fiscal year.", "The audits required by the Single Audit Act are critical to the federal  government\u2019s ability to reasonably assure that federal funds are  safeguarded and used effectively. According to the U.S. Census Bureau,  as of July 2016, over 30,000 single audit reports were submitted for fiscal  year 2015. Single audits can identify deficiencies (audit findings) in the  award recipients\u2019 material compliance with the provision of laws,  regulations, contracts, or grant agreements and in their financial  management and internal control systems. For example, some single  audits have found that materials used for roads and bridges were not  tested appropriately, doctors were paid billions of dollars for medical  services without adequate procedures to verify whether the services had  been performed, and unauthorized users had access to Medicaid  payment systems. Federal agencies are responsible for following up on  audit findings to provide reasonable assurance that award recipients take  timely and appropriate action to correct deficiencies identified through the  single audit process. Correcting such deficiencies can help reduce  federal improper payments.", "The Single Audit Act directs OMB to prescribe guidance to implement the  act. Previously this guidance was in eight individual OMB circulars.

Federal awards include  grants, loans, loan guarantees, property, cooperative agreements,  interest subsidies, insurance, food commodities, direct appropriations,  other assistance, and federal cost-reimbursement contracts. A single  audit is an audit of both the entity\u2019s financial statements and expenditures  of federal awards. The Single Audit Act mandates that federal agencies  assume oversight responsibility for the funds that they award to  nonfederal entities. OMB Circular No. A-133 requires that federal  awarding agencies ensure that award recipients complete and submit  single audit reports within the earlier of 30 days after the receipt of the  auditor\u2019s report or 9 months of the award recipient\u2019s fiscal year-end,  unless a longer period for audit is agreed to in advance by the cognizant  or oversight agency for audit.

A  management decision entails the federal awarding agency or pass- through entity evaluating the single audit report findings and the award  recipient\u2019s corrective action plan and issuing a written decision on  whether the federal awarding agency is satisfied with the corrective action  plan and, if not, what corrective action is necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Example of the Time Frames for Single Audit Reports with Single Audit Findings", "paragraphs": ["Federal award recipients are required to submit their single audit  reporting packages to the FAC within the shorter of 30 days after receipt  of the single audit report from the auditor or nine months after the end of  the award recipient\u2019s fiscal year.

Under the  time frames provided by the Single Audit Act and OMB Circular No. A- 133, it may take up to 15 months for the award recipient to initiate  corrective action for single audit findings.

Specifically, according to FNS officials, the  single audit liaison checks the FAC for single audit reports and notifies  the regional offices that single audits are available for download from the  FAC. While these policies and procedures allow FNS to identify the  award recipients that have submitted single audit reports, including the  date when each single audit report was submitted, the policies and  procedures do not allow FNS to reasonably assure that award recipients  that have not submitted their single audit reports do so by the required  due dates. An FNS official stated that the agency does not maintain a list  of award recipients that should have submitted single audit reports to the  FAC but did not. In addition, the FNS official stated that its award  recipients are primarily state agencies and that FNS receives a statewide  single audit report once annual statewide audits are completed.

As stated in our report, the Uniform Guidance is effective for  audits for fiscal years beginning on or after December 26, 2014. However,  Uniform Guidance, Section 200.521, Management Decisions, carried  forward the requirements in OMB Circular No. A-133 for management  decisions relating to the content requirements and the time frames for  issuing management decisions.

CPD  stated that neither OMB Circular No. A-133 nor the Uniform Guidance  makes reference to high-risk or recurring single audit findings. However,  as stated in our report, leading risk management practices include that an  organization develop, implement, and continuously improve a process for  managing risk and integrate it into the organization\u2019s overall governance,  strategy, policies, planning, management, and reporting processes.  Further, our report also notes that in July 2016, OMB released OMB  Circular No. A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility for Enterprise Risk  Management and Internal Control, effective beginning fiscal year 2016,  which requires federal agencies to consider risk management in their  operations.", "Also, in its e-mail, CPD stated that our definition of high-risk findings was  too broad. Our definition states that high-risk single audit findings are  findings that may be seriously detrimental to federal programs. Among  other things, high-risk single audit findings could result in program failure;  abuse; mismanagement; misuse of federal funds; improper payments;  significantly impaired service; significantly reduced program efficiencies  and effectiveness; unreliable data for decision making; and unauthorized  disclosure, manipulation, or misuse of sensitive information. This  definition provides agencies with the flexibility to analyze the types of  risks pertinent to their operating environments and to develop definitions  of high-risk single audit findings that they deem appropriate.", "CPD also stated that our definition of high-risk findings does not lend itself  to uniform and consistent interpretation across all CPD programs or within  HUD and is unlikely to be consistently interpreted across all federal  agencies, undermining the basis upon which the Uniform Guidance was  developed. However, CPD and HUD can develop a definition of high-risk  single audit findings that is pertinent to their operating environment and  applied consistently within their organization. As stated in our report, an  effective risk management strategy over high-risk and recurring single  audit findings can be particularly useful to help management identify  potential problems and reasonably allocate resources to address them,  which can help improve program performance and outcomes. In addition,  OMB Circular No. A-123 states that risks are analyzed in relation to  achievement of the objectives established in an agency\u2019s strategic plan  and are to be reexamined regularly to identify new risks or changes to  existing risks. Thus, risks can be agency specific. To that end, the  definition for high-risk single audit findings need not be uniform across the  federal government.", "We continue to believe that CPD needs to take action to implement this  recommendation to design and implement policies and procedures for  identifying and managing high-risk and recurring single audit findings  using a risk-based approach.", "In an e-mail on behalf of the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, PIH  stated that it has been in the process of revising its policies and  procedures for reviewing and taking action on single audit report findings  for public housing agencies.

We selected for our audit the five agencies that had the  largest dollar amount of total reported outlays for grants to state and local  governments in fiscal year 2013. These five agencies\u2014the Departments  of Agriculture (Agriculture), Education (Education), Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), Transportation (Transportation), and Health and  Human Services (HHS)\u2014collectively accounted for 93 percent of total  reported outlays for federal grants to state and local governments in fiscal  year 2013. For Agriculture, Education, HUD, and Transportation, we  selected subagencies that collectively outlaid over 90 percent of their  respective agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2013 total reported outlays for grants to  state and local governments. For HHS, we selected the single largest  subagency within HHS, which outlaid over 83 percent of HHS\u2019s fiscal year  2013 total reported outlays for grants to state and local governments. We  also reviewed HHS\u2019s Audit Resolution Division, which has a key role in  HHS\u2019s single audit oversight process but does not provide federal  awards. (See table 1.)", "For our first objective, we reviewed the Single Audit Act of 1984, as  amended (Single Audit Act); OMB Circular No. A-133; and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government to identify agency  responsibilities. In addition, we reviewed the selected agencies\u2019 and  subagencies\u2019 written policies and procedures for those areas and  interviewed selected agency and subagency officials with responsibility  for single audit oversight. We also identified four key steps relating to the  design of single audit policies and procedures that would assist federal  awarding agencies in fulfilling their responsibilities under OMB Circular  No. A-133 for reasonably assuring that award recipients submit single  audit reports timely. To that end, designing policies, procedures, and  mechanisms to include the following steps would help provide reasonable  assurance that agencies can fulfill these responsibilities:  identify award recipients that should have submitted single audit  reports,  verify that the award recipients submitted single audit reports, determine whether the reports were submitted within the required time  take action to obtain single audit reports when award recipients did  not submit the reports within the required time frames.", "For purposes of our audit, we reviewed the agencies\u2019 and subagencies\u2019  policies and procedures to assess whether they reasonably assure that  award recipients completed and submitted their single audit reports within  the required time frames, using 9 months after each award recipient\u2019s  fiscal year-end as the applicable time period. Nine months after the fiscal  year-end is in most cases the later date compared to 30 days after receipt  of the single audit report; we used this time period because it generally  represents the maximum amount of time award recipients would have to  submit single audit reports, and measuring the length of time after receipt  as the applicable time period would have been unduly burdensome for  our audit.", "We requested from each subagency a list of award recipients that  expended in excess of $500,000 in federal awards during fiscal year 2013  and were therefore required to submit single audit reports for fiscal year  2013. We then queried the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) to  determine whether selected award recipients submitted their single audit  reports timely. While we do not present data directly from the FAC in this  report, because the FAC database is integral to the Single Audit Act  reporting requirements, we undertook data reliability procedures to  ascertain whether award recipients were submitting their single audit  reports to the FAC. Specifically, we randomly selected 15 award  recipients from each of the six subagencies that provided lists\u2014Food and Nutrition Service, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office  of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Office of Public and  Indian Housing, Federal Highway Administration, and Federal Transit  Administration\u2014for a total of 90 sampled cases. We received a listing of  award recipients from the remaining three subagencies: Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services, Rural Development, and Office of  Community Planning and Development.", "We were unable to use the lists for our testing because lists from the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Rural Development  were not generated independently of the FAC. In addition, the Office of  Community Planning and Development did not provide us with a list that  facilitated searching in the FAC. Two of the six responding subagencies  provided us with a list that included 8 award recipients that expended less  than $500,000. For the remaining 82 cases, we undertook searches in the  FAC to ascertain whether those award recipients had single audit reports  in the FAC database. In 72 of the 82 cases, we were able to find the  applicable fiscal year 2013 single audit report. In the remaining 10 cases,  we could not readily locate an applicable 2013 single audit report using  our multistep search procedures. Our random sample, which examined a  limited number of single audit reports for the selected subagencies, was  not designed to be generalizable. As a result, we do not make a  generalizable statement about the completeness of the single audit  reports in the FAC database.", "For our second objective, we reviewed selected policies and procedures  and interviewed agency and subagency officials to clarify our  understanding of those policies and procedures. We also randomly  selected nongeneralizable samples of single audit findings applicable to  each subagency. For each sample item, we requested and reviewed  documentation relating to written management decisions.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed the selected agencies\u2019 and  subagencies\u2019 written policies and procedures for those areas and  interviewed selected agency and subagency officials to clarify our  understanding of those policies and procedures.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2015 to February 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
