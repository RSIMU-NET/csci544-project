Each process is managed and overseen  by different organizations and leaders within DOD and the military  departments. At the DOD level, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) is responsible for  the acquisition function and is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for  major defense acquisition programs, whereas the Joint Chiefs of Staff are  responsible for implementing the requirements process, and the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is responsible for the resource  process. At the military department level, where programs are largely  planned and executed, the civilian service acquisition executive is  responsible for the acquisition process, while the service chiefs have  responsibility for assisting the military departments in the development of  requirements and the resourcing processes. We have previously found  that these processes are fragmented, making it difficult for the department  to achieve a balanced mix of weapon systems that are affordable and  feasible and provide the best military value to the warfighter. In recent  years, Congress and DOD have taken steps to better integrate the  requirements and acquisition processes. For example, the department  added new decision points and reviews for weapon programs as they  progress through the acquisition process. Additionally, USD (AT&L) now  serves as an advisor to the council that reviews requirements for major  weapon programs. Furthermore, the Fiscal Year 2011 National Defense  Authorization Act delineated that the service chiefs have a responsibility  to assist the secretaries of the military departments concerned in carrying  out the acquisition function.", "Generally, major defense acquisition programs go through a series of  phases as they progress from the identification of the need for a new  capability, through initial planning of a solution, to system development,  and finally production and deployment of a fielded system. High-level,  operational requirements of major weapon systems are first generated,  vetted, and put forward for DOD-level review and approval, generally by  the military services. These requirements are prioritized based on how  critical the associated system characteristics are to delivering the military  capability. Key performance parameters are considered most critical by  the sponsor military organization, while key system attributes and other  performance attributes are considered essential for an effective military  capability. Through systems engineering efforts, these high-level  requirements must then be translated into lower-level technical  requirements and specifications to design and build the weapon system.  Figure 1 illustrates the notional types and levels of requirements for  weapon system development.", "Following military service-level reviews and approvals, the high-level  operational requirements, which are specified in a capability development  document, go through several key stages where DOD-level reviews and  validations are required, a process accomplished for joint military  requirements within the department\u2019s Joint Capabilities Integration and  Development System (JCIDS) process. Capability requirements  documents for these programs are assessed and validated within JCIDS  by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the advice of the Joint  Requirements Oversight Council (JROC), which is chaired by the Vice  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is comprised of the Vice Chiefs  of Staff of each military service and the Combatant Commanders, when  directed by the chairman.", "These high-level requirements along with several other acquisition-related  analyses and documents (e.g., acquisition strategy, cost estimates, and  test and evaluation plan) are required for approval at Milestone B, when  an acquisition program formally starts system development. As major  defense acquisition programs go through the iterative phases of the  acquisition process, they are reviewed by the Defense Acquisition Board,  which is chaired by USD (AT&L) and includes the secretaries of the  military departments and other senior leaders. However, prior to these  DOD-level reviews, programs have reviews and approvals at the military  service level where the service acquisition executives and service chiefs  are involved. In our prior report on the acquisition chain of command, we  found that service chiefs and their supporting offices have multiple  opportunities to be involved in major defense acquisition programs  throughout the acquisition process, including participation in integrated  product teams, service-level reviews during system development, and  requirements review and approval prior to a program\u2019s production  decision. Figure 2 illustrates DOD\u2019s current acquisition process and  where the military service chiefs and service acquisition executives have  primary responsibilities.

One current service chief cited an example where  program officials unnecessarily created a lower-level requirement for an  aircraft system that did not meet any validated operational need. The  service chief attributed the problem, in part, to a lack of military officers  with acquisition expertise and a corresponding absence of acquisition  officials with operational expertise. A former DOD official pointed to the  lengthy timeframe usually involved in developing major weapon systems  and how requirements increases occur because programs want to  introduce the latest technology advances into a system, such as  information technology and electronics equipment. Some current and  former service chiefs stated that because they lack visibility into  programs, they are unable to influence trade-offs between requirements  and resources. One current service chief provided an example when  program officials, in an effort to meet a validated operational requirement  for speed, were developing an engine that led to cost increases, while he  believed there was an existing engine available that would have required  a minor reduction in capability in favor of reducing cost.", "The service chiefs also had concerns that requirements growth is a  function of too many stakeholders within DOD having the ability to  influence acquisition programs, making it difficult to hold anyone  accountable for program outcomes. Many of these service chiefs believed  that cultural factors and incentives within the department make it difficult  for program managers to manage requirements growth and execute  programs effectively. These chiefs said that program managers and other  acquisition officials often lack experience and expertise to manage  requirements and acquisitions, are incentivized to meet internal  milestones and not raise issues, and rely too much on contractors to  figure out what is needed to develop a weapon system.

However, some chiefs indicated that involvement in acquisition programs,  in general, varies by service chief based on their priorities and the other  personalities involved. Several current and former service chiefs agreed  that they have been involved in the oversight of some programs, but their  level of involvement is dependent on the importance of the program and  established working relationships with the service acquisition executive.  One service chief stated that, at times, service chiefs have not been  involved due to unfamiliarity with the acquisition process, their own  perceived role in the process, or a lack of interest in an acquisition.", "Several former service chiefs thought that establishing co-chairmanship  for key decision reviews and co-signature of key acquisition documents,  particularly at the military department level, may improve collaboration,  encourage requirements trade-offs during development, and force the  service chiefs to share the burden of responsibility for acquisition  programs. One suggestion from an outside expert for implementing this  solution was to have the service chief and the service acquisition  executive co-chair the service-level acquisition review board. Some  military and acquisition leaders noted, however, that requiring co- chairmanship of acquisition meetings and co-signature of decision  documents could slow an already complex process and further  discourage program managers from raising issues and concerns.", "In general, the former service chiefs we interviewed emphasized the need  for a stronger role in the acquisition chain of command with more formal  authority and mechanisms in place to ensure that the service chiefs are  consistently involved and sufficiently able to influence program decisions.

These acquisition experts note, however, that while service chiefs had  significant influence on certain acquisition programs in the past, their  close involvement did not always result in successful cost, schedule, or  performance outcomes. For example, service chiefs had significant  involvement in the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship and the Army\u2019s Future  Combat System and, in both cases, viewed the programs as providing  vital operational capabilities and needing to be fielded quickly.

During system development, the high- level operational requirements, such as key performance parameters and  key system attributes, usually need to be further analyzed by the  contractor using systems engineering techniques to fully understand,  break down, and translate them into technical weapon system-level  requirements and contract specifications. Systems engineering analysis  translates operational requirements into detailed system requirements for  which requisite technological, software, engineering, and production  capabilities have been identified. It also provides knowledge to enable the  developer to identify and resolve gaps before system development  begins. It is often at this point\u2014when the technical specifications are  finally understood and design challenges are recognized\u2014that cost and  schedule increases materialize in a program. What may appear to be  requirements growth is the recognition that the weapon system will  require considerably more time and money than expected to build to  these derived technical specifications to meet the validated operational  requirements.", "The process of translating high-level operational requirements into low- level requirements and technical specifications in many programs does  not usually occur until well after Milestone B approval (see figure 3 for a  notional depiction).", "The number of requirements can expand greatly over time, as the  designs of the subsystems and components become defined. In the case  of the Army\u2019s Future Combat System, a large program that was intended  to equip combat brigades with an advanced set of integrated systems,  requirements were still being defined when the program was canceled  beginning in 2009\u2014after 6 years and $18 billion had been spent on initial  system development. The program was approved to start system  development with 7 key performance parameters. In order to meet these  key performance parameters\u2014which did not change\u2014the program  ultimately translated them into over 50,000 lower-level requirements  before it was canceled. Requirements definition remains a challenge  facing current major defense acquisition programs. For example, the F-35  program, which was conceptualized around three aircraft design variants  to achieve cost efficiencies, has had difficulty reconciling different  requirements imposed by the military services. According to program  officials, in order to meet the nine validated key performance parameters,  the program developed approximately 3,600 specifications. While the  operational requirements for the F-35 have not increased, factors such as  poorly defined requirements, significant concurrency between  development and production, and immature technologies have  contributed to significant cost growth and delays in the program.", "We found that several of the major defense acquisition programs that  experienced cost growth, but did not report changing key performance  parameters, had a significant number of engineering change orders and  other configuration changes. As operational requirements become better  understood during system development, contract specifications change to  reflect what is needed to build the weapon system. Changes show up in  engineering change orders and other design configuration changes,  which contribute to cost growth. For example, between 2009 and 2013,  the Littoral Combat Ship program reported 487 changes to its system  configuration or design. Similarly, the Joint Tactical Radio System  Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit Radios program reported  making 29 engineering changes and 11,573 software changes between  2009 and 2013. In neither case were the high-level requirements  increased. While some configuration changes are necessary to manage  obsolescence and other issues, the pursuit of poorly defined  requirements results in overly optimistic cost and schedule estimates that  are sometimes unachievable\u2014leading to cost and schedule growth as  programs encounter increased technical challenges necessary to achieve  operational requirements.", "GAO\u2019s prior work as well as DOD\u2019s own policy emphasizes that the  translation of operational requirements into technical weapon system  specifications, which are informed by systems engineering, should take  place prior to approving a program at Milestone B and awarding a  contract that locks in the requirements. This allows trade-offs between  requirements and resources to take place, and the establishment of more  realistic cost, schedule, and performance commitments before programs  get underway. However, DOD often does not perform sufficient up-front  requirements analysis via systems engineering on programs to determine  whether the requirements are feasible and there is a sound business  case to move forward. Programs are proposed with unachievable  requirements and overly optimistic cost and schedule estimates and,  usually, participants on both the requirements side and the acquisition  side are loathe to trade away performance. For example, a preliminary  design review is a key systems engineering event that should be held  before the start of system development to ensure requirements are  defined and feasible, and the proposed design can meet the requirements  within cost, schedule, and other system constraints. In 2013, GAO  reviewed the 38 major defense acquisition programs that held preliminary  design reviews that year. Only 11 of these programs held design  reviews prior to the start of system development. The remaining 27  programs completed or planned to complete their design reviews  approximately 24 months, on average, after the start of development.

Some chiefs also noted that  reassessments of requirements, acquisition, and funding are not  conducted often enough during program execution. According to one  service chief, under the current acquisition process, there are too few  points of collaboration among requirements officers, acquisition  professionals, systems engineers, and cost estimators to work out  requirements early in the process or to address problems and limitations  associated with meeting operational requirements after programs are  underway. Another service chief noted that the acquisition workforce  lacks experience in operational and tactical settings and that his  requirements community lacks technical acquisition skills, so it is  important that collaboration regularly occurs between the two  communities. Further, one chief emphasized that requirements officers  are too dependent upon the acquisition community and its contractors to  work out requirements.", "Several current and former service chiefs voiced concern that cost and  schedule problems that acquisition programs experience are due to the  failure to make appropriate trade-offs during system development. They  indicated that too often programs encounter cost and schedule problems  because in striving to meet challenging requirements the programs end  up making technical and design changes to the weapon system. For  example, one former service chief highlighted a combat vehicle program  in development which had fallen short of meeting its vehicle speed  requirement by a small percentage. Instead of making trade-offs, and  perhaps seeking requirements relief, the program manager requested  additional funding so the contractor could make design changes to the  engine. Another service chief stated that requirement changes made  during weapon system development are often viewed as sacrificing  capability rather than reconciling requirements with operational  conditions. The chief was concerned that program managers too often  take the view that requirements cannot be changed and avoid elevating  problems to leadership before they become critical, forgoing the  opportunity to make needed trade-offs. In addition, one service chief  described this problem as \u201ccost creep\u201d to meet requirements, not  \u201crequirements creep\u201d.

Almost all of the service chiefs stated that there is a  need to further enhance expertise within the government, and several  specified expertise in systems engineering.

Some service chiefs advocated that  having systems engineering capabilities available to the military services  during requirements development could help to ensure earlier  assessment of requirements feasibility. The service chiefs\u2019 views on the  importance of systems engineering is consistent with our prior acquisition  work, which calls for DOD to implement a knowledge-based approach to  guide the match of defense program needs with available technology and  resources.", "The service chiefs expressed a willingness to be more involved in the  management and oversight of acquisition programs.

In order  to improve program outcomes, DOD must focus its efforts on better  integrating the requirements and acquisition processes, which can be  achieved through better collaboration between these communities from  the generation of requirements through system development, coupled  with a greater emphasis on systems engineering and knowledge  attainment early in a program\u2019s life cycle. Without sufficient systems  engineering input to better define requirements and examine trade-offs  early on, there is no assurance that acquisition programs going forward  have a sound basis to start system development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that requirements are well defined and well understood  before a program is approved to start system development, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the military service  chiefs and service acquisition executives to work together to take the  following two actions:", "Assess whether sufficient systems engineering expertise is available  during the requirements development process; and", "Develop a better way to make sure sufficient systems engineering is  conducted and opportunities exist to better define requirements and  assess resource trade-offs before a program starts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report, which  are reprinted in appendix II. The department concurred with both of our  recommendations, stating that the early application of systems  engineering expertise and ensuring the availability of appropriately skilled  personnel are critical to successful program outcomes. DOD noted that  recent changes to department-wide policies, such as DOD Instruction  5000.02, strengthen the department\u2019s focus on conducting systems  engineering and making trade-offs during requirements development and  pre-program planning. DOD further agreed that continuing to improve  engagement between the requirements and acquisition communities will  result in better informed program initiation and resourcing decisions.", "We are encouraged that DOD agrees with our recommendations and has  recently taken steps to strengthen its policies and identify the need for  early systems engineering. However, for many years DOD policies have  emphasized the importance of a knowledge-based approach to acquiring  weapon systems, but practice does not always follow policy. Instead,  incentives exist that encourage deviation from sound policies and  practices. We believe that DOD must focus on achieving better  collaboration between the requirements and acquisition communities  such as by ensuring that more systems engineering and other expertise  are applied when requirements are being defined. It is through informed  collaboration that knowledge will be attained, trade-offs between  requirements and resources can be made earlier, and acquisition  programs will begin development with realistic cost and schedule  estimates, ultimately leading to improved outcomes.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Air Force,  Army, and Navy; the Chief of Staff of the Air Force; the Chief of Staff of  the Army; the Chief of Naval Operations; the Commandant of the Marine  Corps; and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics.

This report reviews further related issues  and concerns the military service chiefs have with the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) acquisition process and outcomes it produces.  Specifically, we examined (1) the views of current and former military  service chiefs on the current acquisition process, and (2) key problems or  factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and our  assessment of these issues.", "To obtain the views of current and former military service chiefs on the  current acquisition process, we conducted interviews with 12 current and  former military service chiefs and vice chiefs between August and  December 2014. We met with all current military service chiefs and vice  chiefs as of September 2014, including the Chief and Vice Chief of Staff  of the Air Force, the Chief and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief  and Vice Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant and Assistant  Commandant of the Marine Corps. These individuals possessed joint-  and service-level experience, including positions as the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combatant Commander. In December 2014,  after completing our interviews, we analyzed our findings and sent a  summary to the four current and three former military service chiefs, but  not the vice chiefs, for their review and comment. We received responses  from five of the seven service chiefs, all of whom concurred with our  findings. We reviewed any comments and made changes to the summary  document, as appropriate. We also interviewed or sought the  perspectives of additional current and former DOD leadership, including  the Service Acquisition Executive of the Air Force, Army, and Navy;  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff; and  another former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We analyzed  evidence and examples collected from our interviews with current and  former military service chiefs and DOD leadership. We also reviewed  findings from existing reports and compendiums focused on the  acquisition chain of command and interviewed acquisition subject matter  experts to discuss the current acquisition process, the role of the military  service chiefs in the acquisition chain of command, and potential  solutions to improve program outcomes. We reviewed prior GAO work on  weapon system acquisition and commercial best practices and analyzed  the extent to which evidence exists that would demonstrate that these  potential solutions may improve program outcomes.", "To assess key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the  acquisition process and our assessment of these issues, we drew upon  our extensive body of work in defense acquisitions and best practices,  and reviewed program execution information from ongoing major defense  acquisition programs. We reviewed the annual Selected Acquisition  Reports (SAR) from 2009 to 2013 for the 78 programs in DOD\u2019s current  portfolio of major defense acquisition programs. SAR data was collected  from the Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval (DAMIR)  Purview system, referred to as DAMIR. We assessed the reliability of the  data by reviewing existing information about DAMIR and determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We  analyzed the performance metrics to determine the extent to which  programs were reporting changes to key performance parameters. Our  analysis was limited to unclassified requirements that are included as part  of the SAR. In October 2014, we developed and submitted a  questionnaire to 28 major defense acquisition programs that had reported  key requirement changes in their respective SAR from 2009 to 2013,  sought requirement relief from the Joint Requirements Oversight Council,  or experienced a development cost increase or decrease of 10 percent or  more between 2011 and 2013. We conducted two pretests of the  questionnaire prior to distribution to ensure that our questions were clear,  unbiased, and consistently interpreted. We obtained responses from all  28 programs, and in cases where questionnaire results differed from  previously collected SAR data, we submitted follow-up questions to the  program office to adjudicate any discrepancies. To determine the extent  to which programs that experienced development cost growth also  changed key requirements, we compared the research, development, test  and evaluation cost estimates from 2009 and 2013 for DOD\u2019s current  portfolio of major defense acquisition programs, as reported in their  annual SAR. In instances where a program began development after  2009, we compared the program\u2019s initial research, development, test and  evaluation cost estimate with its 2013 current estimate. We then reviewed  any program that had a cost increase of more than 20 percent to  determine if this program also reported key requirement changes in its  annual reports for the same time period. We also leveraged prior and  ongoing GAO work on weapon system acquisition.", "We conducted this audit from October 2014 to June 2015 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact:", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments:", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, John E.
