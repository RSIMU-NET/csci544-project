In locations overseas, DOD supplements its MTF care with civilian host  nation care, where medical practice, language, and culture can differ  significantly from U.S. civilian care. For example, health care in Japan and  Italy is characterized by more inpatient admissions and longer hospital  stays than in the U.S. system. In many countries, nurses and administrative  staff do not speak English, and the English fluency of doctors varies,  making it difficult for patients to discuss their medical problems with host  nation personnel. In addition, patients expressed concerns that medical  terms might not be translated accurately. Cultural differences have  similarly affected beneficiary perceptions of care. For example, in some  areas of Europe and the Pacific, doctors are unaccustomed to American  patients who may take a more active role in their health care and ask  questions about their diagnosis or treatment strategies, procedures, and  expected outcomes. As a result, these patients can become frustrated with  the more reserved attitude of host nation doctors. Other cultural  differences can create a gap in care. For example, in Japan and Korea,  patients\u2019 families, not nursing staff, typically provide sheets, towels, and  toiletries and assist patients during hospitalizations. In 2000, we reported  that differences such as these have caused frustrations for some  beneficiaries\u2014both men and women\u2014and in some cases have resulted in  their delaying care until they can travel to an MTF.", "Remote locations\u2014both in the United States and overseas\u2014also present a  challenge to DOD in providing care to all of its beneficiaries. In 2000, we  reported that, according to DOD, there are some deficiencies in provider  availability in rural areas of TRICARE regions in the United States. In  remote areas, beneficiaries can have difficulty finding providers, especially  for certain types of specialty care, and often have to follow the accepted  community access standards, which may require traveling a long distance  to obtain care. For example, in some parts of South Dakota, a 2-hour drive  is considered routine, and in Alaska, all patients are transported to the  lower 48 states for certain types of care. In remote locations overseas,  many of DOD\u2019s beneficiaries rely on the State Department to provide or  help arrange their medical care through a list of local providers who meet  U.S. medical standards.", "In deployed settings, such as in the field or on a ship, active duty members  may be limited in the choice of health care services and supplies available  since DOD tailors the medical capability to the setting and the size of the  unit deployed. For women, this constraint has raised concerns about  privacy. In 1999, we reported that women deployed to Bosnia described the  base camp clinics as very small and lacking interior walls and doors to  shield individuals being examined. These deployed women also had  concerns that their medical problems would not be kept confidential by  staff at the clinics and that word of their visit would be known around the  camp. Deployed women also raised concerns about the availability of  supplies, such as feminine hygiene products and birth control pills, in the  field or on ships. Due to limited storage space, women may not be able to  obtain their preferred brand, but most women were able to obtain adequate  supplies. At the end of 2001, DOD officials and representatives from  beneficiary groups told us that these concerns remain among deployed  women."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Concerns About Care Stem From Beneficiary Preferences", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD officials, some women beneficiaries were dissatisfied  with the care they received or were reluctant to seek available care  because of certain expectations about the type of provider they should see  and the setting in which they should receive their care. Several DOD  officials told us that some women expressed dissatisfaction or reluctance  to seek care from a provider who they perceive to be inexperienced or  insensitive to women\u2019s issues or who is male. These officials also told us  that some women prefer or expect to see a doctor who specializes in  obstetrical and gynecological care for their gynecological examinations.  This preference or expectation is generally the result of their believing that  specialists are better qualified than generalists, such as internists or family  practice doctors. According to DOD officials, while obstetrical and  gynecological specialists are needed for some procedures, generalists,  physician assistants, or nurse practitioners can provide routine care and  perform preventive tests. According to beneficiary representatives from  DACOWITS and NMFA, women also expressed dissatisfaction with the  lack of continuity of care because they did not see the same provider from  visit to visit. Finally, DOD officials also said that active duty women noted  that they were reluctant to seek care from a provider who is a peer or  junior in rank, or is someone with whom they socialize. This can be a  particular problem in some deployed settings where the number of medical  staff is limited.", "DOD officials also reported that women have preferences for where they  receive their maternity care. According to DOD officials, some women  prefer to have their babies delivered in civilian hospitals instead of MTFs.  Additionally, results from a DOD survey on inpatient care during childbirth  at selected MTFs show that some women reported problems with  obstetrical care received at MTFs. According to survey results from 2000,  26 percent of women beneficiaries reported dissatisfaction with obstetrical  care at the MTF, compared to the civilian hospital average of 22 percent.

In addition to providing patients access to specialized care, these  rotations have given specialists enough work to keep their skills current.  The Air Force has expanded this initiative of rotating obstetrical and  gynecological doctors to another location\u2014Misawa Air Force Base in  Japan.", "Some of the military branches\u2019 health care initiatives for women were  developed by one branch and then adopted by the others. For example, the  Army and the Air Force have developed deployment readiness guides for  active duty women and their leaders. The need for such guides was  demonstrated in 1999, when we reported that 51 percent of women  deployed to Bosnia stated that they had not received any information on  women-specific health care and hygiene practices in the field prior to  deployment. The Army\u2019s Female Soldier Readiness Guide\u2014which covers  areas such as field needs, health care preventive measures in the barracks,  and pregnancy\u2014suggests strategies for leaders and soldiers to ensure  female readiness. The Air Force\u2019s Female Airman Readiness Guide is  based on the Army\u2019s readiness guide and, like the Army guide, aims to  enable military leaders to effectively manage women in the Air Force by  addressing topics such as hygiene in the field and pregnancy counseling.", "Each military branch is also developing systems for tracking women\u2019s  routine gynecological exams, including Pap smears. Currently, the Air  Force reviews the health needs of active duty women and men annually  during a preventive health appointment and makes recommendations for  further care based on their medical history. For example, during this annual  visit, active duty women are told when they are due for their next  gynecological exam. In addition, the Army is working on an Army-wide  initiative to track active duty women\u2019s Pap smears so they can notify them  of their annual exams, thereby helping to ensure they receive needed care.  This initiative is in the planning stages and has not been implemented,  although in the meantime some individual installations have tracking  processes in place. Similarly, the Navy has no Navy-wide mechanism for  tracking annual exams for women, although there is some tracking of Pap  smears at the MTF level.", "Many of the Army\u2019s, Navy\u2019s, and Air Force\u2019s education initiatives aim to  educate leaders and beneficiaries about health care services for women,  including family planning and pregnancy wellness. According to Army  officials, unplanned pregnancies can disrupt work and training situations.  Army officials told us various studies show that more than half of births to  active duty women in the Army are from unplanned pregnancies. In  response, the Army has developed several initiatives to provide  beneficiaries with the knowledge to make informed decisions about having  children and taking appropriate care measures while pregnant.", "The Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) is  developing a Personal Responsibility Program, including an Army- specific curriculum for soldiers. Its purpose is to provide soldiers with  better skills for reducing unplanned pregnancies, including education on  reproduction and contraception as well as meshing family planning with  career and financial planning. Following pilot testing, this program may  be implemented Army-wide.", "The Army\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel convened a  multidisciplinary work group that is looking at many aspects of  parenthood and its effects on readiness, including unplanned pregnancy  and physical training for women after birth. Its intent is to develop a  comprehensive reference manual for military leaders to use in managing  the myriad issues connected to parenthood.", "CHPPM, with the assistance of a contractor, is developing a certification  program for physical training during pregnancy and postpartum. The  intent of this program is twofold:  to provide Army certification in  pregnancy fitness and to provide a safe, standardized program for  pregnant and postpartum soldiers. Most women may exercise safely  throughout pregnancy within ACOG guidelines and under the advice of  their health care provider. Exercise during pregnancy helps prevent  unwanted body fat gain and promotes a faster return to physical  readiness levels. According to Army officials, one Army study suggested  that active duty women who participated in a pregnancy wellness  program were more likely to pass the postpartum height/weight  requirements than those who did not participate in a structured physical  fitness program. In addition, they told us that other studies showed that  the caesarian section rate was lower among fitness program  participants than the national average, and there were no increases in  adverse outcomes to either the pregnant soldiers or their fetuses or  infants. They also said that preliminary Army data from the initial pilot  program indicate that there is a beneficial effect on labor and that  military readiness is promoted following a regular special exercise  program.", "The Navy and Air Force have also developed initiatives on family planning  and pregnancy wellness. For example, the Navy\u2019s Environmental Health  Center developed a program called the Sexual Health and Responsibility  Program (SHARP) to provide sexual health and responsibility training  Navy-wide to both leaders and active duty members through the Internet  and CD-ROMs. In addition, the Navy\u2019s CHOICES program provides sailors  with education on sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, relationship  building, and sexual responsibility. The goal of the program is to assist  sailors in making better choices, which will reduce the number of  unplanned pregnancies. CHOICES is available at selected commands,  including in San Diego where the Deployment Program Manager of the  Fleet Family Services Center has indicated that male and female sailors at  Naval Station San Diego, including all shipboard personnel, are required to  attend this program. The Navy\u2019s recruit training also includes a component  on conception and contraception. Specifically, in the seventh week of basic  training both females and males attend a program called Recruit Education  to Achieve Health (REACH) that includes training on sexual responsibility,  family planning, and emergency contraception. The Air Force supports the  use of doulas\u2014specially trained women to help other women, particularly  first-time mothers, during pregnancy and childbirth\u2014as long as this does  not interfere with providing care. A national society of doulas has offered  their services free of charge to women beneficiaries. According to Air  Force officials, this service could be particularly beneficial to women  whose husbands have been deployed.", "The branches of the military have provided education on women\u2019s health  through targeted web sites or a CD-ROM. For example, a Navy website  provides information about dysuria, family planning, and emergency  contraception. It also provides information on the breast care centers at  the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda and the Naval Medical  Centers at San Diego and Portsmouth. The Navy also developed the  Operational Obstetrics and Gynecology CD-ROM to serve as a self- contained resource on obstetrical and gynecological care for health care  providers of all levels from corpsman through physician providers who are  deployed and ashore, stationed away from an MTF or other hospital.  According to Navy officials, the fact that it does not require Internet access  is crucial during deployment. The CD-ROM is a refresher on the full range  of women\u2019s health care from Pap smears, family planning, gynecological  emergencies, and obstetrical care through menopause. It also includes  DOD-wide medical instructions pertinent to all three military branches and  copies of the female readiness guides for the Army and Air Force. The CD- ROM has been distributed to the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and various  international military medical forces."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Contributors to this report were Ann Calvaresi-Barr, Cynthia D.
