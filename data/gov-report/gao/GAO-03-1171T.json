GAO recommended in 1993 that USAID develop a comprehensive workforce plan; however, human capital management continues to be a high-risk area for the agency. GAO was asked to testify on how changes in USAID's workforce over the past 10 years have affected its ability to deliver foreign aid, the agency's progress in implementing a strategic workforce planning system, and whether its reported operating expenses reflect the full costs of delivering foreign aid."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USAID has evolved from an agency in which U.S. direct-hire staff directly implemented development projects to one in which U.S. direct-hire staff oversee the activities of contractors and grantees. Since 1992, the number of USAID U.S. direct-hire staff declined by 37 percent, but the number of countries with USAID programs doubled and, over the last 2 years, program funding increased more than 78 percent. As a result of these and other changes in its workforce and its mostly ad-hoc approach to workforce planning, USAID faces several human capital vulnerabilities. For example, attrition of experienced foreign service officers and inadequate training and mentoring have sometimes led to the deployment of staff who lack essential skills and experience. The agency also lacks a \"surge capacity\" to respond to evolving foreign policy priorities and emerging crises. With fewer and less experienced staff managing more programs in more countries, USAID's ability to oversee the delivery of foreign assistance is becoming increasingly difficult. USAID has taken steps toward developing a workforce planning and human capital management system that should enable the agency to meet its challenges and achieve its mission, but it needs to do more, such as conducting a comprehensive skills assessment and including its civil service and contracted employees in its workforce planning efforts. USAID's reported that operating expenses do not always reflect the full costs of administering foreign assistance because the agency pays for some support and oversight activities done by contractors with program funds. As a result, the amount of program funds directly benefiting foreign recipients is likely overstated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report on USAID\u2019s workforce  planning and highlight the preliminary findings from our ongoing review  of USAID\u2019s operating expense account. The workforce report is being  released today. Humanitarian and economic development assistance is an  integral part of U.S. global security strategy, particularly as the United  States seeks to diminish the underlying conditions of poverty and  corruption that may be linked to instability and terrorism. In fiscal year  2003, USAID expects to obligate about $13 billion and manage programs in  about 160 countries. Agency staff often work in difficult environments and  under evolving program demands. More will be demanded of USAID\u2019s staff  as they implement large-scale relief and reconstruction programs in  Afghanistan and Iraq while continuing traditional long-term development  assistance programs.", "As a result, it is essential that USAID develop a strategic approach to its  workforce planning so that it can identify and attain the essentials skills it  needs to accomplish its goals. It is also important that USAID identify and  report accurate costs on administering its foreign aid programs. My  statement today will cover these two broad areas.", "I will focus most of my statement on our review of USAID\u2019s workforce  planning. I will discuss some of USAID\u2019s human capital challenges,  including its recent efforts to staff missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and  the status of its efforts to develop a strategic workforce planning system.  Regarding USAID\u2019s operating expense account, I will focus on how the  agency\u2019s reporting of operating expenses does not always capture the full  cost of administering foreign assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, we reported that USAID had not adequately managed changes in  its overseas workforce and recommended that USAID develop a  comprehensive workforce planning system to better identify staffing needs  and requirements. In the mid-1990s, USAID reorganized its activities  around strategic objectives and began reporting in a results-oriented  format but had made little progress in personnel reforms. In July 2002, we  reported that USAID could not quickly relocate or hire the staff needed to  implement a large-scale reconstruction and recovery program in Latin  America, and we recommended actions to help improve USAID\u2019s staffing  flexibility for future disaster recovery requirements.", "Studies by several organizations, including GAO, have shown that highly  successful service organizations use strategic management approaches to  prepare their workforces to meet present and future mission requirements.  We define strategic workforce planning as focusing on long-term strategies  for acquiring, developing, and retaining an organization\u2019s workforce and  aligning human capital approaches that are clearly linked to achieving  programmatic goals. Based on work with the Office of Personnel  Management and other entities, we identified strategic workforce planning  principles used by leading organizations. According to these principles, a  strategic workforce planning and management system should (1) involve  senior management, employees, and stakeholders in developing,  communicating, and implementing the workforce plan; (2) determine the  agency\u2019s current critical skills and competencies and those needed to  achieve program results; (3) develop strategies to address gaps in critical  skills and competencies; and (4) monitor and evaluate progress and the  contribution of strategic workforce planning efforts in achieving program  goals.", "Until the mid-1970s, about two thirds of USAID\u2019s operating expenses were  funded from appropriations to program accounts, and the rest were  funded from a separate administrative expenses account. In 1976,  Congress began providing a line-item appropriation for operating expenses  separate from USAID\u2019s humanitarian and economic development  assistance programs. The accompanying Senate report noted that USAID\u2019s  \u201ccost of doing business\u201d would be better managed if these funds were  separately appropriated. Congress authorized USAID\u2019s separate operating  expense account the following year. USAID\u2019s criteria for determining the  expenses to be paid from operating expense funds are based on guidance  it has received from Congress as well as its assessment of who benefits  from a particular activity\u2014the agency or the intended program recipient.  For example, congressional reports in the late 1970s directed USAID to  fund the costs of all full-time staff in permanent positions from the  operating expense account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Workforce Planning Can Help USAID Address Current and Future Challenges", "paragraphs": ["USAID faces a number of challenges in developing and implementing a  strategic workforce plan. Its overseas missions operate in a changing  foreign policy environment often under very difficult conditions. USAID\u2019s  workforce, particularly its U.S. direct-hire foreign service officers, has  decreased over the years; but in recent years program dollars and the  number of countries with USAID activities have increased. These factors  have combined to produce certain human capital vulnerabilities that have  implications for the agency\u2019s ability to effectively carry out and oversee  foreign assistance. A strategic approach to workforce planning and  management can help USAID identify the workforce it needs and develop  strategies for attaining this workforce that will last throughout successive  administrations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USAID Faces Challenges in Workforce Planning", "paragraphs": ["Since 1990, USAID has continued to evolve from an agency in which U.S.  direct-hire foreign service employees directly implemented development  projects to one with a declining number of direct-hire staff who oversee  the contractors and grantees carrying out most of its day-to-day activities.  As numbers of U.S. direct-hire staff declined, mission directors began  relying on other types of employees, primarily foreign national personal  services contractors, to manage mission operations and oversee  development activities implemented by third parties. In December 2002,  according to USAID\u2019s staffing report, the agency\u2019s workforce totaled 7,741,  including 1,985 U.S. direct-hires. Personal services contractors made up  more than two-thirds of USAID\u2019s total workforce, including 4,653 foreign  national contractors. Of the 1,985 U.S. direct-hires, 974 were foreign  service officers, about 65 percent of whom were posted overseas. Other  individuals not directly employed by USAID also perform a wide range of  services in support of the agency\u2019s programs. These individuals include  employees of institutional or services contractors, private voluntary  organizations, and grantees.", "In addition to having reduced the number of U.S. direct hires, USAID now  manages programs in more countries with no USAID direct-hire presence,  and its overseas structure has become more regional. Table 1 illustrates  the changes in USAID\u2019s U.S. direct-hire overseas presence between fiscal  years 1992 and 2002. In fiscal year 2002, USAID managed activities in 88  countries with no U.S. direct-hire presence. According to USAID, in some  cases, activities in these countries are very small and require little  management by USAID staff. However, in 45 of these countries USAID  manages programs of $1 million or more, representing a more significant  burden on the agency. USAID also increasingly provides administrative  and program support to countries from regional service platforms, which  have increased from 2 to 26 between fiscal years 1992 and 2002. Program  funding also recently increased about 78 percent\u2014from $7.3 billion in  fiscal year 2001 to about $13 billion in fiscal year 2003.", "As a result of the decreases in U.S. direct-hire foreign service staff levels,  increasing program demands, and a mostly ad-hoc approach to workforce  planning, USAID now faces several human capital vulnerabilities. For  example, the attrition of its more experienced foreign service officers, its  difficulties in filling overseas positions, and limited opportunities for  training and mentoring have sometimes led to the deployment of direct- hire staff who do not have essential skills and experience and the reliance  on contractors to perform many functions. In addition, USAID lacks a  \u201csurge capacity\u201d to enable it to respond quickly to emerging crises and  changing strategic priorities. As a result, according to USAID officials and  a recent overseas staffing assessment, the agency is finding it increasingly  difficult to manage the delivery of foreign assistance.", "In addition, USAID works in an overseas environment that presents unique  challenges to workforce planning. Mission officials noted the difficulties in  adhering to a formal workforce plan linked to country strategies in an  uncertain foreign policy environment. For example, following the events  of September 11, 2001, the Middle East and sub-Saharan African missions  we visited\u2014Egypt, Mali, and Senegal\u2014received additional work that was  not anticipated when they developed their country development strategies  and work plans. Also, the mission in Ecuador had been scheduled to close  in fiscal year 2003. However, this decision was reversed due to political  and economic events in Ecuador, including a coup in 2000, the collapse of  the financial system, and rampant inflation. Program funding for Ecuador  tripled from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000, while staffing was reduced  from 110 to 30 personnel; and the budget for the mission\u2019s operating  expenses was reduced from $2.7 million to $1.37 million. During our field  work, we found that other factors unique to USAID\u2019s overseas work  environment can affect its ability to conduct workforce planning and  attract and retain top staff. These factors vary from country to country and  among regions and include difficulties in attracting staff to hardship posts,  inadequate salaries and benefits for attracting the top host country  professionals, and lengthy clearance processes for locally contracted staff.", "USAID\u2019s workforce challenges are illustrated by its difficulties in staffing  hardship posts like Afghanistan and Iraq. As of September 4, 2003,  according to USAID\u2019s new personnel data system, the mission in Kabul  had 42 full-time staff\u20147 foreign service officers and 35 personal service  contractors, mostly local hires. However, the mission had 61 vacancies,  including 5 vacancies for foreign service officers. In Iraq, as of September  15, 2003, the mission had 13 USAID direct-hire staff; 3 additional U.S.  government employees; and about 60 personal services and institutional  contractors. The mission had 13 vacancies that will most likely be filled by  contract staff.", "USAID\u2019s human resource office is in its annual bidding process for foreign  service positions. When that process is complete, the office expects to  have a better picture of replacements for current staff in Afghanistan and  Iraq as well as additional placements. According to USAID staff, the  agency is having trouble attracting foreign service officers to these posts  because in-country conditions are difficult and tours are unaccompanied.  USAID\u2019s average staff age is in the late forties, and this age group is  generally attracted to posts that can accommodate families. Both posts are  responsible for huge amounts of foreign aid\u2014in fiscal year 2003 alone,  USAID\u2019s assistance for Afghanistan and Iraq is expected to  total $817 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. USAID faces serious  accountability and quality of life issues as it attempts to manage and  oversee large-scale, expensive reconstruction programs in countries with  difficult conditions and inadequate numbers of both foreign service and  local hire staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID\u2019s Workforce Planning Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In response to the President\u2019s Management Agenda, USAID has taken  steps toward developing a comprehensive workforce planning and human  capital management system that should enable the agency to meet its  challenges and achieve its mission, but progress so far is limited.

For example:    The involvement of USAID leadership, employees, and stakeholders in  developing and communicating a strategic workforce plan has been  mixed. USAID\u2019s human resource office is drafting a human capital  strategy, but at the time of our review it had not yet been finalized or  approved by such stakeholders as OMB and the Office of Personnel  Management.

However, it has not yet conducted a comprehensive assessment of the  critical skills and competencies of its current workforce. USAID hopes  to have a contractor in place by the end of September, 2003, to assist  the working group in identifying critical competencies and devising  strategies to close skill gaps. USAID is also in the process of  determining the appropriate information technology instrument and  methodology that will permit the assessment of its current workforce  skills and competencies.", "USAID\u2019s strategies to address critical skill gaps are not comprehensive  and have not been based on a critical analysis of current capabilities  matched with future requirements. USAID has begun hiring foreign  service officers and Presidential Management Interns to replace staff  lost through attrition. However, the agency has not completed its civil  service recruitment plan and has not yet included personal services  contractors\u2014the largest segment of its workforce\u2014in its agencywide  workforce analysis and planning efforts.

According to USAID guidance, contractor salaries and related support can  be paid from program funds when the expenses are benefiting a particular  program or project.
