The disability claims process has been the subject of attention by Congress and others, due in part, to long waits for processing claims and a large backlog of claims. To process disability and pension claims more efficiently, VA began implementation of an electronic, paperless system in 2009. GAO was asked to study VBMS. Specifically, GAO (1) assessed VA's progress toward completing the development and implementation of VBMS and (2) determined to what extent users report satisfaction with the system.

While 95 percent of records related to veterans' disability claims are electronic and reside in the system, additional capabilities have not yet been completed, such as automation of the steps associated with a veteran's request for an increase in benefits. Further, VBA has not yet developed and implemented pension processing capabilities in VBMS, nor has it articulated when the system will support appeals processing. The VBMS program reported receiving funding of about $1 billion from fiscal years 2009 to 2015, at which time system completion was originally planned. Although development of the system is expected to continue beyond 2015, the incremental approach VA is using to develop and implement VBMS has not yet produced a plan that identifies when the system will be completed and can be expected to fully support disability and pension claims processing and appeals. Thus, it will be difficult for VA to hold its managers accountable for meeting its time frame and for demonstrating progress.", "As VA continues its efforts to complete development and implementation of the system, three areas could benefit from increased management attention.", "Cost estimating: The program office does not have a reliable estimate of the cost for completing the system. Without such an estimate, VA management and the department's stakeholders have a limited view of the system's future resource needs, and the program risks not having sufficient funding to complete development and implementation of the system.", "System availability: Although VBA has improved its performance for ensuring the system is available to users, it has not established system response time goals. Without such goals, users do not have an expectation of the system response times they can anticipate and management does not have an indication of how well the system is performing relative to performance goals.", "System defects: While the program has actively managed system defects, a recent system release included unresolved defects that impacted system performance and users' experiences. Continuing to deploy releases with large numbers of defects that reduce system functionality could adversely affect users' ability to process disability claims in an efficient manner.", "While VBA has employed various methods to obtain VBMS users' feedback, it has neither established goals to define user satisfaction, nor conducted a survey of claims processing employees to obtain a more comprehensive picture of overall customer satisfaction. GAO's survey of VBMS users estimated that a majority report satisfaction with the system, but that one group of users who are responsible for examining claims decisions was considerably less satisfied. Although the results of GAO's survey provide VBA with useful data about users' satisfaction with the system, the absence of user satisfaction goals limits the utility of survey results.

The PMO Director stated that VBA is currently  analyzing commercial IT solutions that can meet the business  requirements for appeals, such as providing document navigation  capabilities. Nevertheless, the Director added that VBMS is expected to  be part of the appeals modernization solution because components of the  system, such as the VBMS eFolder and certain workload management  functionality, are planned to continue supporting appeals management.", "According to the PMO Director, the fact that VBMS requires additional  development beyond 2015 does not reflect a delay in completing the  system\u2019s development. Instead, the additional time is a consequence of  decisions to enlarge the VBMS program\u2019s scope over time. This official  added that VBMS\u2019s original purpose was to serve primarily as an  electronic document repository, and they have met this goal.", "The PMO Director further stated that, as the program\u2019s mission has  expanded to support the department\u2019s efforts to eliminate the disability  claims backlog, the PMO has had to re-prioritize, add, and defer system  requirements to accommodate broader departmental decisions and, in  some cases, regulatory changes. For example, the PMO was tasked with  developing functionality in VBMS to meet regulatory requirements for  processing disability claims using mandatory forms. Officials from the  VBMS PMO explained that they were made aware of this requirement  well after system planning for the March 2015 release had been  completed, and it introduced significant complexity to their development  work.", "Finally, VBA included in its strategic road map the strategic objectives  that are to be addressed in generation 5 of the system, which is planned  for fiscal year 2016. Further, officials from the VBMS PMO stated that  they intend to develop tactical plans that identify the expected capabilities  to be provided in the generation 5 releases. Nevertheless, due to the  department\u2019s incremental approach to developing and implementing  VBMS, VBA has not yet produced a plan that identifies when the system  will be completed and can be expected to fully support disability and  pension claims processing and appeals. Thus, it will be difficult for VA to  hold its managers accountable for meeting its time frame and for  demonstrating progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ongoing Progress of VBMS Development and Implementation May Be Hindered by Lack of a Reliable Cost Estimate", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with our guidance on estimating program costs, an important  aspect of planning for IT projects such as VBMS involves developing a  reliable cost estimate to help managers evaluate a program\u2019s affordability  and performance against its plans, and provide estimates of the funding  required to efficiently execute a program. Without this information,  programs are at risk of experiencing cost overruns, missed deadlines,  and performance shortfalls. Additionally, federal guidance and IT project  management principles stress the importance of continuous planning  throughout the life of a program to serve as a basis for managing trade- offs between cost, schedule, and scope.", "In July 2012, we identified several weaknesses in VA\u2019s policies related to  cost estimating and also found that the department\u2019s 2011 cost estimate  for VBMS did not reflect key practices for developing an accurate and  credible estimate. At that time, we recommended that VA modify its  policies governing cost estimating to establish, among other things, a  requirement to prepare a full life-cycle cost estimate for a program (as  opposed to preparing an estimate for each program increment) and a  requirement for programs to prepare cost estimates using best practices.  In February 2013, VA\u2019s Office of Corporate Analysis and Evaluation  released a cost estimating process guide, which states that VA program  offices are required to develop a life-cycle cost estimate to support senior  leaders\u2019 decision making and the department\u2019s planning and budgeting  processes. Further, this guide states that, at the request of VA leadership  or a program office, VA\u2019s Office of Corporate Analysis and Evaluation is  to be available to develop independent cost estimates and review existing  program cost estimates to ensure they have been developed in  accordance with our cost-estimating guidance.", "In 2011, VBA submitted a life-cycle cost estimate for VBMS of $934.8  million to the Office of Management and Budget. This estimate was  intended to capture costs for the system\u2019s development, deployment,  sustainment, and general operating expenses through the end of fiscal  year 2018. However, as of July 2015, the program\u2019s actual costs  exceeded the 2011 life-cycle cost estimate. Specifically, VBMS has  received approximately $1 billion in funding through the end of fiscal year  2015 and the department has requested an additional $290 million for the  program in fiscal year 2016.", "The PMO has not reliably updated VBMS\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate to  reflect the program\u2019s expanded scope and timelines for completing the  system. This is largely attributable to the fact that the PMO has developed  cost estimates for 2-year project cycles that are used for VBMS milestone  reviews under OI&T\u2019s Project Management Accountability System.", "When asked how the PMO arrived at the cost estimates reported in the  milestone reviews, officials stated that they develop rough order of  magnitude estimates for each business need based on expert knowledge  of the system, past development and engineering experience, and  lessons learned. However, while this approach may have provided  adequate information for VBA to prioritize VBMS system requirements to  address in the next release, it has not produced estimates that could  serve as a basis for identifying VBMS\u2019s funding needs. Because it is  typically derived from limited data and in a short time, a rough order of  magnitude analysis is not equivalent to a budget-quality cost estimate and  may limit an agency\u2019s ability to identify the funding necessary to efficiently  execute a program.", "In addition, the PMO\u2019s annual operating plan, which is generally limited to  high-level information about the program\u2019s organization, priorities,  staffing, milestones, and performance measures for fiscal year 2015, also  shows estimated costs totaling $512 million for VBMS development from  fiscal years 2017 through 2020. However, according to the PMO Director,  this estimate was also developed using rough order of magnitude  analysis. Further, the estimate does not provide reliable information on  life-cycle costs because it does not include estimated IT sustainment and  general operating expenses.", "Even though the PMO has developed rough order of magnitude cost  estimates for VBMS, these estimates have not been sufficiently reliable to  effectively identify the program\u2019s funding needs. Instead, during the last 3  fiscal years, the PMO Director has had to request an additional $118  million in IT development funds to meet program demands and to ensure  support for ongoing development contracts. Specifically, in May 2013,  VA requested $13.3 million to support additional work on VBMS. Then,  during fiscal year 2014, VA reprogrammed $73 million of unobligated IT  sustainment funds to develop functionality to transfer service treatment  records from DOD to VA, and to support development of VBMS-Core  functionality. In December 2014, the PMO identified the need for  additional fiscal year 2015 funds for ongoing system development  contracts for VBMS-Core and VBMS-Awards, and, in late April 2015, VA  leadership submitted a letter to Congress requesting permission to  reprogram $31.7 million to support work on these contracts, the National  Work Queue, and other VBMS efforts.", "According to the PMO Director, the need to request additional funding  does not represent additional risk to the program, but is the result of  VBMS\u2019s success. The Director further noted that, as the PMO has  identified opportunities to increase functionality to improve the electronic  claims process, their funding needs have also increased. We recognize  that as new capabilities are deployed, additional requirements may  surface. Nevertheless, evolution of the VBMS program illustrates the  importance of continuous planning, including cost estimating, so that  trade-offs between cost, schedule, and scope can be effectively  managed.

The PMO uses average page response times to  measure VBMS system performance, with lower response times  indicating optimal system performance and higher response times  indicating performance issues.", "From September 2013 through April 2015, VBA reported a decrease in  average response times for VBMS-Core and VBMS-Rating (see table  2).", "VBA attributed the decrease in response times to continuous engineering  improvements to system performance. Program officials also explained  that the difference in response times between modules was due to the  type of information that is being pulled into each module from various  other VBA systems. For example, both VBMS-Core and VBMS-Rating  require information from the VBA corporate database, but VBMS-Core is  populated with data from multiple VBA systems in addition to the  corporate database.", "Program officials told us there are no specific goals for mean transaction  response times because they feel that there are adequate tools in place  to monitor system performance and provide alerts if there are response  time issues.

The  purpose of the daily defect management report is to provide the current  status of all open defects identified in testing of a forthcoming VBMS  release or identified during production of a previous release.", "According to the defect management plan, defects can be resolved in a  number of different ways. Once a defect is fixed, tested, and has passed  testing, it is considered done or resolved. Defects that cannot be  attributed to an existing requirement are reclassified as a system  enhancement and considered resolved, as they do not affect a current  system release requirement.

At that time, we will send copies of this report to appropriate  congressional committees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and other  interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the  GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have questions about this report, please contact me at  (202) 512-6304 or melvinv@gao.gov.

These included the VA Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation  Claims Backlog (2013), VBMS Strategic Roadmap, VBMS Tactical  Roadmap, VBMS Operating Plans, VBA\u2019s 2011 life-cycle cost estimate  for the program, documentation supporting VBMS\u2019s progression through  VA\u2019s milestone review process, VA\u2019s annual budget submissions, and  contracts and related contractor documentation. We compared program  plans and other documentation articulating the system\u2019s goals, expected  benefits, and the system functionality expected to be delivered with  documents showing VBMS\u2019s progress, such as monthly program  management reviews and cost and performance reports. We also  compared program plans to VA\u2019s policies for incremental system  development, as well as federal guidance and IT project management  principles on program planning and cost estimating.", "In addition, we obtained reports documenting the system\u2019s availability and  performance and analyzed information in the reports to determine trends  in system availability and response time. We compared system  performance data with GAO and federal IT guidance for defining program  goals and related performance targets that can be used to assess  progress in achieving the goals. We assessed the reliability of the data  by reviewing it for obvious errors and missing data; corroborating the data  with related documentation; and interviewing responsible officials about  their use of an automated tool that monitors system performance. We  determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "We reviewed the VBMS Defect Management Plan and compared the plan  with key principles of sound defect management. We also compared the  processes described in the plan with actions taken to manage defects  identified for VBMS. We conducted analysis of critical defects identified  for VBMS releases 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, and 8.1 to determine whether they  remained open at the time of system release.", "Further, we reviewed the department\u2019s methods for soliciting end user  feedback on the performance of the system (e.g., VBMS training strategy,  operational management reviews, cost and performance reports, and end  of month reports). We compared these methods to leading practices for  obtaining customer feedback and collecting customer service data to  improve performance and demonstrate customer satisfaction of IT  projects.", "To determine the extent that users report satisfaction with the system, we  conducted a Web-based survey of a nationally representative stratified  random sample of disability compensation claims processors. The survey  was administered during the time frame of September through November  2014. We developed survey questions with input from officials in the  VBMS PMO and VA\u2019s Office of Information and Technology.", "We pretested versions of the draft survey and observed claims  processors to gain initial insight regarding their use of the system in  VBA\u2019s Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, regional  offices. We selected these offices based on their large size and location.  We revised the draft survey based on comments received during the  pretests. Once finalized, the claims processors included in the sample  were sent an e-mail that asked them to complete the survey, which was  available to them over the Web from September 30, 2014, to November  19, 2014. Following the initial request, we e-mailed weekly follow-up  requests to any nonrespondents.", "Our eligible population for this survey consisted of all 10,622 disability  compensation claims processors employed by the agency as of July 31,  2014. To determine whether VBMS experiences differed based on  position and office workload, we designed a stratified random sample of  claims processors, with strata defined by position and office workload.  VBA provided us lists of these claims processors with information that  indicated their position and office. We determined average office  workload based on information published in VBA\u2019s public weekly  workload reports. We divided the list of claims processors into 10 strata  based on their position at both smaller and larger workload regional  offices. Table 4 shows the size of each eligible population, the size of the  sample drawn from each eligible population, and the number of claims  processors in each stratum that responded to the survey.", "We drew an independent random sample from each of these strata to  enable us to project survey results to all VBA claims processors, in  general, and to claims processors in each of the positions listed above,  within small and large workload offices. Of our total sample of 3,475  claims processors, 2,098 responded to the survey for an overall response  rate of 60 percent.", "To produce estimates regarding the experiences and views of claims  processors from the survey responses of those included in our sample,  we analyzed the data with methods that are appropriate for a stratified  random sample using analysis weights. We weighted each response from  claims processors in each stratum to statistically account for all members  of that stratum. Because estimates are based on responses from a  sample, each estimate we report has a measurable precision or sampling  error. The sampling error or margin of error surrounding an estimate is  expressed as a number of percentage points higher or lower than that  estimate and the entire range that the sampling error covers is referred to  as a confidence interval. Confidence intervals are calculated based on a  certain confidence level. Confidence intervals for estimates we report  from this survey are based on a confidence level of 95 percent and are  calculated using methods appropriate for a stratified random sample.  Confidence intervals for percentage estimates in this report are never  wider than plus or minus 5 percentage points. At a 95 percent confidence  level, this means that in about 95 out of 100 instances, the sampling  procedures we used would be expected to produce a confidence interval  (in this case, a 10 percentage point range) containing the true population  value we estimate.", "In addition to sampling error, estimates based on survey results are  subject to what is referred to as nonsampling error that can result from,  among other things, poorly designed survey questions and mistakes in  data entry or analysis or nonresponse. We took a number of steps in  developing the survey and in entering and analyzing the data to minimize  nonsampling error. For example, a social science survey specialist  collaborated with our subject matter experts in designing the survey. In  addition, it was reviewed by VBA officials and, as previously noted, was  pretested with a number of different types of claims processors in two  locations. Also, when we analyzed the data, an independent analyst  verified all computer programs. Because this was a Web-based survey,  respondents\u2019 answers to survey questions were automatically entered  into an electronic file, eliminating the need to separately key responses  into a data file, further minimizing the potential for nonsampling error.", "We also took steps to mitigate potential nonresponse error. For example,  we used follow-up e-mails to remind users to complete the survey in order  to reduce nonresponse. Further, we adjusted for characteristics that were  associated with survey response propensity using standard weighting  class adjustments defined by sampling strata. We assumed that  nonresponse adjusted data were missing at random, and therefore  concluded the respondent analyses using the nonresponse adjusted  weights were unbiased for the population of VBMS users sampled in the  survey.", "We supplemented our analyses with interviews of VA officials that had  knowledge of the VBMS program, including officials in VA\u2019s Office of  Information and Technology and the Veterans Benefits Administration\u2019s  VBMS PMO and Office of Field Operations.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2014 through August  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
