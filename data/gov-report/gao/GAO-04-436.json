Our analysis found that most delegates generally hold highly favorable views of their experience in the program. Many found ways to adapt what they learned to the Russian environment. Also, embassy officials said Open World complemented U.S. mission activities. However, because the program does not have formalized strategic and performance plans with measurable indicators, it is difficult to determine the extent to which it is targeting and reaching the right people and giving them experiences that result in improved mutual understanding. While Open World does survey delegates about their experiences, it has not yet conducted a full program evaluation to determine progress toward its long-term goals. Open World officials agree that such an evaluation is necessary and hope to conduct one in the near future. Open World does not have the formalized financial management and accountability mechanisms that would provide Congress and other decision makers with timely and reliable information about its cost and performance. Now that Open World has permanent status and is expanding its scope, it is appropriate for the program to turn its attention to enhancing these mechanisms. Its procedures for reviewing program transactions and analyzing financial reports have neither been evaluated for their adequacy nor formalized in writing; and it does not prepare financial statements that can be subject to an independent audit. In addition, Open World does not have an audit or financial management advisory committee to advise the Board of Trustees on financial management, accountability, and internal control issues.

The program aimed to  expose emerging political leaders at all levels of government to the  American economic system and democratic institutions through visits to  communities across the United States, allowing participants to see how  Americans from all walks of life conduct their business and professions  and their private, social, and cultural lives.  The idea was to develop a cadre  of people committed to democratic and free market principles by reaching  out to emerging leaders, similar to the way that young German leaders  were targeted by the Marshall Plan after World War II.  In 2003, Congress  changed the program\u2019s name to the Open World Leadership Center,  expanded its scope to a cultural leaders program for Russia, and extended  eligibility to the remaining 11 countries of the Newly Independent States  and 3 in the Baltic states.

The Chairman of the Judicial Council in Moscow and  several judges at the Supreme Court in Petrozavodsk told us that they  established court management structures modeled after U.S. courts and  developed a judicial code of ethics in consultation with American judges.  Librarians in Petrozavodsk told us that, after returning from the United  States, they helped to establish a library association in the Republic of  Karelia that is similar to the Russian Library Association, a counterpart to  the American Library Association. Another alumnus joined the Rotary Club  in Moscow after his Open World experience and was recently elected the  president of his chapter.

(See app. III for a list of selected State  exchange programs.)  According to U.S. mission officials in Russia,  including those at the consulate in St. Petersburg, it is at locations outside  of the major cities that Open World has an advantage and can best target  potential delegates for the program who have not yet traveled to the United  States on other U.S. exchange programs.  In fact, when visiting various  regions within the country, embassy officials find it especially useful to  meet with Open World alumni, many of whom are in leadership positions.   For example, while visiting Volgograd, the U.S. ambassador met with Open  World alumni who shared some examples of direct results of their  exchange experiences.  One alumnus started several youth programs in his  district, while another started public information programs on healthy  lifestyles directed at Volgograd youth.", "In addition to enhancing outreach efforts, State officials in Washington,  D.C., and U.S. embassy officials with whom we spoke in Russia said Open  World complements other U.S. mission activities.  Similarly, Open World is  able to build on relationships fostered by other U.S.-Russia assistance  activities to further its own program.  For example, the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) worked through Open World to send  more Russian judges to the United States than it could have funded on its  own, as part of the Vermont-Karelia Project. This project was initially  established to bring representatives of the judiciary of Karelia, with which  the judiciary of Vermont has a long-standing working relationship, to meet  their counterparts and learn about the U.S. judicial system.  The program  has since grown to include an additional six Russian regions and six U.S.  states and is now called the Russian-American Rule of Law Consortium, of  which the Vermont-Karelia Project is a part.  Also, the State Department  targets Open World alumni for follow-up technical assistance and training  upon their return to Russia.   Thus, although Open World does not bring  Americans to Russia, under State or USAID sponsorship, some American  judges who had hosted Open World delegates later visited Russia to  provide technical assistance and training.", "Embassy officials and State officials in Washington, D.C., noted that,  although there are other independent entities within the executive branch  that carry out international activities such as exchange programs, Open  World is the only exchange program within the legislative branch.  (For  illustrative purposes, app. IV provides information on some independent  entities funded through the executive branch.)  The officials told us that the  program\u2019s independent status and current placement within the legislative  branch offered some advantages, noting that congressional sponsorship of  Open World lends a certain cachet to the program and allows it to attract  emerging leaders who otherwise might not participate.

Without a framework that identifies long-term goals, explicitly links them  to U.S. mission priorities and plans overseas, and systematically identifies  the incremental outcomes expected at each step, along with measurable  indicators of such progress, it is difficult to gauge whether Open World is  targeting and reaching the right people, whether it is providing delegates  with the right types of experiences, and whether these experiences are  resulting in improved mutual understanding.  This also makes it more  difficult for Open World to adjust its course of action, when necessary, and  to determine whether it is using its resources in the most efficient and  effective manner.  Also, although Open World surveys all delegates on their  experiences in and immediate reactions to the exchange program, it does  not systematically compare delegate attitudes and knowledge both before  and after their participation in the program.  Open World has also  administered several different alumni surveys; however, these surveys are  of limited value in gauging improvements in mutual understanding.", "Open World does provide nominating organizations with general criteria  for determining a person\u2019s eligibility for the program.  To further screen  nominees, the vetting committee considers such factors as a person\u2019s  active involvement in politics, the community, or teaching; the number of  publications issued; the number of people the person supervises; whether  the person is from outside the capital; and any prior visits to the United  States to make subjective judgments about the applicant\u2019s potential to  influence change and apply the experience gained from participating in the  program.

We found varied responses among the past alumni we  interviewed regarding what would constitute an optimal mix of  experiences.  Some favored a more focused approach involving training  that is narrowly targeted toward specific professional needs.  Others said  that a broad exposure to the United States and its institutions is all that can  be expected during a 10-day visit.  One program nominator said that the  program should consist of two separate trips:  On the first, delegates would  simply gain an insight into the American political and economic systems,  while the second trip would be more focused on specific professional  experiences.

However,  the surveys miss the opportunity to measure whether a delegate\u2019s attitude  toward the United States and its institutions changed as a direct result of  participation in the program by not measuring pre- and postparticipation  attitudes using parallel questions.  The postprogram survey asks  retrospective questions about whether delegates\u2019 attitudes changed and  whether their expectations were met.  From a methodological standpoint,  this approach is useful but not as rigorous as measuring attitudes and  expectations before and after the program because it relies on the  delegates\u2019 accurately recalling how they felt before the exchange program.

For example, Open World has procedures for reviewing  budget submissions that accompany grant applications, for awarding  grants, and for reviewing grantee expenditures.  It also has procedures for  analyzing reports on program payroll and outstanding obligations.

Documentation of policies and  procedures covering an entity\u2019s internal control structure and all significant  transactions and events is fundamental to ensuring that all staff understand  and consistently apply procedures, while management assessment of these  procedures is an essential component of internal control.  Management  evaluation of controls, along with approval and documentation of  procedures, is particularly important when financial management services  are being performed by a contractor.

For example, as long as the total grant amount is not exceeded,  Open World allows up to a 10 percent variance between the actual and  budgeted amounts by budget category on an approved grant, but it does not  require grantees to report such variances as part of their reporting of grant  expenses; it also does not have follow-up procedures to deal with variances  of more than 10 percent.  Also, according to Open World officials, grantees  are required to submit receipts or other evidence for all grant expenses  unless Open World agrees, as part of the grant agreement, to permit a  grantee to submit the results of its \u201csingle audit\u201d conducted pursuant to  OMB Circular A-133.  However, the officials acknowledged that Open  World does not have a formal policy that clearly defines the conditions  under which it will accept the results of a single audit in lieu of a grantee\u2019s  submission of receipts or other evidence for all grant expenses.

However, Open  World has neither defined what audit coverage represents a \u201csignificant  sample\u201d nor implemented procedures to ensure that the requirement has  been followed.  According to program officials, Open World has permitted  only a few grantees to submit single audit results in lieu of submitting  receipts and other evidence of grant expenses.

This foundation is built and maintained largely through the discipline of  routinely preparing periodic financial statements and subjecting them  annually to an independent audit.  In fact, the April 2003 bylaws of the  Open World Board of Trustees require an annual audited financial  statement for the Open World Leadership Center Fund.  This requirement  further underscores the importance of Open World developing formal  financial management policies.  The auditor would use the financial  management policies and any related operating procedures to gain an  understanding of and evaluate Open World\u2019s internal control environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governance Structure Does Not Include an Audit Committee", "paragraphs": ["Open World\u2019s governance structure does not include either an audit  committee or financial management advisory committee to provide the  Board of Trustees and management with independent advice on financial  management, accountability, and internal control issues.  Such a committee  is a required element of the governance structure of publicly owned  companies and a best practice for other types of organizations.  The audit  committee of a publicly owned company plays a particularly important role  in assuring fair presentation and appropriate accountability in connection  with financial reporting and related external audits and general oversight of  an organization\u2019s internal control.   In the federal government, audit  committees and advisory committees are intended to protect the public  interest by promoting and facilitating effective accountability and financial  management.  This is accomplished by providing management with  independent, objective, and experienced advice and counsel, including  oversight of audit and internal control issues.   In the case of Open World,  use of an audit or financial management advisory committee could  facilitate the process of formalizing financial management policies and  procedures, including related internal controls, and preparing for the  program\u2019s first financial statement audit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Value of Contributed Services Is Not Disclosed", "paragraphs": ["Open World is not collecting data on the significant volume and value of  contributed services from U.S. volunteers.

As a  result, the amount expended by Open World does not reflect the full scope  and cost of operating the program.  The usefulness of information on the  nature and extent of similar contributed services is recognized under  generally accepted accounting principles, which encourage entities to  disclose, if practicable, the fair value of contributed services received.   Open World could obtain data, by geographic area, on the number of  program participants that stay in the homes of American host volunteers  and then apply standard per diem rates to estimate the value of meals and  lodging provided by host volunteers.

Most delegates viewed their program experiences very  favorably, and many say they have taken concrete actions to adapt what  they learned from their U.S. visits to the Russian environment.  Also, U.S.  ambassadors and embassy officials consider Open World a valuable tool to  complement U.S. mission activities and outreach efforts and noted that  congressional sponsorship of Open World lends a certain cachet to the  program, allowing it to attract emerging leaders who otherwise might not  participate.  However, because the program does not have formalized  strategic and performance plans with systematic performance  measurement indicators, it is difficult to determine the extent to which  Open World is targeting and reaching the right people and providing  delegates with the right types of experiences, including those that result in  improved mutual understanding. Also, Open World lacks the formalized  financial management and accountability mechanisms that would help  provide decision makers with useful, relevant, timely, and reliable  information.  Open World began as a pilot project and was not established  as an independent entity until 2001.  Now that Open World has permanent  status and is expanding its scope, it is appropriate for the program to turn  its attention to enhancing its strategic and performance planning and  financial management and accountability mechanisms.  Such mechanisms  are particularly important to ensure that Open World\u2019s efforts and the  related activities of embassies, contractors, grantees, and nominating  organizations are systematically integrated and managed to achieve  measurable progress toward Open World\u2019s fundamental goals.

Open World generally concurred with the report\u2019s observations,  conclusions, and recommendations and acknowledged that the time has  come for strategic planning and for considering options to strengthen the  program\u2019s administrative operations and financial reporting.  Open World  said that it is proceeding with measures to implement some of these  recommendations.  These measures include proceeding with plans to  develop strategic and performance plans, review the program\u2019s data  collection efforts, and prepare financial statements and subject them to an  independent audit.  In response to other recommendations, Open World  said it would ask the Board of Trustees to consider forming an audit  committee for the board, evaluating the in-kind contributions of the  program\u2019s American volunteer hosts, and implementing a system for more  regular summary financial statements for the board.  However, Open World  took issue with the report\u2019s emphasis on measurable goals and indicators  of success, noting that the results of its programs can only be validated in  the medium or long term.  Open World also said that improving mutual  understanding is not a measurable, performance-based goal.", "We recognize the long-term commitment required to measure the ultimate  success of exchange programs.  However, measuring short-term  incremental progress toward a program\u2019s goals is also an important  component of any serious effort to assess progress over the long term.  It is  fundamental to making necessary course corrections along the way\u2014a  capability that will become even more important as Open World further  expands.  While it is sometimes difficult to establish direct causal links  between exchange programs and their ultimate impact, we believe that  establishing convincing correlations is a reasonable expectation.

Because our interviews were limited to a few locations in  Russia (due to travel and time constraints), we did not generalize the  results of our interviews to the universe of delegates.  We recognize that the  opinions and experience of the group of delegates with whom we met may  not be representative of all program alumni; therefore, the results of our  interviews should be used for illustrative purposes only.  We conducted our  interviews as follows:  We developed a structured interview instrument for our meetings with  program alumni with the assistance of GAO social science analysts and  analysts fluent in Russian and in consultation with Open World.
