Unlike many executive branch agencies, which have either recently received or are just requesting new broad-based human capital tools and flexibilities, GAO has had certain human capital tools and flexibilities for over two decades. GAO's latest proposal combines diverse initiatives that, collectively, should further GAO's ability to enhance its performance, assure its accountability, and help ensure that it can attract, retain, motivate, and reward a top-quality and high-performing workforce currently and in future years. Specifically, GAO is requesting that the Congress (1) make permanent GAO's 3-year authority to offer early outs and buyouts, (2) allow GAO to set its own annual pay adjustment system separate from the executive branch, (3) permit GAO to set the pay of an employee demoted as a result of workforce restructuring or reclassification to keep his/her basic pay but to set future increases consistent with the new position's pay parameters, (4) provide authority to reimburse employees for some relocation expenses when that transfer has some benefit to GAO but does not meet the legal requirements for reimbursement, (5) provide authority to place upper-level hires with fewer than 3 years of federal experience in the 6-hour leave category, (6) authorize an executive exchange program with the private sector, and (7) change GAO's legal name from the \"General Accounting Office\" to the \"Government Accountability Office.\" GAO has used the narrowly tailored flexibilities granted by the Congress previously in Public Law 106-303, the GAO Personnel Flexibilities Act, responsibly, prudently, and strategically. GAO believes that it is vitally important to its future to continue modernizing and updating its human capital policies and system in light of the changing environment and anticipated challenges ahead. GAO's proposal represents a logical incremental advancement in modernizing GAO's human capital policies. Based on employee feedback, there is little or no concern relating to most of the proposal's provisions. Although some elements of GAO's initial straw proposal were controversial (e.g., GAO's pay adjustment provision), the Comptroller General has made a number of changes, clarifications, and commitments to address employee concerns. While GAO believes that some employees remain concerned about the pay adjustment provision, GAO also believes that employee concerns have been reduced considerably due to the clarifications, changes, and commitments the Comptroller General has made. Given GAO's human capital infrastructure and unique role in leading by example in major management areas, the rest of the federal government can benefit from GAO's pay system experience."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s latest human capital  proposal.  Chairwoman Davis, we at GAO appreciate your support of our  proposal and your leadership in seeking additional sponsors for the bill you  plan to introduce, the GAO Human Capital Reform Act of 2003.", "As I have testified on many occasions, strategic human capital management  must be the centerpiece of any serious government transformation effort.    A key component of this is modern, effective, and credible human capital  policies, which are critical to the successful functioning of any enterprise,  both public and private.  As the Chief Executive Officer and primary  steward of GAO, I am not just responsible for GAO\u2019s current economy,  efficiency, and effectiveness, I am also responsible for ensuring that we are  well positioned to serve our congressional clients, maximize our  performance, and assure our accountability in the future.", "With this important responsibility in mind, I asked this committee and  others over 3 years ago to grant GAO certain additional narrowly tailored  human capital authorities.  In enacting Public Law 106-303, known as the  GAO Personnel Flexibilities Act, the Congress granted GAO certain  flexibilities, which we have used responsibly to help strategically reshape  the organization in order to better support the Congress and the American  people.   After reviewing the range and limits of our existing administrative  and legal authorities, I have concluded that we now need to seek from the  Congress additional human capital flexibilities in order for GAO to: ensure  quality service to the Congress; continue leading by example in the  government transformation, in general, and human capital reform areas in  particular; and continue to attract, retain, motivate, and reward a quality  and high- performing workforce, both currently and in future years.  We  believe that our proposal is well reasoned and reasonable, especially if  viewed in the light of authorities already granted and requested by other  agencies and the extensive external and internal outreach efforts we have  conducted.  We also respectfully request your support and prompt passage  by the Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO: A Unique Agency with a Hybrid System", "paragraphs": ["As an arm of the legislative branch, GAO exists to support the Congress in  meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the  performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for  the benefit of the American people.  Today, GAO is a multidisciplinary  professional services organization, comprised of about 3,250 employees,  that conducts a wide range of financial and performance audits, program  evaluations, management reviews, investigations, and legal services  spanning a broad range of government programs and functions.  GAO\u2019s  work covers everything from the challenges of securing our homeland, to  the demands of an information age, to emerging national security threats,  and the complexities of globalization.  We are committed to transforming  how the federal government does business and to helping government  agencies become organizations that are more results oriented and  accountable to the public.  We are also committed to leading by example in  all major management areas.", "Given GAO\u2019s role as a key provider of information and analyses to the  Congress, maintaining the right mix of technical knowledge and subject  matter expertise as well as general analytical skills is vital to achieving the  agency\u2019s mission.  Carrying out GAO\u2019s mission today is a multidisciplinary  staff reflecting the diversity of knowledge and competencies needed to  deliver a wide array of products and services to support the Congress.  Our  mission staff\u2014at least 67 percent of whom have graduate degrees\u2014hold  degrees in a variety of academic disciplines, such as accounting, law,  engineering, public administration, economics, and social and physical  sciences.  I am extremely proud of our GAO employees and the difference  that they make for the Congress and the nation.  They make GAO the  world-class organization that it is, and I think it is fair to say that while they  account for about 80 percent of our costs, they constitute 100 percent of  our real assets.", "Because of our unique role as an independent overseer of federal  expenditures, fact finder, and honest broker, GAO has evolved into an  agency with hybrid systems.  This is particularly evident in GAO\u2019s  personnel and performance management systems.  Unlike many executive  branch agencies, which have either recently received or are just requesting  new broad-based human capital tools and flexibilities, GAO has had certain  human capital tools and flexibilities for over two decades.  As a result, we  have been able to some extent to operate our personnel system with a  degree of independence that most agencies in the executive branch do not  have.  For example, we are excepted from certain provisions of Title 5,  which governs the competitive service, and we are not subject to Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) oversight.", "Until 1980, our personnel system was indistinguishable from those of  executive branch agencies\u2014that is, GAO was subject to the same laws,  regulations, and policies as they were.  However, with the expansion of  GAO\u2019s role in congressional oversight of federal agencies and programs,  concerns grew about the potential for conflicts of interest.  Could GAO  conduct independent and objective reviews of executive branch agencies,  such as OPM, when these agencies had the authority to review GAO\u2019s  internal personnel activities?  As a result, GAO worked with the Congress  to pass the GAO Personnel Act of 1980, the principal goal of which was to  avoid potential conflicts by making GAO\u2019s personnel system more  independent of the executive branch.", "Along with this independence, the act gave GAO greater flexibility in hiring  and managing its workforce.  Among other things, it granted the  Comptroller General authority to  appoint, promote, and assign employees without regard to Title 5  requirements in these areas;  set employees\u2019 pay without regard to the federal government\u2019s General  Schedule (GS) pay system\u2019s classification standards and requirements;  and   establish a merit pay system for appropriate officers and employees.", "By excepting our agency from the above requirements, the GAO Personnel  Act of 1980 allowed us to pursue some significant innovations in managing  our people.  One key innovation was the establishment of a \u201cbroad  banding,\u201d or \u201cpay banding,\u201d approach for classifying and paying our Analyst  and Attorney workforce in 1989.  This was coupled with the adoption of a  pay for performance system for this portion of our workforce.  Therefore,  while other agencies are only now requesting the authority to establish  broad banding and pay for performance systems, GAO has had almost 15  years of experience with such systems.", "Although GAO\u2019s personnel and pay systems are not similar to those of  many executive branch agencies, I must emphasize that in important ways,  our human capital policies and programs are very much and will continue  to remain similar to those of the larger federal community.  GAO\u2019s current  human capital proposal will not change our continued support for certain  national goals (e.g., commitment to federal merit principles, protection  from prohibited personnel practices, employee due process through a  specially created entity\u2014the Personnel Appeals Board (PAB), and  application of veterans\u2019 preference consistent with its application in the  executive branch for appointments and all appropriate reductions-in- force).  Furthermore, our pay system is and will continue to be consistent  with the statutory principle of equal pay for equal work while making pay  distinctions on the basis of an individual\u2019s responsibilities and  performance.  In addition, we are covered and will remain covered by Title  VII of the Civil Rights Act, which forbids employment discrimination.  At  GAO, we also emphasize opportunity and inclusiveness for a diverse  workforce and have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind.  We have  taken and will continue to take disciplinary action when it \u201cwill promote  the efficiency of the service\u201d\u2014which for us includes such things as GAO\u2019s  ability to do its work and accomplish its mission.", "Although we are not subject to OPM oversight, we are nevertheless subject  to the oversight of the Congress including our appropriations  committees\u2014the Senate Committee on Appropriations\u2019 Subcommittee on  the Legislative Branch and the House Committee on Appropriations\u2019  Subcommittee on Legislative\u2014and our oversight committees\u2014the Senate  Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on  Government Reform.  In addition, GAO\u2019s management actions are subject  to the review of an independent five member board, the Personnel Appeals  Board, which performs functions similar to those provided by the Merit  Systems Protection Board for federal executive branch employees\u2019  personnel grievances.  The Congress authorized the establishment of the  PAB specifically for GAO in order to protect GAO\u2019s independence as an  agency.  As with other federal executive branch employees, our employees  have the right to appeal certain kinds of management actions including  removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reductions in pay or grade,  furloughs of not more than 30 days, a prohibited personnel practice, an  action involving prohibited discrimination, a prohibited political activity, a  within-grade denial, unfair labor practices or other labor relations issue.   However, they do so to the PAB rather than the MSPB.", "While we currently do not have any bargaining units at GAO, our  employees are free to join employee organizations, including unions.  In  addition, we engage in a range of ongoing communication and coordination  efforts to empower our employees while tapping their ideas.  For example,  we regularly discuss a range of issues of mutual interest and concern with  our democratically elected Employee Advisory Council (EAC).  Chris  Keisling, who is a Band III field office representative of the EAC, is  testifying with me today.  In addition, I consult regularly with our managing  directors on issues of mutual interest and concern.  In that spirit, I will  consult with the managing directors and the EAC before implementing the  provisions related to our human capital proposal.  As we did with the  flexibilities granted it under Public Law 106-303, the GAO Personnel  Flexibilities Act, we will implement the authorities granted under this  provision of our proposal only after issuing draft regulations and providing  all employees notice and an opportunity for comment.  Specifically, for the  authorities granted to us under Public Law 106-303, we posted the draft  regulations on our internal Web site and sent a notice to all GAO staff  advising them of the draft regulations and seeking their comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Elements of GAO\u2019s Proposal", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u2019s proposal combines diverse initiatives that, collectively, should  further GAO\u2019s ability to enhance our performance, assure our  accountability, and help ensure that we can attract, retain, motivate, and  reward a top quality and high-performing workforce currently and in future  years.  These initiatives should also have the benefit of helping guide other  agencies in their human capital transformation efforts.  Specifically, we are  requesting that the Congress provide us the following additional human  capital tools and flexibilities:   make permanent GAO\u2019s 3-year authority to offer voluntary early  retirement and voluntary separation payments;   allow the Comptroller General to adjust the rates of basic pay of GAO on  a separate basis than the annual adjustments authorized for employees  of the executive branch;   permit GAO to set the pay of an employee demoted as a result of  workforce restructuring or reclassification at his or her current rate  with no automatic annual increase to basic pay until his or her salary is  less than the maximum rate of  their new position;   provide authority in appropriate circumstances to reimburse employees  for some relocation expenses when that transfer does not meet current  legal requirements for entitlement to reimbursement but still benefits  GAO;   provide authority to put upper-level hires with less than 3 years of  federal experience in the 6-hour leave category;   authorize an executive exchange program with private sector  organizations working in areas of mutual concern and involving areas in  which GAO has a supply-demand imbalance; and  change GAO\u2019s legal name from the \u201cGeneral Accounting Office\u201d to the  \u201cGovernment Accountability Office.\u201d", "I will go into more detail later in my testimony on the details and rationale  for each of these proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Developing the Proposal", "paragraphs": ["In developing our proposal, we used a phased approach that involved   (1) developing a straw proposal, (2) vetting the straw proposal broadly  both externally and internally, and (3) making appropriate adjustments  based on comments and concerns raised during the vetting process.   As we  have previously testified, many of the management tools and flexibilities  we needed to pursue modern human capital management approaches are  already available to us and we have used them.  We have chosen to come to  the Congress for legislation only where the tools and flexibilities we have  were inadequate for addressing the challenges we faced.  For example, the  Congress enacted Public Law 106-303 to provide us with certain narrowly  tailored flexibilities we needed to reshape our workforce and establish  senior-level technical positions in critical areas.  These flexibilities were  needed to help GAO address the past decade\u2019s dramatic downsizing  (approximately 40 percent from 1992 through 1997) combined with a  significant increase in the retirement-eligible workforce that jeopardized  our ability to perform our mission in the years ahead.", "In developing our preliminary proposal, we gathered suggestions for  addressing GAO\u2019s human capital challenges as well as challenges faced by  the rest of the federal government, discussed and debated them internally,  and compiled a preliminary list of proposals.  We received a number of  viable proposals that we separated into two groups: (1) proposals that  would be more applicable government-wide and (2) proposals GAO should  undertake.  I had our Office of General Counsel review the proposals GAO  should undertake to determine whether we needed to seek legislative  authority to implement them or whether I could implement them under the  Comptroller General\u2019s existing authority.", "Mindful of the need to keep the Congress appropriately informed, my staff  and I began our outreach to GAO\u2019s appropriations and oversight  committees on the need for additional human capital flexibilities beginning  late last year.   In early spring of this year, we shared with these committees  a confidential draft of a preliminary draft proposal.  We also advised them  that we planned to conduct a broad range of outreach and consultation on  the proposal with our employees and other interested parties and that we  would send them our revised legislative proposal at a later date.  We  conducted an extensive outreach and consultation effort with members of  the Congress, including chairmen and ranking minority members of our  appropriations and oversight committees and a number of local delegation  members; congressional staff; the Director of OPM; the Deputy Director for  Management of the Office of Management and Budget; public sector  employee associations and unions; and various \u201cgood government\u201d  organizations.", "Within GAO, members of the Executive Committee (EC), which includes  our Chief Operating Officer, our General Counsel, our Chief Mission  Support Officer and me, engaged in an extensive and unprecedented range  of outreach and consultation with GAO employees.  This outreach included  numerous discussions with our managing directors, who manage most of  GAO\u2019s workforce, and members of the EAC.", "The EAC is an important source of input and a key communications link  between executive management and the constituent groups its members  represent.  Comprising employees who represent a cross-section of the  agency, the EAC meets at least quarterly with me and members of our  senior executive team.  The EAC\u2019s participation is an important source of  front-end input and feedback on our human capital and other major  management initiatives.  Specifically, EAC members convey the views and  concerns of the groups they represent, while remaining sensitive to the  collective best interest of all GAO employees; propose solutions to  concerns raised by employees; provide input to and comment on GAO  policies, procedures, plans, and practices; and help to communicate  management\u2019s issues and concerns to employees.", "I have also used my periodic \u201cCG chats,\u201d closed circuit televised broadcasts  to all GAO employees, as a means of explaining our proposal and  responding to staff concerns and questions.  Specifically, I have held two  televised chats to inform GAO staff about the proposal.  One of these chats  was conducted in the form of a general listening session, open to all  headquarters and field office staff,  featuring questions from members of  the EAC and field office employees.  I have also discussed the proposal  with the Band IIs (GS-13-14 equivalents) in sessions held in April 2003, and  with our Senior Executive Service (SES) and Senior Level members at our  May off-site meeting. In addition to my CG chats, I have personally held a  number of listening sessions, including a session with members of our  Office of General Counsel, two sessions with our administrative support  staff, and sessions with staff in several field offices.  Furthermore, the Chief  Operating Officer represented me in a listening session with Band I field  office personnel.  Finally, I have also personally received and considered a  number of E-mails, notes, and verbal comments on the human capital  proposal.", "I would like to point out to others seeking human capital flexibilities that  the outreach process, while necessary, is indeed time-consuming and  requires real and persistent commitment on the part of an agency\u2019s top  management team.  In order for the process to work effectively, it also  requires an ongoing education and dialogue process that will, at times,  involve candid, yet constructive, discussion between management and  employees.   This is, however, both necessary and appropriate as part of the  overall change management process.  To facilitate the education process on  the proposal, we posted materials on GAO\u2019s internal website, including  Questions and Answers developed in response to employees\u2019 questions and  concerns, for all employees to review.  Unfortunately, others who have  sought and are seeking additional human capital flexibilities have not  employed such an extensive outreach process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nature of GAO Employee Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Based on feedback from GAO employees, there is little or no concern  relating to most of the provisions in our proposal.  There has been  significant concern expressed over GAO\u2019s proposal to decouple GAO\u2019s pay  system from that of the executive branch.  Some concerns have also been  expressed regarding the pay retention provision and the proposed name  change.  As addressed below, we do believe, however, that these employee  concerns, have been reduced considerably due to the clarifications,  changes, and commitments resulting from our extensive outreach and  consultation effort.", "On the basis of various forms of GAO employee feedback, it is not  surprising, since pay is important to all employees, that the provision that  has caused the most stir within GAO has been the pay adjustment  provision.  Fundamentally, some of our employees would prefer to remain  with the executive branch\u2019s GS system for various types of pay increases.   There are others close to retirement who are concerned with their \u201chigh  three\u201d and how the modified pay system, when fully implemented, might  affect permanent base pay, which is the key component of their retirement  annuity computation.  Overall, there is a great desire on the part of GAO  employees to know specifically how this authority would be implemented.", "It is important to note that, even in the best of circumstances, it is difficult  to garner a broad-based consensus of employee support for any major pay  system changes.  While it is my impression, based on employee feedback,  that we have made significant strides in allaying the significant initial  concerns expressed by employees regarding the pay adjustment provision,  I believe that some of these concerns will remain throughout  implementation.  In addition, some can never be resolved because they  involve philosophical differences or personal interest considerations on  behalf of individual GAO employees.", "GAO\u2019s history with pay banding certainly is illustrative of how difficult it is  for an organization to allay employee fears even in the face of obvious  benefits.  While history has proven that an overwhelming majority of GAO  employees have benefited from GAO\u2019s decision to migrate our Analysts and  Attorneys into pay banding and pay for performance systems, there was  significant opposition by GAO employees regarding the decision to move  into these systems.  The experience of the executive branch\u2019s pay  demonstration projects involving federal science and technology  laboratories shows that employee support at the beginning of the pay  demonstration projects ranged from 34 percent to 63 percent.  In fact, OPM  reports that it takes about 5 years to get support from two-thirds of  employees with managers generally supporting demonstrations at a higher  rate than employees.", "Following the pay adjustment provision but a distant second in terms of  employee concern, has been the pay reclassification provision, which  would allow GAO employees demoted as a result of workforce  restructuring or reclassification to keep their basic pay rates; however,  future pay increases would be set consistent with the new positions\u2019 pay  parameters.  Currently, employees subject to a reduction-in-force or  reclassification can be paid at a rate that exceeds the value of their duties  for an extended period.", "A distant third in terms of employee concern is the proposed name change  from the \u201cGeneral Accounting Office\u2019 to the \u201cGovernment Accountability  Office,\u201d which would allow the agency\u2019s title to more accurately reflect its  mission, core values, and work.  My sense is that some GAO employees  who have been with GAO for many years have grown comfortable with the  name and may prefer to keep it.   At the same time, I believe that a  significant majority of our employees support the proposed name change.   Importantly, all of our external advisory groups, including the Comptroller  General\u2019s Advisory Council, consisting of distinguished individuals from  the public and private sectors, and the Comptroller General\u2019s Educators  Advisory Council, consisting of distinguished individuals from the  academic community, and a variety of \u201cgood government\u201d groups strongly  support the proposed name change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes Made in Response to Employee Feedback", "paragraphs": ["The members of the EC and I took our employees\u2019 feedback seriously and  have seriously considered their concerns.  Key considerations in our  decision making were our institutional responsibility as leaders and  stewards of GAO and the overwhelming support expressed through  anonymous balloting by our senior executives, who also serve as leaders  and stewards for GAO, for proceeding with all of the provisions of our  human capital proposal, including the pay adjustment provision.   Specifically, in a recent confidential electronic balloting of our senior  executives, support for each element of our proposal ranged from over 2 to  1 to unanimous, depending on the provision.  Support for the proposed pay  adjustment provision was over 3 to 1, and support for the proposed pay  protection provision was over 4 to 1.  Given this and other considerations,  ultimately, we decided to proceed with the proposal but adopted a number  of the suggestions made by employees in these sessions, including several  relating to the proposal to decouple GAO annual pay adjustments from  those applicable to many executive branch agencies.", "A key suggestion adopted include a minimum 2-year transition period for  ensuring the smooth implementation of the pay provisions which would  also allow time for  developing appropriate methodologies and issuing  regulations for notice and comment by all employees.  Another key  suggestion adopted was the commitment to guarantee annual across the  board purchase power protection and to address locality pay  considerations to all employees rated as performing at a satisfactory level  or above (i.e., meeting expectations or above) absent extraordinary  economic circumstances or severe budgetary constraints.  We have chosen  to implement this guarantee through a future GAO Order rather than  through legislative language because prior \u201cpay protection\u201d guarantees  relating to pay banding made by my predecessor, Comptroller General  Charles A. Bowsher, used this means effectively to document and  operationalize that guarantee.  I have committed to our employees that I  would include this guarantee in my statement here today so that it could be  included as part of the legislative record.  Additional safeguards relating to  our pay proposal are set forth below.", "The following represents additional information regarding our specific  proposal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voluntary Early Retirement and Separation Incentive Payment Authorities", "paragraphs": ["Section 2 of our proposal would make permanent the authority of GAO  under section 1 and 2 of Public Law 106-303, the GAO Personnel  Flexibilities Act of 2000, to offer voluntary early retirements (commonly  termed \u201cearly outs\u201d) and voluntary separation payments (commonly  termed \u201cbuyouts\u201d) to certain GAO employees when necessary to realign  GAO\u2019s workforce in order to meet budgetary or mission needs, correct skill  imbalances, or reduce high-grade positions.  We believe that we have  behaved responsibly in exercising the flexibilities that the Congress  granted us and deserve a permanent continuation of these authorities.  In  addition, the two flexibilities which we would like to be made permanent  are narrowly drawn and voluntary in nature, since the employees have the  right to decide if they are interested in being considered for the benefits.   Further, the provisions also have built in limits: no more than 10 percent of  the workforce in any one year can be given early outs and no more than 5  percent can be given buyouts.", "GAO\u2019s transformation effort is a work in progress, and for that reason, the  agency is seeking legislation to make the voluntary early retirement  provision in section 1 of the law permanent. While the overall number of  employees electing early retirement has been relatively small, GAO  believes that careful use of voluntary early retirement has been an  important tool in incrementally improving the agency\u2019s overall human  capital profile. Each separation has freed resources for other uses, enabling  GAO to fill an entry-level position or to fill a position that will reduce a skill  gap or address other succession concerns.   Similarly, we are seeking  legislation to make section 2\u2014authorizing the payment of voluntary  separation incentives\u2014permanent.    Although GAO has not yet used its  buyout authority and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future, we are  seeking to retain this flexibility.  The continuation of this provision  maximizes the options available to the agency to deal with future  circumstances, which cannot be reasonably anticipated at this time.   Importantly, this provision seems fully appropriate since the Homeland  Security Act of 2002 provides most federal agencies with permanent early  out and buyout authority.", "Public Law 106-303 required that GAO perform an assessment of the  exercise of the authorities provided under that law, which included the  authority for the Comptroller General to provide voluntary early retirement  and voluntary separation incentive payments.  With your permission, I  would like to submit the assessment entitled Assessment of Public Law  106-303: The Role of Personnel Flexibilities in Strengthening GAO\u2019s  Human Capital, issued on June 27, 2003, for the record.   I will now  highlight for you our observations from that assessment on voluntary early  retirement and buyouts.", "Voluntary Early Retirement   Public Law 106-303 also allows the Comptroller General to offer voluntary  early retirement to up to 10 percent of the workforce when necessary or  appropriate to realign the workforce to address budgetary or mission  constraints; correct skill imbalances; or reduce high-grade, supervisory, or  managerial positions.  This flexibility represents a proactive use of early  retirement to shape the workforce to prevent or ameliorate future  problems.  GAO Order 2931.1, Voluntary Early Retirement, containing the  agency\u2019s final regulations, was issued in April 2001.  Under the regulations,  each time the Comptroller General approves a voluntary early retirement  opportunity, he establishes the categories of employees who are eligible to  apply.  These categories are based on the need to ensure that those  employees who are eligible to request voluntary early retirement are those  whose separations are consistent with one or more of the three reasons for  which the Comptroller General may authorize early retirements.  Pursuant  to GAO\u2019s regulations, these categories are defined in terms of one or more  of the following criteria:  organizational unit or subunits,  grade or band level,   skill or knowledge requirements,  other similar factors that the Comptroller General deems necessary and  appropriate.", "Since it is essential that GAO retain employees with critical skills as well as  its highest performers, certain categories of employees have been ineligible  under the criteria.  Some examples of ineligible categories are employees  receiving retention allowances because of their unusually high or unique  qualifications; economists, because of the difficulty that the agency has  experienced in recruiting them; and staff in the information technology  area.  In addition, employees with performance appraisal averages above a  specified level have not been eligible under the criteria.", "To give the fullest consideration to all interested employees, however, any  employee may apply for consideration when an early retirement  opportunity is announced, even if he or she does not meet the stated  criteria.  Furthermore, under our order, the Comptroller General may  authorize early retirements for these applicants on the basis of the facts  and circumstances of each case.  The Comptroller General or his EC  designee considers each applicant and makes final decisions based on  GAO\u2019s institutional needs.  Only employees whose release is consistent  with the law and GAO\u2019s objective in allowing early retirement are  authorized to retire early.  In some cases, this has meant that an employee\u2019s  request must be denied.", "GAO held its first voluntary early retirement opportunity in July 2001.   Employees who were approved for early retirement were required to  separate in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.  As required by the act,  information on the fiscal 2002 early retirements was reported in an  appendix to our 2002 Performance and Accountability Report.  Another  voluntary early retirement opportunity was authorized in fiscal 2003, and  employees were required to separate by March 14, 2003.  In anticipation of  the 3-year sunset on our authority to provide voluntary early retirements, I  have recently announced a final voluntary early retirement opportunity  under our current authority.

High-grade, supervisory, or  managerial employees are those who are GS-13s or above, if covered by  GAO\u2019s GS system; Band IIs or above, if covered by GAO\u2019s banded systems  for Analysts and Attorneys; or in any position in GAO\u2019s SES or Senior-Level  system.", "In recommending that GAO\u2019s voluntary early out authority be made  permanent, I would like to point to our progress in changing the overall  shape of the organization. The 1990s were a difficult period for ensuring  that GAO\u2019s workforce would remain appropriately sized, shaped, and  skilled to meet client demands and agency needs.  Severe downsizing of the  workforce, including a suspension of most hiring from 1992 through 1997,  and constrained investments in such areas as training, performance  incentives, rewards, and enabling technology left GAO with a range of  human capital and operational challenges to address.  Over 3 years ago,  when GAO sought additional human capital flexibilities, our workforce was  sparse at the entry level and plentiful at the midlevel.  We were concerned  about our ability to support the Congress with experienced and  knowledgeable staff over time, given the significant percentage of the  agency\u2019s senior managers and analysts reaching retirement eligibility and  the small number of entry-level employees who were training to replace  more senior staff.", "As illustrated in figure 1, by the end of fiscal year 2002, GAO had almost a  74 percent increase in the proportion of staff at the entry level (Band I)  compared with fiscal year 1998.  Also, the proportion of the agency\u2019s  workforce at the midlevel (Band II) decreased by 16 percent."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Voluntary Separation Payments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to authorizing voluntary early retirement for GAO employees,  Public Law 106-303 permits the Comptroller General to offer voluntary  separation incentive payments\u2014buyouts\u2014when necessary or appropriate  to realign the workforce to meet budgetary constraints or mission needs;  correct skill imbalances; or reduce high-grade, supervisory, or managerial  positions.  Under the act, up to 5 percent of employees could be offered  such an incentive, subject to criteria established by the Comptroller  General.", "The act requires GAO to deposit into the U.S. Treasury an amount  equivalent to 45 percent of the final annual basic salary of each employee to  whom a buyout is paid.  The deposit is in addition to the actual buyout  amount, which can be up to $25,000 for an approved individual.  Given the  many demands on agency resources, these costs present a strong financial  disincentive to use the provision if at all.  GAO anticipates little, if any, use  of this authority because of the associated costs.  For this reason, as well as  to avoid creating unrealistic employee expectations, GAO has not  developed and issued agency regulations to implement this section of the  act.  Nevertheless, as stated earlier, it is prudent for us to seek the  continuation of this provision because it maximizes the options available to  the agency to deal with future circumstances.  Since GAO is also eligible to  request buyouts under the provisions of the Homeland Security Act, the  agency will consider its options under this provision as well.  However,  under the Homeland Security Act, GAO would have to seek OPM approval  of any buyouts, which raises serious independence concerns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Annual Pay Setting Policy and Adjustments", "paragraphs": ["Section 3 and 4 of our proposal would provide GAO greater discretion in  determining the annual across the board and locality pay increases for our  employees.  Under our proposal, GAO would have the discretion to set  annual pay increases by taking into account alternative methodologies  from those used by the executive branch and various other factors, such as  extraordinary economic conditions or serious budgetary constraints.   While the authority requested may initially appear to be broad based, there  are compelling reasons why GAO ought to be given such authority.  First, as  I discussed at the beginning of my testimony, GAO is an agency within the  legislative branch and already has a hybrid pay system established under  the authority the Congress granted  over two decades ago.  Therefore, our  proposal represents a natural evolution in GAO\u2019s pay for performance  system.  Second, GAO\u2019s proposal is not radical if viewed from the vantage  point of the broad-based authority that has been granted the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) under the Homeland Security Act of 2002;  agencies that the Congress has already granted the authority to develop  their own pay systems; the authorities granted to various demonstration  projects over the past two decades; and the authority Congress is currently  contemplating providing the Department of Defense (DOD).  Third, GAO  already has a number of key safeguards and has plans to build additional  safeguards into our modified pay system if granted this authority.", "Our proposal seeks to take a constructive step in addressing what has been  widely recognized as fundamental flaws in the federal government\u2019s  approach to white-collar pay.  These flaws and the need for reform have  been addressed in more detail in OPM\u2019s April 2002 White Paper, A Fresh  Start For Federal Pay: A Case for Modernization, and more recently the  National Commission on the Public Service\u2019s January 2003 report on  revitalizing the public service.  The current federal pay and classification  system was established over 60 years ago for a federal workforce that was  made up largely of clerks performing routine tasks which were relatively  simple to assess and measure.  Today\u2019s federal workforce is composed of  much higher graded and knowledge-based workers.", "Although there have been attempts over the years to refine the system by  enacting such legislation as the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act  (FEPCA) which sought to address, among other things, the issue of pay  comparability with the nonfederal sector, the system still contains certain  fundamental flaws.  The current system emphasizes placing employees in a  relative hierarchy of positions based on grade; is a \u201cone size fits all  approach\u201d since it does not recognize changes in local market rates for  different occupations; and is performance insensitive in that all employees  are eligible for the automatic across the board pay increases regardless of  their performance.  Specifically, the annual across the board base pay  increase, also commonly referred to as the cost of living adjustment  (COLA) or the January Pay Increase which the President recommends and  the Congress approves, provides a time driven annual raise keyed to the  Employment Cost Index (ECI) to all employees regardless of performance.   In certain geographic areas, employees receive a locality adjustment tied to  the local labor markets.  However, in calculating the locality adjustment,  for example, it is my understanding that FEPCA requires the calculation of  a single average, based on the dominant federal employer in an area, which  does not sufficiently recognize the differences in pay rates for different  occupations and skills. In view of the fact that today we are in a knowledge- based economy competing for the best knowledge workers in the job  market, I believe that new approaches and methodologies are warranted.   This is especially appropriate for GAO\u2019s highly educated and skilled  workforce.", "Our proposed pay adjustment provision along with the other provisions of  GAO\u2019s human capital proposal are collectively designed to help GAO  maintain a competitive advantage in attracting, motivating, retaining, and  rewarding a high performing and top-quality workforce both currently and  in future years.  First, under our proposal, GAO would no longer be  required to provide automatic pay increases to employees who are rated as  performing at a below satisfactory level.  Second, when the proposal is fully  implemented, GAO would be able to allocate more of the funding\u2014 currently allocated for automatic across-the-board pay adjustments to all  employees\u2014to permanent base pay adjustments that would vary based on  performance.   In addition, our proposal would affect all GAO, non-wage  grade employees, including the SES and Senior Level staff.", "Ultimately, if GAO is granted this authority, all GAO employees who  perform at a satisfactory level will receive an annual base pay adjustment  composed of purchase power protection and locality based pay increases  absent extraordinary economic circumstances or severe budgetary  constraints.  GAO will be able to develop and apply its own methodology  for annual cost-of-living and locality pay adjustments.  The locality pay  increase would be based on compensation surveys conducted by GAO and  which would be tailored to the nature, skills, and composition of GAO\u2019s  workforce.   The performance part of an employee\u2019s annual raise would  depend on the level of the employee\u2019s performance and that employee\u2019s pay  band.  We estimate that at least 95 percent of the workforce will qualify for  an additional performance-based increase.

Each of these groups  currently operate in a different pay system.  Generally, our mission staff are  all in pay bands whereby they currently receive the annual across-the- board base pay increase and locality pay increase similar to the GS pay  system, along with performance-based annual increases that are based on  merit.  Generally, our mission support staff, with some exceptions, remain  in a system similar to the GS pay system with its annual across- the-board  pay increases, locality pay, quality step increases, and within grade  increases.  We are currently in the process of migrating the mission support  staff into pay bands and a pay for performance system.

It is important to point out that GAO\u2019s proposal and  proposed pay flexibilities pale in respect to those granted to the DHS and to  those requested by the DOD in the Defense Transformation for the 21st  Century Act of 2003. Collectively, these two agencies represent almost 45  percent of the non-postal federal civilian workforce.  Specifically, in  November 2002, the Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002,  which created DHS and provided the department with significant  flexibilities to design a modern human capital management system, which  could have the potential, if properly developed, for application  governmentwide.  DOD\u2019s proposed National Security Personnel System  (NSPS) would provide wide-ranging changes to its civilian personnel pay  and performance management systems, collective bargaining, rightsizing,  and a variety of other human capital areas.  NSPS would enable DOD to  develop and implement a consistent, DOD-wide civilian personnel system.", "In addition to DHS, there are a number of federal agencies with authority  for their own pay systems.  Some of these agencies are, for example, the  Congressional Budget Office, which is one of our sister agencies in the  legislative branch; the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ; and the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) within the Department of the Treasury.   When the Congress created the CBO in 1974, it granted that legislative  branch agency significant flexibilities in the human capital area.  For  example, CBO has \u201cat will\u201d employment.  In addition, CBO is not subject to  the annual executive branch pay adjustments.  Further, CBO has extensive  flexibility regarding its pay system subject only to certain statutory annual  compensation limits.", "Furthermore, there are twelve executive branch demonstration projects  involving pay for performance.
