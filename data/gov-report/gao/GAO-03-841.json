BIPA's provisions related to Medicare appeals were to be applied to claims denied after October 1, 2002, but many of the changes have not yet been implemented.

While the carriers have generally met their pre-BIPA time requirements, in fiscal year 2001, they completed only 43 percent of first level appeals within BIPA's 30-day time frame. In addition to average processing times more than four times longer than that required by BIPA, OHA and the MAC--the two highest levels of appeal--have accumulated sizable backlogs of unresolved cases. Delays in administrative processing due to inefficiencies and incompatibility of their data systems constitute 70 percent of the time spent processing appeals at the OHA and MAC levels. The appeals bodies are housed in two different agencies--HHS and SSA. The lack of a single entity to set priorities and address operational problems--such as incompatible data and administrative systems--at all four levels of the process has precluded successful management of the appeals system as a whole. Uncertainty about funding and a possible transfer of OHA's Medicare appeals workload from OHA to HHS has also complicated the appeals bodies' ability to adequately plan for the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2002, Medicare\u2014the nation\u2019s largest health insurer\u2014paid  over $200 billion to provide medical care to 40 million elderly and disabled  beneficiaries.

Among other things, CMS is charged with  protecting the program by identifying and denying health care claims that are invalid, incomplete, or otherwise appear to be improper. Beneficiaries  and providers may pursue the payment of denied claims through a  multilevel administrative appeals process. The entities\u2014or appeals  bodies\u2014that constitute the process include the Social Security  Administration (SSA) and HHS\u2019s Departmental Appeals Board (DAB), in  addition to CMS. In fiscal year 2001, 3.7 million Part B appeals were  submitted to the first level in the process.", "In recent years, there has been widespread concern about the length of  time it takes the appeals bodies to render decisions. In December 2000, the  Congress enacted the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits  Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA). Section 521 of BIPA  amended section 1869 of the Social Security Act by mandating shorter  time frames and expedited procedures for processing Medicare appeals. It  also added the requirement that the Secretary of HHS report on the  number of appealed claims and consistency of appeals decisions. The  provisions were to be applied to claims denied on or after October 1, 2002.", "Concerned about the appeals bodies\u2019 ability to implement BIPA\u2019s  provisions, you asked that we conduct an assessment of the Medicare  appeals process. Specifically, we examined whether (1) the current  appeals process is operating consistent with BIPA\u2019s requirements and (2)  there are any barriers in meeting the law\u2019s requirements.", "Because the majority of appeals are related to the denial of Part B claims,  we limited our work to assessing the appeals process for these claims. We  reviewed statutes, regulations, policies, and other documentation related  to the four levels of the administrative appeals process, including Part B  carriers, which conduct the first two levels of appeal; the Office of  Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within SSA, which hears the third level of  appeals; and the Medicare Appeals Council (MAC) within HHS\u2019s DAB,  which reviews OHA\u2019s decisions. To assess the conditions present at the  time BIPA was passed, we analyzed fiscal year 2001 appeals processing  data. We subsequently reviewed more current data and confirmed that the  conditions were relatively unchanged. We interviewed officials from CMS,  OHA, and the MAC to discuss the management of the appeals process and  the implementation of BIPA requirements. We conducted our work from  November 2001 through September 2003, in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

Claims are  denied for a variety of reasons. In fiscal year 2001, the most common  reason for denying claims was that the services provided were determined  not to have been medically necessary for the beneficiaries. Other reasons  for denials include that Medicare did not cover the services, or that the  beneficiary was not eligible for services. Claims that do not meet the  requirements outlined in Medicare statutes and federal regulations may be  denied. In addition, denials may be issued for claims that are inconsistent  with CMS\u2019s national coverage determinations (NCD) and carrier-based  policies, including local medical review policies (LMRP), local coverage  determinations (LCD), and other carrier instructions. Relatively few  denied claims are ever appealed, and only a small fraction is appealed to  the highest level. (App. II contains more information regarding the denial  of claims, including common reasons for denials.)", "The Medicare Part B appeals process consists of four levels of  administrative appeals performed by three appeals bodies. Medicare  carriers are responsible for the first two levels of appeal\u2014the carrier  review and the carrier hearing. Through a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) implemented in March 1995\u2014when SSA was separated from HHS  and became an independent agency\u2014OHA\u2019s administrative law judges  (ALJ) within SSA continue to hear the third level of appeal. OHA\u2019s  continued role in Medicare appeals is uncertain, as SSA officials have  indicated that they plan to discontinue adjudicating Medicare appeals and  expect to transfer the workload to HHS. However, until an agreement  between SSA and HHS is reached, OHA will continue to adjudicate  Medicare appeals. The MAC adjudicates appeals at the fourth level of the  administrative appeals process. In addition, appellants who have had their  appeals denied at all four levels of the administrative appeals process have  the option of filing their appeals in federal court.", "Section 521 of BIPA requires numerous administrative and structural  changes to the appeals process, including moving the second level of  appeals\u2014the carrier hearing\u2014from the Medicare carriers to a group of  yet-to-be-established contractors, known as qualified independent  contractors (QIC). Figure 1 outlines the steps of the existing appeals  process and the process BIPA requires. BIPA\u2019s changes to the appeals  process were to apply with respect to initial determinations\u2014that is,  claims denials\u2014made on or after October 1, 2002. Although CMS  published a rule on October 7, 2002, the ruling implemented only two of  BIPA\u2019s provisions\u2014revising the deadline for filing an appeal to the carrier  review level and reducing the dollar threshold for filing an appeal at the  OHA level. The October 7th rule outlines the criteria used to select the  changes that would be immediately implemented; among the criteria is  that the provision can be implemented using existing CMS resources. CMS  published a proposed rule for complete implementation of BIPA-mandated  changes on November 15, 2002, but the final rule has not been issued. As  of June 2003, the appeals process is generally operating in accordance  with regulations established prior to BIPA\u2019s passage. (See app. III for a  comprehensive list of BIPA\u2019s changes.)", "CMS oversees the carriers who perform  - intitial claim determinations and  - the carrier appeals functions  (hearing and review).", "BIPA requires that the Secretary of HHS  contract with QICs for the new  second-level review.", "SSA oversees OHA.", "HHS (but not CMS) oversees the MAC.", "Beneficiaries and providers have the right to appeal denied claims if  appeals are filed within the deadline. CMS\u2019s October 2002 ruling  implemented the BIPA-mandated deadline for filing an appeal at the  carrier review level, shortening it from 180 to 120 days\u2014one of two BIPA  provisions implemented thus far. Appeals at the carrier hearing level must  be submitted within 180 days of the denial or unfavorable determination.  Appellants who are dissatisfied with decisions reached at the carrier  hearing level may appeal to OHA and then to the MAC, and their appeals  must be filed within 60 days of receiving an unfavorable determination at  the previous level.", "There is no dollar minimum required to file an appeal at the carrier review  level. However, an appeal at the carrier hearing and OHA levels must meet  specific dollar thresholds of $100 and $500, respectively. To meet the  thresholds, multiple denied claims may be aggregated into a single appeals  \u201ccase.\u201d The MAC does not have a dollar threshold for considering appeals.  Finally, appellants who receive unfavorable determinations from the MAC  may appeal the decisions in federal court if the amount in dispute is at  least $1,000. BIPA provisions change the threshold amounts at the second  level of appeal and OHA. When QICs replace carrier hearings as the  second level of appeal, the dollar threshold for submitting an appeal at  that level will be eliminated. Further, CMS\u2019s October 2002 ruling  implemented BIPA\u2019s reduced dollar threshold for filing an appeal at  OHA\u2014the second of two BIPA provisions to be implemented thus far\u2014by  dropping the threshold from $500 to $100.", "BIPA also shortened the time frames the appeals bodies have for  adjudicating appeals at the first two levels and established time frames for  the first time at the higher levels. BIPA\u2019s provisions that revise the  timelines for processing appeals have not been implemented, and the  appeals bodies are following previously issued performance standards  specifying that 95 percent of carrier reviews be completed within 45 days  and 90 percent of carrier hearings be completed within 120 days. BIPA  required that carrier reviews be completed in 30 days and that the QICs  issue their decisions in 30 days. While OHA and the MAC have not  previously been bound by time limits, BIPA required that they issue  decisions within 90 days of the date an appeal was filed. BIPA also gave  appellants the right to escalate their appeals to the next level in the  process for adjudication when a decision is not issued within the specified  time frame. Escalation is available from any level of appeal except the  first\u2014carrier review. However, CMS\u2019s November 2002 proposed rule  regarding BIPA\u2019s implementation provides that appellants who escalate  their appeals to the next level will, in essence, be waiving their right to a  decision within the statutory time frame governing that level. For example,  an appeal that is escalated from the OHA to the MAC would not be subject  to the 90-day limit that applies to appeals received by the MAC that have  not been escalated.", "The first three levels of appeal share a protocol for adjudication, called de  novo review, which permits adjudicators to consider results from earlier  decisions but requires them to independently evaluate evidence and issue  original decisions. The appeals bodies reexamine the initial claim to  determine if it should be paid and consider any new documentation or  information supporting the claim that the appellant submitted. The fourth  level of review, the MAC, does not share this protocol. Rather than  performing de novo review of evidence, it evaluates the appropriateness of  OHA decisions and considers whether new evidence submitted will alter  the decision. BIPA changes require that the MAC performs de novo review  in all cases.", "The appeals bodies reach decisions through either a review of the file for  the initial claim or through hearings. At the first level of appeal, a carrier  review officer who was not involved in the initial denial reexamines the  initial claim and any new supporting documentation provided by the  appellant but does not conduct a hearing. The second level of appeal\u2014the  carrier hearing\u2014provides the appellant with an opportunity to participate  in a hearing at the carrier\u2019s facility or by telephone. OHA conducts  hearings at the third level of review. OHA\u2019s hearings are held at its central  office in Falls Church, Virginia, or at one of its 140 local hearing offices  nationwide. The MAC\u2019s adjudication is based on a review of OHA\u2019s  decisions, and it does not conduct hearings.", "Appeals bodies have several options when deciding a case. The case may  be decided fully or partially in favor of the appellant and payment awarded  for all or part of the claim or claims in dispute. Alternatively, the decision  may be unfavorable to the appellant and the initial denial of payment  upheld. The MAC has an additional option of remanding the appeal\u2014  returning it to the OHA judge who issued the original decision\u2014for a  variety of reasons. For example, the MAC may determine that more  evidence is needed, additional action by OHA is warranted, or that OHA  should issue a modified decision based on the MAC\u2019s instructions. Finally,  the MAC may deny an appellant\u2019s request for review if it finds that OHA\u2019s  decision is factually and legally adequate.", "In making a determination regarding whether the claim is payable or will  continue to be denied, the first two levels of appeal are bound by the same  guidance used in the initial denial determination\u2014Medicare statutes,  federal regulations, CMS\u2019s NCDs, the carrier\u2019s own LMRPs and LCDs, and,  pursuant to carrier\u2019s contracts with CMS, CMS\u2019s general instructions, such  as manuals and program memoranda.

CMS is charged with establishing procedures for  carriers to follow in considering appeals\u2014including developing guidelines  for timeliness and quality of communications with the appellant\u2014and is  also responsible for ensuring that the carrier review and carrier hearing  processes comply with statutory and regulatory requirements. SSA  establishes its own requirements and procedures, with input from CMS,  for OHA\u2019s review of third-level appeals. CMS reimburses OHA for its  appeals work.

At the carrier  hearing level\u2014eventually to be replaced by the appeals to the QICs\u2014the  ability to meet BIPA\u2019s time frames remains largely unanswered because  the QICs have not yet been established. Although the carriers exceeded  CMS\u2019s performance standards in fiscal year 2001 by completing more than  90 percent of the carrier hearings within 120 days, this standard is much  less stringent than the one imposed by BIPA, which requires the QICs to  complete all appeals within 30 days.", "Similarly, OHA and the MAC fall far short of BIPA\u2019s required 90-day time  frame for completing 100 percent of their cases. For example, in fiscal year  2001, OHA took an average of 14 months from the date an appeal was filed  to complete adjudication. The MAC took even longer to process appeals  during the same year, with cases taking an average of 21 months to  adjudicate. As of September 2003, OHA and the MAC had not implemented  BIPA-mandated time frames and continued to operate without time frames  for rendering decisions. Although officials at both appeals bodies told us  that they are concerned with meeting BIPA time frames, neither body has  developed strategies for doing so. Instead, the officials stated that they  would take action once regulations implementing BIPA are finalized and  they are more certain how the new regulations will affect them.", "Existing backlogs of unprocessed cases may also interfere with the  appeals bodies\u2019 compliance with BIPA\u2019s mandated time frames for appeals  of claims denied after October 2002. While backlogs at the carrier review  and carrier hearing levels are relatively small, OHA and the MAC have  been unable to meet workload demands. For example, OHA\u2019s backlog at  the end of fiscal year 2001 included nearly 35,000 Part B cases\u2014equal to  about the average number of cases processed in 7 months. At the end of  that same year, the MAC had a backlog of 15,000 cases\u2014twice the number  of cases it adjudicated in 2001. The MAC has been making strides to  improve its efficiency and, near the end of fiscal year 2003, reported  reducing its backlog to 10,100 cases. According to OHA and MAC  representatives, BIPA-governed cases\u2014appeals of claims denied after  October 1, 2002\u2014will have higher priority than cases filed earlier, virtually  ensuring that pre-BIPA cases experience even longer delays. However, as  of July 2003, none of the appeals bodies had determined how they would  prioritize the processing of BIPA appeals while completing their pre-BIPA  workloads.", "At OHA, protocols for assigning appeals to ALJs may contribute to delays.  Although OHA plays a critical role in resolving Medicare appeals, its  primary focus is disability appeals for SSA, which constitute 85 percent of  its total caseload. While they are a smaller workload, Medicare appeals are  often more complex than disability appeals. Some local OHA hearing  offices take advantage of their ALJs\u2019 Medicare expertise by assigning all  Medicare cases to a single judge. However, other offices assign cases  randomly, requiring judges to refamiliarize themselves with basic  Medicare statutes each time they hear a Medicare case\u2014potentially  prolonging the process.", "While all of the appeals bodies are subject to BIPA\u2019s processing time  frames, the MAC is uniquely challenged in meeting these deadlines  because the requirement for de novo review expands the scope of the  MAC\u2019s work. MAC officials pointed out that shifting from ensuring that  OHA interprets policy correctly to becoming a fact-finding body requires a  substantial amount of additional resources and more time to gather and  evaluate evidence. MAC officials report that they do not have a strategy to  address the expansion in the scope of their work and the contraction in  time to render decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Administrative Processing at OHA and the MAC Further Suggest BIPA\u2019s Time Frames Will Not Be Met", "paragraphs": ["The bulk of time at OHA and the MAC is spent on assembling files and  completing other administrative tasks rather than in performing legal  analyses of appeals and adjudicating cases. Each agency takes more than a  year, on average, to complete an appeal. For example, OHA spent 14  months, on average, to complete a case in fiscal year 2001 and an average  of 10 months of that was consumed obtaining case files from the lower  level appeals bodies and performing related processing tasks. In that same  year, the MAC adjudicated nearly 7,100 Part B cases and spent about 17  months, on average, performing administrative tasks. As shown in figure 2,  on average, over 70 percent of the time to resolve OHA and MAC cases  was spent on administrative activities, rather than on substantive legal  analysis of the appeals.", "Officials from both OHA and the MAC report that it may take months to  receive appellants\u2019 case files from the previous level of review or the  appropriate storage facility. Case files\u2014which are all paper documents\u2014  are a critical component of the adjudication process as they contain all  evidence submitted by the appellant in previous appeals. The MAC, in  particular, requires OHA\u2019s case files to assess the evidence, the hearing  tapes, and the letter of decision so that it may determine whether OHA\u2019s  decision was appropriate.", "OHA and the MAC are dependent on the Medicare carriers to forward the  appropriate files to their hearing offices for review. CMS allows carriers 21  to 45 days to forward case files to OHA, depending on the number of  appellants and dollar value of the case. However, locating files is further  complicated by the fact that appellants are required to include little  information in their appeal requests. Therefore, OHA and the MAC may  receive appeals that do not identify the carrier that originally denied the  claim. Locating files can also be hindered if the appeal has been in process  for several years and the carrier that initially denied the claim is no longer  a Medicare contractor. Although the defunct carrier should have  transferred all of its files, including its appeals records, to the replacement  carrier, such transitions are not always smooth. Instead, files are often  difficult to locate, causing delays in forwarding specific requested cases.", "The MAC faces an additional challenge in locating case files. OHA- completed cases are routed to a special clearinghouse contractor for  temporary storage. If OHA determines that the appellant is due a full or  partial payment, the clearinghouse returns the files to the carrier that  initially denied the claim so that payment may be processed. If OHA  continues to deny payment, the clearinghouse holds the accompanying file  for 120 days to expedite the MAC\u2019s retrieval should the appellant continue  to appeal. However, the MAC may not know whether to approach the  clearinghouse contractor or the relevant carrier to request needed files.  And, like the carriers, the clearinghouse does not always provide files in a  timely manner. In fiscal year 2001, the MAC waited an average of nearly 3  months\u2014the entire time allowed for the MAC to adjudicate appeals under  the BIPA amendments\u2014to receive case files. The MAC, which is  empowered to remand, or return, cases to OHA when there is insufficient  information in the existing record to issue a decision, in fiscal year 2001  remanded 1,708 cases\u2014nearly a quarter of the cases it adjudicated that  year\u2014to OHA because needed files were either missing or incomplete.  Although CMS has not performed a comprehensive evaluation of the  clearinghouse\u2019s accuracy in routing appeals files, it recently determined  that the clearinghouse had a 10 percent error rate in routing case files to  particular carriers for payment.", "Inadequate technology and the need for manual processing also indicate  that the appeals bodies are not prepared to address BIPA\u2019s requirements.  For example, providers often aggregate groups of claims for different  beneficiaries to meet the dollar threshold for filing an OHA appeal. To  maintain beneficiary confidentiality, a separate electronic file\u2014containing  the same provider information\u2014is created for each beneficiary. While  widely available technology allows the creation of multiple data files by  entering the information one time and then quickly duplicating it, OHA\u2019s  system requires administrative staff to separately enter repetitive  information pertaining to each denied claim that constitutes the appeal.  For example, if a provider is appealing a similar group of claims in a single  appeal, OHA must nonetheless create a separate case file and data record  for each beneficiary.", "BIPA provides that appellants may escalate their appeals from the QIC or  OHA to the next level in the administrative appeals process when it is not  resolved within the time frames mandated. MAC cases not meeting the  time frame may be escalated to the federal district court. More than 95  percent of OHA appeals and about 85 percent of MAC appeals did not  meet BIPA time frames in fiscal year 2001, suggesting that a number of  cases would be eligible for escalation. However, escalation may not  ensure that appellants secure timely adjudication. Escalated cases will  lack comprehensive records because the prior level of appeal did not  complete the cases and may not have the full collection of case  documentation. OHA and MAC officials report that cases without  complete records from earlier levels of appeal will require the next level to  perform time-consuming research.

For  example, appeals bodies often reconfigure cases to group claims with  similar issues. Appellants also change the configuration of their cases by  aggregating their claims to meet minimum dollar thresholds necessary to  file an appeal at a given level. Case numbering is further complicated when  a partially favorable decision is made. In these situations, some of the  claims within the appeal are paid, while the remaining denied claims are  eligible for further appeal by beneficiaries and providers and subject to  further reconfiguration with new case numbers.

OHA collects aggregate data from each of its 140 hearing offices, despite  the fact that the local offices are tracking individual cases. The aggregate  numbers allow OHA and CMS to develop basic workload statistics, such as  the number of cases they resolve and the average time frames for  adjudication.

For example, only the MAC collects data on the reason for the  appeal, the type of denial being appealed, and the amount in controversy;  however, the MAC is not consistent in ensuring that the information is  routinely entered in the database. Furthermore, carriers do not collect  data that allow CMS to distinguish if the appellant is a beneficiary or a  provider, and none of the appeals bodies collects information on the rates  of appeal among provider specialty groups. Analyses of case characteristic  data could be valuable in identifying confusing or complex policies or  requirements that lead to denied claims and the submission of appeals.  The data would also be useful to the agencies in understanding the nature  of denied claims that are appealed at each level and guiding more  appropriate initial reviews of claims and educating providers about proper  claim submission.", "BIPA mandated the use of QICs to replace the second appeals level and  required them to develop management information through a data system  that would identify (1) the types of claims that give rise to appeals, (2)  issues that could benefit from provider education, and (3) situations that  suggest the need for changes in national or local coverage policy. QICs  must report their information to the Secretary of HHS and, among other  things, must monitor appeals decisions to ensure consistency between  similar appeals. However, the requirements do not affect data collection at  the other appeals bodies. As a result, without corresponding changes at  the other appeals bodies, it will remain difficult to evaluate the  performance of the appeals process as a whole and make informed  decisions affecting more than one appeals level. CMS stated that it plans to  expand the QICs\u2019 data system to the third level of appeal\u2014the  ALJ-adjudicated level\u2014and, eventually, to all levels of appeal. Until the  compatible data systems are in place at all appeals bodies\u2014which CMS  plans for 2005\u2014the appeals bodies will not be able to perform the most  fundamental types of analyses to improve the management of the process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainties in Regulations, Funding, and the Role of OHA Hinder BIPA Implementation Planning", "paragraphs": ["While BIPA mandated several changes to the current appeals process,  CMS, OHA and the MAC are charged with developing regulations for  implementing BIPA\u2019s mandates in accordance with the Administrative  Procedures Act. As of September 2003, guidance regarding two  provisions\u2014adjusted deadlines for appellants filing first-level appeals and  reduced dollar thresholds required for filing appeals at OHA\u2014have been  issued. CMS officials stated that they expect that the proposed  regulations implementing the remaining provisions of BIPA section 521  will be finalized by early 2004. The regulations, once finalized, will provide  directions specifying how each body will operate. Without final  regulations, officials from carriers, OHA, and the MAC said that they have  had difficulty estimating what the actual effect on their workloads will be  and, accordingly, have not made specific plans to comply with BIPA\u2019s  mandates.", "Even after the regulations are finalized, several important issues will not  have been resolved. For example, when it published its ruling on October  7, 2002, CMS acknowledged that transition issues from the current appeals  process to the new process would require additional policy guidance prior  to implementation. Specifically, questions will remain regarding the  necessity of operating two separate appeals processes concurrently,  dependent on the date of the initial claim determination. Appeals of claims  denied before the effective date of the BIPA amendments are not governed  by them, barring specific guidance to the contrary, and are subject to pre- BIPA guidelines and processes.", "No additional funding was provided to the appeals bodies in fiscal year  2003 to implement BIPA\u2019s changes. Moreover, uncertainties exist about  the funds available in fiscal year 2004. The first uncertainty concerns  funding for HHS. The President\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2004  includes $126 million in funding for CMS to complete BIPA\u2019s changes\u2014  including establishing the QICs, developing the QIC data systems, and  implementing the shortened time frames at the first and second appeals  levels\u2014as well as assuming the workload currently performed by OHA.  However, this funding level was premised on the assumption that BIPA  would be amended to reduce the number of QICs, increase the time  frames for completing appeals at all levels, and require that providers pay  a $50 user fee for filing appeals at QICs. However, as of September 2003,  BIPA had not been amended. Moreover, the proposed budget contained no  additional funding for the MAC to implement BIPA. The second budgetary  uncertainty concerns funding for the third level of the appeals process,  currently performed by OHA. While SSA\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget included  a $90 million \u201cdirect draw\u201d from the Medicare Trust Fund for Medicare  appeals, the proposed 2004 budget eliminates the direct draw and does not  include a new source for Medicare appeals funding, reflecting SSA\u2019s plan  to transfer OHA\u2019s Medicare appeals workload to HHS.", "Although BIPA required CMS to establish QICs in time for them to begin  adjudicating appeals of claims denied as of October 1, 2002, CMS  estimated, in its fiscal year 2004 budget request, that QICs would become  operational, at the earliest, February 2005. Agency officials detailed that  the implementation of QICs would require approximately 10 months of  drafting and finalizing the related regulations and conducting the bidding  process, and 6 months for hiring staff, renting space, and performing other  tasks associated with making QICs operational, including developing the  QICs\u2019 data systems. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS stated  that CMS now plans for QICs to begin operation in fiscal year 2004.  However, we were not provided with CMS\u2019s implementation plan or  sufficient details to evaluate its feasibility.", "Finally, one of the critical issues related to BIPA\u2019s implementation  involves the possible transfer of the Medicare caseload currently  adjudicated by SSA\u2019s OHA to HHS. Several issues remain unresolved. In  1995, when SSA separated from HHS and became an independent agency,  SSA entered into an MOU with the Health Care Financing Administration  to continue to perform the Medicare appeals work it had been conducting.  Recently, SSA has taken the position, which is reflected in its budget  request for fiscal year 2004, that it intends for OHA to discontinue  adjudicating Medicare appeals and has proposed a revised MOU outlining  the transfer of OHA work to HHS. However, as of September 2003, HHS  had not signed the revised MOU and the transfer of the workload to HHS  had not been finalized. In addition, legislation has been introduced that  would expressly provide for the transfer of Medicare appeals to HHS.However, provider and beneficiary groups have protested because they  believe shifting responsibility to HHS will compromise the ALJs\u2019  independence.", "OHA\u2019s departure from the appeals process would create a new challenge  for HHS. OHA\u2019s process for adjudicating administrative appeals includes  140 local hearing offices and over 1,000 ALJs. Because SSA disability  appeals constitute about 85 percent of OHA\u2019s work, OHA would continue  to require the use of its hearing offices and judges regardless of whether it  continues to hear Medicare appeals. BIPA language specifies that the third  level of appeal be adjudicated by ALJs, but because HHS has far less  capacity than OHA to hear ALJ cases, HHS would have to compensate for  OHA\u2019s departure by developing plans that would enable it to adjudicate  the current workload demands within BIPA\u2019s time frames and to address  the backlog of cases accumulated before the transfer to HHS. As of June  2003, CMS was evaluating OHA\u2019s Medicare operations, workload, and  facilities and developing and assessing the feasibility of various options. A  CMS official stated that assuming OHA\u2019s workload would be a notable  challenge for the agency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["BIPA demands a level of performance\u2014especially regarding timeliness\u2014  that the appeals bodies have not demonstrated they can meet. In addition  to lengthy processing times, OHA and the MAC have developed sizable  backlogs of unprocessed cases. The backlogs raise a question about how  BIPA-governed cases, with their mandated time frames, will be prioritized  relative to unresolved cases filed before BIPA\u2019s mandated implementation  date. Administrative and systemic inefficiencies, which span all levels of  appeals, strongly indicate the need for improvement. Without significant  improvements, the appeals bodies will be unable to meet BIPA\u2019s more  rigorous performance requirements. Uncertainties regarding BIPA  regulations and funding further complicate the challenge the appeals  bodies face in implementing BIPA and meeting its requirements.  Moreover, the transfer of OHA\u2019s Medicare appeals work from SSA to HHS  involves major challenges, and until all of the stakeholders resolve  workload and timeliness issues, the full impact of such a transfer will not  be known.", "CMS, its carriers, OHA, and the MAC have traditionally not coordinated  their management of the appeals process. Instead, each has operated as  though the process consisted of discrete and independent segments.  Greater coordination could enable them to resolve the barriers that  currently preclude successful management of the appeals process as a  whole. Inefficiencies in file transfer and case file tracking, developing  comprehensive and meaningful data, and planning for BIPA  implementation require a joint effort including each appeals body and its  agency. The lack of a single entity that sets priorities and addresses  operational problems at all four levels of the process makes it imperative  that all bodies work closely together. If OHA\u2019s Medicare appeals workload  is to be transferred to HHS, it is critical that all of the current appeals  bodies work together to develop a carefully planned transition and build  efficiencies to help HHS assume the workload. We believe that the  creation of a Medicare appeals process that can consistently address  BIPA\u2019s requirements will require a commitment for close coordination  from all appeals bodies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of HHS and the Commissioner of SSA  create an interagency steering committee with representatives from CMS,  the carriers, OHA, and the MAC to serve as an advisory body to the  Secretary of HHS and the Commissioner of SSA with the following  responsibilities:  make administrative processes, such as file tracking and transfer,  compatible across all appeals bodies;  negotiate responsibilities and strategies for reducing the backlog of  pending cases, especially at OHA and the MAC, and establish the priority  for adjudicating pre-BIPA cases relative to BIPA-governed cases; and  establish requirements for reporting specific and comparable program and  performance data to CMS, SSA, and HHS so that management can identify opportunities for improvement, and determine the resource requirements  necessary to ensure that all appeals bodies will be able to meet BIPA\u2019s  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and SSA and received written  comments from both agencies.

We have  reprinted HHS\u2019s and SSA\u2019s letters in appendixes IV and V, respectively.", "HHS agreed with our conclusion that a more coordinated approach to the  appeals process is needed. HHS said, however, that we understated its  progress in this area and described a variety of efforts it has engaged in to facilitate improved coordination between the appeals bodies. As we noted  in the draft report, HHS has made strides in enhancing coordination, but  we believe that greater progress can be made by creating an interagency steering committee to develop a consolidated and strategic approach to  implementing BIPA.", "SSA\u2019s comments also emphasized the benefits of enhanced coordination  between the appeals bodies. It largely attributed the inefficiencies that  exist in the current appeals process to the lack of a single entity with  ownership of, and accountability for, Medicare appeals. SSA indicated that  it believes that HHS is the sole entity with the authority to unify the  policies and procedures for the Medicare appeals process.", "HHS stated that it would consider the appropriateness of an interagency  steering committee but did not specifically agree or disagree with our  recommendation to create such a body. However, it stated that the  transfer of the work performed by SSA\u2019s OHA to HHS is critical to  achieving the level of coordination needed to address the inefficiencies  outlined in our report. SSA indicated that it generally agreed with the  specific responsibilities of the steering committee. It also stated that it  believes that HHS has ultimate responsibility for Medicare appeals and  that HHS should carry out the functions of the steering committee through  CMS. SSA stated that its budget anticipates the transfer of OHA\u2019s appeals  workload to HHS, and SSA has submitted a new MOU to HHS to facilitate  a smooth transition. While SSA emphasized its commitment to serving  Medicare appellants during the expected transition, it also pointed out that  Medicare appeals make up a small portion of its work. Therefore, SSA  cautioned that while it will participate in efforts to improve the Medicare  appeals process, it must consider the demands of its total workload in  allocating its resources.", "While HHS did not specifically comment on our recommendation to make  administrative processes, such as file tracking and transfer, compatible  across all levels of appeal, SSA agreed that an interagency steering  committee could be beneficial in ensuring such compatibility among  appeals bodies. SSA also noted that the steering committee would be  helpful in defining the roles of the appeals bodies both in their current  operating status and during the anticipated transfer of the OHA workload  to HHS.", "Regarding our recommendation to negotiate responsibilities for reducing  the backlog of pending cases, HHS agreed that a strategy for setting clear  requirements to prioritize pre-BIPA and BIPA cases and reduce the  backlog of cases at all levels is needed. HHS also reported that the MAC  has already reduced its backlog and we revised the report to reflect the  reduction. HHS also said that prioritizing cases and other transition  matters would be addressed in the forthcoming final regulations.

To that end, HHS noted that it has  issued a request for proposals to develop the data system required by  BIPA. SSA acknowledged that fragmentation of the appeals process has  precluded the development of comparable data.

Many claims are rejected because they  are missing information or are duplicates of claims previously processed  and paid or denied. In fiscal year 2001, carriers rejected over 19.5 million  claims that were missing information and more than 40 million claims that  they considered duplicate. Duplicate claims may be submitted for several  reasons. For example, inconsistent regulations may confuse providers  causing them to resubmit denied Part B claims\u2014even though Medicare  rules do not allow this\u2014because Medicare allows denied Part A claims to  be resubmitted for payment. Also, turnover in administrative and billing  personnel at providers\u2019 offices may result in confusion about whether a  claim was previously submitted, and under what circumstances a claim  can be resubmitted for payment. According to officials from the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS), carrier error also contributes to  the rate of duplicate submissions because some carriers have system  limitations that do not always recognize appropriate claims. For example,  if a claim is submitted that appropriately includes the performance of the  same service to two separate limbs, the two distinct services may be  construed as duplicate claims by some carrier systems.", "Claims are denied if they do not meet the requirements in Medicare  statutes, federal regulations, or CMS\u2019s national coverage determinations.

Although CMS has established the  categories for data submission shown in table 1, it has not provided strict  definitions of these categories for carriers to follow. Instead, each carrier  has developed its own unique set of definitions for each category. As a  result, these data do not provide a precise or reliable explanation of the  reasons for denial.
