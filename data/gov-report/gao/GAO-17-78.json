However, there is no specific legal requirement to verify the events that trigger a Special Enrollment Period (SEP), which is an opportunity period to allow an individual to apply for health coverage after events such as losing minimum essential coverage or getting married. Prior to the start of GAO's enrollment tests, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which maintains the federal Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace), implemented a policy to request that federal Marketplace applicants provide supporting documentation for certain SEP triggering events. According to CMS, ensuring that only qualified applicants enroll during an SEP is intended to prevent people from misusing the system to enroll in coverage only when they become sick. However, relying on self-attestation without verifying documents submitted to support an SEP triggering event, such as those mentioned above, could allow actual applicants to obtain subsidized coverage they would otherwise not qualify for.", "The federal and selected state-based marketplaces approved health-insurance coverage and subsidies for 9 of 12 of GAO's fictitious applications made during a 2016 SEP. The remaining 3 fictitious applicants were denied. The marketplaces instructed 6 of 12 applicants to provide supporting documentation, such as a copy of a recent marriage certificate, related to the SEP triggering event; the remaining 6 of 12 were not instructed to do so. For 5 applicants, GAO provided no documents to support the SEP triggering event, but coverage was approved anyway. Officials from the marketplaces explained that they do not require applicants to submit documentation to support certain SEP triggering events. For other SEP triggering events, CMS officials explained that the standard operating procedure in the federal Marketplace is to enroll applicants first, and verify documentation to support the SEP triggering event after enrollment.

In formal comments on a draft of the February report, HHS concurred with the recommendations and outlined a number of steps it planned to take to implement them. In an April 2016 follow-up letter to GAO, HHS described a number of specific actions it had taken in response to the eight recommendations, such as creating an integrated project team to perform the Marketplace fraud-risk assessment. As of November 2016, GAO considers all eight recommendations to be still open, pending corroborating information, and will continue to monitor CMS's progress in implementing them.

While subsidies under the act are generally  not paid directly to enrollees, participants nevertheless benefit financially  through reduced monthly premiums or lower costs due at time of service,  such as copayments. Because subsidy costs are contingent on eligibility  for coverage, enrollment controls that help ensure only qualified  applicants are approved for coverage with subsidies are a key factor in  determining federal expenditures under the act.", "Under PPACA, states may elect to operate their own health-care  marketplaces, or may rely on the federally facilitated marketplace, or  Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace), often known to the public as  HealthCare.gov.

In this regard, we did  not evaluate the cost of authenticating such documents as part of our  work because it was outside the scope of our review.", "In its written comments, the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority  described its policies and processes for verifying SEP eligibility by relying  on self-attestation or reviewing information provided by consumers and  others. Additionally, in its written comments, the DC Health Benefit  Exchange Authority also raised concerns about our methodology. First,  the agency stated that the DC marketplace is too different from other  marketplaces to be an informative part of our review. Specifically, the  comments state that the age of individuals enrolled in health insurance  coverage in the DC marketplace \u2013 and enrolled through SEPs in  particular \u2013 suggests that there is no evidence that consumers are waiting  to get sick before enrolling in coverage. We did not evaluate the DC  marketplace\u2019s data on its population of enrollees and did not evaluate the  DC marketplace\u2019s conclusion that the age of its enrollee population shows  that there is no systemic abuse of SEPs. Rather, our work focused on  testing whether our fictitious applicants could obtain and maintain health  coverage during an SEP by submitting fictitious documents or no  documents to support our SEP triggering event. The DC marketplace is  similar to the federal Marketplace and the other state-based marketplace  we selected in that it relies on self-attestation to verify certain SEP  events.", "The written comments from the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority  also expressed concern that the results of our testing are not useful to  help improve the agency\u2019s processes because we did not provide specific  details of our undercover testing scenarios to the states included in our  review. As we noted in our meetings with HHS and both of the state  agencies included in our review, we did not provide certain details on our  undercover testing scenarios to maintain the integrity of our undercover  tests. Specifically, we did not provide details about our undercover tests  that could risk inappropriately revealing the identities of our fictitious  applicants and preclude the use of such identities in any future reviews.   However, we did provide HHS and both of the state agencies with details  of the scenarios, including the type of application submitted; the type of  documentation we submitted; and the interaction with the marketplace  representatives, among other things. Providing additional, specific details  about our fictitious identities would not help the agency address any  systemic vulnerabilities stemming from their reliance on self-attestation to  verify eligibility for an SEP.", "Further, the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority commented that our  undercover tests are unrealistic because we produced fictitious  documents to support our SEP events; that lying under penalty of perjury  is a unique ability of our undercover investigators; and that our work  assumes a significant number of individuals perjure themselves to access  federal funds. These statements represent a misunderstanding of our  methodology. First, as stated in our report, we used publicly available  hardware, software, and materials to produce the counterfeit documents  that we submitted for our testing. Using these same tools, potential  fraudsters may realistically produce similarly counterfeit documents to  support an SEP triggering event. Second, potential fraudsters have the  ability\u2014and very possibly the inclination\u2014to lie under penalty of perjury to  perpetrate their illegal schemes. Finally, our report makes no statements  or assumptions about the number of individuals who perjure themselves  to access federal funds. Rather, our report focuses on the results of our  undercover testing of enrollment verification for 12 fictitious applications  for subsidized health-insurance coverage during an SEP in 2016 to  identify potential vulnerabilities in enrollment-verification controls. As  mentioned above, prudent stewardship and good management practices  suggest that fraud risks be understood and managed to protect public  funds.", "The DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority\u2019s written comments  additionally stated that relying on self-attestation is a well-accepted  practice in the federal government. The DC Health Benefit Exchange  Authority also suggested that any requirement for marketplaces to  authenticate documents provided by applicants for an SEP should  consider the burden on both the marketplace and consumers. In this  regard, we did not evaluate the cost of authenticating such documents as  part of our work because it was outside the scope of our review. Further,  while federal agencies may rely on self-attestation for certain aspects of  their programs, such as those noted in the DC Health Benefit Exchange  Authority\u2019s written comments, federal agencies also take steps to verify  information needed to determine eligibility for programs and benefits. For  example, in compliance with the requirements of PPACA and CMS  regulations, the federal and state-based marketplaces (including DC  Health Link) verify information on applicant citizenship, nationality, or  legal presence status by matching applicant data with data from federal  agencies rather than relying on self-attestation for this information.  Additionally, our prior work has found that relying on self-reported  information can leave agencies vulnerable to fraud in some programs.  Thus, it would be misleading to characterize reliance on self-attestation  for conducting program integrity activities as a generally well-accepted  practice in the federal government.", "Finally, the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority\u2019s written comments  stated that its approach to verifying SEP events is consistent with the best  practices in our fraud risk framework. For example, the DC Health Benefit  Exchange Authority stated that it has reviewed the characteristics of the  DC marketplace, consistent with the principles of our fraud risk  framework, and assessed risk to develop appropriate verification  procedures. However, we did not review, and are thus not able to  corroborate, the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority\u2019s claim that its  enrollment verification controls are consistent with our fraud risk  framework.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

This report describes results of undercover attempts  to obtain subsidized qualified health-plan coverage outside the open  enrollment period for 2016; that is, during an SEP. To perform our  undercover testing and describe the results of our undercover attempts to  obtain new coverage during an SEP, we used 12 fictitious identities for  the purpose of making applications to obtain subsidized qualified health- plan coverage offered through a marketplace by telephone and online.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires  marketplaces to verify application information to determine eligibility for  enrollment and, if applicable, determine eligibility for the income-based  subsidies or Medicaid. These verification steps include validating an  applicant\u2019s Social Security number, if one is provided; verifying  citizenship, U.S. nationality, or lawful presence in the United States; and  verifying household income. The 12 identities were designed to pass  these verification steps by providing supporting documentation\u2014albeit  fictitious\u2014such as a copy of the Social Security card, driver\u2019s license, and  proof of income.", "We selected states within the federal Health Insurance Marketplace  (Marketplace) and state-based marketplaces for our undercover  applications, based on factors including state population, percentage of  state\u2019s population without health insurance, whether the state was  selected for testing as part of our prior work, whether the state  participates in the state-based marketplace or federal marketplace, and  whether the states make the eligibility determination or assessment for  other health-coverage programs, including Medicaid. Specifically, we  selected two states\u2014Virginia and Florida\u2014that elected to use the federal  marketplace rather than operate a marketplace of their own. We also  selected two state-based marketplaces\u2014Covered California (California)  and DC Health Link (District of Columbia).", "The results obtained using our limited number of fictional applicants are  illustrative and represent our experience with applications in the federal  and state marketplaces we selected. The results cannot, however, be  generalized to the overall population of applicants, enrollees, or  marketplaces.", "Our undercover testing included fictitious applicants claiming to have  experienced an event that would trigger eligibility to enroll in health- insurance coverage during an SEP. Specifically, our 12 fictitious  applicants claimed to have experienced one of the following selected  events that may indicate eligibility, under certain circumstances, to enroll  in health coverage under an SEP: (1) loss of minimum essential health  coverage; (2) gained access to new qualified health plans as a result of a  permanent move to another state; (3) gained a dependent through  marriage; (4) experienced an exceptional circumstance, such as a serious  medical condition that prevented the consumer from enrolling during the  annual open enrollment period; (5) nonenrollment during the annual open  enrollment period was unintentional and the result of misinformation or  misrepresentation by a non-exchange entity providing enrollment  assistance or conducting enrollment activities; and (6) Medicaid  application filed during the annual open enrollment period was denied  after the open enrollment period had closed. We tested the six selected  triggering events in the federal marketplace. We also tested the six  selected triggering events in the two selected state-based marketplaces.  We submitted three applications in each state and the District of  Columbia.", "We selected these six SEP triggering events to create a balance between  three events that are subject to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) Special Enrollment Confirmation Process and three  events that are not subject to this process. In February 2016, CMS  announced plans to begin requesting supporting documentation to verify  certain events that would trigger an SEP. CMS announced that it would  begin requesting supporting documentation from consumers who enroll or  change plans using an SEP for selected triggering events on June 17,  2016. We started our testing after June 17, 2016. State-based  marketplaces are not required to follow CMS\u2019s Special Enrollment  Confirmation Process, but states may choose to follow this guidance or  establish their own processes, according to CMS officials.", "We made 6 of our applications online initially, and 6 by phone; however,  for all our fictitious applicant scenarios, we sought to act as an ordinary  consumer would in attempting to make a successful application. For  example, if, during online applications, we were directed to make phone  calls to complete the process or mail or fax the application, we acted as  instructed. We also self-attested that the information provided in the  application was true when instructed. In these tests, we also stated  income at a level eligible to obtain both types of income-based subsidies  available under PPACA\u2014a premium tax credit, to be paid in advance,  and cost-sharing reduction (CSR).", "As appropriate, in our applications for coverage and subsidies, we used  publicly available information to construct our scenarios. We also used  publicly available hardware, software, and material to produce counterfeit  documents, which we submitted, as appropriate for our testing, when  instructed to do so. We designed the 12 fictitious applications to provide  either no documentation or fictitious documentation related to the SEP  triggering event. We used professional judgement to determine what  type of documentation we would submit related to the SEP triggering  event. For example, for a marriage scenario, we did not provide a  marriage certificate or any documentation including the fictitious spouse\u2019s  Social Security number. We did need to submit documentation related to  the fictitious applicant\u2019s income in the form of a self-employment ledger  and avoided providing information supporting a fictitious spouse. In  another example, we had to submit proof of identity to pass the general  eligibility requirements for a scenario in which we claimed the applicant  permanently moved to another state within the past 60 days. Thus, to  avoid submitting documentation related to the SEP triggering event, we  submitted a driver\u2019s license, but we ensured it was from the original state  and the issuance date was back-dated several years. We did not provide  any documentation to support our permanent move to the new state. We  did, however, self-attest to the permanent move. We then observed the  outcomes of the document submissions, such as any approvals received  or requests received to provide additional supporting documentation. For  the applications that we were denied, we did not proceed with the appeals  process.", "We conducted our performance audit from May 2016 to November 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
