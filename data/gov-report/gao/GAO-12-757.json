Mobile  devices often lack passwords to authenticate users and control  access to data stored on the devices. Many devices have the  technical capability to support passwords, personal identification  numbers (PIN), or pattern screen locks for authentication. Some  mobile devices also include a biometric reader to scan a fingerprint for  authentication. However, anecdotal information indicates that  consumers seldom employ these mechanisms. Additionally, if users  do use a password or PIN they often choose passwords or PINs that  can be easily determined or bypassed, such as 1234 or 0000. Without  passwords or PINs to lock the device, there is increased risk that  stolen or lost phones\u2019 information could be accessed by unauthorized  users who could view sensitive information and misuse mobile  devices.", "Two-factor authentication is not always used when conducting  sensitive transactions on mobile devices. According to studies,  consumers generally use static passwords instead of two-factor  authentication when conducting online sensitive transactions while  using mobile devices. Using static passwords for authentication has  security drawbacks: passwords can be guessed, forgotten, written  down and stolen, or eavesdropped. Two-factor authentication  generally provides a higher level of security than traditional passwords  and PINs, and this higher level may be important for sensitive  transactions. Two-factor refers to an authentication system in which  users are required to authenticate using at least two different  \u201cfactors\u201d\u2014something you know, something you have, or something  you are\u2014before being granted access. Mobile devices themselves  can be used as a second factor in some two-factor authentication  schemes. The mobile device can generate pass codes, or the codes  can be sent via a text message to the phone. Without two-factor  authentication, increased risk exists that unauthorized users could  gain access to sensitive information and misuse mobile devices.", "Wireless transmissions are not always encrypted. Information  such as e-mails sent by a mobile device is usually not encrypted while  in transit. In addition, many applications do not encrypt the data they  transmit and receive over the network, making it easy for the data to  be intercepted. For example, if an application is transmitting data over  an unencrypted WiFi network using hypertext transfer protocol (http)  (rather than secure http), the data can be easily intercepted. When a  wireless transmission is not encrypted, data can be easily intercepted  by eavesdroppers, who may gain unauthorized access to sensitive  information.", "Mobile devices may contain malware. Consumers may download  applications that contain malware. Consumers download malware  unknowingly because it can be disguised as a game, security patch,  utility, or other useful application. It is difficult for users to tell the  difference between a legitimate application and one containing  malware. For example, figure 3 shows how an application could be  repackaged with malware and a consumer could inadvertently  download it onto a mobile device.", "Mobile devices often do not use security software. Many mobile  devices do not come preinstalled with security software to protect  against malicious applications, spyware, and malware-based attacks.  Further, users do not always install security software, in part because  mobile devices often do not come preloaded with such software.  While such software may slow operations and affect battery life on  some mobile devices, without it, the risk may be increased that an  attacker could successfully distribute malware such as viruses,  Trojans, spyware, and spam, to lure users into revealing passwords or  other confidential information.", "Operating systems may be out-of-date. Security patches or fixes  for mobile devices\u2019 operating systems are not always installed on  mobile devices in a timely manner. It can take weeks to months  before security updates are provided to consumers\u2019 devices.  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, the patching process  may be complex and involve many parties. For example, Google  develops updates to fix security vulnerabilities in the Android OS, but  it is up to device manufacturers to produce a device-specific update  incorporating the vulnerability fix, which can take time if there are  proprietary modifications to the device\u2019s software. Once a  manufacturer produces an update, it is up to each carrier to test it and  transmit the updates to consumers\u2019 devices. However, carriers can be  delayed in providing the updates because they need time to test  whether they interfere with other aspects of the device or the software  installed on it.", "In addition, mobile devices that are older than 2 years may not receive  security updates because manufacturers may no longer support these  devices. Many manufacturers stop supporting smartphones as soon  as 12 to 18 months after their release. Such devices may face  increased risk if manufacturers do not develop patches for newly  discovered vulnerabilities.", "Software on mobile devices may be out-of-date. Security patches  for third-party applications are not always developed and released in a  timely manner. In addition, mobile third-party applications, including  web browsers, do not always notify consumers when updates are  available. Unlike traditional web browsers, mobile browsers rarely get  updates. Using outdated software increases the risk that an attacker  may exploit vulnerabilities associated with these devices.", "Mobile devices often do not limit Internet connections. Many  mobile devices do not have firewalls to limit connections. When the  device is connected to a wide area network it uses communications  ports to connect with other devices and the Internet. These ports are  similar to doorways to the device. A hacker could access the mobile  device through a port that is not secured. A firewall secures these ports  and allows the user to choose what connections he or she wants to  allow into the mobile device. The firewall intercepts both incoming and  outgoing connection attempts and blocks or permits them based on a  list of rules. Without a firewall, the mobile device may be open to  intrusion through an unsecured communications port, and an intruder  may be able to obtain sensitive information on the device and misuse it.", "Mobile devices may have unauthorized modifications. The  process of modifying a mobile device to remove its limitations so  consumers can add additional features (known as \u201cjailbreaking\u201d or  \u201crooting\u201d) changes how security for the device is managed and could  increase security risks. Jailbreaking allows users to gain access to the  operating system of a device so as to permit the installation of  unauthorized software functions and applications and/or to not be tied  to a particular wireless carrier. While some users may jailbreak or root  their mobile devices specifically to install security enhancements such  as firewalls, others may simply be looking for a less expensive or  easier way to install desirable applications. In the latter case, users  face increased security risks, because they are bypassing the  application vetting process established by the manufacturer and thus  have less protection against inadvertently installing malware. Further,  jailbroken devices may not receive notifications of security updates  from the manufacturer and may require extra effort from the user to  maintain up-to-date software.", "Communication channels may be poorly secured. Having  communication channels, such as Bluetooth communications, \u201copen\u201d  or in \u201cdiscovery\u201d mode (which allows the device to be seen by other  Bluetooth-enabled devices so that connections can be made) could  allow an attacker to install malware through that connection, or  surreptitiously activate a microphone or camera to eavesdrop on the  user.

In March 2011, CSRIC released its report  recommending that wireless carriers and device manufacturers consider  adopting practices such as: working closely and regularly with customers to provide  recommendations concerning existing default settings and to identify  future default settings that may introduce vulnerabilities; employing fraud detection systems to detect customer calling  anomalies (e.g., system access from a single user from widely  dispersed geographic areas); having processes in place to ensure that all third-party software has  been properly patched with the latest security patches and that the  system works correctly with those patches installed; establishing application support for cryptography that is based on  open and widely reviewed and implemented encryption algorithms  and protocols; and enforcing strong passwords for mobile device access and network  access.", "In addition, in March 2012 FCC tasked CSRIC with examining three major  cybersecurity threats to networks that allow cyber criminals to access  Internet traffic for theft of personal information and intellectual property. In  response, CSRIC recommended that wireless carriers (1) use key  practices when mitigating botnet threats, (2) use best practices for  deploying and managing Domain Name System Security Extensions,    and (3) develop an industry framework to prevent Internet route hijacking  via security weaknesses in the Border Gateway Protocol.working with the wireless carriers to implement these recommendations  and is tasked with developing ways to measure the effectiveness of the  recommendations.", "FCC also tasked the Technological Advisory Council\u2019s Wireless Security  and Privacy working group to examine mobile security issues, such as  vulnerabilities of WiFi networks, security of older generation cellular  networks, malicious applications, and text messaging security. The  working group is scheduled to issue its recommendations in December  2012.", "Moreover, in April 2012, FCC announced that it had reached agreement  with the CTIA-the Wireless Association, and multiple wireless carriers to  establish processes to deter theft of mobile devices. Under the antitheft  agreement, participating wireless carriers are to take several specific  actions and submit quarterly progress reports to FCC. For example, the  antitheft agreement calls for wireless carriers to initiate, implement, and  deploy database solutions by October 31, 2012, to prevent reportedly lost  or stolen smartphones from being used on another wireless network. The  FCC plans to monitor progress in developing these databases and CTIA  agreed to report progress quarterly, beginning June 30, 2012. The  agreement also will result in the launch of a public education campaign by  July 1, 2012, to inform consumers about the ability to lock or locate and  erase data from a smartphone.", "In addition, wireless carriers and device manufacturers reported that they  participate in private-sector standards-setting organizations, which have  addressed aspects of mobile security. For example, the Open Mobile  Alliance, an industry standards group, has developed a specification to  provide a common means for mobile developers to implement standards  for secure and reliable data transport between two communicating  parties. Furthermore, a consortium of wireless carriers and mobile device  manufacturers known as the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse  Working Group has an initiative underway to address text-message-based spam. Under this initiative, wireless carriers encourage customers  to forward spam text messages back to the carriers, who can use the  messages to identify the source of spam and take corrective action to  block its content from their networks. According to FCC officials, the  current chairman of the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse  Working Group is a member of CSRIC and the chair of the working group  that developed recommended solutions for the botnet threats.", "While private and public sector entities have initiated activities to identify  mobile security safeguards, these safeguards are not always available on  mobile devices or activated by users. According to a 2012 study by NQ  Mobile and the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), approximately  30 percent of respondents said they did not have mobile security  features on their smartphones. In addition, approximately 66 percent of  respondents did not report that they activated password protection on  their devices to prevent unauthorized access and that at least 67 percent  did not report activating a remote-wipe or remote-locate security feature.  Security company representatives told us that these results were  generally consistent with their experiences and observations.", "In addition, mobile device manufacturers and wireless carriers do not  consistently implement or activate security safeguards on their mobile  devices. According to most of the device manufacturers and several  wireless carriers we spoke with, safeguards such as passwords,  encryption, and remote wipe/lock/locate can be made available on their  mobile devices, although one wireless carrier noted that encryption might  be inappropriate for certain types of devices. Several of these companies  also acknowledged that it is possible to preconfigure mobile devices to  prompt the user to implement safeguards when the phone is first set up.  However, with the exception of password protection for online voicemail  accounts, none of the device manufacturers or wireless carriers stated  that they generally configure their devices to prompt the user to  implement these controls. We also observed that general cybersecurity  instructions were not directly accessible from either carriers or device  manufacturers, although instructions for implementing controls could be  found by searching the company\u2019s website for information about  individual models of smartphones.", "FCC has the ability to encourage broad implementation of mobile security  safeguards among mobile industry companies. While it has taken steps to  encourage implementation of safeguards in certain areas, it has not yet  taken similar steps to encourage industry implementation of a broad  baseline of mobile security safeguards. For example, in its recent antitheft  agreement with CTIA, and participating wireless carriers, FCC took an  active role in encouraging major wireless carriers to adopt specific  procedures to discourage the theft of mobile devices. This effort  demonstrates that FCC can facilitate private sector efforts to establish an  industry baseline and milestones for addressing mobile security  challenges. Moreover, representatives from multiple companies agreed  that FCC could play a role in coordinating private sector efforts to improve  mobile security.", "FCC has also facilitated private sector efforts to establish cybersecurity  best practices in areas not specific to mobile security. As mentioned  previously, FCC tasked CSRIC to review best practices for botnet threats,  Domain Name System attacks, and Internet route hijacking. CSRIC  developed voluntary recommendations in these areas and has been  working with wireless carriers to implement them. According to FCC  officials, wireless carriers representing 90 percent of the domestic  customer base have committed to adopting and using these practices.  Although these recommendations are not specific to mobile devices, FCC  officials stated that the process of seeking voluntary compliance from  carriers had been successful and demonstrated the willingness of carriers  to adopt best practices.", "FCC officials stated that they hope to have the same cooperation from  wireless carriers when the Technological Advisory Council\u2019s Wireless  Security and Privacy working group releases its recommendations on  mobile security issues, scheduled for December 2012. While it is not clear  that the working group will develop a baseline of recommended practices  for implementation by mobile industry companies, the council\u2019s  recommendations nevertheless could be part of such a baseline.", "Another candidate for a set of baseline mobile security standards that  mobile industry companies could be encouraged to implement is the  collection of cybersecurity best practices developed by CSRIC in 2011.  Those practices have not yet been adopted as a baseline within the  mobile industry. FCC officials from the Public Safety and Homeland  Security Bureau stated that they had not yet taken action to promote this  specific set of recommended practices, although they had held informal  meetings with industry to discuss the implementation of cybersecurity  practices. Whether mobile industry companies adopt the CSRIC- recommended practices or choose other baseline practices and controls,  it will be important for FCC to encourage industry to adopt recommended  practices.

Their views  are consistent with the results of the 2012 NCSA study, which suggested  that many mobile users do not know how to implement mobile security  safeguards. The survey reported that more than half of respondents felt  that they required additional information in order to select and/or implement  security solutions for their mobile devices.
