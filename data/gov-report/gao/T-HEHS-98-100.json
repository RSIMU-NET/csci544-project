TRICARE represents a redesign of DOD\u2019s $15.5 billion health care system and is being implemented to improve beneficiaries\u2019 access to health care while maintaining quality and controlling costs in a time of military downsizing and budgetary concerns.

It was envisioned as a way to maintain beneficiary access to high-quality care while containing costs. Designing and implementing TRICARE to achieve these objectives, however, has proven to be a complex and difficult undertaking involving many stakeholders, including the Congress, the individual services and their many facilities and contractors, and the more than 8 million beneficiaries of the military health care system. DOD has taken steps to improve the program as it has evolved, but much remains to be done before TRICARE becomes the smooth-running and beneficiary-friendly endeavor envisioned by its developers.

Also, as an employer, DOD offers health care services to 6.6 million non-active duty beneficiaries, including active duty members\u2019 dependents and military retirees and their dependents. Most care is provided in 115 hospitals and 471 clinics\u2014called military treatment facilities (MTF)\u2014operated by the Army, Navy, and Air Force worldwide. This direct delivery system is supplemented by DOD-funded care provided in civilian facilities. In fiscal year 1997, DOD spent about $12 billion for direct care and about $3.5 billion for civilian care.", "In response to such challenges as increasing health care costs and uneven beneficiary access to care, in the late 1980s DOD initiated a series of congressionally directed demonstration programs to evaluate alternatives to its existing health care delivery approaches. Drawing from its experience with the demonstration projects, DOD then designed TRICARE as its managed care health program. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs sets TRICARE policy and has overall responsibility for the program. The Army, Navy, and Air Force Surgeons General have authority over the MTFs in their respective services.", "TRICARE is designed to give beneficiaries a choice of three benefit options. These are TRICARE Prime, the health maintenance organization (HMO) option; TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service benefit replacing the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) program; and TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider option. do not pay an enrollment fee; retirees under age 65 and their dependents and survivors pay an annual enrollment fee of $230 for an individual and $460 for a family. Copayments under Prime are lower than under the other options. TRICARE Standard provides beneficiaries with the greatest freedom in selecting civilian physicians but requires the highest beneficiary cost share. Under TRICARE Extra, beneficiaries do not enroll or pay annual premiums but, by using physicians in the TRICARE network, are charged copayments that are 5 percent less than under TRICARE Standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TRICARE Implementation Falling Short of DOD\u2019s Expectations", "paragraphs": ["In restructuring its health care program, DOD designed a program that has proven difficult to implement. More than 4 years after initiating TRICARE, DOD is now 1 year behind its schedule for fully implementing the nationwide program, and that schedule may slip further. As DOD implements TRICARE, it is also continuing to make significant changes to the program\u2019s design. While these changes are aimed at improving TRICARE and addressing problems we and others have identified, they also create new implementation challenges. Moreover, DOD\u2019s progress in implementing TRICARE has been hampered by enrollment shortfalls and administrative problems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recurring Contract Award Problems", "paragraphs": ["As part of its implementation of TRICARE, DOD has awarded large, complex, competitively bid contracts to supplement and support the health care provided in MTFs. These 5-year contracts are estimated to cost a total of about $15 billion. DOD had planned to award a total of seven contracts for the 11 TRICARE regions nationwide by September 30, 1996, and health care delivery under TRICARE was expected to have begun in all regions by May 1997. (The appendix contains a map of the 11 TRICARE regions.) sustained protests if the reconsideration requests are denied, could further delay implementation of TRICARE in three regions.", "In 1995, we reported that such problems as DOD\u2019s failure to evaluate offerors\u2019 bids according to solicitation criteria led to the sustained protest of a pre-TRICARE contract award covering California and Hawaii. In response, DOD put in place such improvements as a revised methodology for evaluating bids, which it believed would reduce the chance of protests being sustained. The recent sustained protests indicate, however, that problems with bid evaluations continue. industry experts, and us, DOD is developing a more simplified procurement approach, which it will begin to use this summer as the first of the existing TRICARE contracts is recompeted.

However, as of October 1997, only about half of the eligible beneficiaries using the military health care system had enrolled in TRICARE Prime.", "DOD set targets to help ensure high enrollment in Prime. It expected, for example, that 100 percent of active duty members would enroll in Prime by the end of 1996. However, as of October 1997, only about 70 percent of active duty members had enrolled. Moreover, DOD expected that at least 90 percent of non-active duty beneficiaries targeted for enrollment would enroll in Prime within 1 year of TRICARE\u2019s implementation in each region. However, as of October 1997, in those regions where TRICARE had been implemented for at least a year, only about 57 percent of those targeted, or about 1.1 million beneficiaries, had enrolled.", "This less-than-optimal enrollment has several important implications. For example, DOD is less able to manage the utilization of health care for beneficiaries not enrolled in Prime. Under managed care, costs are contained in part through the use of primary care managers who ensure that beneficiaries receive necessary and appropriate care in the most cost-effective manner. Moreover, beneficiaries may sustain higher out-of-pocket health care costs if they choose not to enroll.", "Also, DOD is beginning to implement a new funding system\u2014 enrollment-based capitation\u2014that is designed to motivate and reward MTF commanders for maximizing their enrolled population. Under this approach, DOD will fund MTFs on the basis of the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Prime at the MTF. Previously, DOD had set per capita rates according to past levels of military spending. This new capitation method is designed to better mirror private sector managed care funding methods. Under enrollment-based capitation, MTFs will continue to receive funding for the care they provide to nonenrollees, but at a lower rate than for those enrolled.", "We have identified a number of reasons why beneficiaries may not be enrolling in Prime. Beneficiaries who are accustomed to receiving care in MTFs may not see the need to enroll. Retirees under 65 years of age and their dependents, who must pay an annual enrollment fee, may opt not to enroll for that reason. In addition, Prime is not available in all areas of the country\u2014for example, in areas where there is no MTF and no civilian provider network. Also, some beneficiaries may choose to continue receiving care under TRICARE\u2019s traditional fee-for-service option.", "DOD asserts that it can provide care more cost-effectively in its MTFs than through civilian providers, and for that reason, TRICARE was designed to maximize the use of the MTFs before relying on civilian care. However, although enrollment capacity still exists in MTFs, beneficiaries are being allowed to enroll in civilian facilities that are near MTFs.", "As of late last year, about 74 percent of MTFs\u2019 primary care capacity had been assigned to Prime enrollees.

However, this report card applies only to MTFs and does not include care provided through civilian contractors\u2014an estimated one-third of DOD\u2019s peacetime health care delivery efforts. Under its managed care support contracts, DOD does set performance-related requirements, and contractors report to DOD their performance in meeting these requirements. However, this information is not yet compiled or consolidated with military facility data to provide a programwide picture. beneficiary satisfaction levels, on average, exceed those in civilian HMOs. However, DOD survey officials told us it is too soon to use the surveys\u2019 results to assess TRICARE because the program is new and not yet implemented nationwide. Also, they said the results from surveys conducted to date constitute an insufficient basis from which to identify trends.", "Although important, beneficiaries\u2019 perceptions do not totally measure DOD\u2019s actual performance. To supplement beneficiary satisfaction information on access to care, we recommended in 1996 that DOD collect data on the timeliness of appointments. While DOD agreed with our recommendation, it has yet to fully implement this data collection effort. Moreover, the beneficiary satisfaction information DOD uses in its report card to measure access is based on monthly surveys of patients receiving outpatient care. Relying on the outpatient survey provides limited information on access and may mask the extent of difficulty beneficiaries face since it only collects information from those patients who were able to obtain care at a military facility.", "As required by the Congress, DOD has contracted for independent evaluations of TRICARE\u2019s progress in improving access, maintaining quality, and controlling costs.

However, there are reasons now to question how current and analytically complete DOD\u2019s savings claims are.", "An important cost-saving feature of DOD\u2019s partnership between military and civilian health care entities under TRICARE is resource sharing. To share resources, the contractor supplements the capacity of a military hospital or clinic by providing civilian personnel, equipment, or supplies. DOD had estimated that resource sharing could save about $700 million over 5 years. We reported last summer, however, that DOD and the contractors had made agreements likely to save about 5 percent of DOD\u2019s overall resource sharing goal. At that rate, after 9 to 24 months of operation, DOD could have expected to realize only about $36 million.", "DOD\u2019s plans to undertake a more current and complete cost analysis of MTF direct and contractor-provided care to determine TRICARE\u2019s cost-effectiveness.
