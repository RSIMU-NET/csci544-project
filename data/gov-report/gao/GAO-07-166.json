GAO's analysis of available data indicates that, when completed, the cleanup for the four prior BRAC rounds is expected to cost about $13.2 billion and additional costs will be needed for BRAC 2005 property. These costs reduce BRAC savings, especially in the short term. Because of broad congressional interest in BRAC, GAO prepared this report under the Comptroller General's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative. GAO's objectives were to examine costs to clean up 2005 BRAC properties, progress in transferring prior BRAC rounds properties to other users, and opportunities to expedite cleanups and transfers. To address these issues, GAO analyzed cleanup cost estimates, interviewed environmental officials and visited seven bases."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While expected environmental cleanup costs for unneeded property arising from the 2005 BRAC round are not yet fully known, Department of Defense (DOD) data indicate that about $950 million will be needed to clean up these bases, adding to the estimated $13.2 billion total cleanup cost for the prior rounds. Although DOD's cleanup program has matured compared to prior BRAC rounds, there are still many unknowns and the cleanup estimate for the 2005 round should be considered preliminary. In fact, environmental cleanup costs are likely to increase as more intensive environmental investigations are undertaken, additional hazardous conditions are discovered, and future reuse plans are finalized. Furthermore, Congress does not have full visibility over the total cost of DOD's BRAC cleanup efforts because none of the four reports DOD prepares on various aspects of environmental cleanup present all types of costs--past and future--to complete cleanup at each base. Compiling a complete picture of all costs requires extracting information from multiple reports, as GAO has done to estimate the total cleanup cost for the four prior BRAC rounds. More complete and transparent cost information would assist Congress in conducting its oversight responsibilities for this multibillion dollar effort. While GAO's analysis shows that DOD continues to make progress in transferring over 502,500 acres of unneeded property from the four prior BRAC rounds--78 percent of the acres have now been transferred compared to 72 percent 2 years ago--over 112,300 acres remain untransferred. Comparatively, a total of about 102,000 acres are potentially transferable as a result of the 2005 BRAC round. Impediments to transfer continue to be related primarily to a variety of interrelated environmental cleanup issues, including limited technology to address unexploded ordnance and prolonged negotiations on compliance with environmental regulations. Opportunities exist to expedite the cleanup and transfer of unneeded 2005 BRAC properties compared with other BRAC rounds. Congress provided DOD with a wide range of property transfer authorities for prior BRAC rounds. In the past DOD did not use some tools as much as others out of deference to community land reuse plans. For example, low- and no-cost transfer tools accounted for 65 percent of all acres transferred, whereas public and negotiated sales accounted for 5 percent. DOD's March 2006 guidance now encourages the services to make full use of all tools for transferring properties resulting from both the 2005 and prior-year BRAC rounds. The services have processes in place to monitor their progress to clean up and transfer BRAC properties, but they are not required to report periodically to the Office of the Secretary of Defense on their successes and challenges in using various transfer authorities. Collectively, such lessons learned could help others expedite the cleanup and transfer of unneeded properties by maximizing the use of all available tools, thereby accelerating the economic benefits of property reuse to communities while also saving the ongoing caretaker costs being incurred by DOD for unneeded properties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The cleanup of environmental contaminants, such as hazardous chemicals  or unexploded ordnance (UXO), found on bases closed under the base  realignment and closure (BRAC) process has historically been a key  impediment to the expeditious transfer of unneeded property to other  federal and nonfederal parties who can put the property to new uses.  While the Department of Defense (DOD) is obligated to ensure that former  base property is cleaned up to a level that is protective of human health  and the environment, the cleanup process can delay redevelopment in  neighboring communities adversely impacted by the BRAC process. Our  analysis of DOD data indicates that the estimated total cost to clean up  environmental contaminants found on installations affected by the four  prior BRAC rounds is approximately $13.2 billion, and while most of this  cost has already been incurred, the cleanup process is expected to  continue for many years at some closure sites. Environmental cleanup of  unneeded property arising from the 2005 BRAC round closures will add  additional costs. Cleanup costs, combined with additional caretaker costs  DOD continues to incur for untransferred properties, cause some offset to  projected net savings from BRAC with the greatest impact occurring in the  short term.", "This report is one in a series of reports we have issued on DOD  environmental cleanup liabilities and property transfer issues that relate to  the BRAC process. (See app. V for a list of key prior GAO reports.) Our  prior work showed that, as of September 30, 2004, DOD had transferred  about 72 percent of over 504,000 acres of unneeded BRAC property from  the prior rounds to other entities for reuse, but about 140,000 acres of  unneeded DOD property had not been transferred at that time, primarily  because of issues related to environmental cleanup. Further, we reported  that estimated costs for environmental cleanup at sites from the prior  BRAC rounds remained within the range of prior estimates, but those  costs could increase if unknown or undetermined future cleanup  responsibilities, such as additional unexploded ordnance or other harmful  contaminants, emerged.", "Because of the broad congressional interest in the BRAC process, we  prepared this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to conduct  evaluations on his own initiative to examine (1) potential environmental  cleanup costs for 2005 BRAC properties, including an examination of how  these costs are reported for all BRAC properties; (2) DOD\u2019s progress, since  our prior work in 2005, to transfer unneeded properties from the four prior  BRAC rounds; and (3) possible opportunities for DOD to expedite the  cleanup and transfer of unneeded BRAC properties. This report is  addressed to you because of your role in the oversight of DOD\u2019s  infrastructure and BRAC implementation actions.", "To examine the potential cost to clean up unneeded properties resulting  from the 2005 BRAC round, we analyzed various DOD reports submitted to  Congress on the environmental cost of cleanups at military bases in  general, and interviewed DOD and military service officials familiar with  the environmental cleanup process at military bases for clarification of  these reports as well as the cleanup process as it affects BRAC bases. We  visited four bases identified for closure in the 2005 BRAC round that  reportedly have environmental cleanup needs\u2014Fort Monroe, Hampton,  Virginia; Umatilla Chemical Depot, Hermiston, Oregon; Brunswick Naval  Air Station, Brunswick, Maine; and the Mississippi Army Ammunition  Plant, Picayune, Mississippi. To assess DOD\u2019s progress in transferring  properties from the four prior BRAC rounds since our prior work in 2005,  we analyzed the Defense Environmental Programs Fiscal Year 2005  Annual Report to Congress and collected property transfer information  from the cognizant offices in each of the military services. Although we  found some discrepancies, we concluded that overall the DOD data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To assess opportunities  for DOD to expedite cleanup and transfer of unneeded properties due to  environmental hazards, we reviewed the laws, regulations, and policies  governing the cleanup and transfer of properties. We also visited three  BRAC bases from the prior BRAC rounds\u2014which represent the three  bases with the most expensive estimated costs to complete environmental  cleanup\u2014and interviewed local community property reuse officials as  well as military environmental cleanup specialists to obtain their  perspective on cleanup and property transfer issues. The bases we visited  were the former Fort Ord, Marina, California; the former McClellan Air  Force Base, Sacramento, California; and the former Alameda Naval Air  Station, Alameda, California. We also interviewed officials representing  federal and state environmental regulatory agencies for their perspective  on DOD cleanup activities and any opportunities for DOD to expedite the  cleanup and property transfer process while adhering to cleanup  standards and regulations. We conducted our work from January 2006  through November 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Further details on our scope and  methodology can be found in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD has undergone five BRAC rounds with the most recent occurring in  2005. Under the first four rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995, DOD closed  97 major bases and had 55 major base realignments and hundreds of  minor closures and realignments. DOD has reported that under the prior  BRAC rounds it had reduced the size of its domestic infrastructure by  about 20 percent and had generated about $6.6 billion in net annual  recurring savings for those years following the completion of the 1995  round in 2001. As a result of the 2005 BRAC decisions, DOD was slated to  close an additional 25 major bases, complete 32 major realignments, and  complete 755 minor base closures and realignments. At the time the BRAC  decisions were finalized in November 2005, the BRAC Commission  projected that implementation of these decisions would generate over $4  billion in annual recurring net savings following the completion of  implementing those decisions in 2011. In accordance with BRAC statutory  authority, DOD must complete closure and realignment actions by  September 15, 2011\u2014-6 years following the date the President transmits  his report on the BRAC recommendations to Congress. Environmental  cleanup and property transfer actions can exceed the 6-year time limit,  having no deadline for completion.", "In addition to reducing unneeded infrastructure and generating savings,  DOD envisioned the 2005 BRAC round to be one that emphasized  transformation by aligning the infrastructure with the defense strategy and  fostered jointness by examining and implementing opportunities for  greater jointness across DOD. As such, there are a considerably higher  number of realignments to take place than in any of the four prior rounds,  which has resulted in far more individual BRAC actions, many of which  affect multiple bases. While the number of major closures and  realignments are somewhat similar to those of previous rounds (see table  1), the number of minor closures and realignments is significantly greater  than those in all previous rounds combined. Available data indicate that  despite the larger number of actions associated with the 2005 BRAC round  compared with previous rounds, the amount of property potentially  available for transfer is likely to be much less than in prior BRAC rounds.  Although the total amount of acres available for transfer resulting from the  2005 BRAC round is yet to be fully determined, the preliminary number of  potentially transferable acres for the 25 major bases is about 102,000  acres compared with a total of about 502,500 acres from the prior BRAC  rounds combined. The extent of additional transferable acreage arising  from the hundreds of minor base closures and realignments was not  available at the time of our review, but is likely to be limited given the  smaller size of many of those locations.", "A critical component to the process of transferring unneeded property  arising from BRAC actions is the need to address the environmental  contamination that has occurred over time due to military operations  being conducted when the bases were active installations. Types of  environmental contaminants found at military installations include  solvents and corrosives; fuels; paint strippers and thinners; metals, such as  lead, cadmium, and chromium; and unique military substances, such as  nerve agents and unexploded ordnance. According to DOD officials, while  environmental cleanup of these contaminants has been an ongoing  process on active military bases, the cleanups often receive greater  attention once a base has been selected for closure. Environmental  cleanup is necessary for the transfer of unneeded contaminated property,  which becomes available as a result of base closures and realignments.  While addressing the environmental cleanup of contaminated property is a  requirement for property transfer to other users, the sometimes decades- long cleanup process is not bound by the 6-year limitation for  implementing required BRAC actions. As we have reported in the past,  addressing the cleanup of contaminated properties has been a key factor  related to delays in transferring unneeded BRAC property to other parties  for reuse. DOD officials told us that they expect environmental cleanup to  be less of an impediment during the 2005 round since the Department now  had a more mature cleanup program in place to address environmental  contamination on its bases.", "In conducting assessments of potential contamination and to determine  the degree of cleanup required (on both active and closed bases), DOD  must comply with cleanup standards and processes under all applicable  environmental laws, regulations, and executive orders. The  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act  of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended, authorizes cleanup actions at federal  facilities where there is a release of hazardous substances or the threat of  such a release which can present a threat to public health and the  environment. To clean up potentially contaminated sites on both active  and closed bases, DOD generally follows the process that is required under  CERCLA, which generally includes the following phases and activities:  preliminary assessment, site investigation, remedial investigation and  feasibility study, remedial design and remedial action, and long-term  monitoring. (An explanation of these phases is provided in app. II.)", "The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA)  added provisions to CERCLA specifically governing the cleanup of federal  facilities, including active military bases and those that are slated for  closure under BRAC and, among other things, required the Secretary of  Defense to carry out the Defense Environmental Restoration Program  (DERP). Following SARA\u2019s enactment, DOD established DERP, which  now consists of two subprograms: (1) the Installation Restoration  Program, which addresses the cleanup of hazardous substances that are  primarily controlled under CERCLA and were released into the  environment prior to October 17, 1986; and (2) the Military Munitions  Response Program, which addresses the cleanup of munitions including  UXO and the contaminants and metals related to munitions that were  released into the environment prior to September 30, 2002. Cleanups of  hazardous substances released after 1986 and munitions released after  2002 are not eligible for DERP funds. These cleanups are generally  referred to as non-DERP or \u201ccompliance\u201d cleanups and often include  activities that are regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery  Act. These cleanups involve the closure and cleanup of operations  associated with landfills, training ranges, and underground storage tanks  and are generally funded under base operations and maintenance accounts  for active bases. Once the property is determined to be unneeded and  transferable to other users under BRAC, the cleanups are funded under  the BRAC account.", "While SARA had originally required the government to warrant that all  necessary cleanup actions had been taken before transferring property to  nonfederal ownership, the act was amended in 1996 to expedite transfers  of contaminated property. Now such property, under some  circumstances, can be transferred to nonfederal users before all remedial  action has been taken. However, certain conditions must exist before the  department can exercise this early transfer authority, such as the property  must be suitable for the intended reuse and the governor of the state must  concur with the transfer.", "In addition to investigations into potential hazards, DOD is required to  follow National Environmental Policy Act requirements and consult with  local redevelopment authorities during the process of property disposal  and during the process of relocating functions from one installation to  another. Although the decision to close or realign installations is not  subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, DOD is required to  follow the act\u2019s requirements during the process of property disposal and  during the process of relocating functions from one installation to another.  The National Environmental Policy Act requires federal agencies,  including DOD, to consult with and obtain the comments of other federal  agencies that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to  any environmental impact involved with the action.", "DOD\u2019s March 2006 Base Redevelopment and Realignment Manual  requires the military services to prepare an Environmental Condition of  Property Report for closing BRAC bases. The report is used to evaluate the  environmental condition of all transferable property based on already  available information on contamination. It can be used to identify \u201cgaps\u201d in  information regarding environmental conditions and where more study is  required. Environmental Condition of Property reports have replaced the  former baseline surveys that were required when SARA was enacted in  1986. According to Army officials, the Army plans to have a total of 183  Environmental Condition of Property reports completed for all of its 2005  major and minor base closures by January 31, 2007. With respect to Army  National Guard properties, the states will be responsible for their  Environmental Condition of Property reports except for the five bases  located on federal lands for which the Army will prepare the reports, if  required. According to Navy officials, the Navy has completed all reports  for lands affected by 2005 closures. Air Force officials reported that they  will have the reports completed for all their bases, which require one, by  April 2007.", "DOD has had a long-standing policy of not considering environmental  cleanup costs in its BRAC decision making. Accordingly, the estimates  using the Cost of Base Realignment Actions model, which is used to  compare alternative actions during BRAC decision making, do not include  the cost of environmental cleanup for BRAC-affected bases. Historically,  we have agreed with DOD\u2019s position that such costs are a liability to DOD  regardless of its base closure recommendations. While such costs are not  included in the Cost of Base Realignment Actions model, they are included  in developing BRAC implementation budgets and recorded as a BRAC  cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expected Environmental Cleanup Costs for the 2005 BRAC Round Are Not Yet Fully Known", "paragraphs": ["Expected environmental cleanup costs for the 2005 BRAC round are not  yet fully known, but they are likely to increase from current estimates.  DOD\u2019s available data indicate that at least $950 million will be needed to  complete the cleanups now underway for known hazards on the major and  minor bases scheduled for closure for the 2005 BRAC round. However, our  prior work has indicated that as closures are implemented, more intensive  environmental investigations occur and additional hazardous  contamination may be uncovered resulting in higher cleanup costs. Also,  the services\u2019 estimates were based on cleanup standards that are  applicable for the current use of the property, but reuse plans developed  by communities sometimes lead to more stringent and thus more  expensive cleanups. In addition, DOD is in the early phases of identifying  and analyzing munitions hazards that may require additional cleanup at  both active and BRAC bases. Furthermore, the manner in which DOD is  required to report all these costs to Congress is fragmented. Of the four  reports DOD annually provides to Congress on environmental cleanup  costs and estimates for its bases, none gives the entire cost picture by  service or base."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cleanup Cost Estimates for BRAC 2005 Round Bases Are Not Fully Known and Likely to Increase", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD data indicate that at least $950 million will be needed for  cleanup of the major and minor base closures resulting from the 2005  BRAC round, this figure reflects preliminary amounts that are likely to  increase as more information is collected during BRAC implementation on  the extent of cleanup required to safely reuse property in communities  where future land use decisions have yet to be made. DOD\u2019s best available  data suggest that at least $590 million will be needed to complete the  cleanup of the 25 major base closures and about $360 million will be  needed for the minor closures. These amounts were developed from  information contained in the Defense Environmental Programs Fiscal  Year 2005 Annual Report to Congress, and they do not include all costs,  such as program management costs and non-DERP costs. In addition, the  2005 BRAC round includes the closure of more than 100 reserve centers,  the extent to which cleanups will be required and at what cost is largely  unknown. Only 2 of these centers reported cleanup estimates in the  Defense Environmental Programs Fiscal Year 2005 Annual Report to  Congress. Our experience with prior BRAC round bases has shown that  estimates tend to increase significantly once more detailed studies and  investigations are completed.", "The following table provides DOD\u2019s estimated cost to complete the  environmental cleanup beyond fiscal year 2006 for the 25 major DOD base  closures resulting from the 2005 BRAC round as reported in the Defense  Environmental Programs Fiscal Year 2005 Annual Report to Congress.  For certain bases, conflicting cost estimates appear between this report  and those reported in the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment  Commission Report to the President. According to DOD officials, the  data provided to the BRAC Commission is now outdated and estimates  contained in the Defense Environmental Programs Fiscal Year 2005  Annual Report to Congress provide more current data.", "Table 2 shows that DOD estimates it will spend at least $590 million to  clean up the 25 major bases recommended for closure in 2005. However,  we believe that this figure is low for several reasons. First, the amounts in  table 2 only include the cost estimate for DERP eligible cleanups\u2014those  cleanups associated with contamination occurring prior to 1986 for  hazardous waste and prior to 2002 for munitions. The cost for non-DERP  cleanups and program management costs are not included. These  additional costs could add millions to the overall cost estimate. Second, no  cleanup cost estimates were available in the Defense Environmental  Programs Fiscal Year 2005 Annual Report to Congress for 5 of the 25  major base closures either because the cleanups were not eligible for  DERP funding, or because the bases had not been thoroughly assessed for  environmental damage. As the bases undergo more complete and in-depth  environmental assessments, a clearer picture of environmental cleanup  costs will likely emerge. Finally, these cost estimates will likely increase  due to more in-depth investigations that are expected to address all  environmental cleanup issues now that the bases have been scheduled for  a BRAC closure. For example, during our visit to the Mississippi Army  Ammunition Plant in June 2006, we noted that Army and contract officials  were preparing an environmental condition of property assessment to pull  together all known environmental issues. Army officials told us that the  ammunition plant had been closed and placed in standby status since 1990  and that no aggressive environmental cleanup had taken place. When the  plant was recommended for closure in 2005, the Army estimated that $8.4  million would be required to address environmental contamination caused  by 2 inactive range munitions sites. Since that time, according to Army  plant officials, as many as 46 more sites have been identified as having  environmental concerns which will require further investigation and  possible cleanup. Therefore, the total eventual cleanup costs are likely to  be much higher than the current estimate of $8.4 million.", "DOD officials told us that the projected environmental cleanup cost  estimates are relatively lower for the 2005 BRAC bases than for those of  the prior rounds because the environmental conditions on the property of  today\u2019s bases are much better than those closed in previous rounds. These  officials told us that this is primarily due to ongoing actions associated  with DOD\u2019s Installation Restoration Program (cleanup program) and the  Military Munitions Response Program at active and BRAC bases. The  restoration program addresses hazardous substances, pollutants, and  other contaminants, and the munitions program addresses UXO and  discarded munitions. The officials stated that contaminated sites identified  under the installation restoration program are much farther along in the  cleanup process than sites identified under the munitions program,  primarily because the restoration program has been in existence since  1985 while the munitions program was only initiated in 2001. Our analysis  of DOD-provided cleanup-phase data for the identified contaminated  sites at 20 of the 25 major BRAC 2005 closures supports this assertion. For  example, DOD\u2019s data show that, as of September 30, 2005, 89 percent of  the 571 installation restoration sites (508 sites) either had their cleanup  remedy in place or had the remedy complete, and 91 percent (521 sites)  had completed investigation studies. Comparatively, of the 50 identified  munitions sites at the 20 bases, only 8 percent (4 sites) reported cleanup  action complete and only 10 percent (5 sites) had completed investigation  studies. However, federal cleanup officials as well as military  environmental specialists told us that many of these sites may require  further investigation and cleanup\u2014and greater cleanup costs\u2014if, as  expected, the future control and use of the property shifts from the  military to the private sector. Furthermore, DOD officials stated that many  munitions sites were not required to be cleaned when they were  operational ranges on active bases, but will require cleanup now that the  bases have been closed. The Army estimates that the cost to address  active ranges on their 2005 BRAC properties ranges from $37 million to  $335 million and is not included in the $950 million estimate for cleanup of  2005 major and minor bases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Environmental Cleanup Reports Do Not Provide a Complete Picture of Environmental Cleanup Cost Information", "paragraphs": ["Congress does not have complete visibility over the expected total cost of  DOD\u2019s cleanup efforts for the 2005 BRAC round or for the prior BRAC  rounds because of a variety of reports that individually are incomplete and  which collectively may present a confusing picture of costs. Although  DOD prepares multiple reports for Congress on various environmental  cleanup costs, none of them presents an overall total cost estimate per  base, nor is DOD required to present this information. DOD does not fully  explain the scope and limitations of the cost information presented.  Transparency and complete accountability in financial reporting and  budgetary backup documents are essential elements for providing  Congress with a more complete picture of the total cleanup costs so it can  make appropriate budgetary trade-off decisions to ensure the expeditious  cleanup and transfer of properties and ultimately realize savings for the  U.S. government.

While these costs are typically the majority  of the overall total costs, the report excludes the cost of cleanups by base  that do not qualify for DERP funding. Although these non-DERP costs are  presented elsewhere in the report, they are only presented in aggregate  terms by service. From information contained in two of the reports, we  determined that the expected environmental costs for the first four BRAC  rounds will total $13.2 billion, as shown in table 3.", "The $9.0 billion of funding made available for the four prior BRAC rounds  for all cost categories was obtained from DOD\u2019s BRAC Budget  Appropriations Request for fiscal year 2005.

For example, at the former Naval  Air Facility in Adak, Alaska, over 5,500 acres of UXO-contaminated  property have not been transferred because the technology for  economically cleaning up the UXO on this remote Aleutian island does  not currently exist. At the former Fort Ord Army Base in Marina,  California, about 11,800 acres contaminated with UXO still require  cleanup, and this effort is currently expected to take until 2021 due to  the labor-intensive nature of current cleanup technology (see fig. 2).  We were told by DOD officials that the detection of UXO is not only  labor intensive but difficult because the technology often used for this  purpose cannot easily distinguish between UXO and waste scrap  metals.", "Prolonged negotiations between environmental regulators and DOD  about compliance with environmental regulations and laws can delay  property transfers. For example, at the former Fort Wingate, New  Mexico, which was closed by the 1988 BRAC Commission and has  about 8,800 acres of transferable property with environmental  impediments, it took years of active negotiation between the Army and  regulators to reach agreement for closure requirements permitted  under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. At the former  Fort Ord, California, open burning of the coastal chaparral is necessary  before discovery and removal of UXO and other munitions can begin.  However, according to Army officials, the number of acres that can be  burned annually must be negotiated with the state and is controlled by  California\u2019s clean air standards.", "Additional environmental contamination can be detected after a base is  recommended for closure. For example, the former McClellan Air  Force Base in Sacramento, California, was recommended for closure in  1995 and traces of plutonium were found during a routine cleanup in  September 2000, causing a cost increase of $21 million, and extending  the completion schedule beyond 2030.", "Table 4 shows the most expensive \u201ccost to complete\u201d environmental  cleanups on prior BRAC round bases. The estimated costs to complete  cleanups at these 10 BRAC installations ($2.1 billion) account for more  than half (55 percent) of DOD\u2019s $3.8 billion future BRAC environmental  restoration and munitions cleanup estimates for all unneeded properties  on bases from the previous BRAC rounds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Expedite Cleanup and Transfer of Unneeded BRAC Properties", "paragraphs": ["Although opportunities exist to expedite the cleanup and transfer of  unneeded BRAC 2005 properties, as well as untransferred properties from  prior BRAC rounds, it is not clear to what extent each of these  opportunities are considered for BRAC properties nor what successes or  challenges were seen in their application since the services are not  required to report their strategies for addressing unclean and  untransferred properties to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Over the years, Congress has provided DOD with a wide range of property  transfer authorities to expedite the cleanup and transfer of unneeded  BRAC property, including public sales and the so-called \u201cEarly Transfer  Authority,\u201d which allows property to be transferred before all necessary  cleanup actions have been completed. In prior BRAC rounds, there was  more extensive use made of some tools than others, and as we previously  reported, DOD could have given greater attention to early transfer  authority. Each of the military services has processes in place to monitor  their progress to clean and transfer BRAC properties. Also, DOD\u2019s March  2006 Base Redevelopment and Realignment Manual, which provides  cleanup and disposal guidance for BRAC 2005 properties as well as  untransferred properties from prior BRAC rounds, encourages the services  to make wide use of all available property transfer tools.

When an installation becomes a BRAC action, the  unneeded property is reported as excess. Federal property disposal laws  require DOD to first screen excess property for possible reuse by defense  and other federal agencies. If no federal agency needs the property, it is  declared surplus and is made available to nonfederal parties, including  state and local agencies, local redevelopment authorities, and the public,  using various transfer tools as shown in table 5."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of the Wide Range of Tools Has Been Limited in the Past, but Has Greater Emphasis Now", "paragraphs": ["Although prior DOD guidance to the military services promoted creativity  within applicable laws and regulations to successfully close and reuse  installations, DOD used some property transfer tools to a much greater  extent than others. In some cases, DOD\u2019s deference to community plans  for economic development led it to use low or no-cost transfer tools more  often than property sales. As BRAC has evolved, there have been differing  emphases placed on the approaches used to transfer unneeded property.  For example, following the 1988 round, DOD emphasized revenue  generation through the sale of unneeded properties. Following the BRAC  rounds in the 1990s, however, DOD underscored economic development  through direct, no-cost transfers of property to the public sector. The  emphasis during the 2005 BRAC round appears to be headed towards a  renewed importance on achieving fair market value through various  transfer authorities and the consideration of all transfer tools available to  quickly transfer unneeded property to others for reuse.", "The services have taken some steps to expand their use of the wide array  of transfer tools in recent years, most notably the Navy, which realized  over $850 million in revenues from the sale of unneeded BRAC properties  at two former Marine Corps air stations in California. Figure 3 illustrates  the alternatives used to transfer unneeded BRAC property from the prior  BRAC rounds to nonfederal entities as of September 30, 2006.", "205,400 (65%) 13,300 (5%)", "As shown in figure 3, low- and no-cost property conveyance mechanisms  accounted for 65 percent (205,400) of all acres transferred\u2014public benefit,  conservation, and economic development conveyances were used in 17  percent, 19 percent, and 29 percent, respectively\u2013whereas public and  negotiated sales accounted for 5 percent (13,300) of all acres transferred.  According to DOD officials, this trend reflected deference to local  community organizations and their preference for low- and no-cost  conveyances. Moreover, it also reflected the difficulty in using public and  negotiated sales at that time, because more time was often needed to  determine the nature and extent of environmental contamination and its  potential cleanup cost, to attract private property developers. However, as  more information is developed at these sites and as local economic  conditions change, a different approach to transferring property may now  be successful, an approach which would not have worked in the past. For  example, while an agreement was reached in 2000 on a no-cost economic  development conveyance at the former Alameda Naval Air Station,  California, the local redevelopment authority could not follow through on  the terms of this conveyance to create jobs because of a decline in the  local economy. Therefore, both the local redevelopment authority and the  Navy were reassessing other property transfer options, including public  sales, at the time of our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Early Transfer Authority May Facilitate Property Transfers", "paragraphs": ["Another tool for facilitating property transfers is the so-called \u201cearly  transfer authority,\u201d which is not actually a property transfer mechanism  but rather an amendment to SARA, allowing the services to transfer  property that has not been entirely cleaned under an authorized transfer  conveyance. Recognizing that environmental cleanup has often delayed  the transfer of BRAC property, Congress enacted the early transfer  authority provision in 1996 which allows, under certain conditions,  property to be transferred before all necessary cleanup actions have been  completed. The transfer agreement identifies who will complete the  cleanup and what funding the service will provide, if any. In addition, the  entity assuming cleanup responsibilities will often purchase environmental  insurance to insure itself against possible cost overruns. We previously  reported that this tool should receive greater DOD attention and DOD has  increased its use of this authority, transferring a total of about 23,700 acres  using this method as of July 2006.", "There are typically two scenarios with which an early transfer is  requested. In the first scenario, the deed to the property is provided to the  new owner, such as a local redevelopment authority, and DOD continues  the cleanup. For the other scenario, the user takes the deed to the  property and as the new owner agrees to complete cleanup activities or to  control the implementation of an ongoing cleanup at the time of transfer.  Although this tool is officially called the \u201cTransfer Authority in Connection  with Payment of Environmental Remediation Costs,\u201d it is commonly  referred to as \u201cprivatization.\u201d DOD\u2019s March 2006 Base Redevelopment and  Realignment Manual states that if the fair market value of the property is  more than the cleanup cost, the purchaser must pay the military  departments the difference. However, if fair market value is less than the  cleanup costs, the military department may pay the purchaser the  difference. Because the purchaser will be responsible for completing the  cleanup, the services must confirm that the purchaser has the technical  expertise and financial capability to do so before considering this  approach. In terms of cost, DOD retains responsibility for funding the  environmental cleanup, regardless of whether it is performed by DOD or  the user.", "A primary advantage of using the early transfer authority is that it makes  property available to the future user as soon as possible, thus allowing  environmental cleanup and redevelopment activities to proceed  concurrently. This can save time and costs and provide users with greater  control over both activities. Furthermore, it provides communities with  the means to quickly put property into productive use, create jobs, and  possibly create tax revenue. DOD reported that some reasons why the  services were not taking full advantage of this authority were due to a lack  of information on early transfer authority by communities, how to use it,  and how the process ensures the protection of public health, safety, and  the environment. In addition, DOD cites a lack of support from state and  local regulators as a reason for the previously limited use of this authority.  However, a local redevelopment authority can purchase environmental  insurance to transfer the risk of potential cost overruns from the property  owner to the contractor and the insurance provider. By shifting the risk,  contractors may be strongly motivated to complete the environmental  cleanups in a timely and cost-efficient manner. According to one local  redevelopment authority official, privatization of environmental cleanup  (one scenario for achieving an early transfer) is now seen as a way to  expedite the cleanup and transfer process significantly because DOD\u2019s  approach can be too methodical, while the private sector can remediate  the hazards more economically and in less time.", "As of July 2006, the number of completed early property transfers had  increased from 12 (about 8,200 acres) as of September 30, 2001, to 23  (about 23,700 acres). According to DOD officials, 8 early transfer authority  actions are currently pending (in the process of being transferred), and 5  are currently being considered for the future.

Without such a  requirement, OSD cannot readily monitor and track the transfer tools the  services are using to expedite the cleanup and transfer of BRAC  properties. Further, there is less likelihood of the sharing of lessons  learned among the services, and communities could be denied full  economic benefits that may be possible through expedited reuse of the  property.", "In March 2006 guidance, DOD encouraged the military services to use all  appropriate means to transfer unneeded property from the BRAC 2005  round and prior BRAC rounds, and to dispose of property at the \u201chighest  and best use\u201d. As the disposing agency, the military department has the  authority to select the methods of disposing of unneeded properties. The  guidance states that DOD recognizes that federal law provides it with an  array of legal authorities by which to transfer property, but also recognizes  that the variety of installation types and the unique circumstances of the  surrounding communities do not lend themselves to a single approach.", "We found that each of the services monitors BRAC property cleanup and  disposal progress as part of their responsibility to dispose of unneeded  BRAC property. According to the Army, discussions within the Army  Conveyance Team can focus on progress and problems being  encountered with a current property disposal method at an installation.  The Army then attempts to resolve the problem with the local  redevelopment authority. In addition, the Army has developed a system to  track ongoing transfer conveyances for BRAC properties so it can identify  slippage and track progress. Approximately every 6 months Army  environmental personnel meet to discuss funding requirements and  property transfer issues. Within the Air Force Real Property Agency,  environmental program reviews are performed at least twice a year to  determine the extent of cleanup progress at Air Force BRAC installations.  In addition, the Air Force conducts bimonthly reviews to identify potential  problems and to confirm that the transfer schedule is being maintained.  We were told by a Navy official that each Program Management Office  regional director meets monthly with each of their BRAC teams to  discuss cleanup and property disposal progress at BRAC properties and, if  needed, any potential alternative approaches that could expedite cleanup  and disposal.", "According to a key OSD official responsible for monitoring the services\u2019  progress, the military services are not required to formally report their  strategy for cleaning up and transferring BRAC properties, including  sharing any challenges and successes they experienced in the use of  various property disposal tools or that they fully considered using all the  tools available to them.

The fiscal year 2006 budget request estimate for the  environmental cleanup costs was about $378 million. DOD also presented  Congress with information on the 2005 BRAC closures and realignments,  which shows that DOD and the services plan to spend about $426 million  on the environmental cleanup cost categories between fiscal year 2006 and  2011.
