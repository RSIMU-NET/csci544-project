In 1999, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) began a study to examine whether individuals who were exposed in utero to the contaminated drinking water are more likely to have developed certain childhood cancers or birth defects. ATSDR has projected a December 2007 completion date for the study. The National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2005 required GAO to report on past drinking water contamination and related health effects at Camp Lejeune.

In 1982 and 1983, continued testing identified two VOCs--trichloroethylene (TCE), a metal degreaser, and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), a dry cleaning solvent--in two water systems that served base housing areas, Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace. In 1984 and 1985 a Navy environmental program identified VOCs, such as TCE and PCE, in some of the individual wells serving the Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace water systems. Ten wells were subsequently removed from service. Department of Defense (DOD) and North Carolina officials concluded that on- and off-base sources were likely to have caused the contamination. It has not been determined when contamination at Hadnot Point began. ATSDR has estimated that well contamination at Tarawa Terrace from an off-base dry cleaner began as early as 1957. Activities related to concerns about possible adverse health effects began in 1991, when ATSDR initiated a public health assessment evaluating the possible health risks from exposure to the contaminated drinking water. The health assessment was followed by two health studies, one of which is ongoing. While ATSDR did not always receive requested funding and experienced delays in receiving information from DOD for its Camp Lejeune-related work, ATSDR officials said this has not significantly delayed their work. Former residents and employees have filed about 750 claims against the federal government. Additionally, three federal inquiries into issues related to the contamination have been conducted--one by a Marine Corps-chartered panel and two by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Members of the expert panel that the National Academy of Sciences convened generally agreed that many parameters of ATSDR's current study are appropriate, including the study population, the exposure time frame, and the selected health effects. ATSDR's study is examining whether individuals who were exposed in utero to the contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune between 1968 and 1985 were more likely to have specific birth defects or childhood cancers than those not exposed. DOD, EPA, and HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated where appropriate. Three members of an ATSDR community assistance panel for Camp Lejeune provided oral comments on issues such as other VOCs that have been detected at Camp Lejeune, and compensation, health benefits, and additional notification for former residents. GAO focused its review on TCE and PCE because they were identified by ATSDR as the chemicals of primary concern. GAO's report notes that other VOCs were detected. GAO incorporated the panel members' comments where appropriate, but some issues were beyond the scope of this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the early 1980s, Department of the Navy water testing at Marine Corps  Base Camp Lejeune identified contamination in water systems that served  housing areas on the base. Further water testing revealed that some of the  individual wells serving two of the water systems were contaminated with  volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as trichloroethylene (TCE),  which is a metal degreaser and an ingredient in adhesives and paint  removers, and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), which is a solvent used in the  textile industry and a dry cleaning solvent. By 1985, 10 wells that were  determined to be contaminated with VOCs had been removed from  service. Although it is not known precisely when the wells became  contaminated, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), which is  investigating the issue, has estimated that the contamination may have  begun as early as the 1950s. According to ATSDR, the VOCs of primary  concern at Camp Lejeune were TCE and PCE, and the agency notes that  exposure to these chemicals may cause adverse health effects. For  example, exposure to low levels of TCE may cause headaches and  difficulty concentrating. Exposure to high levels of both TCE and PCE  may cause dizziness, headaches, nausea, unconsciousness, cancer, and  possibly death.", "As required by federal law, ATSDR conducted a public health assessment  at Camp Lejeune after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  designated the base as a National Priorities List site in 1989. The health  assessment recommended that studies be conducted to evaluate the risks  of childhood cancer related to VOC exposure at Camp Lejeune and noted  that adverse pregnancy outcomes were also of concern. The first study  based on the health assessment was released in 1998 and found a  statistically significant association between exposure and some adverse  pregnancy outcomes. In 1999, ATSDR initiated a second study that  currently is examining whether individuals who were exposed in utero  (i.e., as developing fetuses during gestation) and as infants up to 1 year of  age to the contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune between 1968  and 1985 are more likely to have developed specific childhood cancers or  birth defects than those who were not exposed. ATSDR has projected a  December 2007 completion date for the study. In addition to ATSDR\u2019s  Camp Lejeune-related work, three inquiries into the issues related to the  past drinking water contamination have been conducted, one by a Marine  Corps-chartered panel, one by EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG),  and one by EPA\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division (CID).", "Former residents of Camp Lejeune have taken legal action against the  federal government for injuries alleged to have resulted from exposure to  the contaminated water. In addition, some former residents have  expressed concern over the Marine Corps\u2019 handling of and response to the  drinking water contamination, noting that even though contaminants were  detected as early as 1980, the wells that were determined to be  contaminated were not removed from service until 1985. Some former  residents have also asserted that there have been delays in the provision of  funding and information from the Department of Defense (DOD) to  ATSDR, and have said that DOD and EPA\u2019s responses to their requests for  drinking water contamination-related documents have sometimes been  inadequate. Finally, some former residents have raised concerns about  various aspects of ATSDR\u2019s ongoing study, including whether the study  population, time frame, and selected health effects are too limited to  adequately represent those who were potentially affected, and about  ATSDR\u2019s projected December 2007 study completion date because the  federal government plans to wait to adjudicate their claims until the study  is complete.", "The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year  2005 directed that we study and report on the past drinking water  contamination and related adverse health effects at Camp Lejeune,  including identifying the type, source, and duration of the contamination,  determining the actions taken to address the contamination, and assessing  the current ATSDR health study. The act also requires that our study  consider information and opinions from individuals who lived and worked  at Camp Lejeune during the period when the drinking water may have  been contaminated. As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, in  this report we examine the history of events related to drinking water  contamination at Camp Lejeune. Specifically, we (1) examine efforts to  identify and address the past contamination; (2) describe activities  resulting from concerns about possible adverse health effects and  government actions related to the past contamination, such as the current  ATSDR health study; and, (3) describe an assessment by an independent  panel of experts of the design of the current ATSDR health study,  including the study\u2019s population, the exposure time frame, selected health  effects being measured, and the reasonableness of the projected  completion date.", "To examine efforts to identify and address the past contamination, we  reviewed more than 1,600 documents related to past and current drinking  water activities at Camp Lejeune. We focused our review on the past TCE  and PCE contamination because ATSDR had noted that these chemicals  were the VOCs of primary concern at Camp Lejeune. However, we also  reviewed documentation regarding other VOCs detected at Camp Lejeune.  We interviewed current and former officials from various DOD entities,  including Camp Lejeune, Headquarters Marine Corps, and the Department  of the Navy, to obtain information about the history of events related to  the past drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune, including efforts  to identify and address the contamination. The current and former officials  interviewed often provided information based on their memory of events  that occurred more than 20 years ago. We attempted to corroborate their  testimonial evidence with documentation whenever possible. The former  officials we interviewed were responsible for environmental activities at  Camp Lejeune or the Department of the Navy during the time in which the  contamination was detected. The current officials we interviewed are  responsible for environmental activities at Camp Lejeune, Headquarters  Marine Corps, or the Department of the Navy. Some of these current  officials were also responsible for environmental activities during the time  in which the contamination was detected. We also met with 19 interested  former residents and individuals who worked on the base during the  1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, in order to obtain their perspective on historical  events and to learn about their concerns related to the drinking water  contamination. A former resident who is active in matters related to the  past drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune identified most of the  interested former residents; others were identified at an ATSDR public  meeting. Additionally, we examined reports from and interviewed officials  with EPA and with the North Carolina Department of Environment and  Natural Resources who were knowledgeable about activities and costs  related to the cleanup of the suspected sources of contamination.", "To describe activities resulting from concerns about the possible adverse  health effects and government actions related to past drinking water  contamination, including efforts to study potential health effects and  federal inquiries into the response to the contamination, we reviewed  documents, interviewed agency officials, and attended agency meetings.  To examine the activities undertaken by ATSDR to study possible adverse  health effects related to the drinking water contamination, we interviewed  ATSDR officials and reviewed ATSDR\u2019s Camp Lejeune-related documents  and publications, including the 1997 public health assessment and the  ATSDR health study released in 1998. We did not evaluate the  methodology or findings of the health assessment or health study. We also  attended the meetings and reviewed the reports of expert review panels  convened by ATSDR in 2005 regarding improving the study\u2019s water  modeling efforts and future studies of health effects. We attended the  February and April 2006 meetings of the ATSDR community assistance  panel which is made up of seven former residents of Camp Lejeune. We  also reviewed meeting transcripts from the July and September 2006  meetings. We also interviewed officials with the Department of the Navy  and the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine,  which serves as a liaison between DOD and ATSDR. We also interviewed  officials with the Department of the Navy Judge Advocate General and the  Department of Justice regarding the status of the legal claims related to  Camp Lejeune. To describe the three federal inquiries into issues related  to the drinking water contamination, we reviewed the reports of a Marine  Corps panel, the EPA OIG, and the EPA CID, and we interviewed EPA  officials.", "To assess the design of the current ATSDR health study, we contracted  with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to convene a panel of seven  subject area experts for a 1-day meeting on July 29, 2005. The expert panel  was charged with evaluating the study\u2019s population, exposure time frame,  selected health effects, and completion date. For the assessment of the  ATSDR study, we relied primarily on information gleaned from the expert  panel meeting and the panel experts\u2019 subsequent written responses to the  set of questions that were discussed during the 1-day meeting. Panel  members were invited as individual experts, not as organizational  representatives, and were not asked to reach consensus on any topics.  NAS was not asked to provide advice or produce any report, and the  comments made during the meeting of the expert panel should not be  interpreted to represent the views of NAS, of the organizations with which  the panel members were affiliated, or of all experts regarding health  studies related to drinking water contamination. Not all panel members  commented individually about each of the questions discussed during the  1-day meeting. Additionally, some panel members noted that certain  questions addressed subjects that were outside their areas of expertise.  We also reviewed study-related documentation furnished by officials from  ATSDR, Marine Corps, and Navy Environmental Health Center, and  interviewed officials from those agencies. We conducted our work from  May 2005 through April 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

All sources  of drinking water contain some naturally occurring contaminants. As  water flows in streams, sits in lakes, and filters thorough layers of soil and  rock in the ground, it dissolves or absorbs the substances that it touches.  Some of these contaminants are harmless, but others can pose a threat to  drinking water, such as improperly disposed-of chemicals, pesticides, and  certain naturally occurring substances. Likewise, drinking water that is not  properly treated or disinfected, or which travels through an improperly  maintained water system, may pose a health risk. However, the presence  of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health  risk\u2014all drinking water may reasonably be expected to contain at least  small amounts of some contaminants. As of July 2006, EPA had set  standards for approximately 90 contaminants in drinking water that may  pose a risk to human health. According to EPA, water that contains small  amounts of these contaminants, as long as they are below EPA\u2019s  standards, is safe to drink.

Base housing at Camp Lejeune consists of enlisted family housing, officer  family housing, and bachelor housing, which consists of barracks for  unmarried service personnel. The base has nine family housing areas, and  families live in base housing for an average of 2 years. Additionally,  schools, day care centers, and administrative offices are located on the  base. Approximately 54,000 people currently live and work at Camp  Lejeune, including about 43,000 active duty personnel and 11,000 military  dependents and civilian employees.", "In the 1980s, Camp Lejeune obtained its drinking water from as many as  eight water systems, which were fed by more than 100 individual wells  that pumped water from a freshwater aquifer located approximately 180  feet below the ground. Each of Camp Lejeune\u2019s water systems included  wells, a water treatment plant, reservoirs, elevated storage tanks, and  distribution lines to provide the treated water to the systems\u2019 respective  service areas. Drinking water at Camp Lejeune has been created by  combining and treating groundwater from multiple individual wells that  are rotated on and off, so that not all wells are providing water to the  system at any given time. Water is treated in order to remove minerals and  particles and to protect against microbial contamination. (See fig. 1 for a  description of how a Camp Lejeune water system operates.)", "From the 1970s through 1987, Hadnot Point, Tarawa Terrace, Holcomb  Boulevard, and Rifle Range water systems provided drinking water to  most of Camp Lejeune\u2019s housing areas. (See fig. 2 for the locations of these  water service areas.) The water treatment plants for the Hadnot Point and  Tarawa Terrace water systems were constructed during the 1940s and  1950s. The Rifle Range water system was constructed in 1965. The water  treatment plant for the Holcomb Boulevard water system began operating  at Camp Lejeune in 1972; prior to this time, the Hadnot Point water system  provided water to the Holcomb Boulevard service area. In the 1980s, each  of these four systems had between 4 and 35 wells that could provide water  to their respective service areas. In 1987 the Tarawa Terrace water  treatment plant was shut down and the Holcomb Boulevard water  distribution system was expanded to include the Tarawa Terrace water  service area.", "Generally, housing units served by the Tarawa Terrace and Holcomb  Boulevard water systems consisted of family housing, which included  single- and multifamily homes and housing in trailer parks. Housing units  served by the Hadnot Point water system included mainly bachelor  housing with limited family housing. The housing area served by the Rifle  Range water system included both family housing and bachelor housing.  Based on available housing data for the late 1970s and the 1980s, the  estimated annual averages of the number of people living in family housing  units served by these water systems at that time were:    5,814 people in units served by the Tarawa Terrace water system,    6,347 people in units served by the Holcomb Boulevard water system,    71 people in units served by the Hadnot Point water system, and    14 people in units served by the Rifle Range water system.", "In addition to serving housing units, all four water systems provided water  to base administrative offices.

The  Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, is the key federal law protecting  public water supplies from harmful contaminants. For example, the act  requires that all public water systems conduct routine tests of treated  water to ensure that the water is safe to drink. Required water testing  frequencies vary and range from weekly testing for some contaminants to  testing every 3 years for other contaminants. The act also established a  federal-state arrangement in which states may be delegated primary  implementation and enforcement authority for the drinking water  program. For contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in  public water systems and that EPA determines may have an adverse  impact on health, the act requires EPA to set a nonenforceable maximum  contaminant level goal, at which no known or anticipated adverse health  effects occur and that allows an adequate margin of safety. Once the  maximum contaminant level goal is established, EPA sets an enforceable  standard for water as it leaves the treatment plant, the maximum  contaminant level. A maximum contaminant level is the maximum  permissible level of a contaminant in water delivered to any user of a  public water system. The maximum contaminant level must be set as close  to the goal as is feasible using the best technology or other means  available, taking costs into consideration. The North Carolina Department  of Environment and Natural Resources and its predecessors have had  primary responsibility for implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act  in North Carolina since 1980.", "In 1979, EPA promulgated final regulations applicable to certain  community water systems establishing the maximum contaminant levels  for the control of TTHMs, which are a type of VOC that are formed when  disinfectants\u2014used to control disease-causing contaminants in drinking  water\u2014react with naturally occurring organic matter in water. The  regulations required that water systems that served more than 10,000  people and which added a disinfectant as part of the drinking water  treatment process to begin mandatory water testing for TTHMs by  November 1982 and comply with the maximum contaminant level by  November 1983.

Suggested no adverse response levels provided EPA\u2019s estimate of  the short- and long-term exposure to TCE and PCE in drinking water for  which no adverse response would be observed and described the known  information about possible health risks for these chemicals. Suggested  action guidance recommended remedial actions within certain time  periods when concentrations of contaminants exceeded specific levels.  Suggested action guidance was issued for PCE related to drinking water  contamination from coated asbestos-cement pipes, which were used in  water distribution lines.", "The initial regulation of TCE and PCE under the Safe Drinking Water Act  began in 1989 and 1992, respectively, when maximum contaminant levels  became effective for these contaminants.

LANTDIV arranged for an Army laboratory to begin testing the treated  water from two Camp Lejeune water systems, Hadnot Point and New  River, in October 1980. At that time, these two water systems were the  only ones that served more than 10,000 people and therefore would be  required to meet the future TTHM regulation. From October 1980 to  September 1981, eight samples were collected from the Hadnot Point  water system and analyzed for TTHMs. Results from four of the eight  samples indicated the presence of unidentified chemicals that were  interfering with the TTHM analyses. Reports for each of the four analyses  contained an Army laboratory official\u2019s handwritten notes about the  unidentified chemicals: two of the notes classified the water as \u201chighly  contaminated\u201d and notes for the other two analyses recommended  analyzing the water for organic compounds.", "The exact date when LANTDIV officials began receiving results from  TTHM testing is not known, and LANTDIV officials told us that they had  no recollection of how or when the results were communicated from the  Army laboratory. Available Marine Corps documents indicate that Camp  Lejeune environmental officials learned in July 1981 that LANTDIV had  been receiving the results of TTHM testing and was holding the results  until all planned testing was complete. Subsequently, Camp Lejeune  environmental officials requested copies of the TTHM results that  LANTDIV had received to date, and LANTDIV provided these results in  August 1981. The next documented correspondence from LANTDIV to  Camp Lejeune regarding TTHM monitoring occurred in a February 1982  memorandum in which LANTDIV recommended that TTHM monitoring be  expanded to all of Camp Lejeune\u2019s water systems and noted that Camp  Lejeune should contract with a North Carolina state-certified laboratory  for the testing.", "In early 1981, additional water testing unrelated to the TTHM monitoring  began at the Rifle Range area within Camp Lejeune for various  contaminants, including TCE and PCE. A former Camp Lejeune official  recalled that the testing was initiated because of concerns about chemicals  that had been buried at Rifle Range. In March, April, and May 1981, water  samples were collected from areas surrounding the chemical dump,  including a nearby creek; treated water from the Rifle Range water system;  and untreated water from the individual wells serving the water system.  These water samples were sent to a Navy-contracted private laboratory for  analysis, and the results were sent to a LANTDIV official in April and May  1981. The results for the samples collected from the areas surrounding the  chemical dump identified VOCs, including TCE and PCE. The results for  the samples collected from the water system\u2019s treated water and for the  samples from the untreated water from the individual wells also identified  VOCs. In July 1981, LANTDIV communicated the results to Camp Lejeune  officials and noted that one of the VOCs detected was a trihalomethane  and arrangements had been made to add the Rifle Range water system to  the base TTHM testing. LANTDIV also recommended that no further  action be taken until additional data became available from TTHM  monitoring or the planned NACIP program to identify, assess, and control  environmental contamination.", "Current and former LANTDIV officials recalled that their agency played a  limited role in providing information or guidance regarding environmental  issues at Camp Lejeune, and that this assistance generally would have  been at the request of Camp Lejeune officials. However, former Camp  Lejeune environmental officials recalled that at that time they had little  experience in water quality issues and relied on LANTDIV to serve as their  environmental experts. Documents from 1981 indicate that LANTDIV  officials continuously communicated information about the Rifle Range  area to Camp Lejeune environmental officials, including providing  sampling results, discussing the implications of these results, providing  copies of related regulations and standards, and making recommendations  for additional action.

According to an August 1982 memorandum, in May  1982 a Camp Lejeune official was informed during a telephone  conversation with a private laboratory official that organic cleaning  solvents, including TCE, were present in the water samples for TTHM  monitoring from the Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace water systems. In  July 1982, additional water samples from the two systems were collected  in an effort to investigate the presence of these chemicals. In August 1982  the contracted laboratory sent a letter to base officials informing them that  TCE and PCE were identified from the May and July samples as the  contaminants. According to the letter, the testing determined that the  Hadnot Point water system was contaminated with both TCE and PCE and  the Tarawa Terrace water system was contaminated with PCE. The letter  also noted that TCE and PCE \u201cappeared to be at high levels\u201d and were  \u201cmore important from a health standpoint\u201d than the TTHM monitoring.  Sampling results indicated that the levels of TCE and PCE varied. The  letter noted that one sample taken in May 1982 from the Hadnot Point  water system contained TCE at 1,400 parts per billion and two samples  taken in July 1982 contained TCE at 19 and 21 parts per billion. Four  samples taken in May 1982 and July 1982 from the Tarawa Terrace water  system contained levels of PCE that ranged from 76 to 104 parts per  billion. (See table 2 for the May and July 1982 sampling results.)", "Former Camp Lejeune environmental officials recalled that after the  private laboratory identified the TCE and PCE in the two water systems,  they did not take additional steps to address the contamination for three  reasons. First, they had limited knowledge of these chemicals; second,  there were no regulations establishing enforceable limits for these  chemicals in drinking water; and third, they made assumptions about why  the levels of TCE and PCE varied and about the possible sources of the  TCE and PCE. The former Camp Lejeune environmental officials told us  that they were aware of EPA guidance, referred to as \u201csuggested no  adverse response levels,\u201d for TCE and PCE when these contaminants were  identified at Camp Lejeune. However, they noted that the levels of these  contaminants detected at Camp Lejeune generally were below those  outlined in the guidance. One Camp Lejeune environmental official also  recalled that at the time they were unsure what the health effects would be  for the lower amounts detected at the base. Additionally, in an August  1982 document and during our interviews with current Camp Lejeune  environmental officials, it was noted that EPA had not issued regulations  under the Safe Drinking Water Act for TCE and PCE when the private  laboratory identified these chemicals in the drinking water. The former  Camp Lejeune environmental officials also said that they made  assumptions about why the levels of TCE and PCE varied in sampling  results and about the possible sources of the TCE and PCE. Specifically,  because the levels of TCE and PCE varied, they attributed the higher levels  to short-term environmental exposures, such as spilled paint inside a  water treatment plant, or to laboratory or sampling errors. Additionally, in  an August 1982 memorandum, a Camp Lejeune environmental official  suggested that, based on the sampling results provided by the private  laboratory, the levels of PCE detected could be the result of using coated  pipes in the untreated water lines at Tarawa Terrace. The former Camp  Lejeune environmental officials told us that in retrospect, it was likely that  well rotation in these water systems contributed to the varying sampling  results because the contaminated wells may not have been providing  water to the Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace systems at any given time.  However, both they and current Camp Lejeune environmental officials  said that at that time the base environmental staff did not know that the  wells serving both systems were rotated.", "After August 1982, the private laboratory continued to communicate with  Camp Lejeune officials about the contamination of treated water from the  Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace water systems. All eight of Camp  Lejeune\u2019s water systems were sampled again for TTHMs in November  1982. In a December 1982 memorandum, a Camp Lejeune environmental  official noted that during a phone conversation with a chemist from the  private laboratory the chemist expressed concern that TCE and PCE were  interfering with Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point TTHM samples. The  chemist said the levels of TCE and PCE were \u201crelatively high\u201d in the  November 1982 samples, though the specific levels of TCE and PCE were  not provided to Camp Lejeune officials. The private laboratory report  providing the November 1982 results said that the samples from Tarawa  Terrace \u201cshow contamination\u201d from PCE and the samples from Hadnot  Point \u201cshow contamination\u201d from both TCE and PCE. All eight of Camp  Lejeune\u2019s water systems were sampled again for TTHMs in August 1983,  and the private laboratory report providing these results said that the  samples from Tarawa Terrace \u201cshow contamination\u201d from PCE and the  samples from Hadnot Point \u201cshow contamination\u201d from both TCE and  PCE. Former Camp Lejeune environmental officials recalled that they did  not take any actions related to these findings.

The first step of the  NACIP program was an initial assessment study, which was designed to  collect and evaluate evidence that indicated the existence of pollutants  that may have contaminated a site or that posed a potential health hazard  for people located on or off a military installation. The initial assessment  study for Camp Lejeune, which was completed in April 1983, determined  that further investigation was warranted at 22 priority sites with potential  contamination, including a site near wells that served the Hadnot Point  water system.", "In July 1984, the base initiated a NACIP confirmation study to investigate  the 22 priority sites. As a part of the confirmation study, a Navy contractor  took water samples from water supply wells located near priority sites  where groundwater contamination was suspected. Current and former  Camp Lejeune officials told us that previous water samples usually had  been collected from treated water at sites such as reservoirs or buildings  within the water systems rather than being collected directly from  individual wells at Camp Lejeune. In November 1984, Camp Lejeune  officials received sampling results for one Hadnot Point well located near  a priority site, which showed that TCE and PCE, among other VOCs, were  detected in the well. This well was removed from service, and in  December 1984, water samples from six Hadnot Point wells that were  located in the same general area and treated water samples from the  Hadnot Point water plant were also tested. Results of the analysis of the  well samples indicated that both TCE and PCE were detected in one well,  TCE was detected in two additional wells, and other VOCs were detected  in all six wells. Results for the treated water samples also detected TCE  and PCE. Four of these six wells were removed from service, in addition  to the original well removed from service. For the two wells that were not  taken out of service, while initial results indicated levels of VOCs,  including TCE, other test results showed no detectable levels of VOCs.  Documents we reviewed show that continued monitoring of those two  wells indicated no detectable levels of TCE. During December 1984, seven  additional samples were taken from the treated water at Hadnot Point  water plant and revealed no detectable levels of TCE and PCE. According  to two former Camp Lejeune environmental officials, once the wells had  been taken out of service and the samples from the water plant no longer  showed detectable levels of TCE or PCE, they believed the water from the  Hadnot Point water system was no longer contaminated.", "Although the December 1984 testing of water from the Hadnot Point water  system showed no detectable levels of TCE or PCE, in mid-January 1985  Camp Lejeune environmental staff began collecting water samples from all  wells on the base. Sampling results were received in February 1985 and  detected VOCs, including TCE and PCE, in 3 wells serving the Hadnot  Point water system and 2 wells serving the Tarawa Terrace water system.  As a result, those 5 wells were removed from service. According to current  Camp Lejeune officials, all 10 wells had been removed from service by  February 8, 1985. According to memoranda dated March 1985 and May  1985, 1 of the 2 wells removed from service at Tarawa Terrace was used  on 1 day in March 1985 and on 3 days in April 1985 for short periods of  time to meet water needs at the base. See table 3 for the dates that wells  were removed from service and for the levels of TCE and PCE which were  detected in the wells prior to their removal from service in 1984 and 1985.  See app. IV for the levels of other VOCs which were detected in the wells  prior to their removal from service in 1984 and 1985.", "In addition, while base officials were waiting for sampling results from  January 1985 of samples collected from wells serving Hadnot Point, water  from this system was provided to a third water system for about 2 weeks.  In late January 1985, a fuel line break caused gasoline to leak into the  Holcomb Boulevard water treatment plant. During the approximately  2-week period the treatment plant was shut down, water from the Hadnot  Point system was pumped into the Holcomb Boulevard water lines.  Former Camp Lejeune environmental officials said that they used water  from the Hadnot Point water system because it was the only water system  interconnected with the Holcomb Boulevard water system, and because  they believed the water from the Hadnot Point water system was no longer  contaminated. Prior to restarting the Holcomb Boulevard water system,  samples of treated water were tested and no gasoline was detected in any  of these samples. However, the samples were found to contain various  levels of TCE; these results were attributed to the use of water from the  Hadnot Point water system. About 5 days after these samples were taken,  the Holcomb Boulevard water system was restarted because the fuel line  had been repaired. \u201cTwo of the wells that supply Tarawa Terrace have had to be taken off line because minute  (trace) amounts of several organic chemicals have been detected in the water. There are no  definitive State or Federal regulations regarding a safe level of these compounds, but as a  precaution, I have ordered the closure of these wells for all but emergency situations when  fire protection or domestic supply would be threatened.\u201d", "The notice asked residents to reduce water use until early June, when the  construction of a new water line was to be completed. In May 1985,  another article in the base newspaper stated the number of wells that had  been removed from service, stated why the wells were removed from  service, and noted the potential for water shortage at Tarawa Terrace as a  result. In addition, the Marine Corps provided us with copies of three  North Carolina newspaper articles published from May 1985 to September  1985 discussing contamination at Camp Lejeune. All three articles  included information about the drinking water contamination and noted  that 10 wells serving two water treatment systems at Camp Lejeune had  been removed from service.

Efforts by ATSDR  are ongoing to conclusively determine the sources of past contamination  in the Hadnot Point water system, as well as when the contamination  began.", "For the Tarawa Terrace water system, North Carolina officials determined  that an off-base source was the likely cause of the drinking water  contamination. After the Marine Corps requested assistance in identifying  the source of the contamination, North Carolina state officials conducted  an investigation from April 1985 through September 1985 to determine  whether two off-base dry cleaning facilities located near the two  contaminated wells were the sources of the PCE contamination at Tarawa  Terrace. The state officials concluded that the contamination likely came  from dry cleaning solvent that had been released into a leaking septic tank  at one of the cleaners\u2014ABC One Hour Cleaners\u2014which built its septic  system and began operation in 1954. Both the dry cleaning facility and its  septic tank were located off base but adjacent to a supply well for the  Tarawa Terrace water system. Based on the environmental contamination  at this site, ABC One Hour Cleaners was designated as a National  Priorities List site in 1989. As part of its current health study, ATSDR has  estimated that beginning as early as 1957 individuals were exposed to PCE  in treated drinking water at levels equal to or greater than what became  effective in 1992 as EPA\u2019s maximum contaminant level of 5 parts per  billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cleanup and Monitoring Activities Are Under Way to Address the Contamination", "paragraphs": ["Since 1989, officials from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and federal  agencies, including EPA, have taken actions to clean up the suspected  sources of the contamination in the Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace  water systems.

Cleanup of the eight sites suspected to be possible sources of  contamination for the Hadnot Point water system has included the  removal of contaminated soils and gasoline storage tanks and the  treatment of contaminated groundwater and soils. The cleanup activities  at four of the eight sites were completed by 2006. The estimated  completion date for cleanup activities of contaminated groundwater and  soils at three of the other four sites is 2025. There is no estimated  completion date for the fourth site.

Cleanup activities at the site,  which have been designed to address both the contaminated groundwater  and soil, have been managed by EPA, with support from North Carolina  officials. While treatment of some of the areas with contaminated soil has  been completed, the EPA official who serves as project manager for the  ABC One Hour Cleaners site could not provide an estimated completion  date for cleanup of either the soil or the groundwater. Funding for the  cleanup of this site comes primarily from the Superfund, though a portion  of the funds has been provided by ABC One Hour Cleaners and North  Carolina.

According to a North Carolina official, North Carolina will  assume authority for cleanup at the site in August 2013.", "Currently, Camp Lejeune uses various methods to monitor and protect the  base\u2019s drinking water. In drinking water reports published in 2004 and  available on the Camp Lejeune Web site, base officials stated that their  efforts to monitor the drinking water supply had met or exceeded all  required testing standards. For example, Camp Lejeune reported that \u201cin  accordance with Safe Drinking Water Act sampling requirements\u201d it had  regularly tested its treated drinking water for more than 80 different EPA- regulated contaminants and additional unregulated contaminants. The  reports noted that testing of treated water for VOCs had been conducted  on a monthly basis\u2014exceeding the requirement to test every 3 years\u2014\u201cin  order to show that there should be no concern about current VOC  contamination.\u201d The Camp Lejeune reports stated that the base had  sampled the wells at least annually for VOCs. Additionally, the Water  Quality Program at Camp Lejeune produces annual reports about each  drinking water system on the base in order to inform water consumers  about the quality of their water. The 2004 reports also stated that Camp  Lejeune officials have undertaken numerous efforts to protect the drinking  water supply, including restricting land uses near well fields, locating  well fields in undeveloped areas, constructing wells in a manner that  minimizes the potential for contamination, and using new technologies to  prevent groundwater contamination. Examples of some of these new  technologies included a computer-based monitoring system for  underground storage tanks that immediately alerts personnel when a leak  occurs, and the installation of bullet traps at firing areas, which prevent  lead and copper bullets from contaminating the groundwater and soil."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Possible Adverse Health Effects and Government Actions Related to the Past Contamination Have Led to Additional Activities", "paragraphs": ["Concerns about possible adverse health effects and government actions  related to the past drinking water contamination have led to additional  activities, including health studies, claims against the federal government,  and federal inquiries. Activities resulting from concerns about possible  adverse health effects began in 1991, when ATSDR initiated a public health  assessment that evaluated the possible health risks from past exposure to  the contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune. The health assessment  was followed by two studies, one of which was ongoing as of April 2007.  Since ATSDR began its work, the agency did not always receive requested  funding and experienced delays in receiving information from DOD  entities. However, ATSDR officials said that the agency\u2019s Camp Lejeune- related work was not significantly delayed by DOD. As of January 2007,  about 750 claims had been filed by former Camp Lejeune residents and  employees against the federal government for injuries alleged to have  resulted from past exposure to the contaminated drinking water at Camp  Lejeune. Additionally, three federal inquiries into issues related to the  drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune have been conducted, one  by a Marine Corps-chartered panel, one by the EPA OIG, and one by the  EPA CID. The inquiry conducted by the Marine Corps-chartered panel  found that the Marine Corps acted responsibly and found no evidence that  the Marine Corps had attempted to cover up information that indicated  contamination in Camp Lejeune\u2019s drinking water.

From 1991 to 1997, ATSDR conducted a public health  assessment at Camp Lejeune that was required by law because of the  base\u2019s listing on the National Priorities List. The health assessment  evaluated several ways in which people on base had been exposed to  hazardous substances, including exposure to the VOC-contaminated  drinking water. ATSDR concluded that (1) cancerous and noncancerous  health effects were unlikely in adults exposed to VOC-contaminated  drinking water, (2) the likelihood of either noncancerous or cancerous  health effects in children could not be determined because of insufficient  scientific information, and (3) there was evidence that suggested that,  because of their developing systems, individuals who were exposed in  utero were potentially more sensitive to the effects of VOCs than  individuals who were exposed as adults or children. In its 1997 report,  ATSDR recommended that a study be carried out to evaluate the risks of  childhood cancer in those who were exposed in utero to the contaminated  drinking water and also noted that adverse pregnancy outcomes were of  concern. ATSDR officials said that the health assessment did not  recommend a study of adverse pregnancy outcomes because such a study  was already under way.", "In 1995, while the health assessment was being conducted, ATSDR  initiated a study to determine whether there was an association between  exposure to VOCs in drinking water and specific adverse pregnancy  outcomes among women who had lived at Camp Lejeune from 1968  through 1985. The study, released in 1998, originally concluded that there  was a statistically significant elevated risk for several poor pregnancy  outcomes, including (1) small for gestational age among male infants born  to mothers living at Hadnot Point, (2) small for gestational age for infants  born to mothers over 35 years old living at Tarawa Terrace, and (3) small  for gestational age for infants born to mothers with two or more prior fetal  losses living at Tarawa Terrace. However, ATSDR officials said they are  reanalyzing the findings of this study because of an error in the original  assessment of exposure to VOCs in drinking water. While the study  originally assessed births from 1968 to 1972 in the Holcomb Boulevard  service area as being unexposed to VOCs, these births were exposed to  contaminants from the Hadnot Point water system. An ATSDR official said  the reanalysis may alter the study\u2019s results.", "In 1999, ATSDR initiated its current study examining whether certain birth  defects and childhood cancers are associated with exposure to TCE or  PCE at Camp Lejeune. The study examines whether individuals born  during 1968 through 1985 to mothers who were exposed to the  contaminated drinking water at any time while they were pregnant and  living at Camp Lejeune were more likely than those who were not exposed  to have neural tube defects, oral cleft defects, or childhood hematopoietic  cancers. The current study began with a survey to identify potential cases  of the selected birth defects and childhood cancers. The study is also using  water modeling to help ATSDR determine the potential sources of past  contamination and estimate when the water became contaminated and  which housing units received the contaminated water. The water modeling  data will help ATSDR identify which pregnant women may have been  exposed to the contaminated water, and will also help ATSDR estimate the  amount of TCE and PCE that may have been in the drinking water. ATSDR  officials said that the study is expected to be completed by December  2007.", "ATSDR also has hosted two expert panel meetings related to the past  drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune. In February 2005, ATSDR  hosted an expert scientific advisory panel to explore opportunities for  conducting additional health studies of people who were potentially  exposed to contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune. The agency  noted that it convened this panel in response to continuing public concern  about health effects from past exposure to contaminated drinking water.  ATSDR received nine recommendations from its scientific advisory panel  in a final report released in June 2005, which include a recommendation to  create an advisory panel to oversee future studies and a recommendation  that funding for future studies should come from appropriations to  ATSDR, not from DOD\u2019s budget. In an August 2005 published response,  ATSDR agreed with all but three of the scientific advisory panel\u2019s  recommendations. (See app. VI for ATSDR\u2019s panel recommendations and  ATSDR\u2019s response.)", "ATSDR has taken steps to accomplish three of the recommended  activities. In February 2006, ATSDR created a community assistance panel  to respond to the two recommendations urging a closer partnership with  former Camp Lejeune residents and development of an advisory panel to  oversee health studies related to VOC exposures at Camp Lejeune. As of  January 2007, the community assistance panel had held four meetings. The  panel includes seven former Camp Lejeune residents. Also participating in  CAP meetings are one representative from DOD, two independent  scientific experts, and ATSDR staff. ATSDR officials said the community  assistance panel is comparable with other panels that ATSDR had set up  for community participation at National Priorities List sites similar to  Camp Lejeune. In response to a recommendation to conduct feasibility or  pilot studies before beginning full-scale health studies, ATSDR had begun  conducting a feasibility assessment to determine the availability and  sufficiency of data needed to conduct several additional health studies  related to past drinking water contamination. At the February 2006  community assistance panel meeting, the panel members and ATSDR  officials agreed that ATSDR should move forward with the initial stages of  planning a mortality study and an adult cancer incidence study of those  potentially exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune so long as  necessary data are available. ATSDR officials said that they had identified  databases such as the National Death Index, which contains death  records, and state cancer registries that could be used to assist ATSDR  with conducting these studies. An ATSDR official said that mortality and  cancer incidence studies would potentially be easier to carry out than  some other health studies because of the existence of these databases.  Since the February 2006 community assistance panel meeting, ATSDR  officials have begun reviewing additional databases at the Defense  Manpower Data Center and Naval Health Research Center to determine if  those databases could be linked to both the National Death Index and  state cancer registries, and to Camp Lejeune family housing records. If  the feasibility assessment shows that these databases can be used, ATSDR  will likely proceed with the two studies, officials said. Additionally,  ATSDR officials said they plan to computerize the family housing records  at Camp Lejeune that were still in paper format. Officials noted that the  fully computerized family housing records might be used as the basis for  defining a registry of potentially affected residents, as recommended by  the scientific advisory panel, if the feasibility assessment indicates that it  is possible to obtain social security numbers and dates of birth for each  potential member of the registry.", "In March 2005, ATSDR hosted a separate expert peer review panel to  evaluate the agency\u2019s water modeling and data-gathering efforts at Camp  Lejeune. In a report published in October 2005, the expert peer review  panel on water modeling made two primary recommendations urging the  agency to make additional effort and expend more resources on more  rigorous record searches to improve the information for the historical  reconstruction of events. ATSDR agreed and had hired new staff and  consultants to begin record searches at Camp Lejeune; however, ATSDR  officials did not proceed with their record search after they learned that  the Marine Corps had separately hired a private contractor to conduct  such a search. The Marine Corps\u2019 private contractor completed its  document search in August 2006, which yielded more than 6,000  documents. An ATSDR official told us that during a preliminary review of  the documents in July 2006, ATSDR determined that the documents were  \u201cextremely useful\u201d for its water modeling activities. The remaining three  recommendations of the expert peer review panel on water modeling were  technical comments related to modeling activities, such as a  recommendation to use simplified models that required less effort and  resources.

While ATSDR conducted the health assessment  at Camp Lejeune, from fiscal year 1991 to fiscal year 1996 funding was  provided by DOD as part of an annual payment for all ATSDR activities at  DOD sites. These annual payments were provided from Defense  Environmental Restoration Program funds. In fiscal year 1997, the  individual military services assumed responsibility for making these  payments. Therefore, for fiscal year 1997, funding for ATSDR\u2019s Camp  Lejeune-related work came directly from the Navy (see Table 5).", "From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2000, no funding was provided to  ATSDR by the Navy or any DOD entity for its Camp Lejeune-related work  because the agencies could not reach agreement about the funding for  Camp Lejeune. In June 1997, ATSDR proposed conducting a study of  childhood leukemia and birth defects associated with TCE and PCE  exposure at Camp Lejeune during fiscal years 1998 and 1999 at an  estimated cost of almost $1.8 million. In a July 1997 letter to the Navy, an  ATSDR official noted that during a June meeting the Navy appeared to be  reluctant to fund the proposed study; however, the official noted that DOD  was liable for the costs of the study under federal law. In an October 1997  letter responding to ATSDR, a senior Navy official stated that the Navy did  not believe it should be required to fund ATSDR\u2019s proposed study because  the cause of the contamination was an off-base source, ABC One Hour  Cleaners. The Navy official said that it was more appropriate for ATSDR to  seek funding for the study from the responsible party that caused the  contamination. However, ATSDR officials told us that while they  expected that the study would focus primarily on contamination from the  dry cleaner, the study was also expected to include people who were  exposed to on-base sources of contamination. An ATSDR official reported  that the agency submitted its funding proposals for the Camp Lejeune  study to DOD in each of the annual plans of work from fiscal year 1998 to  fiscal year 2000, but that during that time period the agency received no  DOD funding and funded its Camp Lejeune-related work from general  ATSDR funding.", "In fiscal year 2001 the Navy resumed funding of ATSDR\u2019s Camp Lejeune- related work.

The letter  also noted that ATSDR had sent several requests for information and  Camp Lejeune\u2019s responses had been in most cases inadequate and no  supporting documentation had been forwarded. ATSDR also had difficulty  in obtaining access to DOD records while preparing to conduct its survey,  the first phase of the current ATSDR health study. In October 1998, ATSDR  requested assistance from the Defense Manpower Data Center, which  maintains archives of DOD data, in locating residents of Camp Lejeune  who gave birth between 1968 and 1985 on or off base. An official at the  Defense Manpower Data Center initially did not provide the requested  information because he believed that doing so could constitute a violation  of the Privacy Act. Between February and April 1999, Headquarters  Marine Corps facilitated discussion between ATSDR and relevant DOD  entities about these Privacy Act concerns and some information was  subsequently provided to ATSDR by DOD. In April 2001, Headquarters  Marine Corps sent a letter to the Defense Privacy Office suggesting that  the Defense Manpower Data Center had only provided a limited amount of  information to ATSDR. However, in a July 2001 reply to Headquarters  Marine Corps, the Defense Privacy Office noted that it believed that  relevant data had been provided to ATSDR by the Defense Manpower Data  Center in 1999 and 2001.", "In December 2005, ATSDR officials told us that they had recently learned  of a substantial number of additional documents that had not been  previously provided to them by Camp Lejeune officials. ATSDR then sent a  letter to Headquarters Marine Corps seeking assistance in resolving  outstanding issues related to delays in the provision of information and  data to ATSDR. In an attachment to the letter, ATSDR provided a list of  data and information needed from the Marine Corps in order to complete  water modeling activities for its current study. In a January 2006 response,  a Headquarters Marine Corps official noted that a comprehensive review  was conducted of responses to ATSDR\u2019s requests for information and that  the Marine Corps believed it had made a full and timely disclosure of all  known and available requested documents. The official also noted that  while ATSDR had requested that the Marine Corps identify and provide  documents that were relevant or useful to ATSDR\u2019s study, the Marine  Corps did not always have the subject matter expertise to determine the  relevance of documents.

EPA did not adequately perform oversight of Camp Lejeune based on  its responsibilities listed in the Safe Drinking Water Act,  4.

Regarding the first two complaints, the OIG determined that EPA\u2019s  response to a Freedom of Information Act request for documents related  to Camp Lejeune contamination was inadequate and that its denial of an  associated fee waiver request was inappropriate and insensitive. The third  complaint was closed because the OIG concluded that EPA had little  oversight responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act until 1996,  significantly later than the contamination occurred at Camp Lejeune.

With regard to the Navy and Marine Corps, the CID investigated  five principal allegations of violation of federal law:  1.  violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act,  2.  conspiracy to violate the Safe Drinking Water Act,  3.  conspiracy to conceal records and prevent persons from talking with a  federal agency conducting a congressionally mandated health study,  4.  conspiracy to conceal Freedom of Information Act records from the  5.  providing material false statements to a federal law enforcement  officer.", "The CID concluded that in the absence of enforceable regulatory  standards for both TCE and PCE between 1980 and 1985, there was no  violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act at that time, and drinking water  provided by Camp Lejeune during that time appeared to have met all state  and federal regulatory requirements.

With regard to allegations that Marine Corps or  Navy officials conspired to violate the Safe Drinking Water Act or to  conceal records, the CID\u2019s report noted that investigators were unable to  substantiate that a conspiracy by military or civilian employees of either  entity existed. Regarding allegations that false statements were provided  to a federal law enforcement officer, investigators noted that while they  were concerned that LANTDIV officials were not completely forthcoming  during their interviews, there was never any direct evidence that LANTDIV  officials were aware of the contamination prior to 1984.", "With regard to ATSDR, the CID investigated two principal allegations  made by former residents of Camp Lejeune:  1.  destruction of a federal agency\u2019s records, and  2.  conspiracy to improperly administer a congressionally mandated  health study.", "Regarding an alleged order by an ATSDR official to destroy records related  to the Camp Lejeune health study, CID investigators found that the records  in question were never destroyed.

Additionally, several of the  allegations from the public had also been forwarded by DOJ to the CID for  investigation. Following the CID\u2019s referral of this case to DOJ for its  review, DOJ discussed its findings at an August 2005 meeting with former  residents and officials from the Navy and Marine Corps. DOJ concluded  that it would not seek criminal prosecution, saying that the government\u2019s  investigation had concluded that no federal criminal law was broken nor  was there an attempt to conceal evidence regarding a violation of any law.", "In addition to investigating whether federal law had been violated, the CID  also investigated additional questions that were relevant to the case but  were determined not to be violations of federal law. The CID noted that  some of these matters appeared to have contributed to confusion,  suspicion, and concern by retired Marines. Additionally, the CID  commented on and criticized certain actions taken by Navy and Marine  Corps officials. For example:    The CID concluded that as a technical advisory agency to Camp Lejeune,  LANTDIV was not diligent in providing technical expertise to the base\u2019s  environmental officials and noted that LANTDIV officials appeared to have  been better suited by virtue of their training and expertise to recognize  and address VOC contamination and the possible effects on public health  than the environmental officials at Camp Lejeune.", "The CID commented that former Camp Lejeune environmental officials  failed to properly investigate the contamination and determine the  contamination was coming from individual wells. Until 1984, the Camp  Lejeune environmental officials never sampled individual water wells and  the CID noted that this was arguably their most significant lapse in  judgment.", "Because of questions raised by Congress and former residents, the CID  also investigated the provision of DOD funding for ATSDR\u2019s work. The  CID concluded that funding for the current study was apparently delayed  because of opposition characterized as a professional difference of  opinion as to the scientific value of the study by a midlevel manager at the  Navy Environmental Health Center, and that coupled with this opposition  was confusion within the Navy hierarchy regarding what entity was  responsible for the contaminated wells.", "Regarding the provision of records and data to ATSDR by the Marine  Corps, the CID found no instances when data or records were  intentionally withheld or false data were provided by Marine Corps  officials to ATSDR. The CID noted the Marine Corps appeared not to have  recognized the complexity and degree of attention this issue required in  1997 and that prior to 1997, the Marine Corps admitted that it failed to  adequately address concerns and data requests from the public and  ATSDR."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Experts Convened by NAS Generally Agreed That Many Parameters of ATSDR\u2019s Current Study Were Appropriate but Some Experts Suggested Potential Modifications to the Study", "paragraphs": ["The seven members of an expert panel convened by the National Academy  of Sciences (NAS) at our request generally agreed that specific parameters  of ATSDR\u2019s current study were appropriate, including the study  population, the exposure time frame, and the selected health effects.

The current study follows recommendations from the agency\u2019s  1997 public health assessment of Camp Lejeune, which noted that studies  of cancer among those who were exposed in utero should be conducted to  further the understanding of the health effects in this susceptible  population. Panel experts said that ideally a study would attempt to  include all individuals who were potentially exposed, but that limited  resources and data availability were practical reasons for limiting the  study population. Additionally, panel experts agreed that those exposed  while in utero were an appropriate study population because they could be  considered at higher risk of adverse health outcomes than others, such as  those exposed as children or adults. In addition, two panel experts said  that studying only those who lived on base was reasonable because they  likely had a higher risk of inhalation exposure to VOCs such as TCE and  PCE, which may be more potent than ingestion exposure. Thus, pregnant  women who lived in areas of base housing with contaminated water and  conducted activities during which they could inhale water vapor\u2014such as  bathing, showering, or washing dishes or clothing\u2014likely faced greater  exposure than those who did not live on base but worked on base in areas  served by the contaminated drinking water.", "While supporting the decision to limit the study population to individuals  who were in utero, the panel experts did not discount the possibility that  children and adults who lived or worked on base may also be at risk for  adverse health effects because of their potential exposure to contaminated  drinking water. For example, four panel experts pointed out that exposed  children and adults might have an elevated risk for neurological effects,  and one of the four experts said exposed adults might have an elevated  risk for certain cancers. Similarly, the ATSDR scientific advisory panel  convened in February 2005 identified at least four groups of individuals at  Camp Lejeune who might be at higher risk for adverse health effects  because they could have been exposed to the contaminated drinking  water.

According to ATSDR\u2019s study protocol,  these years were chosen because 1968 was the first year that birth  certificates were computerized in North Carolina and 1985 was when the  affected water wells were removed from service. Four of the panel experts  said they did not see any benefit in using an earlier start date than 1968  because collecting birth records before 1968 could require a significant  amount of resources to collect data. In addition, while the initial exposure  to contaminated drinking water may have occurred as early as the 1950s,  at the time the ATSDR study time frame was selected officials were unable  to determine precisely when the contamination began. Four of the panel  experts commented that exposure was likely highest in the latter part of  the study time frame\u2014presumably as a result of a higher accumulated  level of contamination over time\u2014thus making the uncertainty of when  the contamination began less significant and supporting ATSDR\u2019s decision  to study the later time frame.", "Six of the panel experts said that extending the time frame past 1985 could  help strengthen ATSDR\u2019s study by adding an additional unexposed  population for comparison. Having an additional comparison population  could help researchers reinforce any conclusions about whether TCE or  PCE are associated with adverse health outcomes, panel experts said. For  example, if the study found some association between adverse health  outcomes and the pre-1985 exposed population, but no association with an  additional unexposed comparison group, it would support any finding that  TCE or PCE exposure was associated with adverse health outcomes, since  the exposure ended in 1985. Two of the expert panel members said that if  adverse health effects continued to be found in a comparison population  after 1985, that finding could mean that exposure to the contaminated  drinking water was not associated with the adverse health effects.

Three of the experts explained that water modeling  would be useful if it improved the classification of the study participants  as either exposed or unexposed to contaminated water or provided more  accurate estimates of individual exposure levels, as ATSDR intends.  ATSDR officials said that a precise and accurate exposure assessment  would enhance the scientific credibility of a study and strengthen the  study\u2019s ability to identify any important exposure effects. But all of the  panel experts raised concerns about the limited historical record of the  amount of PCE or TCE concentration identified at individual Camp  Lejeune wells.

As an alternative to estimating the  extent of each study individual\u2019s exposure using the water modeling  results, four panel experts suggested ATSDR could use simpler categories  of whether and to what extent individuals were exposed to water  contamination. These four experts said that analyzing the data on birth  defects and childhood cancers by using the same exposure categories that  were used in the 1998 ATSDR study could yield an effective study sooner  than December 2007.

Word of  mouth among current and former residents and media campaigns were the  primary methods used to identify and recruit those individuals born  outside the county as study participants. According to three panel experts,  the methods used to identify these study participants raise the possibility  of selection bias for that group. Specifically, the experts suggested that  eligible study individuals born out of county, or their parents, who had  concerns about potential exposure to TCE or PCE or about existing health  problems may have been more likely to sign up for the study than those  who did not have these concerns.

We focused our review on the past trichloroethylene (TCE)  and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination at Camp Lejeune because  the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) had noted  that these chemicals were the VOCs of primary concern. However, we also  reviewed documentation regarding other volatile organic compounds  (VOCs) detected at Camp Lejeune. The documents we reviewed were  obtained from Headquarters Marine Corps and had been collected and  organized by a contractor for the Commandant of the Marine Corps\u2019  Drinking Water Fact-Finding Panel for Camp Lejeune. Documents related  to past and current drinking water activities were also obtained during a  visit to Camp Lejeune. The authors of the documents we collected  included officials with Camp Lejeune, Headquarters Marine Corps, the  Department of the Navy, other federal agencies such as the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), the state of North Carolina, and private  laboratories. The types of documents that were collected included results  of laboratory analyses of drinking water samples, e-mails, memorandums,  letters, reports, site maps, federal and state regulations, press releases,  and newspaper articles.", "Additionally, we reviewed a list of more than 6,000 historical documents  collected by a contractor hired by Headquarters Marine Corps; this list was  compiled by the contractor and included detailed descriptions and dates  of the historical documents. We requested and reviewed more than 100  documents from this list that we thought might be relevant to the past  drinking water contamination.", "We interviewed 39 current and former officials from various Department  of Defense (DOD) entities, including Camp Lejeune, Headquarters Marine  Corps, and the Department of the Navy, who were involved in activities  related to or knowledgeable about historical environmental activities at  Camp Lejeune. The former officials we interviewed were responsible for  environmental activities at Camp Lejeune or the Department of the Navy  during the time in which the contamination was detected. The current  officials we interviewed are responsible for environmental activities at  Camp Lejeune, Headquarters Marine Corps, or the Department of the  Navy. Some of these current officials were also responsible for  environmental activities during the time in which the contamination was  detected. The current and former officials interviewed often provided  information based on their memory of events which occurred more than  20 years ago. We attempted to corroborate their testimonial evidence with  documentation whenever possible. We also met with 19 interested former  residents and individuals who worked on the base during the 1960s, 1970s,  and 1980s in order to obtain their perspective on historical events. A  former resident who is active in matters related to the past drinking water  contamination at Camp Lejeune identified most of the interested former  residents; others were identified at an ATSDR public meeting. We also  interviewed current Camp Lejeune housing officials in order to obtain  estimated historical occupancy rates, including the limitations of the  occupancy data that were provided. Additionally, we examined reports  from and interviewed current officials from Camp Lejeune, EPA, and the  North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources who  were involved with or knowledgeable about past and current activities and  costs related to the cleanup of the suspected sources of contamination.  Finally, we obtained and analyzed information from ATSDR and EPA on  drinking water contaminated with TCE and PCE, the possible adverse  health effects related to exposure to these chemicals, and relevant federal  regulations for TCE and PCE.", "To describe activities resulting from concerns about the possible adverse  health effects and government actions related to past drinking water  contamination, including efforts to study potential health effects and  federal inquiries into the response to the contamination, we reviewed  documents, interviewed agency officials, and attended agency meetings.  To examine the activities undertaken by ATSDR to study potential health  effects related to the drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune, we  reviewed the agency\u2019s 1997 Public Health Assessment that evaluated the  risks of adverse health effects from exposure to the contaminated drinking  water, as well as released documents regarding ATSDR\u2019s 1998 health study  of the association between exposure to TCE and PCE in drinking water at  Camp Lejeune and a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We did not  evaluate the methodology or findings of the public health assessment or  health study. For ATSDR\u2019s current study, we examined the study protocol,  a progress report, and other documents describing ATSDR\u2019s current study  examining whether birth defects and childhood cancers are associated  with exposure to TCE or PCE at Camp Lejeune. We interviewed ATSDR  officials involved with the Public Health Assessment, the 1998 study, and  the current study, and also attended ATSDR expert panel meetings  convened to evaluate and provide recommendations regarding the  agency\u2019s work related to Camp Lejeune. In order to examine the sources  of and issues surrounding funding for ATSDR\u2019s Camp Lejeune-related  work, we obtained documents from and interviewed officials with ATSDR,  the Department of the Navy, and the U.S. Army Center for Health  Promotion and Preventive Medicine, which currently executes the  memorandum of understanding between DOD and ATSDR and negotiates  an annual plan of work with ATSDR. We examined documentation and  interviewed DOD, ATSDR, and EPA officials about efforts to address the  concerns of the former Camp Lejeune residents. To examine the  recommendations of additional review panels convened by ATSDR in 2005  regarding improving the study\u2019s water modeling efforts and future studies  of health effects, we attended two panel meetings and obtained and  reviewed the final reports of both panels, which included ATSDR\u2019s  response to the panels\u2019 recommendations. To determine the actions taken  by ATSDR to address the panel recommendations, we interviewed  relevant ATSDR officials and observed and subsequently reviewed  transcripts of meetings of the Camp Lejeune community assistance panel  held in 2006, where ATSDR officials reported on their activities. In order  to describe the lawsuits and tort claims filed against the federal  government for injuries alleged to have resulted from exposure to the  contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune, we interviewed officials  with the Department of the Navy\u2019s Judge Advocate General and the  Department of Justice. To describe three federal inquiries into issues  related to the drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune, we reviewed  the reports and statements of the Drinking Water Fact-Finding Panel for  Camp Lejeune, the EPA Office of Inspector General, the EPA Criminal  Investigation Division, and the Department of Justice. We also interviewed  officials from the EPA Office of Inspector General and the EPA Criminal  Investigation Division about their examinations of allegations made by  former residents. We did not evaluate the methodology used by the  officials who conducted these three inquiries.", "When the source of evidence we cited is from an interview, we identified  the respondent\u2019s agency and noted whether the individual was a current or  former official. Whenever possible, we reviewed documents to verify  testimonial evidence from DOD and ATSDR officials. When this was not  possible, we attempted to corroborate testimonial evidence by  interviewing multiple individuals about the information we obtained.", "To assess the design of the current study by ATSDR on the possible health  effects associated with the contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune,  including the study population, time frame, health effects, and completion  date, we contracted with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to  convene a 1-day meeting of scientific experts in the areas of drinking  water contamination, hydrologic modeling, and reproductive health. We  identified for NAS the categories of expertise preferred at the meeting and  expressed a preference that each participant have no conflict of interest  with ATSDR, DOD, or EPA. NAS identified participants according to the  preferred categories. Once we concurred with the proposed participants,  NAS contacted the potential participants to determine interest and  availability to participate in the meeting. In total, seven experts and one  moderator participated in the meeting. The experts and the moderator had  combined research expertise in environmental engineering; reproductive,  environmental, and occupational epidemiology; statistics and modeling;  public health investigations, risk assessment, and decision analysis;  geochemistry; and water and wastewater treatment and water modeling.  We observed the meeting, which took place in July 2005, and subsequently  reviewed the written transcript of the meeting. The experts\u2019 discussion  during the meeting was guided by a set of questions we prepared regarding  the ATSDR study population, time frame, health effects, and completion  date. Participants were invited as individual experts, not as organizational  representatives, and were not asked to reach consensus on any topics.  NAS was not asked to provide advice or produce any report, and the  comments made during the meeting of the expert panel should not be  interpreted to represent the views of NAS or of all experts regarding  health studies related to drinking water contamination. As we requested,  each of the experts also provided written responses to the set of questions  that were discussed during the meeting. During the meeting and in their  written responses, not all panel members commented individually about  each of the questions discussed during the 1-day meeting. Additionally,  some panel members noted that certain questions addressed subjects that  were outside their areas of expertise. In addition to convening and  attending the expert panel meeting, we also reviewed ATSDR documents  related to the current study, including the study protocol and progress  reports, and interviewed ATSDR officials involved in the study\u2019s  epidemiologic and water modeling activities.", "We conducted our work from May 2005 through April 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Selected Events Related to Past Drinking Water Contamination at Camp Lejeune from 1980 through 1981", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: Selected Events Related to Past  Drinking Water Contamination at Camp  Lejeune from 1980 through 1981 An official with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic Division (LANTDIV),  collected samples from all eight water systems at Camp Lejeune to be combined into a single  sample and analyzed in order to detect any potential contaminants in the water systems.", "At the direction of LANTDIV, Camp Lejeune collected separate samples to be analyzed for total  trihalomethanes (TTHMs) at two base water systems, Hadnot Point and New River. LANTDIV  arranged for the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency (USAEHA) laboratory to conduct  the testing.", "A LANTDIV-contracted private laboratory reported results from the samples collected on  October 1, 1980, from all eight water systems at Camp Lejeune. The results, sent to LANTDIV,  indicated that 11 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected, including trichloroethylene  (TCE). All VOCs detected in this analysis were identified at their detection limits, which were  the lowest level at which the chemicals could be reliably identified by the instruments being  used.", "A report from USAEHA of the results of the analysis of samples collected on October 21, 1980,  contained a USAEHA official\u2019s handwritten notes which indicated unidentified chlorinated  hydrocarbons were interfering with the testing for TTHMs at the Hadnot Point water system.", "Handwritten notes from a USAEHA official on a USAEHA report indicated that continued  interference with the TTHM analysis of samples collected on December 29, 1980, for the  Hadnot Point water system, and recommended conducting analyses for chlorinated organics.", "Handwritten notes from a USAEHA official on a USAEHA report indicated continued  interference with the TTHM analysis of samples collected on January 30, 1980, for the Hadnot  Point water system, and recommended conducting analyses for chlorinated organics.", "Handwritten notes from a USAEHA official on a USAEHA report indicated that water samples  collected on March 9, 1981, for analysis for TTHMs at the Hadnot Point water system were  \u201chighly contaminated\u201d with other chlorinated hydrocarbons.", "According to the private laboratory report sent to LANTDIV, an analysis of water samples  collected on March 30, 1981, from areas surrounding the Camp Lejeune Rifle Range chemical  dump detected VOCs. However, TCE and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) were not among the  VOCs detected in these samples.", "According to the private laboratory report sent to LANTDIV, an analysis of water samples  collected on April 10, 1981, was conducted from the untreated water in the wells that served the  Rifle Range water system, from treated water from the Rifle Range water system, and from  areas surrounding the Rifle Range chemical dump. VOCs, including TCE and PCE, were  detected in water samples from the areas surrounding the chemical dump. VOCs, including  TCE, were also detected in the well samples. TCE was detected at 1.8 parts per billion in one  of the well samples.", "The Commander of LANTDIV wrote a memorandum to the Commanding General of Camp  Lejeune that recommended resampling the Rifle Range area because of variation in the results  from the April 7 and April 16 analysis reports. LANTDIV noted that three contaminants were  detected in the treated and untreated water in the Rifle Range water system. Two of these  contaminants, methylene chloride and TCE, were not regulated and the third chemical, a  TTHM, was detected at levels within the new regulatory standards. The LANTDIV official noted  that no imminent threat to human health was presented by consumption of water from the Rifle  Range water system.", "According to the private laboratory report sent to LANTDIV, an analysis of water samples  collected on May 20, 1981, from treated water in the Rifle Range water system and from areas  surrounding the Rifle Range chemical dump detected VOCs in the treated water at the Rifle  Range water system and also detected VOCs, including TCE, in areas surrounding the Rifle  Range chemical dump.", "The Commander of LANTDIV wrote a memorandum to the Commanding General of Camp  Lejeune that described the analyses of the additional water samples taken from the Rifle Range  area. The official noted that of the organic contaminants detected at the Rifle Range area, only  one, a TTHM, had an established regulation with a maximum contaminant level though it did  not apply to the Rifle Range water system because this system did not serve more than 10,000  people. The official noted that LANTDIV would add the Rifle Range water system to the TTHM  testing that had been initiated in 1980. Additionally, he suggested no further action be taken  until the Navy Assessment and Control of Installation Pollutants program and TTHM analysis  provided additional data. According to a handwritten note at the end of the memorandum, an  environmental official at Camp Lejeune recommended arranging a meeting with the state in  order to share these results.", "The Commander of LANTDIV wrote a memorandum to the Commanding General of Camp  Lejeune noting that in accordance with Camp Lejeune\u2019s request, it was providing the summary  of TTHM regulations and copies of the TTHM testing reports for the two water systems that met  the requirement to be tested.   0 to  identify, assess, and control environmental contamination from past hazardous materials storage,  transfer, processing, and disposal operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Selected Events Related to Past Drinking Water Contamination at Camp Lejeune from 1982 through 1983", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Camp Lejeune environmental officials began collecting monthly samples for monitoring of total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) at all eight base water systems.", "paragraphs": ["A private laboratory contracted by Camp Lejeune to conduct the TTHM analysis informed Camp  Lejeune by telephone that synthetic organic cleaning solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE),  were detected in the samples that were collected from April 19 to April 22, 1982, from the Tarawa  Terrace and Hadnot Point water systems.

An internal Camp Lejeune  memorandum noted that the additional sampling was conducted because the private laboratory  identified interference by TCE and another synthetic organic cleaning solvent while analyzing earlier  samples from the Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace water systems for TTHMs.", "The private laboratory sent a letter to Camp Lejeune officials stating that the contaminants interfering  with the TTHM monitoring at the Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point water systems were TCE and  tetrachloroethylene (PCE). The laboratory noted that these chemicals appeared to be at high levels  and were thus more important from a health standpoint than the TTHM levels. The laboratory further  noted that the levels of PCE detected in the Tarawa Terrace water system had been relatively stable  over the time period examined, while levels of TCE and PCE detected in the Hadnot Point water  system had varied, and the most recent Hadnot Point readings had been at significantly lower levels  than the levels detected in May.", "Camp Lejeune officials decided to reduce monitoring for TTHMs from monthly to quarterly for six of  the eight water systems, including Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point, beginning in September 1982.

She  explained that the additional samples had been collected on July 28, 1982, to identify the source of  the interference in the earlier TTHM testing; TCE and PCE were identified as the interfering  chemicals. The official detailed the possible adverse health effects from both TCE and PCE, but  further explained that TCE and PCE were not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. However,  she noted that the EPA had issued \u201csuggested no adverse response levels\u201d and \u201csuggested action  guidance,\u201d which provided some guidance on unregulated contaminants. The official explained that  levels of TCE and PCE detected in the Hadnot Point water system were presently within the limits  suggested by the suggested no adverse response levels, but she offered no explanation for the  higher level detected in samples taken in May 1982 and analyzed in July 1982. She also noted that it  was possible that the levels of PCE detected in the Tarawa Terrace water system were the result of  the use of asbestos-coated pipe in the water lines carrying untreated water.", "The private laboratory report of the results of the analysis of samples collected in November from all  eight water systems for quarterly TTHM testing was provided to Camp Lejeune officials.

The agency said that decisions concerning  study period, study population, and study outcomes should be  made in consultation with the CAP, and said that ATSDR would  defer decisions about additional health studies until feasibility  studies were completed and reviewed by the CAP.", "6. Conduct future research activities in parallel with the current  study and without awaiting completion of current ATSDR  activities.", "Agreed. The agency said that its highest priority is to complete  the current study. Development of a CAP and further research  activities would likely require additional staffing and resources,  which ATSDR said it would request from the Department of  Defense (DOD).", "7. Amend the 1997 public health assessment to include the  possibility that adult cancers and other adverse health  outcomes may be related to VOC exposures. Additionally,   in the period since release of the original public health  assessment, much additional information on exposures at  Camp Lejeune and their potential risks has been developed,  and this additional material should be incorporated into an  amended document.", "Did not agree. ATSDR said revisions to the assessment would be  needed only if new information changed the assessment\u2019s  conclusions or recommendations. ATSDR noted that its  assessment acknowledged that the science was inconclusive and  did not rule out the possibility of cancerous health effects from  low-dose exposure to VOCs.", "Did not respond directly. ATSDR indicated that it would work with  the CAP to determine effective ways to disseminate information  about its current study and any future health studies.", "Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\u2019s  (ATSDR) response  9. Obtain future funding for Camp Lejeune health studies through  direct congressional appropriation, not through DOD\u2019s budget,  to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.", "Did not agree. ATSDR said it recognized that the affected  community had some distrust of ATSDR and DOD, and said that  the CAP was intended to help mitigate this distrust. However,  ATSDR suggested that DOD is the most likely funding source for  these research activities because no other funds are available  outside those budgeted to complete the current study."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Description of Current Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Health Study", "paragraphs": ["ATSDR is conducting a study of the potential health effects of exposure  while in utero and as infants up to 1 year of age to trichloroethylene (TCE)  and tetrachloroethylene (PCE)\u2014two volatile organic chemicals found in  drinking water at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in the 1980s. ATSDR\u2019s  study will analyze whether exposure to the TCE or PCE-contaminated  drinking water at Camp Lejeune before birth is associated with increased  risks of specific birth defects or childhood cancers. These birth defects  include (1) neural tube defects, (2) oral cleft defects, and (3) childhood  leukemias and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which have been combined into  one category of hematopoietic cancers.", "ATSDR\u2019s efforts to conduct this study began in 1999 with a telephone  survey conducted with parents of 12,598 individuals born to women who  were pregnant with them while living in on-base housing at Camp Lejeune  any time from 1968 through 1985. Parents were asked if their child had a  birth defect or developed a childhood cancer, along with other questions  such as those to confirm residency on base during the specific time period  and questions regarding water usage. A total of 106 potential cases of the  childhood cancers or birth defects were reported by the interviewed  parents. ATSDR reviewed health records in order to verify the reported  health problems and had confirmed 57 cases of the childhood cancers or  birth defects as of June 2006. (See table 6.) The study population includes  the 57 individuals with confirmed health problems and 548 comparison  individuals chosen randomly from among the remaining individuals  identified in the survey.", "As part of this study, ATSDR officials are also conducting computer  modeling of the drinking water system at Camp Lejeune from 1968 through  1985 in order to determine which pregnant women were probably exposed  to the contaminated drinking water and to estimate their levels of  exposure. ATSDR\u2019s drinking water distribution system model is based on  current and historical information for the base water system as well as  historical information on the sources of the contamination. The results of  the model are intended to establish whether the mothers of the individuals  with the birth defects or childhood cancers were more likely to have been  exposed during their pregnancy to the drinking water contaminants than  were the mothers of the comparison individuals. ATSDR officials said they  did not expect to finalize exposure categories for the current study until  February or March 2007, after most water modeling activities were  completed, but noted that they would use the water modeling results to  assign multiple exposure levels to each study participant. Additionally,  data gathered from the survey about the mothers\u2019 drinking water and other  home water use activities, such as dishwashing, clothes washing, and  bathing, will be combined with the estimated exposures levels to create  another exposure measure. ATSDR officials also said the current study  will analyze results for individuals who were exposed to TCE separately  from those exposed to PCE and will analyze cancer and each type of birth  defect separately. The study is expected to be completed by December  2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Bonnie Anderson, Assistant  Director; Karen Doran, Assistant Director; George Bogart; Helen  Desaulniers; Cathleen Hamann; Danielle Organek; Roseanne Price;  Christina Ritchie; and Stuart Ryba made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
