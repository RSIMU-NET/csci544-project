To determine danger  pay rates at overseas posts, State uses a two-part process that bases  danger pay eligibility on threat ratings for political violence and terrorism  at posts and danger pay rates on whether eligible family members are  allowed at posts (see fig. 7).", "Following its policies, State determines eligibility for danger pay based on  SETL ratings for (1) political violence and (2) terrorism at posts, which  are generated by the DS Office of Intelligence and Threat Analysis.  Overseas posts with a critical threat rating in either of these categories  are eligible for danger pay. DS generates SETL ratings annually,  reflecting threat levels for all overseas posts permanently staffed by direct  hire personnel who operate under the Chief of Mission. SETL ratings  reflect the views of the leadership team at each post as well as the  analysts at DS who assess threats to overseas posts worldwide. Political  violence ratings incorporate the threat to U.S. officials from civil unrest,  government collapse, demonstrations, coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, and inter- or  intrastate conflicts, to include, but not limited to, armed insurgents and  drug trafficking organizations. Terrorism ratings consider the threat of  violence from foreign terrorist organizations and other international  terrorist groups that possess the capability and intent to recruit, plan,  finance, and execute local attacks against official U.S. interests. For posts  that meet eligibility criteria, State determines danger pay rates based on  the \u201caccompanied status\u201d at overseas posts\u2014that is, whether eligible  family members are allowed to reside at posts. The three tiers of danger  pay (15, 25, and 35 percent above basic compensation) correspond to  different types of accompanied status. Fully accompanied posts receive  the lowest danger pay rate of 15 percent above basic compensation.  Partially accompanied posts receive a 25-percent danger pay rate.  Unaccompanied posts and posts that allow only adult working-eligible  family members are entitled to the highest danger pay rate of 35 percent.", "The Danger Pay Review Board evaluates danger pay rates as part of an  annual review cycle and on an ad hoc basis for event-driven reasons. The  board meets each fall to reevaluate danger pay following DS\u2019s release of  new SETL ratings and recommends posts to add or delete from the  danger pay list. Regional bureaus may also request danger pay for posts  outside of the annual cycle for event-driven reasons\u2014for example, if  political unrest leads to the evacuation of family members from a post.  These requests must specify the conditions at the location that meet the  qualifying factors in the danger pay statute and regulations. Additionally,  regional bureaus may request danger pay for locations other than  established overseas posts where employees from State or other eligible  agencies operate. Because these locations do not have SETL ratings, the  Danger Pay Review Board evaluates these requests and makes its  recommendations based on the specific conditions at these locations.  The board generally makes recommendations regarding requests for  danger pay at these other locations in conjunction with its annual review.", "State implemented its current process for determining danger pay rates in  April 2015\u2014the result of its first review of its processes for determining  danger pay rates at overseas posts since the 1980s. Prior to these  changes, ALS scored posts and determined danger pay rates based on  responses to a danger pay survey completed periodically by posts, similar  to the process now used to determine hardship pay. State\u2019s review  identified some inconsistencies between the conditions at posts receiving  danger pay and the qualifying factors cited in the authorizing statute and  regulations. For example, some posts were receiving danger pay  primarily because of high crime rates even though danger pay regulations  stipulate that the qualifying conditions for danger pay do not include acts  characterized chiefly as economic crime. State\u2019s review also determined  that the survey-based scoring process was largely duplicative with the  SETL process led by DS and, moreover, that DS possessed greater  expertise than ALS for assessing the threats at overseas posts and  ensuring consistency in threat ratings across posts. According to State  officials, the new process for determining danger pay rates ensures  greater transparency, consistency, and fairness.", "In 2015, State completed its first annual review of danger pay under the  new process by assessing whether overseas posts had qualifying SETL  ratings and then determining rates based on the accompanied status of  these posts. As a result, 34 overseas posts and other locations lost  danger pay, 7 received danger pay that previously had not been eligible  for it, and 15 experienced increases in their danger pay rates.", "In conjunction with its implementation of the new process for determining  danger pay rates, State adjusted hardship pay rates for affected posts by  adding or subtracting credit for political violence and terrorism\u2014factors  that help determine rates for both allowances. Credit for these factors  must be removed from hardship pay when a post receives danger pay to  avoid duplication of benefits for the same condition. Removing this credit  from the hardship scoring usually results in a decrease in the hardship  pay rate. Conversely, credit for these factors is added back into hardship  pay when a post loses danger pay, commonly resulting in an increase in  the hardship pay rate. As a result of these adjustments, most of the posts  that lost danger pay (27 of the 34) experienced an increase in hardship  pay that offset some or all of their loss in danger pay. For example, six  posts in Mexico lost danger pay under the new process because they  lacked qualifying SETL ratings. However, all six received increases in  hardship pay, which partially or fully offset the loss of danger pay.  Correspondingly, six of the seven posts that became newly eligible for  danger pay experienced partially offsetting reductions in hardship pay.

Specifically, in January 2016, State approved 35-percent danger pay for  Bujumbura, Burundi, because of increasing political violence that led to a  partial evacuation of the post. Danger pay for Bujumbura was later  renewed in November 2016 as part of the regular review cycle based on  a qualifying SETL rating. Additionally, in March 2016, State approved  danger pay for several posts in Turkey because of increasing terrorist  attacks and a growing threat of political violence. Lastly, in June 2016,  State approved danger pay for Bamako, Mali, because of increasing  terrorist threats.

Overseas posts we visited had developed different policies and  procedures for tracking employee travel to the United States and  reporting this travel to CGFS. For example, at Embassy Tunis, the  Human Resources Office is responsible for sending diplomatic cables to  CGFS and requires employees to fill out a form with relevant information  needed for the cables whenever they travel to and return from the United  States. For each diplomatic cable, CGFS determines how the travel will  impact hardship pay and manually adjusts the allowance in the payroll  system for the employee.

First, an employee  must fill out an electronic leave request including information about  whether he is traveling to the United States, the purpose of the U.S.  travel, and whether any eligible family members will remain at the post.

These improper payments accounted for about 30 percent  of the $9.6 million in improper payments that CGFS identified related to  compensation for U.S. employees in 2015 and 2016. CGFS identified  almost twice the amount of improper payments for hardship pay in fiscal  year 2015 as it did in 2016. According to CGFS officials, the amount of  improper payments it identified declined in 2016 because the bureau  made progress working through a backlog of diplomatic cables from  overseas posts and instituted new work processes that helped to reduce  improper payments. As of March 2017, CGFS had recovered almost $2.7  million, or about 92 percent, of the improper payments it identified in 2015  and 2016 related to hardship and danger pay. According to CGFS  officials, the bureau was continuing efforts to recover the remaining 8  percent.", "CGFS officials cited late notification of employee arrivals and departures  from overseas posts as the main cause of improper payments related to  hardship and danger pay. For employees assigned to hardship posts,  State\u2019s policy specifies that hardship pay must be suspended upon travel  to the United States, with some exceptions. To implement these rules,  overseas posts must send diplomatic cables to CGFS with instructions to  suspend and reinstate hardship pay for their employees. According to  CGFS officials, improper payments may occur when CGFS processes  hardship pay cables for dates outside of the current pay period because a  cable arrived after the end of a pay period or CGFS was unable to  process the cable during the pay period when it arrived. For danger pay,  which is recorded in conjunction with the time and attendance process at  overseas posts, CGFS officials said that they primarily identify  overpayments when they receive timesheet corrections from posts  involving danger pay after danger pay has been processed for a given  pay period.", "While CGFS has identified about $2.9 million in improper payments  related to hardship and danger pay as part of its regular pay processing  activities, according to CGFS officials, it has not identified any additional  improper payments through recovery audits, which are generally required  by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010  (IPERA). IPERA requires these audits, if they are not prohibited under  any other provision of law, if it is a program and activity of the agency that  expends $1 million or more annually and if conducting such audits would  be cost-effective. The Office of Management and Budget and State refer  to these recovery audits as \u201cpayment recapture audits.\u201d A recapture audit  is a review and analysis of accounting and financial records, supporting  documentation, and other information supporting payments that is  specifically designed to identify overpayments. CGFS identified U.S.  employee compensation, including hardship and danger pay, as one of  the State programs that meet these criteria and expanded its recapture  audit activities in fiscal year 2015 to cover this area. For example, CGFS  has reviewed instances where hardship pay was paid to employees  assigned to a domestic location. However, according to CGFS officials,  as of March 2017, it had not found any additional overpayments related  specifically to hardship and danger pay through these recapture audit  efforts. They explained that recapture audit efforts for U.S. employee  compensation are in their initial phases, and they plan to expand them in  the future.", "We found that CGFS had not analyzed available data that could help to  identify hardship posts at risk of overpayments and thereby aid in  recapture audit and improper payment prevention efforts. In 2015, CGFS  began collecting data on types of diplomatic cables from overseas posts  that include requests for hardship pay to be suspended or reinstated for  employees. According to CGFS officials, CGFS initiated this data  collection effort in order to reduce improper payments by better managing  workloads and prioritizing cases in which hardship pay needed to be  suspended before CGFS processed pay. CGFS officials emphasized that  they did not originally intend for the data to be used to facilitate recapture  audits. CGFS officials agreed, however, that analyzing patterns in the  data could help identify posts more likely to be out of compliance with the  rules for hardship pay and therefore at higher risk for improper payments.  For example, the diplomatic cable data could help identify anomalies such  as posts that have fewer than expected requests for suspensions and  reinstatements of hardship pay relative to the size of their workforce or  proximity to the United States. Once CGFS has identified these  anomalous posts, the posts would be able to use other data, such as  information from travel management systems, to identify and recover any  overpayments and could develop systems to prevent future improper  payments. For example, one post we visited conducted an internal audit  of employee travel and identified 18 instances over 8 months when the  post did not send diplomatic cables to CGFS to suspend hardship pay.  The post later sent cables to CGFS with this information so that CGFS  could recover the associated overpayments. The post also developed a  standard operating procedure to improve compliance with the policies for  hardship pay and prevent similar overpayments related to hardship pay  going forward.", "We independently analyzed the diplomatic cable data by post and  identified several anomalies. For example, we identified nine countries\u2014 accounting for a total of about $2 million in hardship pay spending in fiscal  years 2015 and 2016\u2014that did not send either suspension or  reinstatement cables to CGFS to request adjustments to hardship pay  during this time period. CGFS officials confirmed that the lack of  diplomatic cables was a possible indication that these posts were not  following State\u2019s rules for hardship pay. Additionally, we identified some  overseas posts located in the same region of the world and with similar  Foreign Service staffing levels that generated substantially different  numbers of diplomatic cable requests to suspend and reinstate hardship  pay. For example, the data indicate that\u2014among two neighboring posts in  Southeast Asia with similar Foreign Service officer staffing levels\u2014one  post sent a total of 235 diplomatic cable requests to suspend and  reinstate hardship pay in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, whereas the other  post sent 39. State spent a total of about $3.5 million on hardship pay in  each of these countries in fiscal years 2015 and 2016.", "Data analytics involves a variety of techniques to analyze and interpret  data to facilitate decision making and may be used to identify patterns or  trends, determine whether problems are widespread and systemic in  nature, and evaluate program performance outcomes. Guidance from the  Office of Management and Budget notes that such techniques could be  part of an internal control program to prevent, detect, and recover  overpayments. Moreover, a forum we convened in September 2016 to  advance the intergovernmental dialogue on implementing data analytics  to prevent and detect improper payments highlighted the importance of  agencies inventorying existing data sources and considering how they  could be used to identify improper payments.

For hardship pay, we analyzed ALS scoring for  192 overseas posts as of October 2016 to determine whether the  hardship rates for these posts accurately reflected the scores they  received based on the ALS analysis of conditions at these posts. For the  15 posts for which ALS awarded Director Points, we reviewed the memos  approving Director Points to determine whether State adequately  documented how these posts met State\u2019s criteria. For danger pay, we  reviewed memos and other documents approving changes to danger pay  rates and analyzed these to determine whether they followed State\u2019s  methodology. We interviewed officials from various State offices,  including ALS, CGFS, and the Bureaus of Diplomatic Security (DS) and  Human Resources (HR).

To understand how State applies its processes for determining  hardship and danger pay in specific locations, we conducted a  videoconference with officials at the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince,  Haiti, and completed fieldwork at U.S. embassies in Islamabad, Pakistan;  Mexico City, Mexico; New Delhi, India; and Tunis, Tunisia. We selected  these posts for site visits based on various criteria, including their  hardship and danger pay rates, Foreign Service staffing levels, whether  they gained or lost hardship or danger pay because of the changes State  made to its process in 2015, and whether they had experienced issues  with improper payments related to these allowances.
