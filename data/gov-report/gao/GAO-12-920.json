In recent years, developing countries committed to strengthen their PFM systems and donors committed to use those systems as much as possible. The United States provides assistance to strengthen PFM systems primarily through USAID and Treasury. USAID conducts capacity building activities to strengthen PFM systems as part of its development programs and has also set a target to obligate 30 percent of its annual assistance through local systems by 2015. Treasury provides technical assistance through advisors who work in country, typically with the finance ministry.", "GAO was asked to examine the processes U.S. agencies use to (1) develop programs to strengthen PFM systems and (2) monitor and evaluate those programs.

In 2011, USAID implemented new processes that place a greater emphasis on PFM in its development efforts as the agency aims to increase its use of country systems to deliver assistance. The agency traditionally included PFM capacity-building efforts only as components of broader programs, as it identified relevant weaknesses during the country assessment or program design process. USAID\u0092s new strategy and program development processes include a mandatory assessment of a country\u0092s institutional capacity, including its financial systems, and a requirement to consider the use of country systems to deliver assistance. Most USAID country offices are required to develop a strategy using the new guidance by the end of fiscal year 2013. Treasury\u0092s process for developing programs begins with an initial assessment of the host country\u0092s capabilities. Treasury staff then draft objectives for the program. For example, a Treasury program in Honduras set four objectives, including improving operational efficiency and enhancing accountability by strengthening the organization of the ministry of finance. Once in country, the advisor develops an annual workplan, outlining more specific goals aimed at meeting the overall objectives.", "USAID and Treasury use several processes to monitor and evaluate their PFM assistance, but weaknesses exist. USAID uses its regular procedures, which may include performance management plans, periodic progress reporting, site visits, and evaluations, to monitor and evaluate its PFM-related programs. Prior reports by USAID\u0092s Inspector General and GAO have found weaknesses in USAID\u0092s implementation of its monitoring procedures in other programs, including programs from the USAID offices that provide PFM assistance. In addition, USAID is currently unable to monitor overall progress toward its target to obligate 30 percent of its program funds through local systems by 2015. USAID, and GAO in prior reports, have identified a number of weaknesses in evaluation practice. To address weaknesses the agency had identified, USAID adopted a new evaluation policy in January 2011 that states that all large projects are required to have an external evaluation, 3 percent of program budgets should be devoted to external evaluation, and evaluations must use methods that generate the highest quality evidence. Treasury\u0092s processes for monitoring and evaluating its programs include monthly reports, annual quantitative performance measures, voluntary customer feedback surveys, and on-site management reviews, but Treasury does not fully evaluate the performance of its completed technical assistance programs. In addition, Treasury\u0092s quantitative performance measures have been a useful project-level indicator of performance but have not been a useful indicator of overall performance due in part to inherent challenges associated with summarizing program performance and errors introduced when aggregating the performance data. Furthermore, a senior Treasury official reported that Treasury had not yet fully implemented a requirement to conduct independent postproject evaluations of its technical assistance programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["USAID should improve its capacity to measure its use of local systems and ensure adequate monitoring of its PFM programs.

The budget cycle  centers around four main phases: (1) budget formulation, (2) budget  execution, (3) accounting and reporting, and (4) external oversight (see  fig. 1).

They use the resources  allocated to them for items such as salaries for public servants, operating  costs for their offices, and goods and services delivered to their  beneficiaries. The ministry of finance, or equivalent, manages the flow of  funds and monitors and makes in-year adjustments to help ensure  compliance with the budget and PFM rules. Throughout the fiscal year,  each programming agency is to account for and record its expenditures.  The ministry of finance centrally consolidates these accounts. At the end  of the fiscal year, the ministry of finance, or equivalent, issues an  accounting report that demonstrates how the budget was implemented.  External or independent entities, such as a country\u2019s supreme audit  institution, may review this report.

In 2003, OECD\u2019s  Development Assistance Committee established a Working Party on Aid  Effectiveness, which has played a critical role in establishing an initial  international donor coordination framework and setting goals for donors  and aid recipient countries to strengthen PFM. The working party has  sponsored four global development forums since 2003. The second  forum, held in Paris in 2005, resulted in the Paris Declaration on Aid  Effectiveness which included broad commitments by recipient  governments and donors to strengthen PFM systems and use those  systems as appropriate.

Furthermore, according to USAID  guidance, country offices are to develop these assistance programs in  collaboration with country stakeholders throughout the program  development process. USAID\u2019s new processes are similar in structure  and approach to prior processes, but, according to USAID, aim to  incorporate more analytical rigor at all stages of the strategic planning  framework so that USAID\u2019s efforts are better aligned with the recipient  country\u2019s development efforts.", "USAID may identify the need for PFM assistance during the country  strategy development process. According to USAID, most country offices  are required to develop a Country Development Cooperation Strategy, a  5-year strategy document, by the end of fiscal year 2013. USAID\u2019s latest  draft of the guidance for developing the country strategy, released in  September 2011, states that the strategy should demonstrate how it is  integrating the goals of USAID\u2019s assistance reform effort, USAID  Forward, such as working through host-country systems and developing  the capacity of civil society and private sector partners. In developing the  country strategy document, the USAID country office is to consult with  various country stakeholders and conduct several assessments to  understand the development context and develop goals and objectives.  According to the guidance, the country office is required to develop the  strategy document with a focus on maximizing the impact of USAID  resources and build the capacity of specific institutions and related  governance systems at the national, regional, and local levels. For  example, if a USAID country office determines that a nontransparent and  inefficient financial system is a key obstacle to economic growth, the  country office is to work with the host government to improve its capacity  for sound financial management and equitable allocation of resources.  According to USAID officials, one indicator of need for a PFM project  would be an assessment that the country has a major fiscal imbalance  that needs to be corrected by a combination of increased revenue  mobilization or reduction of budget expenditures. Another indicator would  be a determination, arrived at through repeated reporting on corruption in  the media, or internal and external publications, and supported by  stakeholder interviews, that anticorruption programs would improve PFM.", "The goals and objectives outlined in the country strategy are to provide  the basis for project design, monitoring, and evaluation.

Of these analyses, we  identified two that pertain directly to PFM systems, as follows:", "Sustainability analysis. The sustainability analysis assesses the  partner government\u2019s ability to manage the continuation of the  project after the project has concluded. According to USAID  guidance, to build sustainability into a project, the design should  consider how the country office will increase the skills and  capacity of local stakeholders involved in maintaining  development gains after the project ends\u2014as well as how USAID  will ensure that relevant activities or services are gradually tied to  sustainable financing models through private sector participation  or through sustainable, publicly managed arrangements and  government processes.  Institutional analysis. An institutional analysis is an in-depth  assessment of the local institutions and systems most critical to  the implementation of the project\u2019s development interventions,  including an assessment of the quality of their leadership,  structure, and staff; and identification of their administrative and  financial management strengths and weaknesses. Using the  analysis, USAID is to develop a plan for project activities that are  necessary and sufficient to bring these institutions up to the level  of performance or engagement as partners appropriate for their  roles in the project\u2019s implementation and their eligibility for direct  USAID funding.", "According to USAID guidance, the analytical stage results in a project  authorization document that will be the basis for project  implementation, adaptation, and evaluation, which includes a  summary of the analyses that underlie the rationale for the project  design.", "Approval stage. A successful project design results in an approved  project authorization, which enables a project to move from the  planning stage to implementation. The project authorization sets out  the purpose and duration of the project, defines fundamental terms  and conditions of the assistance when a partner country agreement is  anticipated, and approves an overall total budget level, subject to the  availability of funds.", "In addition to the above analyses, USAID has developed a PFM risk- assessment framework (PFMRAF) to measure the fiduciary risk, or the  risk of funds being misspent or mismanaged, when USAID plans to  provide aid through the country\u2019s finance systems. USAID guidance  commits country offices to offer, if appropriate, a USAID assessment of  partner country PFM systems with the goal of providing funding for project  implementation through the use of those systems. If the offer is accepted,  the assessment must be carried out using the PFMRAF. Whenever  possible, USAID should begin conducting the PFMRAF during the  conceptual stage of the project design process. The PFMRAF consists of  the following five stages:  1.  The Rapid Appraisal provides a high-level snapshot of country-level  fiduciary risks associated with the use of partner country PFM  systems and helps inform decisions on whether to undertake a more  rigorous, formal risk assessment.  2.  The Risk Assessment, Analysis, Mitigation, and the Approval for  Use of Partner Country Systems establishes the baseline level of  risk corresponding to contemplated funding levels and identifies  vulnerabilities of the partner country PFM sector in which USAID is  considering use of the system for project implementation. USAID  determines whether any systemic risk can be reasonably mitigated  and, if so, what kind of mitigating measures might be introduced to  reduce the risk. USAID establishes an accountability framework with a  set of conditions that would, if complied with, constitute formal  approval for the use of a partner country PFM system.  3.  The Project Design, Approval, Designation of Responsibilities,  and Selection of the Funding Mechanism incorporates the approval  of use of country systems into the project design, includes risk  mitigation measures, such as capacity-building technical assistance,  concurrent audits, and disbursements in tranches, as appropriate, and  the appropriate funding mechanism.  4.  Negotiating and Preparing the Bilateral Project Agreement with  the Partner Country Government involves the preparation of the  bilateral agreement in accordance with the risk mitigation measures  outlined in the approval for use of partner country systems and in  collaboration with the partner country government.  5.  Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation occurs once both  countries agree to the bilateral agreement and as outlined in the  project design.", "According to USAID, the country office is to incorporate recommendations  on actions to mitigate identified risks to providing assistance directly to  the host government into various stages of the project design. According  to one USAID official, the country office\u2019s decision to implement the  recommended steps for mitigating risk may depend on the availability of  funds. According to USAID, if risks cannot be mitigated, USAID is not to  deliver assistance through the partner country\u2019s financial systems.  Mitigation steps may include adding a PFM component to a project, such  as technical assistance to improve an aspect of the financial system.

According to OTA officials, OTA receives two to three requests  for assistance per month, but due to the agency\u2019s limited financial  resources and the financial commitment required for each project, it  selectively chooses its projects. OTA\u2019s principles for providing assistance  are as follows: work with partners committed to ownership of their reform; advocate self-reliance by providing countries with knowledge and  skills required to generate and manage their own resources and  reduce dependence on international aid; and work with ministry staff daily to build capacity through mentoring and  on-the-job training on PFM practices.", "After receiving the request, OTA begins a preliminary assessment  process to identify weaknesses and areas for assistance, according to  OTA officials. The preliminary assessment is primarily a review of  available information on the country\u2019s PFM system, which may include  information from the U.S. embassy, as well as relevant country reports  and assessments prepared by international financial institutions, other  bilateral assistance providers, and nongovernmental organizations. After  reviewing documents, if it decides to proceed with the assessment, OTA  completes a more in-depth, in-country assessment of PFM, which  consists of meetings with U.S. embassy staff, other donors, and relevant  ministry officials, including the minister of finance or the head of the  central bank, as well as high-level policy staff and mid-level supervisors.  According to OTA officials, the purpose of the in-country assessment is to  review the structural issues related to the country system and determine  whether the country has dedicated staff committed to working toward their  reform efforts. At any point during the assessment process, OTA may  determine that OTA assistance is not suitable for the country\u2019s needs.  OTA officials told us that in one such case, government officials  requested that OTA manage their budget for them, which is against  OTA\u2019s principles because doing so would not promote self-reliance or  help the country develop the capacity to generate and better manage its  own revenues. Finally, OTA officials told us that their decision on whether  to provide assistance depends on whether sufficient funding is available.", "The in-country assessment typically results in a draft of official terms of  reference, which identifies weaknesses to be addressed during OTA\u2019s  engagement. According to OTA officials, the terms of reference describes  the broad goals of the project and represents agreement between  Treasury and the host-country counterpart, the ministry staff with whom  the advisor will work on a daily basis. For example, the 2010 terms of  reference for a budget project in Honduras identified the following four  agreed-upon areas for assistance:  improve operational efficiency and enhance accountability by  strengthening the organization of the ministry of finance; move toward compliance with International Public Sector Accounting enhance capacity to conduct fiscal analysis and produce more reliable  macroeconomic estimates and revenue and expenditure projections;  and  conduct workshops on basic finance methods and terminology.", "The terms of reference also identifies the advisor\u2019s host-country  counterparts and agreements regarding each party\u2019s responsibilities.  According to OTA officials, after OTA fully vets a project and secures  funding, the parties finalize and sign the terms of reference. However,  OTA and its counterparts may seek to revise the terms of reference if the  central purpose of the technical assistance project changes or during  times of transition, such as when a finance minister changes. In  Honduras, the 2010 terms of reference replaced an existing OTA project  following a gap in OTA assistance during a political crisis in the Honduran  government in 2009.", "The OTA advisor assigned to the country uses the broad goals expressed  in the terms of reference to develop a work plan. The work plan contains  specific objectives, milestones, and planned completion dates designed  to work toward goals agreed upon in the terms of reference, and the plan  must be developed within 60 days of the advisor arriving in-country. Each  work plan covers a 1-year period and is the primary basis for regular  monthly progress reports to OTA headquarters.

The project data in USAID\u2019s  accounting system does not provide sufficiently detailed information, such  as the location of the organization receiving assistance, to identify  qualifying assistance. According to a senior USAID official, the agency is  working on a system whereby it will tag each entity receiving assistance  with an identifier, such as government or not-for-profit organization, as  well as a vendor location signifying U.S.-based or non-U.S. based.  According to the official, this tagging process will facilitate identifying use  of country systems.

The work plan is the key  document OTA uses to monitor a project. OTA uses monthly reports to  document and monitor progress toward the milestones identified in the  annual work plan, including changes to milestones or timelines, and to  facilitate communication between the resident advisors and headquarters.  OTA advisors may also share monthly reports with host-country  counterpart institutions, U.S. embassy staff, other Treasury bureaus and  offices, and other interested partners such as USAID, the Millennium  Challenge Corporation, and relevant international financial institutions to  monitor progress and coordinate donor assistance as relevant. In addition  to updates on work-plan progress, the monthly reports may also include  other information such as activities completed; significant meetings held;  and important political, social, and economic developments. OTA also  uses monthly reports to track changes made to the work plan agreed to  by the advisor and his or her counterpart. For example, an OTA budget  project in Cambodia listed implementation of program budgeting as one  its primary objectives and improving budget classification as one its  secondary objectives. In the monthly reports, the resident advisor  documented the need to refocus the reform efforts on budget  classification to better align with the Cambodian government\u2019s ongoing  PFM reform efforts. Further, in the case of OTA\u2019s 2011 Honduras budget  project to implement international public sector accounting standards, the  objectives remained unchanged, but milestones were changed in the  monthly reports. According to the advisor, some milestones had to be  extended due to overly ambitious initial expectations that were purposely  established to encourage the ministry staff to undertake reforms. See  appendix IV for descriptions of OTA-funded PFM projects in our case  study countries.", "OTA headquarters also maintains regular communication with its  advisors. Senior OTA officials monitor project performance through  regular contact with advisors in the field by e-mail, telephone, and site  visits. One advisor told us that their director would already be aware of  any issues raised in the monthly reports, given the frequency of their  communications. Resident advisors also told us that senior Treasury staff  visited Cambodia and Honduras to review OTA projects and talk with  counterparts. Following site visits, OTA officials are required to prepare  trip reports. For example, in a trip report from November 2011, a senior  OTA official reported that he met with host-country counterparts to  discuss the four current OTA engagements in Cambodia, including the  budget project. The visit confirmed the reported difficulties in  implementing the government financial management information system  as a result of a procurement delay, but also affirmed OTA\u2019s role in its  eventual implementation. OTA also uses voluntary customer surveys to  collect feedback on OTA projects from the host-country counterpart.

Our review was not intended to be comprehensive or applicable  to all OTA projects. We found the projects to be clearly defined with  specific objectives, milestones, proposed completion dates, and regularly  submitted monthly reports. In addition, in all three cases, the resident  advisor reported frequent communication on project progress with  headquarters. However, in two of the case study countries, Cambodia  and South Africa, work plans had major changes in objectives, but only  Cambodia documented its change in a monthly report. Additionally, our  review found that the level of detail of the monthly report narratives on  progress varied, with a few reports having little detail, which could make  tracking progress for these specific projects difficult without other  communication between the advisor and OTA management. However, as  noted above, OTA headquarters maintained frequent communication with  advisors in the field.", "OTA\u2019s quantitative performance measures have been a useful project- level indicator of performance but have not been a useful indicator of  OTA-wide performance because of conceptual problems and errors  introduced by OTA when aggregating the performance data. OTA  advisors and management score technical assistance projects annually  based on project-specific indicators under four main categories. The  projects are scored on a scale of one (lowest) to five (highest) for  \u201ctraction,\u201d or the degree of engagement with host-country counterparts,  and \u201cimpact,\u201d or the results of project activities that bring about change in  counterpart law, systems, processes, and procedures. OTA officials told  us that the traction and impact measures also reflect the language and  values of OTA, and are useful to management, advisors, and host- country counterparts. The primary purpose of the quantitative  performance scores was to respond to an Office of Management and  Budget reporting requirement for evaluation data. While OTA reported  that it met or exceeded targets for traction and impact set in 2008, in  every year from 2009 through 2011, OTA officials acknowledged that the  aggregate values associated with its annual goals were of limited value  due to lack of comparability across programs and over time. In previous  work on the Office of Management and Budget, we highlighted the  difficulty of representing program performance with a single rating.  Using a single rating can force agencies to simplify more nuanced and  complex performance results, a circumstance similar to OTA\u2019s  aggregation of traction and impact scores. A senior official told us that  OTA, in complying with the OMB requirement, designed the measures to  be as useful as possible at the project level.  For example, OTA uses the  project-level traction and impact measures in setting expectations and  discussing progress with both the host-country counterpart and the  advisor.  In addition, the official reported that OTA is continually looking  for additional ways to use the traction and impact scores.  One example  of how researchers have used PFM performance data is by developing  analytical approaches to identify the determinants of strong PFM systems  and elements of successful PFM reform efforts, which can help to control  for important differences across countries.", "Our analysis of OTA performance data found several errors that OTA  introduced when aggregating project-level data; these errors collectively  raised questions about the reliability of the instrument used to aggregate  OTA\u2019s quantitative performance measures and, thus, suggested there  may be limitations in its ability to provide insight into performance across  OTA projects. OTA uses this instrument to calculate the annual  performance averages which are compared against annual targets and  provided to OMB and to Congress in annual reports. Our analysis of the  spreadsheet containing these data, and limited spot checking of some  underlying data for our three case-study countries, identified a number of  errors, including those introduced when transcribing data to the  spreadsheet.

OTA guidance for project reporting and documentation includes  requirements for end-of-tour reports when a resident advisor leaves and  end-of-project reports when a technical assistance project is completed.  The end-of-project report is a postproject evaluation whose purpose is to  (1) compare accomplishments with the initial objectives of the project and  (2) improve the planning and execution of future projects. A senior OTA  official said that the requirement for the end-of-tour report was fully  implemented and that OTA intended to fully implement the end-of-project  report requirement by the end of 2012. According to the guidance, the  evaluation must be conducted independently; the report is the  responsibility of the associate director and can be delegated to a senior  advisor, but it should not be prepared by an advisor who prepared an  end-of-tour report. Both OECD guidance and USAID guidance also  highlight the importance of independence in evaluation. In contrast to the  guidance, OTA provided three end-of-project reports that were conducted  by OTA staff who had been involved in providing some of the technical  assistance being evaluated. While no comprehensive and fully  independent end-of-project evaluation has been conducted, OTA officials  described relevant insights from a postproject trip to one country that was  undertaken by a senior OTA official in part to better understand the  longer-term impact of OTA assistance.

Given USAID\u2019s stated goal of obligating 30 percent of annual  assistance through local systems, including partner country PFM  systems, by 2015, it must ensure that those systems are functioning  properly and transparently. Efforts to strengthen PFM systems can lower  the risks that assistance delivered through country systems will be  misspent, while also increasing the capacity of the recipient country to  effectively manage its own resources. Given concerns about  transparency and corruption in many aid-recipient countries, achieving  the expected benefits of using recipient countries\u2019 PFM systems may be  difficult without concerted efforts by the donors and countries to  strengthen these systems. In addition, the risks to using these systems  are increased without efforts to strengthen them. To help strengthen  these systems, USAID provides developing countries with PFM capacity- building assistance. In light of this assistance, and given the difficulties  USAID has experienced in the past with implementing monitoring and  evaluation practices, the importance of developing efforts to strengthen  PFM systems and effectively monitoring and evaluating these efforts has  increased significantly. Previous difficulties USAID has experienced with  regard to monitoring, including poor quality of reported data on projects,  and the lack of reliable baseline data, could affect USAID\u2019s ability to  conduct effective evaluations of these projects, as evaluators will not  have access to reliable data. Also, while USAID\u2019s new evaluation policy  places greater emphasis on impact evaluations and experimental  methods, it may be difficult for USAID to evaluate its PFM capacity- building efforts using these approaches. Finally, for USAID to achieve its  target for use of local systems, by fiscal year 2015, it must be able to  identify and measure the full extent of assistance that qualifies.", "Treasury OTA advisors provide technical assistance targeted at  weaknesses in countries\u2019 PFM systems. Although OTA has taken  numerous steps to monitor this assistance, errors in its aggregated  performance data and the lack of comprehensive postproject evaluations  limit OTA\u2019s ability to effectively evaluate its assistance. OTA has adapted  a challenging mandate from OMB to create a useful measure of its efforts\u2019  performance for management, advisors, and host-country counterparts;  however, conceptual problems with and errors in the aggregated  measures undermine the measures\u2019 reliability. With greater confidence in  the quality of the data, opportunities exist to better identify patterns in  performance across OTA programs, such as economic or institutional  factors that influence program performance. These patterns could help  OTA better understand the strengths and weaknesses of its assistance  programs and make appropriate changes. OTA could also use the  quantitative performance measurement system it has developed to  experiment and document the results of new approaches. Finally,  although OTA guidance recognizes the importance of postproject  evaluations by including in its guidance the requirements for an end-of- project evaluation, the agency has yet to enforce this requirement.

The six dimensions are the following:", "Credibility of the budget: The budget is realistic and is implemented  as intended.", "Comprehensiveness and transparency: The budget and the fiscal  risk oversight are comprehensive, and fiscal and budget information is  accessible to the public.", "Policy-based budgeting: The budget is prepared with due regard to  government policy.", "Predictability and control in budget execution: The budget is  implemented in an orderly and predictable manner, and arrangements  for the exercise of control and stewardship in the use of public funds  exist.", "Accounting, recording, and reporting: Adequate records and  information are produced, maintained, and disseminated to meet  decision-making control, management, and reporting purposes.", "External scrutiny and audit: Arrangements for scrutiny of public  finances and follow up by executive are operating.", "The six core dimensions include 28 high-level indicators, each of which is  assigned a letter score from A to D. The initial assessment helps  establish performance baselines, while repeat assessments help in  monitoring performance progress over time.", "In 2011, the PEFA secretariat released the 2010 PEFA Monitoring  Report. Based on a comparison of 33 repeat PEFA assessments over the  2005-2010 period, the analysis shows that more countries had a higher  number of highest or improved scores (23 countries) than lowest or  worsened scores (8 countries), indicating a broad trend of PFM  improvement across the countries surveyed. According to the analysis,  while PFM systems are improving overall, systems features vary  significantly. Formal PFM features where progress can be achieved  through adopting a new law, regulation, or technical tool, or focusing on  no more than a few agencies, or at an early stage in the budget cycle are  more likely to improve or maintain a high score than functional PFM  features where progress requires actually implementing a new law or  regulation, or coordinating the work of many agencies, or working later in  the budget cycle.", "Starting July 2012, the PEFA partners are extending the PEFA program  by 5 years and conducting a comprehensive review of the PEFA  Framework, the first since it was launched in 2005. One of the objectives  is to improve confidence in PEFA assessments through an endorsement  process that provides an incentive to ensure adherence to PEFA good  practices in undertaking an assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "World Bank\u2019s Quality of Budgetary and Financial Management Indicator", "paragraphs": ["The World Bank undertakes annual Country Policy and Institutional  Assessments to assess the quality of a country\u2019s present policy and  institutional framework. One of the 16 indicators the World Bank uses to  assess the performance of a country\u2019s current policies and institutions is  the quality of budgetary and financial management. This criterion  assesses the extent to which the country has a comprehensive and  credible budget linked to policy priorities; effective financial management  systems to ensure that the budget is implemented as intended in a  controlled and predictable way; and timely and accurate accounting and  fiscal reporting. Over the 5-year period from 2005 through 2010, 26 out of  73 countries, or slightly more than one-third, showed improvements in the  quality of their PFM systems, while 19 countries\u2019 scores worsened.

The objective of the Country Financial  Accountability Assessments is to support the World Bank\u2019s development  objectives by identifying strengths and weaknesses in country PFM  systems. The assessments are intended to help identify priorities and  inform the design and implementation of capacity-building programs. The  assessments also describe and analyze financial management and  expenditure controls, including expenditure monitoring, accounting and  financial reporting, internal controls, internal and external auditing, and  legislative review. Information obtained from the assessments, taken  together with that obtained from other World Bank diagnostic products  and other sources, supports the preparation of an integrated fiduciary  assessment. The results of these assessments inform the preparation of  the World Bank\u2019s Country Assistance Strategy, particularly the sections  dealing with the size of the support program, the sectors to be supported,  selection of lending instruments, and approaches to risk management.

Under the  Fiscal Transparency Review Process (FTRP), OMA reviews central  governments expected to receive bilateral economic assistance and  international security assistance for several dimensions of transparency:  publicly disclosed budget, budget breakdown by ministry, standards for  awarding natural resource contracts, and timely and accurate  documents. Each year, OMA reviews all countries it deemed  nontransparent in the prior year, and countries where recent events may  have affected fiscal transparency to evaluate whether they meet the  threshold of fiscal transparency. State uses the IMF\u2019s definition of fiscal  transparency as a guideline for the FTRP. During this process, OMA  officials said they obtain information about the level of transparency of  each country by collecting information from U.S. embassy staff working in  those countries. In addition, OMA staff review publicly available reports  published by international organizations and civil society representatives,  such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, International  Budget Partnership, and the World Economic Forum. Because these  organizations do not always prepare country reports on an annual basis,  officials told us they use these reports as a check on their internally  generated information, rather than relying on them as primary sources of  information. For countries that State finds to be nontransparent, State can  issue a waiver that allows the country to receive otherwise restricted  assistance. As part of the process of requesting a waiver, embassy staff  in country develop action plans to assist the country in improving the level  of transparency in its budget process. The action plan should address  specific fiscal transparency issues identified in the transparency review  process and should include recommendations of short- and long-term  steps that the countries can take to improve budget transparency.  Embassies work with host governments to encourage implementation of  action plans, which may include activities such as continued daily  engagement with country officials working on budget reforms, providing  training and coordinating training on issues related to the budget process,  and funding local nongovernmental organizations to perform budget  oversight functions.", "For OMA\u2019s DF4D initiative, State officials, working with other agencies  and organizations, helped develop programs based on needs expressed  by country government officials that built on existing reform efforts and  development priorities. As an interagency effort, OMA helps identify and  leverage existing programs and resources, such as those of multilateral  organizations and other donors, such as USAID\u2019s Innovation Fund and  the Global Health Initiative. For example, USAID is implementing a $7.6  million program to advance El Salvador\u2019s fiscal reform agenda by building  capacity and improving systems for public expenditure and management  and tax revenue mobilization, promoting private sector engagement, and  creating a $2 million Revenue Challenge Fund to support improved tax  collection at the municipal level. With five countries piloting DF4D, State  plans to proceed by selecting additional partner countries based on  performance against quantitative DF4D-related measures, consultations  with posts, and expressions of interest from ministers of finance and other  economic leaders. Moreover, State plans to use action plans developed  for FTRP for countries to be considered for DF4D.
