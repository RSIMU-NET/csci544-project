Effects on insurers' investments, underwriting performance, and premium revenues were also limited. However, some life insurers that offered variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, as well as financial and mortgage guaranty insurers, were more affected by their exposures to the distressed equity and mortgage markets. The crisis had a generally minor effect on policyholders, but some mortgage and financial guaranty policyholders--banks and other commercial entities--received partial claims or faced decreased availability of coverage.", "Actions by state and federal regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), among other factors, helped limit the effects of the crisis. First, state insurance regulators shared more information with each other to focus their oversight activities. In response to transparency issues highlighted by American International Group, Inc.'s securities lending program, NAIC required more detailed reports from insurers. Also, a change in methodology by NAIC to help better reflect the value of certain securities also reduced the risk-based capital some insurers had to hold. To further support insurers' capital levels, some states and NAIC also changed reporting requirements for certain assets. These changes affected insurers' capital levels for regulatory purposes, but rating agency officials said they did not have a significant effect on insurers' financial condition. Several federal programs also provided support to qualified insurers. Finally, insurance business practices, regulatory restrictions, and a low interest rate environment helped reduce the effects of the crisis.", "NAIC and state regulators' efforts since the crisis have included an increased focus on insurers' risks and capital adequacy, and oversight of noninsurance entities in group holding company structures. The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment, an internal assessment of insurers' business plan risks, will apply to most insurers and is expected to take effect in 2015. NAIC also amended its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act to address the issues of transparency and oversight of holding company entities.

Realized losses of $59.6 billion contributed to steep  declines in life insurers\u2019 net income that year. The realized losses  stemmed from other-than-temporary impairments on long-term bonds  (primarily mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) and from the sale of  equities whose values had recently declined. A dozen large life  insurance groups accounted for 77 percent of the total realized losses in  2008, with AIG alone, accounting for 45 percent of the realized losses.", "As illustrated in figure 3, life insurers\u2019 net income decreased from 2007 to  2008, from positive income of $31.9 billion to negative income (a loss) of  $52.2 billion. However, it rebounded back to positive income of $21.4  billion in 2009, largely as a result of decreased underwriting losses and  expenses.

As with realized losses,  AIG accounted for 47 percent of total unrealized losses, and seven large  insurance groups accounted for another 35 percent (see app. II). The  majority of the unrealized losses occurred in common stocks and other  invested assets (e.g., investments in limited partnerships and joint  venture entities). However, the unrealized losses and declines in net  income were addressed by a substantial increase in capital infusions from  issuance of company stock or debt in the primary market, transfer of  existing assets from the holding company, or, notably, from agreements  with the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve (see paid in capital or surplus  in fig. 4). AIG accounted for more than half (55 percent) of the capital  infusions in 2008, reflecting an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for the   Some other large life  Treasury\u2019s purchase of about $40 billion in equity.insurance companies\u2014through their holding companies\u2014were also able  to raise needed capital through equity or debt issuance, or through the  transfer of existing assets from the holding companies.

Life insurers\u2019 capital,  increased by 15 percent, to $291.9 billion, from 2008 to 2009, partly as a  result of the increase in net income. By 2011, life insurers had net  unrealized gains of $20.8 billion, indicating improvements in the value of  their investment portfolios.", "During the crisis, aggregated stock prices of publicly traded life insurers  declined substantially. As figure 5 illustrates, aggregate stock prices  (based on an index of 21 life insurance companies) began falling in  November 2007 and had declined by a total of 79 percent by February  2009. Although prices rose starting in March 2009, they had not  rebounded to pre-2008 levels by the end of 2011. In comparison, the New  York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite Index declined by a total of 55  percent during the same time period.

Realized losses of $25.5 billion contributed to the decline in net  income. Seven P/C insurance groups, including six large groups and one  smaller financial guaranty insurance group, accounted for 47 percent of  the realized losses in 2008. The realized losses resulted primarily from  other-than-temporary impairments taken on certain bonds and preferred  and common stocks. Net underwriting losses of $19.6 billion (compared  to net underwriting gains of $21.6 billion in 2007) also affected net income  for the P/C industry in 2008, as did declines in net investment income and  other factors. Many of the insurers with the greatest declines in net  income from 2007 to 2008 were primarily financial and mortgage guaranty  companies.", "P/C insurers\u2019 capital also declined from 2007 to 2008, to $466.6 billion (a  12 percent decline). Although the reduction in net income was a major  factor in the capital decline, unrealized losses of $85.6 billion also played  a role. The greatest unrealized losses occurred in common stocks and  other invested assets. Three large P/C insurance groups accounted for  55 percent of the losses. Capital infusions mitigated the decline in capital,  as illustrated in figure 6, and P/C insurers or their holding companies  continued to pay stockholder dividends. P/C insurers\u2019 capital increased by  11.6 percent and 8.3 percent from the previous year, respectively, in 2009  and 2010.", "Aggregated stock prices of publicly traded P/C companies declined less  severely than those of life insurance companies during the crisis. As  figure 5 demonstrates, P/C companies, like life insurance companies, saw  their lowest stock prices in February 2009, representing a 40 percent  decline from the highest closing price in December 2007. However, prices  had rebounded to 2006 levels by mid-to-late 2009 and remained there  through 2011. See appendix II for additional analysis of stock prices.", "While regulators we interviewed stated that most life and P/C insurers\u2019  strong capital positions just before the crisis helped minimize liquidity  challenges during the crisis, many still experienced pressures on capital  and liquidity. For example, a representative of the life insurance industry  and a regulator noted that it was extremely challenging for most  insurers\u2014as well as banks and other financial services companies\u2014to  independently raise external capital during this time, which led to some  insurers\u2019 participation in federal programs designed to enhance liquidity.  In addition, some life insurers were required to hold additional capital  because of rating downgrades to some of their investments. Mortgage  and financial guaranty insurers with heavy exposure to mortgages and  mortgage-related securities experienced liquidity issues later in the crisis,  when mortgage defaults resulted in unprecedented levels of claims. In  addition to maintaining the ability to pay claims, it is important for insurers  to meet minimum capital standards to maintain their credit ratings, which  help them attract policyholders and investors.", "During this period few insurance companies failed\u2014less than 1 percent.  The number of life and P/C companies that go into receivership and  liquidation tends to vary from year to year with no clear trend (see table  1). While the number of life insurers being placed into receivership  peaked in 2009, receiverships and liquidations for P/C companies in 2009  were generally consistent with other years (except 2008, when incidences  declined). Specifically, throughout the 10-year review period, life  insurance receiverships and liquidations averaged about 6 and 4 per  year, respectively. In 2009, there were 12 receiverships and 6  liquidations. P/C receiverships and liquidations averaged about 15 and 13  per year, respectively; in 2009, there were 15 receiverships and 13  liquidations. However, these companies represented a small fraction of  active companies in those years. There were more than 1,100 active  individual life companies and 3,000 active individual P/C companies from  2007 through 2009. Appendix II provides information on the assets and  net equity (assets minus liabilities) of insurers that were liquidated from  2002 through 2011.", "Some regulators and insurance industry representatives we interviewed  stated that receiverships and liquidations that occurred during and  immediately after the financial crisis were generally not related directly to  the crisis. While one regulator stated that the crisis might have  exacerbated insurers\u2019 existing solvency issues, regulators said that most  companies that were placed under receivership during that time had been  experiencing financial issues for several years. Regulators and industry  officials we interviewed noted two exceptions to this statement; both were  life insurance companies that had invested heavily in Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac securities and in other troubled debt securities. See  appendix III for a profile of one of these companies.", "As noted above, for most insurers investment income is one of the two  primary revenue streams. Insurers\u2019 net investment income declined  slightly during the crisis but had rebounded by 2011.", "In the life and P/C  industries in 2008 and 2009, insurers\u2019 net income from investments  declined by 7 percent and 15 percent respectively from the previous year  (see fig. 7). For life insurers, these declines primarily reflected declines in  income on certain common and preferred stock, derivatives, cash and  short term investments, and other invested assets. For P/C insurers, the  declines primarily reflected declines in income on U.S. government  bonds, certain common stock, cash and short-term investments, and  other invested assets.", "Table 2 illustrates the percentages of life and P/C insurers\u2019 gross  investment income derived from various types of investments. Bonds  were the largest source of investment income in both industries, and they  increased as a percentage of gross investment income during the crisis.  Life and P/C insurers\u2019 income from other types of investments, such as  contract loans, cash, and short-term investments, decreased during the  crisis as a percentage of their gross investment income. According to  insurance industry representatives and a regulator, going forward, low  interest rates are expected to produce lower investment returns than in  the past, reducing insurers\u2019 investment income and likely pressuring  insurers to increase revenue from their underwriting activities. Although  life and P/C companies had some exposure to MBS (including residential  and commercial MBS, known respectively as RMBS and CMBS) from  2002 through 2011, as part of insurers\u2019 total bond portfolios, these  securities did not present significant challenges. In both industries,  investments in derivatives constituted a negligible amount of exposure  and investment income and were generally used to hedge other risks the  insurers faced.", "Life and P/C insurers\u2019 underwriting performance declined modestly during  the crisis. In the life industry, benefits and losses that life insurers incurred  in 2008 and 2009 outweighed the net premiums they wrote (see fig. 8).  A few large insurance groups accounted for the majority of the gap  between premiums written and benefits and losses incurred during these  2 years. For example, one large life insurance group incurred $61.3 billion  more in benefits and losses than it wrote in premiums in 2009.  variable annuities with guarantees purchased before the crisis were \u201cin  the money,\u201d meaning that the policyholders\u2019 account values were  significantly less than the promised benefits on their accounts, so the  policyholders were being credited with the guaranteed minimum instead  of the lower rates actually being earned. Thus, policyholders were more  likely to stay in their variable annuities during the crisis because they  were able to obtain higher returns than they could obtain on other  financial products.", "From 2007 to 2008, the P/C industry\u2019s underwriting losses increased as a  percentage of their earned premiums (loss ratio), and the average  combined ratio\u2014a measure of insurer underwriting performance\u2014rose  from 95 percent to 104 percent, indicating that companies incurred more  in claims and expenses than they received from premiums. However, as  illustrated in figure 9, the ratios during the crisis were not substantially  different from those in the surrounding years. As discussed later in this  report, financial and mortgage guaranty insurers\u2019 combined ratios were  particularly high and contributed to the elevated overall P/C industry  combined ratios from 2008 going forward. P/C insurance industry  representatives we interviewed told us that the P/C market was in the  midst of a \u201csoft\u201d period in the insurance cycle leading into the crisis. Such  soft periods are generally characterized by insurers charging lower  premiums in competition to gain market share. In addition, timing of  certain catastrophic events in the P/C industry overlapped with crisis- related events. For example, one state regulator noted that in the same  week in September 2008 that AIG\u2019s liquidity issues became publicly  known, Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast. According to NAIC analysis,  this resulted in significant underwriting losses for many P/C insurers.  NAIC determined that Hurricane Ike, as well as two other hurricanes and  two tropical storms, contributed to more than half of the P/C industry\u2019s  estimated $25.2 billion in catastrophic losses in 2008, which represented  a threefold increase from the prior year. While the crisis may have  exacerbated certain aspects of this cycle, it is difficult to determine the  extent to which underwriting losses were a result of the crisis as opposed  to the existing soft market or the weather events of 2008.", "As noted previously, a few industry representatives and a regulator we  interviewed stated that decreased investment returns may place more  pressure on insurers to increase the profitability of their underwriting  operations. As shown in figures 10 and 11, life and P/C insurers\u2019 net  investment gains have historically outweighed their net underwriting  losses. As shown in figure 10, life insurers experienced net underwriting  losses during every year of our review period, with the greatest losses  occurring in 2008.", "Effects on premium revenues were primarily confined to individual  annuities in a handful of large insurers. In the life industry, net premiums  written declined by 19 percent from 2008 to 2009 to $495.6 billion,  reflecting decreases in all four of the lines we reviewed\u2014group and  individual life insurance and group and individual annuities\u2014with the  largest decline in individual annuities (see fig. 12).", "Individual annuity premium revenues decreased more than for other life  products because these products\u2019 attractiveness to consumers is based  on the guarantees insurers can provide. During the crisis, insurers offered  smaller guarantees, because insurers generally base their guarantees on  what they can earn on their own investments, and returns on their  investments had declined. A small group of large companies contributed  heavily to the decreases in this area. For example, one large life  insurance group accounted for 6 percent of all individual annuity  premiums in 2008 and 65 percent of the decreases in that area from 2008  to 2009. Another seven life insurance groups accounted for an additional  29 percent of individual annuity premiums and 25 percent of decreases in  that area from 2008 to 2009. By 2011, net premiums in individual  annuities had rebounded beyond their precrisis levels.", "P/C insurers\u2019 net premiums written declined by a total of 6 percent from  2007 through 2009, primarily reflecting decreases in the commercial lines  segment. In the lines we reviewed, auto lines saw a slight decline in net  premiums written, but insurers actually wrote an increased amount of  homeowners insurance. One insurance industry representative we  interviewed stated that the recession caused many consumers to keep  their old vehicles or buy used vehicles rather than buying new ones, a  development that negatively affected net premiums written for auto  insurance. Financial and mortgage guaranty insurers experienced  respective declines of 43 percent and 14 percent in net premiums written  from 2008 to 2009.", "As noted, many life insurers that offered variable annuities with GLBs  experienced strains on their capital when the equities market declined  during the crisis. Specifically, beginning in the early 2000s many life  insurers began offering GLBs as optional riders on their variable annuity  products. In general, these riders provided a guaranteed minimum benefit  based on the amount invested, and variable annuity holders typically  focused their investments on equities. From 2002 through 2007, when the  stock market was performing well, insurers sold a large volume of  variable annuities (for example, as table 3 shows, they sold $184 billion in  2007). As illustrated in table 3, as of 2006 (the earliest point for which  data were available), most new variable annuities included GLBs. These  insurers had established complex hedging programs to protect  themselves from the risks associated with the GLBs. However, according  to a life insurance industry representative and regulators we interviewed,  when the equities market declined beginning in late 2007, meeting the  GLBs\u2019 obligations negatively impacted insurers\u2019 capital levels as life  insurers were required to hold additional reserves to ensure they could  meet their commitments to policyholders. According to a few regulators  and a life insurance industry representative we interviewed, ongoing low  interest rates have recently forced some life insurers to raise prices on  GLBs or lower the guarantees they will offer on new products.", "In the P/C industry, the financial and mortgage guaranty lines were  severely affected by the collapse of the real estate market. As noted  earlier, these lines represented less than 2 percent of the total P/C  industry\u2019s average annual written premiums from 2002 through 2011 and  are unique in that they carry a high level of exposure to mortgages and  mortgage-related securities. Mortgage guaranty insurers primarily insured  large volumes of individual mortgages underwritten by banks by  promising to pay claims to lenders in the event of a borrower default  (private mortgage insurance). Financial guaranty insurers also were  involved in insuring asset-backed securities (ABS), which included  RMBS. Additionally, these insurers insured collateralized debt obligations  (CDO), many of which contained RMBS. These insurers guaranteed  continued payment of interest and principal to investors if borrowers did  not pay. These credit protection products included credit default swaps.", "Financial and mortgage guaranty insurers we interviewed stated that prior  to the crisis, these two industries operated under common assumptions  about the real estate market and its risk characteristics\u2014namely, that  housing values would continue to rise, that borrowers would continue to  prioritize their mortgage payments before other financial obligations, and  that the housing market would not experience a nationwide collapse. As a  result of these common assumptions, these insurers underwrote  unprecedented levels of risk in the period preceding the crisis. For  example, according to a mortgage guaranty industry association annual  report, the association\u2019s members wrote $352.2 billion of new business in  2007, up from $265.7 billion in 2006. A financial guaranty industry  representative told us that the industry had guaranteed about $30 billion  to $40 billion in CDOs backed by ABS.", "The unforeseen and unprecedented rate of defaults in the residential  housing market beginning in 2007 adversely impacted underwriting  performance significantly for mortgage and financial guaranty insurers. As  shown in table 4, combined ratios\u2014a measure of insurer performance\u2014 increased considerably for both industries beginning in 2008, with  mortgage guaranty insurers\u2019 combined ratios peaking at 135 percent in  both 2010 and 2011. In 2008 and later, several insurers in these two  industries had combined ratios exceeding 200 percent.", "Financial and mortgage guaranty insurers are generally required to store  up contingency reserves in order to maintain their ability to pay claims in  adverse economic conditions. However, during the crisis, many insurers  faced challenges maintaining adequate capital as they increased  reserves to pay future claims. This led to ratings downgrades across both  the financial and mortgage guaranty insurance industries beginning in  early 2008. For example, in January 2008, Fitch Ratings downgraded the  financial strength rating of Ambac Financial Group, Inc., a financial  guaranty insurer, from AAA to AA, and Standard & Poor\u2019s placed  Ambac\u2019s AAA rating on a negative rating watch. Standard & Poor\u2019s  downgraded the ratings of AMBAC and MBIA, Inc. (also a financial  guaranty insurer) from AAA to AA in June 2008, and Fitch Ratings  downgraded MGIC Investment Corp. and PMI Group, Inc.\u2014the two  largest mortgage insurers\u2014from AA to A+ in June 2008. These  downgrades had a detrimental impact on insurers\u2019 capital standing and  ability to write new business. For example, because ratings reflect  insurers\u2019 creditworthiness (in other words, their ability to pay claims), the  value of an insurer\u2019s guaranty was a function of its credit rating. Thus  when an insurer receives a credit rating downgrade, the guaranty it  provides is less valuable to potential customers. Additionally, credit  ratings downgrades sometimes required insurers to post additional  collateral at a time when their ability to raise capital was most  constrained.", "According to industry representatives and insurers we interviewed,  financial and mortgage guaranty insurers generally had what were  believed to be sufficient levels of capital in the period leading into the  crisis, but they had varying degrees of success in shoring up their capital  in response to the crisis. Industry representatives and insurers also stated  that early in the crisis, liquidity was generally not an issue, as insurers  were invested in liquid securities and continued to receive cash flows  from premium payments. However, as defaults increased and resulted in  unprecedented levels of claims in 2008 and 2009, the pace and  magnitude of losses over time became too much for some insurers to  overcome, regardless of their ability to raise additional capital. As a result,  several financial and mortgage guaranty insurers ceased writing new  business, and some entered rehabilitation plans under their state  regulator. In addition, insurers we interviewed told us that those  companies that continued to write new business engaged in fewer deals  and used more conservative underwriting standards than before the  crisis.", "The case of one mortgage insurer we reviewed illustrated some of the  challenges that financial and mortgage guaranty insurers experienced  during the crisis. By mid-2008, the insurer had ceased writing new  mortgage guaranty business and was only servicing the business it  already had on its books. This insurer is licensed in all states and the  District of Columbia. Previously, the insurer provided mortgage default  protection to lenders on an individual loan basis and on pools of loans. As  a result of continued losses stemming from defaults of mortgage loans\u2014 many of which were originated by lenders with reduced or no  documentation verifying the borrower\u2019s income, assets, or employment\u2014 the state regulator placed the insurer into rehabilitation with a finding of  insolvency.

To identify potential risks, state regulators said they  increased the frequency of information sharing among the regulators and  used NAIC analysis and information to help focus their inquiries. For  example, an official from one state told us that, during the crisis, state  regulators formed an ad hoc advisory working group on financial guaranty  insurance. The group consisted of state regulators that had oversight of at  least one domestic financial guaranty insurer in their state.

NAIC also provides services to  help state regulators\u2014for instance, maintaining a range of databases and  coordinating regulatory efforts. NAIC officials said that they identified  potential risks and other trends through their regular analyses of statutory  financial statement filings, which contain detailed investment data. For  example, during the crisis NAIC\u2019s analysis of insurers\u2019 investment data  identified companies with exposure to certain European markets that  posed potential risks for the companies. NAIC passed this information  along confidentially to the relevant state regulators for further monitoring.  As discussed above, a state regulator we interviewed said they used  NAIC\u2019s in-depth analyses to help monitor their domiciled insurers for  potential risks such as RMBS. To facilitate information sharing about  private mortgage insurance, NAIC officials said it formed an informal  working group comprised of domestic regulators of private mortgage  insurance companies.

Also, NAIC  officials said that FAWG had informed state regulators about the current  status of financial guaranty and private mortgage insurance companies  on a regular basis as these sectors experienced more financial distress  than the rest of the insurance industry during the crisis. Regulatory  officials from one state said that they relied on information collected by  FAWG to monitor financial guaranty and private mortgage insurers  operating in their state because none of these insurers were domiciled  there.

The bureau monitors developments and trends in  the financial markets that affect insurance companies, researches  investment issues, and reports on those that can potentially affect  insurance company investment portfolios. State regulators said they used  these reports during the crisis. For example, one state said that the report  on the effects of the European debt crisis on U.S. insurers was useful and  another state said the reports on securities lending helped focus their  dialogue with domiciled insurers about their risk management practices.  As discussed later in this report, the bureau also worked with third parties  to model the values of insurers\u2019 portfolios of RMBS and CMBS.", "To increase transparency regarding insurers\u2019 securities lending  reinvestment activities, NAIC made changes to the statutory accounting  rule and added disclosure requirements to address risks that were  highlighted by AIG\u2019s securities lending program, which was a major  source of its liquidity problems in 2008.

As discussed earlier, life insurance companies saw a  decline of almost 6 percent in capital in 2008. Prior to the change, NAIC\u2019s  methodology for calculating RBC charges for nonagency MBS relied on  agency ratings. For example, capital charges were lower for RMBS with a  relatively high agency rating than for those with a lower rating. During the  crisis, the historically high levels of failed mortgages across the nation  were followed by rating agency downgrades of nonagency RMBS that  required insurers to increase their capital levels. NAIC officials told us  that, in hindsight, using agency ratings to help determine the amount of  capital an insurer should hold for their nonagency MBS investments was  not appropriate because these securities were rated too highly before the  crisis and overly pessimistic after the crisis. As a result, NAIC moved to a  methodology for calculating RBC charges for nonagency MBS that  determined an expected recovery value for each security based on a set  of economic scenarios. NAIC contracts with BlackRock and PIMCO to  conduct these analyses. NAIC reported that this change in methodology  not only had eliminated reliance on agency ratings, but also had  increased regulatory involvement in determining how RBC charges were  calculated for nonagency MBS. NAIC officials saw both of these results  as positive.", "Although this change in methodology did result in a change in RBC  charges for more than half of insurers\u2019 RMBS holdings, the change did  not significantly affect insurers\u2019 financial statements. Because the new  methodology resulted in estimated recovery values that were higher than  the amortized values of RMBS shown on financial statements, in 2010  capital requirements for 59 percent of the insurance industry\u2019s nonagency  RMBS were reduced. However, almost 88 percent of industrywide CMBS  holdings in 2011 were not affected by these changes. Officials from one  rating agency said the change was appropriate because the new  methodology was actually similar to the one used by the rating agency  itself. Officials from another rating agency said that the switch to the new  modeling method reduced transparency to insurers because NAIC did not  release its modeling results for insurers to use until late in the year.", "During the financial crisis, some state regulators granted some insurers  permission to use prescribed and permitted accounting practices that  helped the insurers improve their capital positions. These practices  included allowing alternative methods of calculating an insurer\u2019s assets or  liabilities that differ from statutory accounting rules and can result in a  higher amount of assets admitted to an insurer\u2019s statutory financial  statements. Based on data from NAIC, insurers did request modifications  to statutory accounting practices. From 2005 to 2007, about 30 such  requests were made each year nationwide. In 2008, however, there were  over 130 such requests.", "For each year that an insurer has used a prescribed or permitted practice,  statutory accounting rules require it to disclose in its statutory financial  statements specific information about each practice it used, including the  net effect on its net income and capital. For example, an insurer could  request a permitted practice to use a different method of valuing its  subsidiary, and a higher valuation would increase the capital reported on  its statutory financial statements. Table 5 shows the net effect of  prescribed and permitted practices on life and P/C insurers\u2019 net income  and capital from 2006 through 2011. In 2009, the life insurance industry\u2019s  aggregate net income was about $1 billion less given the effects from  prescribed and permitted practices, while P/C insurers\u2019 was about $5  billion more. In terms of capital, both life and P/C insurers experienced a  substantial positive impact from prescribed and permitted practices in  2008 compared to 2007; these positive effects remained through 2011.", "One permitted practice in particular that was sought during the crisis  could generally help insurers increase the amount of admitted assets that  could be included in their statement of financial position by increasing the  percentage of deferred tax assets (DTA) that could be classified as an  admitted asset. Admitted assets are those that are available for paying  policyholder obligations and are counted as capital for regulatory  purposes. Statutory accounting provisions do not allow insurers to include  assets in their statutory statements of financial position unless they are  admitted assets.determining the percentage of DTAs that could be classified as admitted   Specifically, insurers requested that the limits for  assets be raised.permitted practices that states granted to insurers in 2008 were related to  increasing the limits, which in turn increased the amount of DTA that  insurers could classify as admitted assets. This change enabled some  insurers to improve their reported capital positions by increasing the  amount of assets that were admitted to their statutory financial  statements.", "NAIC officials said that more than half of the 119  Industry stakeholders had mixed views on the effects of state regulators  granting permitted practices on a case-by-case basis. A state regulator  and an industry representative said insurance companies complained that  granting case-by-case permission created an uneven playing field  because some insurers were allowed to use the increased limits while  others were not. However, one rating agency official said the effects were  insignificant because DTAs represent a very small percentage of admitted  assets. Another rating agency official added that while the case-by-case  permissions might result in differences across different insurers\u2019 statutory  financial statements, the financial effects of the changes were disclosed  in the financial statements. Therefore, they could be easily adjusted using  the disclosures to facilitate comparison of financial statements across  different insurers.", "In 2009, NAIC issued Income Taxes \u2013 Revised, A Temporary  Replacement of SSAP No. 10 (SSAP 10R), which generally adopted the  increased limits that some states had granted to individual insurers and  made them available to all life and P/C insurers that met certain eligibility  requirements. SSAP 10R, which superseded SSAP 10, had a sunset  provision to expire at the end of 2010 and took effect for statutory  financial statements filed for year-end 2009. A new feature of SSAP 10R  was its eligibility requirements, which were based on certain RBC  thresholds that would trigger regulatory action if they were reached. To be  eligible to apply SSAP 10R, insurers were to exceed 250 to 300 percent  of these thresholds. As a result, only companies at or above certain  minimum capital standards were eligible to include expanded portions of  DTAs in their admitted assets. NAIC officials said that troubled insurance  companies that had violated the threshold for regulatory action were  typically troubled and would not be eligible to include higher portions of  their DTAs as admitted assets. However, they added that state insurance  regulators have the authority to determine if the financial conditions of a  troubled company affect the recoverability of any admitted assets,  including admitted DTAs, and may disallow the company from classifying  certain ones as admitted assets. On January 1, 2012, the Statement of  Statutory Accounting Principles No. 101, Income Taxes, a Replacement  of SSAP No. 10R and SSAP No. 10 (SSAP 101) went into effect. It  permanently superseded the original principle and generally codified the  increased limits of SSAP 10R. However, SSAP 101 has tiered eligibility  requirements, which provide a more gradual reduction in the portion of an  insurer\u2019s DTA that can be included as an insurer\u2019s admitted assets.  NAIC officials said that this more gradual reduction can help prevent a  sudden drop in capital at a time when an insurer is already experiencing a  decline in capital. That is, rather than suddenly losing the ability to count  any DTAs as admitted assets, the tiered eligibility requirements can  spread these reductions over time.", "Based on an actuarial study, among other things, NAIC increased the  limits of SSAP 10, which could provide insurers with capital relief.  According to this study, one of the major contributing factors to DTAs was  the large amounts of write-downs on impaired investments during the  crisis. As previously discussed, in 2008, life insurers had $64 billion in  unrealized losses, as well as other-than-temporary impairments of $60  billion in realized losses on investments. To the extent that an insurer\u2019s  DTA increased due to impairments that were taken on its investments,  expanding the limits on the admittance of DTA would help to increase  their capital. From 2006 to 2011, admitted DTA generally rose from over 4  percent to about 9 percent of capital for life insurers while fluctuating from  about 3 percent to over 4 percent for P/C insurers (see figs. 13 and 14).  The limits of SSAP 10 were intended to be conservative, explained an  NAIC official, admitting far fewer years of DTAs than insurers had  accumulated over the years.", "Industry groups we spoke to had mixed views about expanding the limits  of SSAP 10. A consumer advocacy group official stated that while  expanding the limits could help insurers show greater amounts of  admitted assets and capital in their statutory financial statements, in  reality, no actual additional funds were made available to protect  policyholders because the additional capital came from DTAs, a non- liquid asset. However, one rating agency official said the increased limits  have not significantly affected insurer capital because DTAs are generally  a relatively small line item on insurers\u2019 financial statements. The rating  agency also said the effects of the expanded limits were insignificant and  did not affect the agency\u2019s ratings, nor were they enough to make  insolvent companies appear solvent. Officials from one rating agency also  explained that insurers pursued the expanded DTA limits even though  they were relatively small because, during the crisis, companies were not  certain how long the financial crisis would last and therefore sought  various avenues to help reduce stress on their capital. According to an  actuarial association\u2019s report, the limits in SSAP 10R were low and  therefore conservative."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Programs Have Increased Access to Capital", "paragraphs": ["During the crisis, several federal programs were available to insurance  companies to ease strain on capital and liquidity.

The advances are secured with eligible collateral  including government securities and securities backed by real estate- related assets. According to a representative of a large life insurance  company we interviewed, the borrowing capacity from the Federal Home  Loan Bank System was especially helpful because it provided access to  capital during the crisis when other avenues to the capital markets were  relatively unavailable. In other words, they were able to use their  investment assets as collateral to access capital for business growth. The  number of insurance company members, as well as the advances they  took, increased during the crisis. In 2008, advances to insurance  companies peaked at a total of $54.9 billion for 74 companies, from $28.7  billion for 52 companies in 2007.", "A variety of insurance business practices may have helped limit the  effects of the crisis on most insurers\u2019 investments, underwriting  performance, and premium revenues. First, insurance industry  participants and two regulators we interviewed credited the industry\u2019s  investment approach, as well as regulatory restrictions, for protecting  most companies from severe losses during the crisis. Typically, insurance  companies make investments that match the duration of their liabilities.  For example, life insurers\u2019 liabilities are typically long term, so they tend to  invest heavily in conservative, long-term securities (30 years). According  to a life industry representative, this matching practice helped ensure that  life insurers had the funds they needed to pay claims without having to  sell a large amount of assets that may have decreased in value during the  crisis. A P/C industry representative said P/C insurers, whose liabilities  are generally only 6 months to a year, invest in shorter-term, highly liquid  instruments and did not experience significant problems paying claims. In  addition, P/C insurers\u2019 higher proportion of assets invested in equities  (between about 17 to 20 percent from 2002-2011, as opposed to between  about 2 to 5 percent for life insurers in the same period) helps explain  their greater decline in net investment income during the crisis. Both  industries also derived their largest source of investment income from  bonds and these increased as a percentage of insurers\u2019 gross investment  income during the crisis. Also, state regulations placed restrictions on the  types of investments insurers can make. For example, one of NAIC\u2019s  model investment acts, which serves as a guide for state regulations,  specifies the classes of investments that insurers are authorized to make  and sets limits on amounts of various grades of investments that insurers  can count towards their admitted assets.", "Second, industry participants we interviewed noted that the crisis  generally did not trigger the types of events that life and P/C companies  insure\u2014namely, death and property damage or loss. As a result, most  insurers did not experience an increase in claims that might have  decreased their capital and increased their liquidity requirements. The  exception, as described earlier, was mortgage guaranty and financial  guaranty insurers, where defaults in the residential housing market  triggered mortgage defaults that, in turn, created claims for those  insurers.", "Finally, low rates of return on investments during the crisis reduced  insurers\u2019 investment income, and according to two insurers and two of the  state regulators we interviewed, these low yields, combined with  uncertainty in the equities markets, moved investors toward fixed  annuities with guaranteed rates of return. In addition, industry participants  and a state regulator we interviewed said that the guarantees on many  annuity products provided higher returns than were available in the  banking and securities markets, causing existing policyholders to hold  onto their guaranteed annuity products\u2014fixed and variable\u2014longer than  they might otherwise have done. In 2008 and 2009, the total amount paid  by insurers to those surrendering both individual and group annuities  declined.

NAIC officials stated that  they also received public comments on the ORSA guidance manual and  were in the process of updating it to ensure greater consistency between  the guidance manual and the ORSA model law. NAIC officials told us that  they planned to conduct an additional pilot in the fall of 2013. The officials  added that state regulators still needed to develop their regulatory  guidance for reviewing ORSA.", "Another issue that insurance industry participants identified as significant  was oversight of noninsurance holding companies with insurance  subsidiaries. For instance, industry groups we spoke with identified the  need for greater transparency and disclosure of these entities\u2019 activities.  One industry association stressed the importance of having all regulatory  bodies look across the holding company structure rather than at specific  holding company subsidiaries, such as insurance companies. According  to NAIC, regulators reviewed lessons learned from the financial crisis\u2014  specifically issues involving AIG\u2014and the potential impact of  noninsurance operations on insurance companies in the same group. In  December 2010, NAIC amended the Insurance Holding Company System  Regulatory Act to address the way regulators determined risk at holding  companies. As part of this process, between May 2009 and June 2010,  NAIC held 16 public conference calls, five public meetings, and one  public hearing on the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory  Act. Additionally, NAIC officials told us they also share regulatory and  supervisory information with federal regulators such as the Federal  Reserve, including information on the amended model act revisions, at  the Annual Regulatory Data Workshop.", "According to NAIC, the U.S. statutory holding company laws apply  directly to individual insurers and indirectly to noninsurance holding  companies. The revised model act includes changes to (1)  communication among regulators; (2) access to and collection of  information; (3) supervisory colleges; (4) enforcement measures; (5)  group capital assessment; and (6) accreditation. Some specific changes  include: expanded ability for regulators to look at any entity in an insurance  holding company system that may not directly affect the holding  company system but could pose reputational or financial risk to the  insurer through a new Form F-Enterprise Risk Report; enhancements to regulators\u2019 rights to access information (including  books and records), especially regarding the examinations of  affiliates, to better ascertain the insurer\u2019s financial condition; and  introduction of and funding for supervisory colleges to enhance the  regulators\u2019 ability to participate in the colleges and provide guidance  on how to conduct, effectively contribute to, and learn from them.", "One state regulator stated that the revised Insurance Holding Company  System Regulatory Act was expected to make group-level holding  company data more transparent to state insurance regulators. Regulators  also told us that the amended model act gave them greater authority to  participate in supervisory colleges. U.S. state insurance regulators both  participate in and convene supervisory colleges. State insurance  commissioners may participate in a supervisory college with other  regulators charged with supervision of such insurers or their affiliates,  including other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies. For  instance, the same state regulator stated that the authority allowed for  international travel, with the insurers paying the costs. The act also  increases the regulators\u2019 ability to maintain the confidentiality of records  that they receive or share with other regulators.", "According to NAIC officials, as of April 2013, 16 states have adopted the  model law revisions. Additionally, some state regulators we spoke to  indicated that they were working with their state legislatures to introduce  the revised Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act to their  state legislatures. For instance, officials from one state regulator said that  the new model act had been introduced in the state legislature in January  2013 and that adopting it would mean rewriting the state\u2019s existing  holding company law. As a result, they had decided to ask for the repeal  of the existing law and the adoption of the new statute for consistency.", "Although the Solvency Modernization Initiative is underway, time is  needed to allow states to adopt requirements. For instance, NAIC officials  said that although they had completed almost all of what they saw as the  key SMI initiatives, implementing all SMI activities could take 2 or 3 years.  According to the officials, some decisions will be made in 2013, such as  how to implement governance activities and changes related to RBC. For  instance, the officials stated that they were looking to implement P/C  catastrophe risk data analysis later this year and would then consider how  to integrate their findings into RBC requirements. As mentioned earlier,  ORSA is not expected to be operational until 2015. Also, most states  have yet to adopt revisions to the Insurance Holding Company System  Regulatory Act. NAIC officials told us that getting changes adopted at the  state level was challenging because of the amount of time needed to get  all 50 states on-board. For instance, the adoption of model laws requires  state legislative change and is dependent on the frequency of state  legislative meetings. The officials explained that some states legislatures  meet only every 2 years, limiting the possibility of immediate legislative  change. As we have previously reported, NAIC operations generally  require a consensus among a large number of regulators, and NAIC  seeks to obtain and consider the input of industry participants and  consumer advocates.  Obtaining a wide range of views may create a  more thoughtful, balanced regulatory approach, but working through the  goals and priorities of a number of entities can result in lengthy processes  and long implementation periods for regulatory improvements. As noted  in our other work earlier, continued progress in a timely manner is critical  to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the insurance regulatory  system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Views Varied on Increased Oversight Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Industry officials we spoke with had favorable views of NAIC\u2019s and state  regulators\u2019 efforts to strengthen the regulatory system. For example, one  insurance association stated that NAIC and states had been reevaluating  all regulatory tools beyond those that were related to the financial crisis.  Another insurance association noted that ORSA would be a good tool to  use to identify potentially at-risk companies before they developed  problems. A third insurance association stated that coordination between  domestic and international regulators was more robust now and actions  taken are more coordinated. The officials also pointed to the work  addressing supervisory colleges that involve regulatory actions by other  countries that might impact domestic insurers. However, some insurance  associations we spoke to voiced concerns about the increased oversight  of holding companies, and some insurance associations and insurers also  questioned the need for additional regulatory changes.", "Two insurance associations and a federal entity we spoke to were  concerned with potential information gaps related to the increased  oversight of holding companies. For instance, one insurance association  told us that state insurance regulators do not have jurisdiction over non- insurance affiliates\u2019 activities and as a result, do not have access to  information on these affiliates in order to evaluate if their activities could  jeopardize the affiliated insurers. Another insurance association stated  that there was a need to address holding company regulation, especially  potential gaps between the federal and state regulators in their oversight  roles. Some insurers also questioned the need for additional regulations  and a few suggested that the regulators need to allow time for  implementing recent financial reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act. One  P/C insurer stated that imposing additional requirements on the entire  insurance industry is not necessary especially within the P/C industry.  The official explained that there needs to be greater flexibility in reporting  and that the P/C industry fared well during the crisis as evident by the  lack of widespread insolvencies. The official suggested that NAIC needs  to re-evaluate whether the additional requirements are useful. Another  financial guaranty insurer told us that no additional changes are needed  in the regulatory structure or regulations for the financial guaranty  industry. The officials stated that they are now dealing with federal  regulators and regulatory changes related to the Dodd-Frank Act.  Additionally, one insurance association stated that whether more  regulatory coordination activities regarding holding companies are  needed is not yet known because federal regulators have not finished  implementing the recent Dodd-Frank reforms dealing with holding  company oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Dodd-Frank Provisions That Address Financial Stability Include Insurance Oversight", "paragraphs": ["While many factors likely contributed to the crisis, and the relative role of  these factors is subject to debate, gaps and weaknesses in the  supervision and regulation of the U.S. financial system, including the  insurance industry, generally played an important role.

The  Dodd-Frank Act established CFPB as an independent bureau within  the Federal Reserve System and provided it with rulemaking,  enforcement, supervisory, and other powers over many consumer  financial products and services and many of the entities that sell them.  CFPB does not have authority over most insurance activities or most  activities conducted by firms regulated by SEC or CFTC.

The act requires the enhanced prudential  standards to be more stringent than standards applicable to other bank  holding companies and financial firms that do not present similar risks to  U.S. financial stability. The act further allows the enhanced prudential  standards to be more stringent than standards applicable to other bank  holding companies and financial firms that do not present similar risks to  U.S. financial stability.

In the life industry, we focused  on individual annuities, individual life insurance, group annuities, and  group life insurance. These lines accounted for 77 percent of average life  insurance premiums during our review period of 2002 through 2011, and  the policyholders were individual consumers (either independently or  through their workplaces). In the P/C industry, we focused on private  passenger auto liability, auto physical damage, home owners multiple  peril, commercial multiple peril, other liability (occurrence), other liability  (claims-made), financial guaranty, and mortgage guaranty insurance.  These lines of insurance accounted for 68 percent of average P/C  insurance premiums over our 10-year review period and involved  individual and commercial policyholders. We chose to review financial  and mortgage guaranty insurance despite their small percentage of  premiums (less than 2 percent of average P/C premiums from 2002  through 2011) because we had learned through research and preliminary  interviews that they were more heavily affected by the crisis.

The NAIC staff  that compiled the data told us that data on assets, liabilities, and net  equity were not always available in either of their data systems. To  address this problem of missing data, NAIC staff pulled data when  available from the last financial statement before the company was  placed into receivership or the first available financial statement  immediately after being placed into receivership and replaced the missing  data. This was the case for 5 of 58 life insurance companies and 27 of  152 P/C companies. We believe these asset, liability, and net equity  levels would have changed little in the time between liquidation and when  the financial statements were prepared, and we determined that the time  difference was likely to have little effect on our estimate of the general  size and net equity levels of insurers at liquidation. However, the average  assets and average net equity we report might be slightly higher or lower  than was actually the case for each year. In addition, out of the 40 life  insurers and 125 P/C insurers that went into liquidation from 2002 through  2011, NAIC staff could not provide asset data for 7 life insurers and 19  P/C insurers, and they could not provide net equity data for 8 life insurers  and 29 P/C insurers.

Best, the indexes include all  U.S. insurance industry companies that are publicly traded on major  global stock exchanges that also have an A.M. Best rating, or that have  an insurance subsidiary with an A.M. Best rating. They are based on the  aggregation of the prices of the individual publicly traded stocks and  weighted for their respective free float market capitalizations. The life  index represents 21 life insurance companies and the P/C index  represents 56 P/C companies. Since more than 60 percent of the  companies on the A.M. Best indexes we selected trade on NYSE, we also  obtained monthly closing stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE) Composite Index, which, as of February 2012, represented 1,867  companies that trade on NYSE, to provide a contextual perspective on  the overall stock market during our review period.", "As figure 17 illustrates, life and P/C insurers\u2019 aggregate stock prices  generally moved in tandem with the larger NYSE Composite Index from  the end of 2004 through 2011, but life insurers\u2019 aggregate stock prices fell  much more steeply in late 2008 and early 2009 than P/C insurers\u2019 and  NYSE companies\u2019 aggregate stock prices.", "We selected several key time periods or events from the financial crisis  and identified the largest drops in life and P/C insurers\u2019 aggregate stock  prices during those time periods (see fig.18). While many factors can  affect the daily movement of stock prices, we observed that changes in  life insurers\u2019 aggregate stock prices tended to be more correlated with  several of the events that occurred during the crisis than P/C insurers\u2019  aggregate stock prices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Profiles of Distressed Insurers", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides more detail on two distressed insurers\u2014one  mortgage guaranty insurer and one life insurer\u2014during the financial  crisis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mortgage Guaranty Insurer", "paragraphs": ["We studied a mortgage guaranty insurer operating in a run-off of its  existing book of business (that is, it had ceased writing new mortgage  guaranty business and was only servicing the business it already had on  its books). This insurer is licensed in all states and the District of  Columbia. Prior to its run-off, the insurer provided mortgage default  protection to lenders on an individual loan basis and on pools of loans. As  a result of continued losses stemming from defaults of mortgage loans,  the state regulator placed the insurer into rehabilitation with a finding of  insolvency in 2012.", "During the financial crisis, the insurer began experiencing substantial  losses due to increasing default rates on insured mortgages, particularly  in California, Florida, Arizona, and Nevada.

In  addition, the insurer had significant exposure to Alt-A loans, which are  loans that were issued to borrowers based on credit scores but without  documentation of the borrowers\u2019 income, assets, or employment. These  loans experienced higher default rates than the prime fixed-rate loans in  the insurer\u2019s portfolio.", "This insurer rapidly depleted its capital as it set aside reserves to meet  obligations resulting from the overall rising volume of mortgage defaults.  Rising defaults combined with unsuccessful attempts to raise additional  capital during the crisis adversely affected its statutory risk-to-capital ratio  starting in 2008. While state insurance regulations generally require this  relationship of insured risk to statutory capital (in this case, the sum of  statutory surplus and contingency reserves) to be no greater than 25 to 1,  this insurer\u2019s statutory capital declined 85 percent from year-end 2007 to  year-end 2008, increasing the risk-to-capital ratio from 21 to 1 to 125 to  1. As a result, in 2008, this insurer entered into an order with its state  regulator to cease writing new business and operate in run-off status. Due  to continued increases in mortgage defaults, the regulator required a  capital maintenance plan in 2009 that allowed the insurer to maintain a  positive statutory capital position during the run-off and also to pay partial  claims.", "According to court filings, the insurer reported to the state regulator that  its liabilities outweighed its assets by more than $800 million for the  second quarter of 2012. As a result, the state regulator entered an order  with the relevant county circuit court in late 2012 to take the insurer into  rehabilitation with a finding of insolvency.
