A VTS system typically consists of remote surveillance sensors, such as radar or closed-circuit television, and a central data-gathering location (called a vessel traffic center). VTS personnel receive information on marine traffic conditions, assess this information, and pass it on to mariners and the maritime industry by radio. According to the International Maritime Organization, the purpose of these systems is to improve the safe and efficient movement of marine vessels in and around ports and to protect the environment.", "In response to congressional direction after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Department of Transportation conducted a study to assess the need for VTS systems in ports throughout the country. On the basis of the study, the Coast Guard is considering constructing new or improved VTS systems in as many as 17 ports. The proposed expansion, called VTS 2000, will cost an estimated $260 million to $310 million in federal funds to build and about $42 million in federal funds to operate each year if installed at all 17 locations. At present, the Coast Guard plans to pay these costs from its budget and not pass them on to local ports or to users, such as shipping companies.", "You asked us to provide you with information to assist in your deliberations about funding the VTS 2000 program, including funding alternatives to build and operate the system.

While the views of these 8 ports may not be representative of the views at all 17, we selected the ports that we thought would yield the most useful information in response to the Subcommittee\u2019s questions. Four locations were chosen because the Coast Guard identified them as most likely to benefit from a new VTS system. We chose the other four because they currently operate a privately funded system or have expressed an interest to do so. (See app. I for general background on all eight ports.)

Operations and maintenance costs for these systems, which totaled about $19 million in fiscal year 1995, are borne by the Coast Guard and are not passed on to the ports or the shipping industry. Two other ports, Los Angeles/Long Beach and Philadelphia/Delaware Bay, have radar-based systems funded by their users. These systems are sometimes called \u201cVTS-like\u201d systems to distinguish them from the Coast Guard\u2019s systems, but for consistency, we refer to them as VTS systems in this report. In 1995, operations and maintenance costs were about $1.4 million for the Los Angeles/Long Beach system and about $345,000 for the Philadelphia/Delaware Bay system.", "Study of VTS systems was prompted by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-380), passed after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and subsequent spills in the coastal waters of Rhode Island, the Delaware River, and the Houston ship channel. The act directed the Secretary of Transportation to prioritize the need for a new, expanded, or improved VTS system at U.S. ports and channels. Under criteria for this evaluation, the act specified that in assessing the need for a VTS system, the Secretary consider (1) the nature, volume, and frequency of vessel traffic; (2) the risk of collisions, spills, and damages associated with that traffic; (3) the impact of installing, expanding, or improving a VTS system; and (4) all other relevant costs and data.

Both sets were identified on the basis of an estimate of the net benefits of installing a new VTS system at each location. The first set, which included seven locations, was recommended for initial consideration. For these locations, the study\u2019s methodology showed that the benefit of a new or improved VTS system would consistently be higher than costs even when different assumptions were considered, such as decreasing benefit estimates by 50 percent or increasing cost estimates by 50 percent. The second set, comprising eight other locations, was identified as the next best candidate for consideration. These locations were not as consistent in showing positive net benefits when the methodological assumptions were changed. Table 1 shows the 15 locations and the estimated net benefits calculated for each one. In addition to the 15 ports in table 1, the Coast Guard added San Francisco, California, and Valdez, Alaska, because both locations currently have Coast Guard-operated VTS systems and because the Coast Guard wants to upgrade the equipment at these ports with VTS 2000 technology.", "Many of the ports have existing VTS systems or other nonradar, radio-based information systems to assist vessel operators, and when the estimated benefits of these systems are taken into account, the marginal net benefits of a new system decrease substantially in some instances. The study\u2019s data indicate that over the first 15 years after a switch to a new system, there may be little marginal net benefit in making the conversion at any of the ports with existing radar-based VTS systems. The five Coast Guard-operated systems have either recently been upgraded or enhanced or are scheduled to receive upgrades in the near future regardless of any decision on VTS 2000. These upgrades or enhancements will expand VTS coverage and cost about $39 million for improved software and equipment. According to Coast Guard officials, these ports are included in VTS 2000 so that existing VTS equipment can be replaced when it becomes obsolete. Officials indicated that they will address the timing and affordability of this approach in fiscal year 2000.", "The Coast Guard is conducting follow-on studies at a number of the locations to verify whether the benefits of a new VTS system outweigh its costs. So far, five such studies have been completed for Boston, Corpus Christi, Mobile/Pascagoula, Philadelphia/Delaware Bay, and Tampa. The follow-on study for Mobile/Pascagoula was consistent with the results of the Port Needs Study. However, for Boston, the marginal net benefits no longer outweigh the costs, and for Corpus Christi, Philadelphia/Delaware Bay, and Tampa, the marginal net benefits are higher.

The system\u2019s development\u2014including activities such as developing the software, designing the system, testing, contracting, constructing the land-based support facility, and developing the system engineering of VTS 2000\u2014is being pursued in four phases. The estimated cost of the initial development phase is $69 million, including costs incurred since the program\u2019s inception. This phase is scheduled for completion in fiscal year 1999 and, according to Coast Guard officials, will result in operational capability similar to that of the upgraded VTS systems currently operated by the Coast Guard. The development of all phases will cost an estimated $145 million if the systems are installed in all 17 ports. If all phases are implemented, they are scheduled for completion in fiscal year 2004 and will include activities such as developing software that interfaces with external databases and establishing a facility to test and diagnose software to support a national VTS system (land-based support facility). According to Coast Guard officials, a decision on whether to proceed with all four development phases depends, in part, on the number of sites that receive VTS 2000. The additional cost of equipment and installation at specific ports ranges from about $5 million to $30 million per port area.", "The Coast Guard, which is in the early phase of the acquisition process, plans to select a single systems integration contractor for the project by the first quarter of fiscal year 1997. The contractor will develop computer software, procure hardware (radar, closed circuit television, and radios), integrate these components of the system, and determine what type of VTS 2000 equipment will be installed at each port.

The Coast Guard has received about $25 million to develop VTS 2000 through fiscal year 1996. For fiscal year 1997, the Coast Guard plans to request $6 million. For fiscal years 1998-2004, the Coast Guard estimates that it will need about $30 million a year to support both the development and installation of VTS 2000 systems in ports.", "The contractor for VTS 2000 is scheduled to complete the systems\u2019 development in 2004 as it upgrades sensors, develops software, and establishes interface capability with up to 10 different databases.

At six of the eight ports, a clear majority of stakeholders was not willing to fund VTS 2000. At the remaining two\u2014Houston and San Francisco\u2014support was mixed among the stakeholders we interviewed. However, among those who supported VTS 2000, many said their support was conditional.

At Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where privately funded systems are in place, most stakeholders said they regarded the existing systems as sufficient. In a January 1996 memo, the Commander of the local Coast Guard district stated that the Los Angeles system is a highly professional waterway management tool effectively meeting the needs of the port and the Coast Guard. He noted that in broad terms, the Los Angeles system is entirely consistent with the vast majority of technical specifications identified in VTS 2000 operational documents; he favors admitting the system into the Coast Guard\u2019s national VTS network. At Houston/Galveston and San Francisco, where the Coast Guard\u2019s VTS systems are in place, stakeholders were generally pleased with the safety and service information provided by the current system but had concerns about the cost of a VTS 2000 system.", "At two of the four ports where no form of VTS currently exists (New Orleans and Tampa), most of the stakeholders said some form of VTS, which they perceived to be less expensive than VTS 2000, was needed. At Tampa, for example, many stakeholders believed that a radar-based system would not be the most cost-effective alternative, and some preferred a system based on satellite technology (called a dependent surveillance system) that allows operators to determine the position of their vessel. At New Orleans, proposals from stakeholders included setting up manned watchtowers to monitor traffic in key areas of the Mississippi River.", "At Port Arthur, views were about evenly mixed as to whether a more limited VTS system was needed. Some stakeholders thought that VTS would be valuable in certain areas, but not in the entire Port Arthur/Lake Charles area identified in the Port Needs Study. Of the four ports, Mobile/Pascagoula was the only one where stakeholders thought no VTS system was needed. Most of the stakeholders said they did not believe a VTS system was needed because of the low volume of deep-draft traffic in the Mobile area. As a result, these stakeholders generally regarded the current procedures as adequate. These procedures include such measures as permitting only one-way traffic in certain areas and maintaining communications with other vessel operators in the region.", "As table 3 showed, views on funding such a system were mixed. In general, because stakeholders we interviewed perceived that other VTS alternatives could be less costly than VTS 2000, they were somewhat more disposed to consider paying for a VTS alternative. However, others were not willing to pay for a system. At New Orleans, for example, some stakeholders objected to funding a service that would benefit users passing through the port to other destinations because these stakeholders believed the users might be difficult to identify and charge for the service.

The start-up costs depend on the size and complexity of the system, but buying radar equipment, computer hardware and software, and operations space could cost $1 million or more for a system.", "Financing the systems at Los Angeles/Long Beach and Philadelphia/Delaware Bay posed similar concerns, and both projects received federal or state financial assistance. The state of California provided a low-interest loan of $464,550 to help pay capital costs, and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach each provided $250,000 in grants for VTS equipment. The Marine Exchange of Los Angeles/Long Beach, which operates the system, uses Coast Guard property at no cost. For operators of the Philadelphia/Delaware Bay system, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a $100,000 grant to help upgrade radar equipment in 1986, and Pennsylvania and Delaware authorized pilotage fee increases in 1995 to pay for further upgrades costing more than $1 million.", "To provide you with additional information on this issue, we contacted representatives from five foreign locations with VTS systems that charge port fees or user fees to pay for VTS operations. At four of the five locations, the central government paid for all or part of the cost of developing and installing the VTS system. For example, the Port of Rotterdam\u2019s VTS capital costs of $180 million were paid both by the central government (66 percent) and by the local government (34 percent). At the Port of Marseilles, France, capital costs totaled about $3.5 million, of which the port paid 66 percent and the central government paid the remaining 34 percent. The central governments of these two countries agreed to pay the development and installation costs as part of their oversight role and their recognition of the need for VTS systems in their country. The Port of London was the only port where capital costs were paid entirely by the port authority. Most funding for this system comes from harbor fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concern About Liability Protection Is Widespread", "paragraphs": ["Liability protection for private operators of a VTS system was a widespread concern among those we interviewed. Coast Guard and privately funded VTS systems generally supply only advisory information, such as vessel traffic or environmental conditions; control of the vessel remains with the master of the vessel. However, most port and industry stakeholders we interviewed at the six ports that do not have a privately funded system were concerned that private VTS operators would be liable if inaccurate information given by the VTS operations center led to an accident. Privately funded VTS systems in both Los Angeles/Long Beach and Philadelphia/Delaware Bay receive liability protection under state laws except in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.", "At the foreign locations we contacted, officials said that exposure to liability from operating VTS systems had not been raised as an issue because the master or captain of the vessel has ultimate responsibility for the safe navigation of the vessel. Directives from the VTS operator generally come only when a mechanical failure in the ship occurs or when a situation requires immediate safe traffic management. However, all ports noted that since the area of VTS operator liability has yet to be tested in a court of law, a precedent has not yet been set. At one port, an official noted that the port authority carries third-party insurance ($75 million per incident) as protection from accidents occurring under VTS guidance.", "At locations such as Tampa and San Francisco, where the possibility of operating privately funded systems has been discussed, stakeholders we interviewed believe that securing liability protection is a key issue that must be resolved before they would move forward to establish a VTS system.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s legal counsel has said that the Coast Guard\u2019s exposure to liability in jointly operated systems does not differ appreciably from that in other, more formally established, Coast Guard-operated vessel traffic services.

At seven of the eight ports we reviewed, most stakeholders said the Coast Guard should play a role with the private sector in developing privately funded VTS systems, including establishing operating standards. Among the reasons for the Coast Guard to be involved, the stakeholders cited the Coast Guard\u2019s regulatory authority to require mandatory participation, the need for consistent and unbiased operations, and the Coast Guard\u2019s expertise in and experience with other VTS systems. For example, the consensus of stakeholders in Tampa was that industry, the state, and the Coast Guard should jointly determine the need for a system. A report produced by the state of Florida states that \u201cany interim [VTS] system should be established in conjunction with the Coast Guard since a system without Coast Guard support will have no real authority and may not conform with other U.S. Coast Guard systems.\u201d", "While support for the Coast Guard\u2019s involvement in privately funded systems was widespread, opinions were somewhat divided over what form this involvement should take. The two ports that currently have privately funded systems tended to differ in how they saw the Coast Guard\u2019s role. At Los Angeles/Long Beach, where the Coast Guard provides personnel for helping to run the system, the executive director of the marine exchange said this arrangement gives the system greater viability in performing its operations. Local Coast Guard officials said they also benefit from the system, since it can assist them with other duties, such as waterway management, search and rescue operations, and law enforcement activities. Private operators of the Philadelphia/Delaware Bay system believed that the Coast Guard had a role in private systems but in a more limited capacity. For example, with the Philadelphia/Delaware Bay VTS, Coast Guard personnel do not participate as VTS operators, but frequent communication on issues of mutual concern occurs between the private operators and the Coast Guard\u2019s Marine Safety Office. For example, the VTS operators would notify the Coast Guard if a navigation buoy were reported to them as being missing or in the wrong location. However, operators of the system also said that the Coast Guard should have the authority to approve and set the standards for operating a system.", "At the foreign locations we contacted, the central government played a role in most of the locally or privately operated systems. At three of the four locations where the local government or port authority operates the system, the central government established the operating regulations. Officials said that the role of the central government was to provide regulatory control and oversight to ensure standard procedures for operating the VTS systems in their country. \u201cStatutory and/or regulatory changes are needed to support the development of public-private partnerships for VTS systems. The Coast Guard would need either broad authority to accept reimbursement for personnel it provided, or the authority to approve or sanction non-federal VTSs.

According to Coast Guard officials, despite the relatively high marine traffic volume in the harbor, the area is not considered difficult to navigate, as it is relatively free of navigation hazards and weather problems, except for occasional fog. Together, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are responsible for the highest container tonnage of any port in the nation.

However, in this location, the transit is only about 10 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.", "Navigational challenges in this area (in addition to the narrow channel) are presented by two main factors: weather conditions and crossing marine traffic in certain locations. Relatively frequent and strong weather fronts and fog are typical in this region. Frontal systems occur about 20 times per year and are usually accompanied by heavy rain and strong winds. Fog is most problematic in the winter and spring, and visibilities can fall below one-half mile 4 to 8 days per month from November through April. Crossing marine traffic presents a navigational challenge in two locations where the Intracoastal Waterway (a major shipping channel for shallow-draft vessels) crosses the main ship channels leading to Mobile and Pascagoula. Because of the large volume of shallow-draft traffic transiting east and west along this waterway, there is a potential for collisions with shipping channel traffic in this area. As a result, in both locations, the Coast Guard advises vessel operators to exercise particular caution and requests that they make a security call prior to crossing the Intercoastal Waterway, particularly during periods of restricted visibility. Vessel operators make a security call to advise other vessels in the vicinity of their current location and their intended route.", "Deep-draft vessel traffic in the Mobile/Pascagoula area is relatively light compared with that of larger Gulf Coast ports like New Orleans and Houston.

Vessels coming into this port region from the Gulf of Mexico are typically deep-draft vessels, while the river and Intercoastal Waterway vessels tend to be primarily shallow-draft vessels, according to the Coast Guard.", "According to the Coast Guard, several factors influence the difficulty of navigation in this river port area. The first is geography. For example, blind corners, sharp bends, and strong currents in the Mississippi River make it more difficult for vessel operators to both see each other and avoid collisions. The second is the sheer volume of vessels transiting and mooring in the area. The port region has many miles of warehousing facilities and barge mooring on both banks of the river. The amount of activity occurring along the river banks and the number of vessels going up and down the river pose an increased risk of collisions because maneuvering room decreases. The third is changing river conditions. Because this region is a river environment, it is affected by seasonal changes (such as winter thaw), which can increase the water level and the speed of the river\u2019s currents. With faster river currents, vessels must operate at higher speeds to maintain their maneuverability, thereby reducing their time to maneuver and increasing the potential risk of accidents. This condition is exacerbated by spring fog, which can significantly reduce visibility in the region.", "In 1995, about 41,600 vessels transited through the New Orleans area. Of this total, about 6,400 were deep-draft vessels, and the remainder were shallow-draft vessels. Cargoes carried by vessels transiting this area include iron and steel, metal ores and scrap, and fertilizers. However, according to a Coast Guard official, about half of the shallow-draft vessels carry dangerous cargoes, such as petroleum and petroleum products.", "The Coast Guard currently operates a limited vessel traffic management system in the New Orleans region. It is a radio-based vessel information system that uses red and green signal lights to direct vessel traffic. The scope of its operation depends in part on the river conditions. For example, when there are high water conditions (which may have been created by winter thaw), strong currents create a \u201cboil\u201d at a particular location in the river that is capable of turning a large vessel 180 degrees off course. Because of the added risk under this type of condition, the operators of the system limit the transits in this area to one vessel at a time to ensure that vessels have adequate maneuvering space to accommodate the effects of the river\u2019s current as they try to correct their course.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s plans for a VTS 2000 in this region include installation of two phases of a VTS 2000 system by 2001.
