According to USPS's estimates, these financial gains would significantly reduce its health benefits expenses and eliminate its unfunded retiree health benefit liability--with increased use of Medicare by retirees comprising most of the projected liability reduction. USPS also has projected that its proposal will increase Medicare spending. As Congress considers proposals for a USPS health care plan, it should weigh the impact on Medicare, which also faces fiscal pressure, and other issues, including establishing safeguards for assets of the USPS health plan and ensuring protections for plan participants are comparable to those in FEHBP.", "GAO has also reported on key considerations regarding the release of any Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) surplus to USPS. First, estimates of retirement benefits liabilities contain a significant degree of uncertainty and can change over time. Second, returning surpluses whenever they develop would likely result in an eventual unfunded liability. Alternative options to address funding surpluses include reducing USPS's annual FERS contribution either by amortizing the surplus over 30 years (which would mirror the treatment of deficits) or by offsetting the contribution against the full surplus each year until the surplus is used up."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss U.S. Postal  Service (USPS) benefit issues in the context of proposed postal reform  legislation.

If an 80 percent funding target were implemented because  of concerns about USPS\u2019s ability to achieve a 100 percent target level  within a particular time frame, an additional policy option to consider  could include a schedule to achieve 100 percent funding in a  subsequent time period after the 80 percent level is achieved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPS\u2019s Proposed Health Plan Outside of FEHBP", "paragraphs": ["We recently reported on USPS\u2019s proposal to create a postal health care  plan outside of FEHBP.

Specifically, it is designed  so that all Medicare-eligible retirees would enroll in Medicare Parts A and  B, with Medicare acting as the primary insurer for those enrollees and the  USPS plan paying costs above what Medicare would cover for current  retirees. USPS\u2019s proposed plan would include prescription drug benefits  that qualify it to receive a federal subsidy and drug discounts under  Medicare Part D. Under one USPS option for funding this plan, USPS  proposes that it would be authorized to invest plan assets without the  approval of the Secretary of the Treasury in non-Treasury securities, such  as stocks and bonds, as well as commodities, foreign currency, and real  property. (See app. I for more information on the USPS proposed health  plan.)", "We have reported that USPS would likely realize large financial gains  from its proposed health care plan. According to USPS\u2019s estimates,  USPS would reduce its health benefits expenses and eliminate its  unfunded retiree health benefit liability, primarily by increasing the use of  Medicare by postal retirees once they are eligible for Medicare generally  beginning at age 65. USPS estimated that its plan would reduce its retiree  health benefit liability by $54.6 billion, with the increased use of Medicare  accounting for most of this reduction.  USPS also estimated that the plan  would reduce its total annual required health care payments by $7.8  billion in the first year of implementation and by $33.2 billion over the first  5 years of implementation. In addition, some of the elements of the  proposal\u2014notably an option to allow USPS to invest health plan funds  outside of Treasury securities, such as in stocks, commodities, and  foreign currency\u2014would add uncertainties that could reduce funds  available for its employees\u2019 and retirees\u2019 future health care.", "We have reported that under USPS\u2019s health care plan as designed for  year one, postal employees and retirees would have coverage for a  similar package of services as under selected FEHBP plans, and the level  of coverage would be similar for many services, with some exceptions  (e.g., services received outside of USPS\u2019s approved network). We  estimated that, had the proposed USPS plan been implemented in 2013,  most employees and retirees would have had similar or lower premiums  compared to selected FEHBP plans; but total costs\u2014premiums and costs  for the use of care\u2014could be higher for some.", "We have also reported that withdrawing the approximately 1 million USPS  employees and retirees from FEHBP, which would be required under  USPS\u2019s proposal, would reduce FEHBP\u2019s enrollment by an estimated 25  percent. Despite the significant change in enrollment, most nonpostal  enrollees would likely not be affected by a USPS withdrawal beyond what  selected FEHBP plan representatives expect to be small increases or  decreases in premiums. However, USPS\u2019s withdrawal could lead the  small number of FEHBP plans with primarily postal enrollment to  withdraw from the program. For example, if the 4 plans with 70 percent or  more postal enrollment discontinue participation in FEHBP under a USPS  withdrawal, an estimated 1 percent (about 29,000) of the approximately 3  million nonpostal enrollees in FEHBP would need to select a new health  plan.", "As Congress considers proposals for a USPS health care plan, it should  weigh the impact on Medicare as well as other issues, including  establishing safeguards for plan assets and ensuring FEHBP-comparable  protections for plan participants. The primary policy decision for Congress  to make with respect to such proposals is whether to increase eligible  postal retirees\u2019 use of Medicare. USPS projects that its plan would  increase Medicare spending by an average of $1.3 billion per year over  the first 5 years of its plan\u2014about 0.2 percent of Medicare\u2019s annual costs  of more than $550 billion.

Specifically, Congress  should consider:  safeguards for USPS health plan fund assets by placing appropriate  constraints on their asset allocations (for example, limiting  investments to Treasury securities, including inflation-indexed  Treasury securities; or, to the extent that more risky assets are  permitted, using a conservative approach to setting the prefunding  discount rate); standards for the disposition of any surplus health plan assets that  reduce the risk of a new unfunded liability emerging in the future (for  example, standards for amortizing any surplus to mirror the  amortization of any unfunded liability); designation of an independent entity responsible for selecting  actuarial assumptions used to determine the health plan\u2019s funded  status; and protections for postal employees and retirees that are comparable to  those under FEHBP, including a formula for retirees\u2019 contribution to  health costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Potential FERS Surplus", "paragraphs": ["USPS had an estimated FERS surplus of $3.0 billion at the end of fiscal  year 2012, according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and  OPM will be calculating an updated estimate for the end of fiscal year  2013.
