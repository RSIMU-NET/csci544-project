For example, the framework does not establish strategic departmental intelligence priorities that can be used to inform annual planning decisions, such as what analytic activities to pursue and the level of investment to make, as called for in DHS guidance. According to officials from DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), it can be challenging for DHS components to focus on developing both strategic priorities and more tactical priorities that support their specific operations. Absent strategic priorities, DHS used component subject matter experts and other information to develop key questions of common interest they would address through analysis. As a result, DHS does not have reasonable assurance that component analytic activities and resource investments are aligned to support departmental priorities. The mechanisms to integrate analysis, however, gave components insight into one another's work and helped them avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication.", "I&A customers had mixed views on the extent to which its analytic products and services are useful. GAO's interviews with representatives of I&A's five customer groups indicate that two groups\u2014DHS leadership and state, local, tribal, and territorial partners\u2014found products to be useful, while three groups\u2014DHS components, the Intelligence Community, and the private sector\u2014generally did not. Representatives of four of the five groups said that they found other types of services, such as briefings, to be useful. Results from surveys that are attached to I&A products indicate that most customers were very satisfied with the products' usefulness, but the results are not generalizable because they reflect only the views of customers who chose to respond. To address this issue, I&A is conducting more comprehensive surveys and interviews with customers to evaluate the products and services that best meet their needs.

We also found that I&A  products tend to be based on multiple sources of information, including  DHS component data and information from the Intelligence Community,  whereas component products tend to be sourced primarily from internal  component data. In this way, I&A products aggregate information from  across the department and the Intelligence Community to present a  national picture, whereas component products use component  information to discuss the implications on component operations.

This bias exists because the  results reflect the views of I&A customers who chose to respond to the  feedback form and do not reflect the views of those who did not respond,  a fact that prevents I&A from drawing statistically significant conclusions  about the usefulness of its products since the results are not  representative of all customers. Also, certain products concerning  particularly notable topics can also account for a disproportionate number  of survey responses received, which can bias the overall results since the  responses do not reflect the full range of issued products. For example, in  September 2012, I&A data show that three intelligence products  accounted for 513 (88 percent) of the 586 total survey responses  received during the month. The remaining 73 responses (12 percent) I&A  received during the month covered a total of 18 products.", "Further, because I&A\u2019s products are distributed through broad  information-sharing networks and generally not sent directly to individual  recipients, I&A cannot determine the full extent of its customer base. I&A officials agree that this distribution method limits its ability to form  readership-wide conclusions based on the survey results; however, I&A  officials stated that I&A uses these networks to further its goal for a wide  distribution of its products. Additionally, because of the broad distribution  through information sharing networks, I&A cannot track the number of  individuals who ultimately open and read its products in order to obtain  more complete feedback. All of these factors limit I&A\u2019s ability to draw any  readership-wide conclusions about its products.", "Despite these limitations, I&A officials view the survey results as a useful  tool for generally understanding how their products are being received by  the customer base. The surveys also allow customers to submit product  and service improvement recommendations that help to inform I&A in  making adjustments to products to better serve customers\u2019 needs.  Officials from I&A\u2019s Production Management Division said they provide  the survey results to the I&A analytic division responsible for the product  in order for the division to consider and make improvements in future  products.

Specifically, we reviewed the Department of Homeland  Security Strategic Plan, Fiscal Years 2012-2016, the 2006 and 2008  versions of DHS Intelligence Enterprise Strategic Plan; Office of  Intelligence and Analysis Strategic Plan Fiscal Year 2011\u2013Fiscal Year  2018; Delegation to the Under Secretary for Intelligence and  Analysis/Chief Intelligence Officer, August 10, 2012; DHS Management  Directive 8110, Intelligence Integration and Management, January 30,  2006; Department of Homeland Security Directive 264-01, Intelligence  Integration and Management, June 12, 2013; DHS Instruction Number:  264-01-001 DHS Intelligence Enterprise June 28, 2013; the 2005 and  2009 versions of the Homeland Security Intelligence Council Charter; I&A  memos including the fiscal year 2013 and the fiscal year 2014 DHS  Enterprise Programmatic Guidance; DHS Intelligence Enterprise  Programs of Analysis (POA) for fiscal years 2011 through 2014; and the  Homeland Security Intelligence Priorities Framework for fiscal years 2012  and 2013 to determine the roles and responsibilities of DHS in managing  its enterprise and the analytic efforts of the enterprise, and how DHS was  carrying out these responsibilities.", "Additionally, we analyzed documents from DHS components for which  intelligence analysis is a core function in supporting their unique missions  and operations\u2014the U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security  Administration (TSA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services (USCIS)\u2014to help determine the roles and  responsibilities of component agency intelligence programs and how they  respond to the coordination and prioritization efforts of I&A.

According to DHS guidance, the appropriate vehicle for  establishing enterprise-wide intelligence priorities is the Homeland  Security Intelligence Priorities Framework.", "We met with the I&A Research Director and members of his staff, and the  Director of the Information Sharing and Enterprise Management Division  and his staff who are responsible for developing and implementing the  management coordination mechanisms for the enterprise. We also met  with representatives from the intelligence programs of USCIS, the U.S.  Coast Guard, CBP, ICE, and TSA to discuss the coordination  mechanisms established by DHS.", "Additionally, to address in the first objective whether overlap or  duplication exists in the analytic activities of the DHS Intelligence  Enterprise, we analyzed all 21 products written by I&A, CBP, and ICE  where these three organizations shared responsibility to answer  questions in the 2012 POA in support of DHS\u2019s border security mission.  We selected the 2012 POA because it was the most recent available  when we began this analysis. We selected this mission area for our  analysis because this departmental mission contained contributions from  the largest number of DHS intelligence components, and chose I&A,  CBP, and ICE products to review because these three entities had the  greatest number of key intelligence questions assigned to them within the  border security mission area. By reviewing only one mission area, we  cannot determine if there was duplication in other areas, but our findings  support statements from intelligence officials in both I&A and the  operational components that the content of their products differs because  of their unique missions and primary customer sets and, therefore the  products are not duplicative, even when they cover the same broad  topical area.", "Within the DHS mission area of securing the border, we requested an  inventory of finished intelligence products for fiscal year 2012 from I&A,  CBP, and ICE\u2014the three entities with the greatest number of key  intelligence questions assigned to them in this topic area. Products  written in 2012 were chosen because this was the most recent complete  available to us at the time of this analysis. According to an analysis of  these product inventories, we identified six key intelligence questions in  which I&A and either ICE or CBP both generated finished intelligence  products. In support of these six key intelligence questions, I&A, ICE, and  CBP generated a total of 21 finished intelligence products\u201415 authored  by I&A, 4 by ICE, and 2 by CBP. We analyzed these 21 products to  determine the extent to which duplication existed by comparing the topics,  sources, and customers of these products.", "To address the second objective, we met with I&A staff from the  Production Management Division to determine how I&A develops,  administers, and analyzes feedback surveys included with all I&A finished  intelligence products, as well as to discuss the efforts I&A had in place  through February 2014 to improve customer satisfaction. We then  analyzed the results of the feedback surveys that were included with all  fiscal year 2012 I&A finished analytic products to determine what readers  of these products thought about the quality and usefulness of them. We  also met with representatives from four of the five I&A customer groups:  DHS components; the Intelligence Community; state, local, tribal, and  territorial governments; and the private sector. While we did not meet with  representatives from DHS leadership, we did meet with representatives of  the I&A unit that briefs leadership. Specifically, we met with  representatives from the intelligence programs of the DHS components  for which intelligence analysis is a core function in supporting their  missions and operations\u2014USCIS, the U.S. Coast Guard, CBP, ICE, and  TSA\u2014to discuss the extent to which these organizations find I&A analysis  relevant and useful. We met with staff from the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence\u2014the office that administers the overall efforts of the  Intelligence Community\u2014to discuss their review of the quality of I&A  analytic products, as well as the usefulness of these products to the  Intelligence Community. We met with DHS and state and local  government agency staff members working at 7 of 78 state and major  urban area fusion centers\u2014centers that serve as primary focal points  within the state and local environments for the receipt, analysis,  gathering, and sharing of threat-related information among federal, state,  local, tribal, and territorial homeland security partners. The fusion centers  we met with were (1) the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center,  (2) El Paso (Texas) Fusion Center (no DHS staff were located in the El  Paso Fusion Center at the time of our discussion), (3) Montana All Threat  Intelligence Center, (4) New York State Intelligence Center, (5) San Diego  (California) Law Enforcement Coordination Center, (6) Texas Fusion  Center in Austin, and (7) the Washington State Fusion Center. These  fusion centers comprised 4 of the 6 centers we considered southwest  border fusion centers and 3 of the 11 northern border fusion centers. We  selected each center to provide access to a range of state-level users of  I&A analytic products with an emphasis on border issues because of our  examination of potential overlap or duplication related to DHS  components\u2019 intelligence analysis reporting on border issues. While  information we obtained at these locations cannot be generalized across  all fusion centers because we selected these locations based on the  diversity of participation in the POA and geographic locations along the  southwest and northern border, the units we visited provided us with an  overview of users\u2019 perspectives on the usefulness and relevance of I&A  analytic products. We also met with representatives of the Partnership for  Critical Infrastructure Security (PCIS), the National Council of Information  Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC), and individual representatives  from the Transportation and Commercial Facilities critical infrastructure  sectors to determine how the private sector views the analytic services  provided by I&A. We compared I&A\u2019s efforts against criteria in the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government that note the  importance for management to communicate to, and obtain information  from, both internal and external stakeholders that may have a significant  impact on the organization\u2019s ability to achieve its goals and utilize  resources effectively and efficiently.", "For objective two, we also reviewed the standards by which I&A\u2019s  products are judged. To do so we reviewed I&A Policy Directive 900.2- Producing Finished Intelligence (July 15, 2011), I&A Policy Directive  900.4-I&A Joint Production with State and Major Urban Area Fusion  Centers (August 31, 2011), I&A Policy Instruction IA-901 DHS Intelligence  and Analysis Review and Clearance of Analytic Products Disseminated  Outside the Federal Government, I&A memos including Fiscal Year 2013  and Fiscal Year 2014 DHS Intelligence Enterprise Programmatic  Guidance; and ODNI Intelligence Community Directive 203, Analytic  Standards (June 21, 2007). To obtain a general view of the quality of  these products, we reviewed the 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 DHS  Report to Congress on Voluntary Feedback from State, Local, Tribal, and  Private Sector Consumers; I&A\u2019s fiscal year 2011 Customer Feedback  Report and the September 2012 Production Performance Report that  includes monthly production and feedback information.", "For the third objective, we reviewed the U.S. Office of Personnel  Management Position Classification Standard Flysheet for Intelligence  Series GS-0132 June 1960, the classification standard in effect as of  December 2013, and the I&A Human Capital Standard Operating  Procedures to obtain basic information about personnel standards and  operations at I&A. To determine the challenges I&A experienced  maintaining a skilled workforce, we reviewed correspondence between  I&A and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence related to  obtaining excepted service hiring (November 2012-June 2013) and I&A- reported data on personnel attrition. To obtain information on intelligence  analyst hiring needs and practices, we reviewed the I&A memo on career  ladder decision and hiring standards (November 2012), the DHS  Competency Assessment Pilot frequently asked questions and  presentation, and the I&A Recruitment Strategy (January 2010). To  determine I&A training and development practices and needs we  reviewed the Fiscal Year 2013 Intelligence Training Academy Catalog,  DHS Intelligence Learning Roadmap for Analysts (September 2012), and  the Analysis 101/BITAC Study Report comparing two alternative  introductory courses for intelligence analysts prepared for I&A by Booz  Allen and SAIC (November 2008). We also reviewed the DHS Human  Resources, Performance Management Program (December 2008), and  I&A performance competencies to determine I&A\u2019s performance  management practices. We then compared I&A\u2019s work force planning  activities with those enumerated in DHS\u2019s Workforce Planning Guide  (November 2012), the DHS document that outlines the process for  workforce planning at DHS. We also met with representatives from I&A\u2019s  human capital office, training branch, mission support office, and the  acting Chief of Staff to discuss human capital recruitment, hiring, training,  and evaluation practices and procedures.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 to May 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Analysis of Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication in DHS Components\u2019 Intelligence Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Appendix IV provides additional information about our analysis of  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication in DHS components\u2019 intelligence  analysis activities. The intelligence analysis activities within DHS are  inherently fragmented, as multiple DHS components conduct intelligence  analysis in support of the same broad intelligence topics. However, on the  basis of our case study in the area of border security, we did not find  evidence of unnecessary overlap or duplication among the activities. DHS  intelligence entities said that implementing the mechanisms to date has  helped them to minimize such overlap and duplication."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Analysis Activities are Inherently Fragmented", "paragraphs": ["The intelligence analysis activities of the enterprise are inherently  fragmented, as multiple DHS components conduct intelligence analysis in  support of shared departmental goals. As articulated in the fiscal year  2012 DHS Intelligence Enterprise Program of Analysis, three to five DHS  intelligence components planned to provide intelligence analysis products  in support of each departmental goal in fiscal year 2012. For example, as  shown in table 1, five components planned to support the departmental  goal of Securing and Managing Our Borders through their fiscal year  2012 intelligence analysis activities.", "Although this creates fragmentation, each entity is providing distinct  perspectives because of its unique missions and primary customer sets.  As shown in table 2, I&A focuses on threats to the homeland in general,  whereas the operational components\u2014such as CBP, ICE, and TSA\u2014 each focus more narrowly on supporting their unique operational missions  through intelligence analysis. Further, DHS intelligence officials report  that the primary customers of I&A are DHS leadership and state and local  partners, whereas the primary customers of the operational components  are generally internal component customers.", "Despite distinct missions and primary customer sets, some overlap does  exist in the secondary customers that the six DHS intelligence entities  serve. For example, as shown in table 2, all six entities reported serving  the Intelligence Community, and three entities reported serving state and  local partners as part of their secondary customer sets. In some cases, it  may be appropriate for multiple entities to be involved in the same  programmatic or policy area because of the nature or magnitude of the  federal efforts. For example, having multiple DHS entities contributing  intelligence analysis to shared departmental goals and serving  overlapping customers can be beneficial, as it provides a mechanism to  share and validate information and to facilitate complementary analysis.  However, fragmentation and overlap may create inefficiencies if  customers are burdened with too much information or if entities are  inefficiently using resources to develop duplicate products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Showed No Unnecessary Overlap or Duplication among Select Products, and Customers We Interviewed Agreed", "paragraphs": ["We did not find evidence to suggest that DHS customers were being  burdened with too much information or that DHS resources were being  used to develop products that unnecessarily overlapped or were  duplicative. Specifically, senior intelligence officials from all seven fusion  centers we contacted said that they had not experienced any instances of  unnecessary overlap or duplication in the border security\u2013related  intelligence products they received from various DHS components.  Further, we did not find any duplicative products among those we  reviewed in the area of border security that were generated by different  components. We did identify one instance of overlap where two DHS  components provided similar information to similar customers in different  products, but the information was packaged differently such that the  products were not duplicative. Specifically, we identified one instance  where I&A and ICE each wrote an intelligence product on a similar  topic\u2014human smuggling\u2014and for similar customers\u2014DHS leadership  and the Intelligence Community. Both products discussed the relationship  between permissive visa policies and the potential for exploitation by  human-smuggling networks. Further, both products specifically identified  one particular country as susceptible to exploitation from human  smugglers due at least in part because of its permissive visa policies.", "However, we determined that the overlapping information was presented  in a different context in each product. Specifically, the I&A product  provided a summary graphic depicting the visa permissiveness level of  each country within a particular region of the world. This provided its  customers with a snapshot of countries with permissive visa policies and  a warning that these countries may be more susceptible to exploitation  from human smugglers than others. This graphic was presented as part  of I&A\u2019s Border Security Monitor\u2014a quarterly compilation of relevant  border security intelligence analysis from throughout the enterprise.  Alternatively, the ICE product was a broader assessment of the factors  that make certain locations vulnerable to exploitation from human  smuggling networks. Accordingly, the ICE product provided an analysis of  the reasons that the specifically identified country may be vulnerable to  human smuggling, identifying its visa permissiveness policy as just one  contributing factor.", "While our results cannot be generalized beyond the border security  mission area, our findings support statements from intelligence officials in  both I&A and the operational components that the content of their  products differs because of their unique missions and primary customer  sets and, therefore, are not duplicative, even when the products cover the  same broad topical area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Eileen R.
