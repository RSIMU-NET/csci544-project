Virtually all federal  operations are supported by computer systems and electronic data, and  agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their missions  and account for their resources without these information assets.

Specifically, NCPS  compared network traffic to known patterns of malicious data, or  \u201csignatures,\u201d but did not detect deviations from predefined baselines  of normal network behavior.
