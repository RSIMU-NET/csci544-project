The Office of Motor Carriers\u2019 investigators conduct on-site reviews of motor carriers\u2019 compliance with federal safety regulations, known as compliance reviews, that are used to determine whether each carrier is fit to operate safely on the nation\u2019s highways, known as a safety fitness rating. The Office of Motor Carriers also provides matching grants under the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program for states to perform roadside inspections of commercial vehicles and drivers, compliance reviews, and other commercial vehicle safety programs.

Under MCSAP, the federal government funds up to 80 percent of the costs of each state\u2019s motor carrier safety program. Federal funding for MCSAP has increased from $8 million in fiscal year 1984 to $78.2 million in fiscal 1997. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required that by January 1994, each of the 48 contiguous states participate in Safetynet, the Office of Motor Carrier\u2019s (OMC) automated database system used to monitor the safety performance of commercial motor carriers. The act also directed OMC to provide grants for states to develop a Commercial Vehicle Information System that would link OMC\u2019s motor carrier safety information with states\u2019 motor vehicle registration systems. The Commercial Vehicle Information System project led to the development of OMC\u2019s Safety Status Measurement System (SafeStat) program.", "The Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 directed the Secretary of Transportation to establish a procedure to determine the safety fitness of owners and operators of commercial vehicles. In response, OMC modified its existing safety management audit program to institute safety reviewswith follow-up compliance reviews. During a compliance review, OMC and/or state investigators perform an on-site review of a motor carrier\u2019s compliance with federal safety regulations by assessing its policies, management controls, and operations. Typically, investigators examine a sample of the carrier\u2019s records, including drivers\u2019 hours-of-service logs, commercial drivers\u2019 license requirements, alcohol- and drug-testing records, vehicle maintenance and inspection records, and accident records. Investigators also may perform full vehicle inspections of several of the carrier\u2019s vehicles. The investigators give the carrier a satisfactory, conditional, or unsatisfactory rating on the basis of this review.", "From 1983 through 1995, the rate of fatal accidents involving large trucks dropped by 42 percent\u2014from 4.3 to 2.5 fatal accidents per 100 million vehicle miles traveled.

The lower fatal accident rate reflects a (1) 57-percent growth in total vehicle miles driven by large trucks and (2) 9-percent drop in the number of large trucks involved in fatal accidents. However, almost all of this decline occurred during MCSAP\u2019s first 10 years; since 1992, the fatal accident rate has been relatively stable.

OMC and the states also established drug- and alcohol-testing requirements and a commercial driver\u2019s license program designed to eliminate the opportunity for drivers to evade law enforcement penalties by using commercial licenses from more than one state.

During the past 3 years, about 26 percent of the commercial vehicle accidents reported to Safetynet involved vehicles operated by intrastate carriers, including dump trucks and garbage trucks. Maryland State Police officials noted that these trucks may rarely be inspected because they operate within a metropolitan area and can more readily bypass state weigh stations by using other routes. In fiscal year 1996, 24 states conducted compliance reviews of one or more intrastate commercial motor carriers.", "OMC officials told us that their policy is to encourage, but not require, states to develop compliance review programs. While the OMC officials support a greater state role in conducting compliance reviews, they noted that OMC wants to give each state more flexibility to decide the combination of programs that would best reduce commercial vehicle accidents. OMC also has offered states the option to issue \u201cU.S. DOT numbers\u201d to intrastate carriers and enter them into OMC\u2019s motor carrier management information system to provide a single set of identification numbers for tracking accidents and the results of roadside inspections and compliance reviews. OMC requires, however, that states conduct a census of their intrastate carriers to provide a complete and accurate list of carriers. Connecticut, Kentucky, Indiana, Utah, and Wyoming have completed their census, and other states have expressed an interest in using U.S. DOT numbers.", "MCSAP coordinators for several states we contacted believe that their state could assume lead responsibility for conducting compliance reviews. However, MCSAP coordinators in several other states expressed concern about further expanding their state\u2019s role in the compliance review program because of funding and personnel constraints. For example, one coordinator stated that, without additional MCSAP funding, his state may have to reduce the number of roadside inspections to conduct more compliance reviews.

Of the remaining compliance reviews conducted, 14 percent were to follow up prior enforcement cases, 14 percent were in response to complaints,9 percent were initial reviews of carriers\u2019 operations; 4 percent were in response to carriers\u2019 requests for a compliance review; and 12 percent were for other reasons. Among the other reasons for a compliance review is if a motor carrier\u2019s vehicle was involved in a major accident that resulted in multiple fatalities or closed down an interstate highway for several hours.", "Compliance review investigators found that 63 percent of the carriers examined in fiscal year 1996 did not have a recordable accident during the previous 12 months.

About 77 percent of these carriers had an accident rate below the average rate.", "In a March 1997 report, the DOT Office of Inspector General found that OMC\u2019s SCE list did not ensure that carriers with the worst safety records were targeted for compliance reviews. In particular, the report stated that the SCE list did not define problem carriers and used factors that did not sufficiently emphasize on-the-road performance to prioritize carriers. For example, a carrier that transported passengers or hazardous materials was given more points and, therefore, was more likely to be reviewed than one that transported general freight, regardless of each carrier\u2019s actual accident record. The report also stated that a carrier\u2019s annual mileage, the number of months since its last safety fitness rating, and its overall safety fitness rating were descriptive factors not directly related to the carrier\u2019s on-the-road performance.

SafeStat ranks motor carriers on the basis of performance-based data in four safety evaluation areas (SEA): (1) accident rates; (2) driver factors, including out-of-service violations from roadside inspections; (3) vehicle factors, including out-of-service violations from roadside inspections; and (4) safety management practices and policy, including the results of prior compliance reviews and enforcement actions. SafeStat also weights these data on the basis of the severity and age of an event. For example, SafeStat gives more weight to a fatal or serious injury accident than to a tow-away accident and to an accident that occurred within 6 months than one that occurred more than 6 months previously. (See app. III for a more detailed description of SafeStat.)", "Table 2 shows the SafeStat categories for carriers ranked among the worst 25 percent of all carriers in at least one SEA. OMC will conduct a compliance review of each carrier included in category A or category B. OMC also considers those carriers in category C to be poor performers. Each category A, B, and C motor carrier remains in OMC\u2019s Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Process until its on-the-road performance improves sufficiently for SafeStat not to subsequently identify them.", "The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center tested SafeStat\u2019s effectiveness in identifying problem carriers by using prior year information and then comparing the subsequent accident rates of carriers that SafeStat identified as being poor performers with those for all other carriers. The Volpe Center found, in particular, that the subsequent accident rate for poor performers in the (1) accident SEA was 259 percent higher than that for motor carriers not identified and (2) driver SEA was 81 percent higher than that for motor carriers not identified. Many of the MCSAP coordinators we interviewed believe that SafeStat will considerably improve the targeting of problem carriers for compliance reviews as compared with the SCE list\u2019s criteria. OMC officials noted that if SafeStat targets problem carriers better than the SCE list does, OMC and state investigators could improve the program\u2019s effectiveness while performing about the same number of compliance reviews. However, OMC officials noted that better targeting could reduce the total number of compliance reviews performed because investigators may become involved with more complex enforcement cases, increasing the staff days spent per case.", "In April 1997, OMC used SafeStat to generate its first nationwide list of problem carriers, which included 1,700 category A and B carriers and 3,300 category C carriers. OMC will generate a new list of problem carriers every 6 months. Beginning in October 1997, OMC is sending letters to category C motor carriers notifying them of their poor safety performance. Each letter will identify the carrier\u2019s accidents, out-of-service orders from roadside inspections, and violations and enforcement actions from compliance reviews that provide the basis for the SafeStat score. The letters will give a carrier the opportunity to correct any database mistakes, especially if an accident or inspection was wrongly assigned to the carrier. The letters will advise category C carriers that they will be subject to a compliance review unless their SafeStat score subsequently improves.", "OMC\u2019s policy that a compliance review be performed of each category A and B carrier includes a revisit to any carrier that remains in either category A or B when a new SafeStat list is generated. OMC also plans to conduct a compliance review of any carrier listed in category C after the carrier has been listed in category C for a third time. In addition to these motor carriers, OMC\u2019s regional offices can target other motor carriers from (1) category D carriers that were among the worst 25 percent of the carriers in the accident category only and/or (2) hazardous materials carriers and bus companies that the SCE list prioritized because of the potential severity of an accident involving these carriers. Roadside inspection data may not be sufficient for a SafeStat ranking for bus companies because buses often are allowed to bypass weigh stations so that passengers are not inconvenienced.", "SafeStat is part of the larger Commercial Vehicle Information System demonstration program. The program links OMC\u2019s databases with states\u2019 motor vehicle registration systems, which provide current information on each vehicle that a carrier operates.

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 took a first step toward developing a comprehensive database by requiring that the 48 contiguous states submit data to Safetynet on commercial vehicles\u2019 recordable accidents and the results of roadside inspections and compliance reviews. The states have substantially improved the quantity and quality of the safety data on commercial vehicles reported to Safetynet since 1991. (See app. IV for three examples of innovative ways that the states are collecting, analyzing, and using these data to improve traffic enforcement.) OMC and the states increased the percentage of reported accidents from about 14 percent in fiscal year 1992 to an estimated 74 percent in fiscal 1995.", "To improve the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of roadside inspection data, OMC has provided funding through MCSAP grants for states to purchase laptop computers and special software, known as ASPEN, that enable inspectors to upload inspection results directly into Safetynet\u2019s electronic database. Using ASPEN, instead of paper forms, improves accuracy because the software alerts inspectors to inconsistent information, particularly if the carrier\u2019s name and the entered U.S. DOT number do not match. (Without the correct U.S. DOT number, SafeStat cannot attribute the inspection results to the motor carrier.) The electronic entry of the inspection results also substantially reduces the time needed to transmit data to Safetynet because it eliminates the step of mailing paper forms to a central office for entry into the computer\u2019s database.", "In addition, to better ensure that adequate inspection data are collected on the drivers and vehicles of individual motor carriers, OMC introduced the Inspection Selection System (ISS) software in 1995. As of March 1997, 36 states were using ISS to help inspectors select vehicles for inspection and focus the inspection on problems identified in a carrier\u2019s previous inspections. As a vehicle pulls into an inspection station, its U.S. DOT number is entered into ISS. The program assigns the vehicle a score on the basis of the number and the results of the motor carrier\u2019s previous inspections and compliance reviews. Specifically, ISS recommends an inspection for a motor carrier that has a poor safety record or has had very few roadside inspections relative to its size in the prior 2 years. Alternatively, state inspectors may select vehicles for inspections on the basis of either random sampling or judgmental factors, including the type of commodity transported or observed safety violations.", "Improving the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of accident data is more difficult than improving roadside inspection data primarily because (1) accident reporting is decentralized, involving many more state and local law enforcement officers, and (2) the officer at an accident scene often has other more urgent concerns and gives low priority to obtaining all of the necessary information and filing the accident report with the state. Several states told us that they are taking actions to encourage their law enforcement officers to improve the reporting of accidents involving commercial vehicles. For example, some states we contacted are providing officers with more training in completing the 22-item supplemental form developed by the National Governors\u2019 Association for reporting commercial vehicle accidents. Similarly, some states are incorporating the supplemental form\u2019s items into their basic accident-reporting form to further streamline the needed information. An OMC official noted that accident reporting is likely to improve as law enforcement officers become aware that SafeStat is using their reports to identify poor performers in their states.", "In December 1996, OMC provided the states with guidance that tightened the time frames for uploading (1) roadside inspection and compliance review data to within 7 days if the data are collected electronically or within 21 days if paper forms are used and (2) accident data to within 90 days from the date of the accident. Previously, the standards for uploading the information were 90 days for inspections, 30 days for compliance reviews, and 180 days for accidents. OMC\u2019s data showed that the states, on average, had reduced the time for uploading roadside inspection data to Safetynet from 49 days in fiscal year 1996 to 42 days in fiscal 1997. However, 42 states did not meet OMC\u2019s 21-day standard for paper forms, and only Connecticut met OMC\u2019s 7-day standard for electronically uploading inspection data. OMC\u2019s data show that the states, on average, reduced the time for uploading accident data to Safetynet from 159 days in fiscal year 1996 to 98 days in fiscal 1997. (This improvement is somewhat overstated because no accident data for Maryland were uploaded during fiscal year 1997.) Five states did not meet OMC\u2019s former 180-day standard for uploading accident data during fiscal year 1997.", "Eight of the 16 MCSAP coordinators we contacted do not believe that their state will meet the tighter time frames for uploading inspection and compliance review data. Eight MCSAP coordinators also do not believe that their state will meet the new accident-reporting time frames. For example, Ohio\u2019s MCSAP coordinator told us that Ohio relies on the voluntary cooperation of local police departments to report commercial vehicle accidents, unlike many states that require state and local police to file traffic accident reports with a state highway agency. Ohio\u2019s MCSAP coordinator also noted that uploading accident data into Safetynet has been delayed by a backlog in electronically entering the data from paper forms in the state\u2019s central office. OMC officials acknowledged that if commercial motor carriers\u2019 accidents were unreported, their SafeStat rankings would be reduced for the accident SEA, possibly allowing some carriers to avoid being listed among the worst 25 percent of the performers and subsequently not receive a compliance review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OMC Has Used Compliance Reviews to Rate a Carrier\u2019s Safety Fitness", "paragraphs": ["OMC uses a compliance review to assess a commercial motor carrier\u2019s management controls that results in a safety fitness rating.

The investigators also examine the carrier\u2019s recordable accidents. OMC distinguishes among its motor carrier safety regulations by designating certain regulations as (1) acute, because violating one of these regulations would create an immediate risk to persons or property, or (2) critical, because violations, if occurring in patterns, would indicate a breakdown in the effective control over essential safety functions. Examples of acute regulations are several related to controlled substances and alcohol use and testing. Examples of critical regulations are several driver\u2019s hours-of-service regulations that specify the maximum working hours and minimum hours off duty for drivers at selected times during an 8-day period.", "Each compliance rating factor is evaluated to determine whether the carrier violated any of the acute and critical regulations. A carrier\u2019s rating factor is (1) satisfactory if no violations of acute or critical regulations exist, (2) conditional if one violation of an acute or critical regulation exists, and (3) unsatisfactory if two or more violations of acute or critical regulations exist. In addition, each carrier is rated on the number of recordable, preventable accidents per million miles that its vehicles traveled during the past year. (See table V.1 in app. V.)", "Of the motor carriers that received a compliance review in fiscal year 1996, 35 percent were rated unsatisfactory for the operational rating factor, which includes hours-of-service regulations, while 13 percent were rated unsatisfactory for the driver rating factor\u2014the second highest unsatisfactory category. (See table V.2 in app. V.) A substantial number of carriers violated at least one critical driver\u2019s hours-of-service regulation. (See table V.3 in app.V.) OMC gives double weight to the violation of these regulations because of the link between hours-of-service violations and driver fatigue.", "OMC does not track the time that investigators spend evaluating each rating factor. Compliance review investigators told us that they spend between 30 and 40 percent of their time examining the driver\u2019s hours-of-service records during a typical compliance review, but they added that this percentage could vary, depending on known problems, available records, and whether it was a first visit or a follow-up. We did not identify any studies that specifically analyzed the relationship between the accuracy of the driver\u2019s hours-of-service logs and accidents; however, we found two studies that generally examined these issues. A 1995 study by the National Transportation Safety Board on single-vehicle heavy truck crashes found that drivers were more likely to have exceeded OMC\u2019s maximum allowable hours of service in fatigue-related accidents. A 1996 study by the Northwestern University Traffic Institute examined the relationship between a carrier\u2019s hours-of-service logs and accident rates, but the study primarily relied on interviews with representatives of 26 motor carriers that had received a compliance review. The study stated that the most frequent suggestion for modifying OMC\u2019s safety fitness rating system was to give more weight to performance-based measures, including accidents and roadside inspection results, and eliminate the stringent emphasis on record keeping. In November 1996, OMC published an advance notice of proposed rule making in the Federal Register to request comments on its hours-of-service regulation (49 C.F.R. part 395), as required by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-88)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Motor Carriers Appealed Their Safety Fitness Ratings in Fiscal Year 1996", "paragraphs": ["Of the 8,952 carriers that received a compliance review in fiscal year 1996, 54 percent were rated satisfactory, 32 percent were rated conditional, and 12 percent were rated unsatisfactory. (See table V.4 in app. V.) A carrier\u2019s overall safety fitness rating is satisfactory if none of the six rating factors are unsatisfactory and at most two rating factors are conditional. A carrier\u2019s rating is conditional if either no rating factor is unsatisfactory and more than two rating factors are conditional or one rating factor is unsatisfactory and at most two rating factors are conditional. A carrier\u2019s rating is unsatisfactory if one rating factor is unsatisfactory and more than two rating factors are conditional or if at least two rating factors are unsatisfactory.", "A motor carrier that receives an unsatisfactory or conditional rating may appeal its rating on either factual or procedural grounds within 90 days after the rating is received. Of about 3,940 motor carriers that received either a conditional or unsatisfactory rating in fiscal year 1996, only 17 appealed their rating within 90 days. After reviewing each case, OMC (1) upgraded the ratings of eight carriers, primarily on the basis of actions taken by the carrier; (2) denied the appeal of eight carriers; and (3) did not act on one appeal because a state had conducted the compliance review and had not entered the results into OMC\u2019s Safetynet database.", "Alternatively, a carrier may request a new safety fitness rating on the basis of operational improvements made. This request usually results in a new compliance review. Officials in two OMC regional offices told us that a request for a change of a carrier\u2019s rating is relatively rare and that their regional offices typically try to schedule a follow-up visit within 3 months. Another OMC official added that a follow-up compliance review usually results in an upgraded rating because a carrier would not request one unless previously cited violations had been addressed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMC Plans to Reexamine Its Criteria for Rating Safety Fitness", "paragraphs": ["In March 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that OMC had failed to carry out its statutory obligation to promulgate a regulation that establishes criteria for determining whether a carrier has complied with the safety fitness requirements of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984. While this decision applied only to the safety fitness rating of a single carrier, OMC has temporarily stopped issuing ratings. To address the court\u2019s concerns, OMC published a notice of proposed rule making in the May 1997 Federal Register that would establish a safety fitness rating methodology, including six rating factors, substantially similar to the methodology that OMC had used to rate motor carriers. (OMC also published an interim final rule that applies only to hazardous materials and passenger carriers.) The notice of proposed rule making would revise the accident rating factor by (1) eliminating the determination of whether each recordable accident was preventable by the motor carrier or the driver, (2) increasing the threshold for an unsatisfactory rating from 1 accident to 1.6 accidents per million miles driven, and (3) eliminating the satisfactory and conditional ratings.", "The notice of proposed rule making states that the safety fitness rating methodology is a short-term approach needed to address the court of appeals\u2019 decision. The notice further states that, in the longer term, OMC plans to shift from using compliance reviews to performance-based criteria for determining whether motor carriers are fit to conduct commercial vehicle operations safely in interstate commerce. OMC believes that SafeStat can be successfully employed to identify the worst performing carriers within the next 2 years. As a first step in this transition, OMC plans to publish an advance notice of proposed rule making later this year to solicit public comments on alternative approaches for rating the safety fitness of commercial motor carriers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OMC\u2019s SCE list and other criteria for selecting motor carriers for compliance reviews did not effectively target commercial motor carriers with poor safety performance. While OMC\u2019s new SafeStat system is designed to better identify problem carriers by using on-the-road performance data, it depends upon the states to submit complete, accurate, and timely data on recordable accidents and the results of roadside inspections and compliance reviews. However, some states currently lack adequate data, particularly for accidents. Substantial gaps in the reported data can change a carrier\u2019s score, thus affecting SafeStat\u2019s reliability. In addition, 14 states do not use the Inspection Selection System for selecting vehicles for roadside inspections, and small motor carriers may get no ranking or a biased ranking by SafeStat if few roadside inspections are performed on their vehicles and drivers.", "We agree in concept with OMC\u2019s announced plan to use performance-based data for rating the safety fitness of commercial motor carriers. However, for this approach to succeed, the states must provide substantially complete, accurate, and timely data to Safetynet. While OMC has taken steps to improve states\u2019 data reporting by, for example, introducing the Inspection Selection System and providing funding for the states to purchase laptop computers to directly upload roadside inspection results, many states have not provided complete and timely data that meet OMC\u2019s reporting requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that the safety fitness ratings of commercial motor carriers accurately reflect their on-the-road performance, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation (1) identify the barriers that prevent the states from providing complete and timely data and work with the states to develop a strategy for addressing each barrier and (2) develop alternative approaches to SafeStat, such as consulting with state and local law enforcement officials to identify problem motor carriers, in the states that have inadequate data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Department of Transportation with a draft of this report for review and comment.

DOT agreed with the overall message of the report, stating that it was fair and accurate, and agreed with our recommendation that it work with the states to develop a strategy for addressing barriers that prevent the states from providing complete and timely data. However, DOT disagreed with our recommendation that it develop alternative approaches to SafeStat in the states that have inadequate data, stating that (1) its resources would be better spent by working with the states to improve their data and (2) developing separate processes for different states or individual populations of carriers would not be practical or an effective use of resources because an interstate carrier\u2019s performance is influenced by multiple states.", "We continue to believe that DOT needs to develop alternative approaches for the states that have inadequate data, especially on recordable accidents, because of the importance of improving the safety fitness of motor carriers with poor safety records. An alternative approach need not be labor intensive; for example, it could involve asking a state to identify for compliance reviews any motor carrier whose drivers or vehicles have multiple out-of-service violations. Alternatively, OMC could modify SafeStat for the states that have inadequate accident data to rank carriers only on the basis of the other three SEAs that use roadside inspection, compliance review, and enforcement case results.
