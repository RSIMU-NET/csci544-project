Among births to teens aged 15 to 17, 84 percent occurred outside of marriage. Although the teen birth rate has been declining steadily in recent years, the United States has the highest teen birth rate of all industrialized nations\u2014about 54 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19 as of 1996, nearly twice as high as the next nation, the United Kingdom. Families started by teenagers received an estimated $39 billion in federal assistance in 1995 from programs such as Medicaid; Aid to Families With Dependent Children; and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children.", "Teenage pregnancy and parenthood have unfortunate consequences for society, teenage mothers, and the children born to them. Teen mothers frequently do not complete high school, have poor earnings, and have increased dependency on the welfare system. A child born to a teen mother is more likely to have a low birthweight and health problems, suffer abuse, live in an inferior home environment, be poor, and be less likely to succeed in school. Moreover, a child born to a teen is more likely to become a teenage parent.", "In an effort to prevent teen pregnancy, the federal government and states have taken a number of actions. For example, the Congress recently enacted welfare reform legislation that contains provisions directed at reducing out-of-wedlock childbearing and welfare dependency and promoting sexual abstinence education, especially to teenagers. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is developing a national strategy to prevent teen pregnancy, while states and local governments and private entities are implementing strategies for addressing the problem of teenage pregnancy and childbearing.", "Because of your interest in efforts to prevent teen pregnancy, you asked us to provide information on (1) state strategies to reduce teen pregnancy and how states fund these efforts, (2) how welfare reform affected states\u2019 strategies, (3) the extent to which programs that are part of states\u2019 prevention strategies are evaluated, and (4) what teen pregnancy prevention activities the federal government supports.", "For this review, we focused on eight states that had longstanding teen pregnancy prevention (TPP) strategies in place: California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Oregon, and Vermont. The teen birth rates in these states vary; some had experienced recent declines, and some had more stable rates. These states also employed a variety of strategies to prevent teen pregnancy, but the strategies are not necessarily representative of the nation. During our state visits, we interviewed officials from multiple state agencies\u2014health, social services, education, and justice\u2014who were responsible for implementing their states\u2019 TPP strategies. We also held discussions with local officials who were responsible for implementing the state strategies and some of the teens involved in the programs. We obtained information on state TPP strategies and programs, including state and federal financial assistance, and state efforts to evaluate them. Although we collected information on state strategies and programs, we did not evaluate them.", "To determine the federal role in preventing teen pregnancy, we met with HHS officials who were knowledgeable about TPP activities. We also obtained written responses to questions on programs, funding, surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation from HHS and other federal agencies that HHS identified as having a role related to teen pregnancy prevention. To learn more about teen pregnancy prevention, demographics, research, programs, and other issues, we met with and obtained information from experts in academia and relevant organizations. (See app. I for a detailed description of our scope and methodology.) We conducted our work between April 1997 and November 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Nationally, teen birth rates have declined steadily in the last several years. From 1991 to 1997, the number of teens having engaged in sexual activity has also decreased; for sexually active teens, the rate of condom use has increased. However, the teen birth rate in the United States is high at about 54 per 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19. Teen birth rates vary greatly by state, ranging in 1996 from 30 per 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19 in Vermont to 76 per 1,000 in Mississippi.", "Research shows that four risk factors consistently predict teen pregnancy: poverty, early school failure, early behavior problems, and family problems and dysfunction. Risk factors for teen pregnancy are common to other problem youth behavior, such as delinquency and substance abuse. Research has also identified several factors that can help protect against teen pregnancy, including positive relationships with parents and positive connections to a school community. Recent reviews of program evaluation results concluded that certain approaches are more promising than others, but too few programs have been rigorously evaluated to assess their effect on teen pregnancy.", "Numerous federal, state, and local agencies as well as private citizens and organizations have had a role in TPP activities. For decades, the federal government has supported efforts to prevent teen pregnancy. As part of HHS\u2019 Healthy People 2000 initiative, each state sets goals to reduce teen pregnancy. To help meet these goals, the federal government provides funding to states and local communities for teen pregnancy prevention through a variety of grants and programs administered primarily by HHS. HHS also supports research and data collection and surveillance on the magnitude, trends, and causes of teen pregnancies and births. The 1996 welfare reform legislation also includes provisions aimed at reducing teen pregnancy. For example, the new law provides funding for abstinence-only education\u2014sex education programs that emphasize abstinence from all sexual activity until marriage and exclude instruction on contraception\u2014and allows states to use their TANF block grants for other TPP activities. In addition, the legislation requires states to set goals for decreasing out-of-wedlock births and will financially reward states with bonuses for the largest decreases in all out-of-wedlock births. The legislation also requires teen parents receiving assistance to stay in school and live at home or in another approved setting. States must also indicate how they intend to address the problem of statutory rape, and the government is required to study the link between teen pregnancy and statutory rape. Finally, the new law requires HHS to develop a national strategy to prevent out-of-wedlock teen pregnancy.", "States in our review have designed strategies for reducing teen pregnancy and have implemented and overseen programs that support their strategies. Generally, state health departments lead state TPP efforts. However, because of the crosscutting nature of teen pregnancy prevention, coordination is necessary with other state agencies whose programs and activities can affect efforts to prevent teen pregnancy, such as departments of social services, justice, and education. Governors\u2019 offices, special commissions, and task forces can also play a central role in designing and implementing strategies and programs at the state level. States generally administer statewide programs, but most of the responsibility for implementing programs is delegated to local communities. States also encourage building coalitions among community groups and organizations involved in teen pregnancy prevention. State strategies must operate within the context of statutes, local policies, and other activities in the state.", "At the local level, public institutions, like schools and health departments as well as community-based and other organizations, often implement TPP programs or otherwise influence how TPP programs are implemented. Finally, some private organizations at the national, state, or local level may support public efforts or, in some cases, run independent initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States\u2019 Teen Pregnancy Prevention Strategies Target Different Groups and Are Implemented at the Local Level", "paragraphs": ["In their efforts to address the problem of teen pregnancy, the states that we visited developed prevention strategies with multiple components that included a variety of programs and services. But in all cases, a key objective of these states\u2019 strategies was to target high-risk groups, such as teens living under impoverished conditions. Within the context of their broad strategies, states generally gave localities the flexibility to administer programs to meet local needs and preferences. States identified the federal government as a major contributor of funds that support their TPP strategies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Strategies Have Multiple Components", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1980s, the TPP strategies in the eight states that we visited have evolved from focusing on services for teen parents to an array of programs with increased emphasis on prevention, while still providing programs and services for pregnant and parenting teens. The TPP strategies of all the states we visited contained six basic components: sex education, family planning services, teen subsequent pregnancy prevention programs, male involvement, comprehensive youth development, and public awareness. (See table 1.) Although each state generally had all of these components in their TPP strategies, the emphasis placed on the components and the types of services and programs included in their strategies varied.", "Two of these components\u2014male involvement and youth development\u2014are beginning to play prominent roles in states\u2019 TPP strategies. Traditionally, pregnancy prevention efforts almost exclusively targeted young women. More recently, strategies have begun to focus on young men\u2019s role in decisions to have sex and to use contraception. In 1995, 68 percent of males surveyed by the National Survey of Adolescent Males reported having had intercourse by age 18. The survey also observed that one of the biggest shifts in teen reproductive behavior is the improvement in teenage males\u2019 use of contraception. These shifts suggest that male teens can be encouraged to delay sex or use contraception if they have begun having sex.", "All the states we visited included a male involvement component in their TPP strategies in an effort to change male behavior and produce more promising results. For example, California\u2019s male involvement program\u2014a 3-year, $8 million grant program established in 1995\u2014funds 23 projects across the state to improve teen males\u2019 motivation for being sexually responsible through peer education, mentoring, youth conferences, and other activities. California also supports prevention and parenting programs for incarcerated young men and has increased enforcement of statutory rape laws to increase the prosecution and conviction of adult men who have unlawful sex with minors. In addition, one of the state\u2019s public awareness campaigns specifically targets males. Georgia\u2019s male involvement effort aims to establish community-based programs that focus on male responsibility for pregnancy prevention, responsible fatherhood, and motivation for academic achievement and economic self-sufficiency. In 1996, Georgia used $265,500 from the Medicaid Indigent Care Trust Fund (ICTF) to sponsor 17 projects across the state. Grant recipients included health departments, community centers, and various chapters of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. In 1997, Georgia used $200,000 from ICTF to award 23 grants that focused specifically on pregnancy prevention programs from a male perspective.", "All of the states we visited also included youth development\u2014another nontraditional component\u2014in their TPP strategies. Although many of these programs do not focus specifically on teen pregnancy prevention, states and some experts believe they can reduce teen pregnancy by improving teens\u2019 belief in their future and improving their education and career opportunities. Youth development activities often include mentoring, after-school homework assistance and tutoring, peer leadership, self-esteem building, social and recreational activities, and sex education. For example, Illinois\u2019 Teen REACH (Responsibility, Education, Achievement, Caring, and Hope)\u2014an $8.4-million annual after-school program\u2014aims to decrease teen pregnancies, arrests, alcohol and drug use and increase school attendance and completion and work or work-related activities. The program targets girls and boys aged 10 to 17 at 41 sites across the state and will link participants to other state and community-based programs and services.", "Table 2 summarizes the activities and services in the various components that the eight states used to implement their TPP strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Targeting High-Risk Groups Is a Key Objective of States\u2019 Strategies", "paragraphs": ["A key objective of all the states\u2019 strategies is to target their TPP efforts to groups or communities at higher risk of teen pregnancy. California, for example, targeted TPP efforts to communities and neighborhoods with high rates of teen births, high poverty and unemployment rates, and low education levels. The states\u2019 strategies also focused on meeting the needs of three different groups of teens: those who were not yet sexually active, those who were sexually active, and those who were already pregnant or were parenting. Louisiana is targeting 12 zip codes in the New Orleans area with the highest teen birth rates in the city. Oregon offers special life-skills training for teens whose parents receive public assistance because they are at increased risk of becoming teen parents. California, Illinois, and Vermont developed programs aimed at youth in foster care or with foster parents because research has shown that these youth are at a greater risk for unsafe sexual behavior and teen pregnancy. Other state strategies target high-risk groups such as incarcerated males and siblings of teen mothers.", "The states we visited were using different types of data to target TPP efforts to high-risk communities and youth. For example, all of the states in our review use teen birth data, frequently broken down by zip code, to identify and target high-risk areas. Illinois uses data from a sexually transmitted disease reporting project sponsored by HHS\u2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help target TPP initiatives. In addition, the states that participated in the federal Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) use this data in developing their strategies and programs. For example, to improve access to and use of contraception, Oregon uses YRBS data to target sexually active teens who report not using contraception."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Implementation Varied at the Local Level", "paragraphs": ["While TPP strategies were applicable statewide, the states we visited typically gave communities flexibility in selecting and implementing programs to meet local needs and preferences. States generally offered localities a choice among certain state-approved programs or programs that used promising approaches. Communities selected programs that they found most consistent with local policy and values. According to state officials, this resulted in a mix of programs, approaches, and services that varied among communities within a state. Some communities, for example, have chosen programs that encourage abstinence, while others chose a more comprehensive approach that includes abstinence-based sex education as well as access to family planning services, including contraceptive services. Still other communities emphasized youth development programs that focus not on teen pregnancy but on general skill building aimed at improving youth life options. In particular, family planning and sex education programs varied considerably among communities because of local preferences and policies, particularly in schools.", "Providing sex education and access to family planning services, particularly in school-based settings, varied considerably among communities because they adopted approaches consistent with their preferences and values. Even though each state we visited encouraged or mandated sex education in the schools, local policies dictated the content of such programs in school settings. In some cases, states offer these programs in settings other than schools; in others, state strategies tried to encourage a school-based approach.", "For example, Maine and Vermont provide funding for health educators who work with schools to provide technical assistance, develop curricula, and train teachers in sex education. But officials in these states said that not all schools offer sex education and in those that do, the curricula vary. Oregon\u2019s strategy encourages the use of a specific abstinence education program for sixth- and seventh-graders and encourages comprehensive sex education in grades 5 through 12. Oregon officials report that 45 percent of the state\u2019s sixth- and seventh-graders received the prescribed abstinence curricula but said that only a few schools are providing comprehensive sex education in the higher grades. Louisiana\u2019s strategy encourages sex education in schools but only within a targeted area with high birth rates. Illinois\u2019 strategy encourages sex education in community or home settings and funds community-based sex education programs. Maryland\u2019s strategy includes a media campaign and outreach program that encourages parents to be the primary sex educators of their children as well as encouraging comprehensive health education in the schools. Two states, Oregon and Maine, are beginning to implement systems that are intended to encourage schools to teach sex education.", "Although not a part of the states\u2019 strategies, all eight states received federal funding from CDC to support school HIV prevention education programs. The purposes of these programs are similar to those of some TPP programs\u2014to increase the percentage of high school students who do not engage in intercourse and to increase the percentage of sexually active teens who correctly and consistently use condoms. Officials in some of the states we visited cited HIV prevention education as one reason for the decline in teen pregnancy in their states.", "Illinois, Maine, and Oregon encouraged access to family planning in school-based health centers. However, local policies and statutes control the types of school-based family planning services\u2014primarily contraceptives and information on abortion\u2014that may be made available in these centers. Some communities permitted school health centers to dispense contraception\u2014including condoms, birth control pills, and implantable and injectable birth control\u2014while other communities only allowed school health centers to refer students to other facilities for these services. In some states, such as Georgia, laws restrict referrals and providing family planning information in schools. Louisiana state laws prohibit school-based health centers from providing any family planning services, but the law allows schools to refer students elsewhere for these services. Even though California and Maryland did not include school-based health centers in their strategies, these states had some school-based health centers that provided referrals and access to family planning where permitted by local communities.", "To improve teen access to family planning services, some states included in their strategies access to family planning in other settings. For example, California\u2019s strategy includes over 2,200 state-funded community, hospital, university, and private practice providers that serve low-income males and females, with 56 of these clinics offering enhanced counseling for teens. Georgia provides similar services along with other youth services and activities in 27 community-based youth centers. Also, strategies in Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Oregon, and Vermont included collaboration with the federal Title X Family Planning Program to overcome barriers to teen access by opening teen-only clinics, having clinics open at hours convenient for teens, and doing outreach to inform teens about available services. Although the Title X Family Planning Program serves teens in the remaining states, these states do not include title X programs in their TPP strategies. Some states also included Medicaid expansions to improve access to family planning.

In the six states that provided funding data, the federal share of total TPP funding ranged from 74 percent in Georgia to 12 percent in California. The primary mechanisms by which states receive federal funds for TPP efforts include block grants, entitlement programs, and categorical programs. Because federal funds provided through many of these programs are not designated specifically for teen pregnancy prevention, states have some flexibility in deciding what activities to support with federal funding and how much to devote to TPP efforts. The federal government also provides grants directly to local communities to fund TPP initiatives.

However, at the time of our review, state officials had mixed reactions to other welfare reform provisions intended to reduce teen pregnancy.

Officials in some states said they believe that these provisions may deter teens from having any more children until they finish school and become self-sufficient and discourage other teens from having their first child. In addition, all the states\u2019 TPP strategies included a teen subsequent pregnancy prevention component that emphasized school completion and prevention of another pregnancy, and some states included activities to inform teens of the welfare requirements. For example, for more than 10 years, California\u2019s Adolescent Family Life and Cal-Learn programs have encouraged pregnant and parenting teens to complete school as well as provided these teens case management and health and social services.

Each eligible state can receive up to $25 million a year. As proposed, the bonus would be based on a calculation of birth and abortion rates for a state\u2019s population as a whole; bonuses would not be based on reductions for specific populations, such as teenagers. The five states that demonstrate the largest proportionate decrease in their out-of-wedlock birth ratios between the most recent 2 years and the prior 2-year period will be potentially eligible for a bonus award.", "Among the eight states we reviewed, state officials had mixed views about their chances to successfully compete for the bonus. Some say they will likely not be competitive for the bonus because they are focusing their prevention efforts on teens rather than adult women, who have most out-of-wedlock births; other states say they may not be eligible to compete because they do not have available the abortion data needed to compete. For example, California does not have an abortion reporting system for the data required under the proposed rules and, therefore, is unsure of its ability to compete. Illinois and Maryland had concerns about their abortion data being overstated because of current limitations in capturing information on marital status and residency. Oregon\u2019s state law prohibits marriage under the age of 17 and, because the bonus encourages marriage, state officials do not believe the state will be competitive. Georgia, Maine, and Vermont will continue to focus their prevention efforts on teens, but since most out-of-wedlock births in these states occur among women 20 or older, these states believe they will not be competitive.

States must match 3 state dollars for every 4 federal dollars spent. States, local governments, and private sources often provide such funds in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, such as building space, equipment, or services. The funding can be used for abstinence-only education or mentoring, counseling, and adult supervision programs to promote abstinence until marriage and cannot be incorporated with programs that provide information on both abstinence and contraception.", "States had some concerns about the restrictive nature of the abstinence programs. One concern was that implementing education programs that stressed only abstinence would interfere with their efforts to develop and continue comprehensive programming. Maine, for example, encourages comprehensive sex education in the schools and felt that abstinence-only programs were not consistent with the state\u2019s attempts to provide education that addresses both abstinence and contraception. Some states were also concerned that the research on abstinence-only education was limited. Moreover, they noted that the data that were available suggested that such programs have little or no effect on the initiation of sex, while research results on programs that provide information on both abstinence and contraception show that these types of programs do have some effect. Officials in seven of the eight states were also concerned about how to come up with the required matching funds without affecting the comprehensive programs they already had in place. Despite these concerns, all the states we visited applied for and received the federal funding to either initiate new programs or expand existing abstinence efforts.

The results were used to improve the delivery of teen-oriented services. States also used birth rates to track overall progress. Vermont officials told us that rather than conducting evaluations on each component in its strategy, the state\u2019s oversight efforts focus on teen birth and pregnancy rates and responses to the state\u2019s YRBS.

When an outcome evaluation of a California education program that focused on postponing sexual activity of 12- to 14-year-olds showed some improvement in knowledge gain but no delay of sexual intercourse, improved use of birth control, or reduced teen pregnancy, the state discontinued the program and implemented a more comprehensive TPP program.", "Officials in most states we visited expressed interest in knowing the effect of their programs on teen pregnancy.

Some of the funds are solely for teen pregnancy prevention; but others, such as the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, allow states to fund various activities that improve the health of women, infants, and children. Although HHS could not isolate all of the funding specifically for TPP efforts, it was able to identify at least $164 million in fiscal year 1997.

Another $28 million was for two of the three federal programs whose primary goal is teen pregnancy prevention\u2014the Adolescent Family Life (AFL) Program and the Community Coalition Partnership Program for the Prevention of Teen Pregnancy (CCPPPTP). The remaining $10 million is from the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant and several broad youth programs that were able to isolate specific funds for teen pregnancy prevention. Beginning fiscal year 1998, HHS provided states with $50 million in funding for the new Abstinence Education Program (AEP).

Because of the nature of block grant programs, funds are not specifically allocated to teen pregnancy at the federal level and states have some flexibility in deciding how to use them. The states we visited said they relied on programs such as the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, and TANF to support their TPP strategies. Other funding streams that support programs addressing other issues may include teen pregnancy prevention as one of the objectives. For example, the Community Services Block Grant funds programs that address poverty in communities, but the programs can include teen-pregnancy-related initiatives, such as family planning, substance abuse prevention, and job counseling.

The evaluation\u2019s goal is to determine the effects of the abstinence education programs in achieving key outcomes, including reduced rates of sexual activity, teen pregnancies and births, and sexually transmitted diseases. In August 1998, HHS awarded the contract to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.

Furthermore, most do not allow for sufficient follow-up to determine long-term program effects. Evaluation efforts at the federal level have also been limited. However, HHS is beginning two major evaluations of TPP programs that will look at their long-term impact on outcomes known to be related to teen pregnancy prevention. The results of evaluations that focus on outcomes related to teen pregnancy should help states, the federal government, and others in choosing the programs or approaches most likely to be effective in preventing teen pregnancy.", "Four of the states we visited and the federal government are establishing performance measures systems to allow for assessments of program performance toward achieving established TPP goals and to help improve accountability. Although performance measurement alone will not provide the information necessary to understand the link between the programs and their effects on reducing teen pregnancy, the Results Act encourages a complementary role for performance measurement results and program evaluation findings.
