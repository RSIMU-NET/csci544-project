Experts who considered the results of randomized clinical studies in 1990 concluded that patient survival rates following mastectomy and breast-conservation therapy were \u201cequivalent.\u201d (See National Institutes of Health (NIH), 1991.) But a key question is: Have results been similar in day-to-day medical practice\u2014with its less certain quality of treatments? To address this question, we developed a three-step analysis, the results of which are reported here, at your request.", "The first step of our analysis consisted of examining 5-year survival results separately for single-center and for multicenter randomized studies (since the latter more closely resemble day-to-day medical practice, as explained below). In step 2, we examined database records for breast cancer patients treated outside randomized studies. Specifically, we analyzed a set of medical practice cases that had been selected to be comparable to the kinds of patients covered in the randomized studies. (The main characteristics of the patient population examined here are age 70 or younger, node-negative, with tumors 4 cm or smaller.) Step 3 consisted of quantitative comparisons across study designs and a consideration of the strength of the evidence."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Breast-conservation therapy involves a number of physician decisions not required for mastectomy, including the selection of patients for breast conservation, the amount of tissue to be removed from the area surrounding the tumor, the details of administering radiation, and so forth. (See Sacks and Baum, 1993; Winchester and Cox, 1992; Harris et al., 1990; NIH, 1991.) And since breast-conservation therapy involves radiation, its implementation would logically vary depending upon the availability of appropriate radiation equipment and expertise in operating that equipment. Breast-conservation therapy also requires \u201ccareful long-term breast monitoring\u201d in order to identify and treat local recurrences in the breast that was subjected to lumpectomy (NIH, 1991).", "All these treatment-implementation factors can potentially affect breast-conservation patients\u2019 survival\u2014and may not be the same in randomized studies and in medical practice. At least, the typical treatments given in day-to-day medical practice could fall short of the presumably consistent and high-quality treatments provided by a single prestigious research center, such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Some randomized studies are conducted at single centers, while others are conducted at diverse sites (that is, multiple centers). To more closely approximate day-to-day medical practice, multicenter studies have, in some instances, intentionally involved \u201ccommunity surgeons.\u201d For this reason\u2014and also because the treatments given in multicenter studies may vary from one center to another\u2014multicenter studies\u2019 results may more closely approximate results in medical practice than the results of single-center studies at prestigious institutions. But unlike medical practice, both single-center and multicenter studies stipulate that participating physicians follow a set of prespecified procedures. The question remains, then, as to whether or not breast conservation therapy has produced results similar to mastectomy in day-to-day medical practice.", "Randomized clinical studies are the \u201cgold standard\u201d of medical research. Random assignment essentially equates patients in the two treatment groups. Because the two groups should not differ on variables related to cancer survival, their outcomes can be directly compared, and any difference in survival can be attributed to the difference in treatment. In contrast, the statistical analysis of cases from a medical practice database represents a potential \u201cwindow\u201d on how well breast-conservation therapy has, in fact, worked in community medical practice. But the results of such analyses may be less conclusive because of their vulnerability to hidden selection bias. (See Byar, 1980; Office of Technology Assessment, 1994.) Briefly, in day-to-day medical practice, patients and physicians freely choose between treatments; a database analyst must, therefore, attempt to control for the potentially differing characteristics of patients who received breast-conservation therapy and those who received mastectomy. In this report, we have made all possible efforts to minimize the impact of selection bias, as described below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The analyses presented here are based on a unique combination of meta-analysis (to summarize randomized studies\u2019 results), statistical analysis of records from a medical practice database, and cross design comparison of results. To our knowledge, this is the first time such an approach has been used in the area of breast cancer treatment.", "In all analyses presented here, breast-conservation therapy is defined as including lumpectomy, nodal dissection, and radiation. With respect to time frame, the randomized studies enrolled and treated patients from 1972 to 1989, and the medical practice cases selected for this analysis were diagnosed from 1983 to 1985. Because of limitations in the medical practice database (discussed in appendix I), all our analyses use the outcome criterion of 5-year survival and examine node-negative patients only.", "The medical practice data were drawn from the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. SEER archives records for almost all cancer patients residing in five states\u2014 Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah\u2014and four metropolitan areas\u2014Atlanta, Detroit, San Francisco-Oakland, and Seattle -Puget Sound. (See Hankey et al., 1992.)", "Our analysis consisted of three major steps.", "In step 1, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize randomized studies\u2019 results and obtain summary figures that can be compared to medical practice results. We conducted meta-analyses separately for the single-center studies and for the more generalizable multicenter studies to determine if similarity of survival following breast-conservation therapy and mastectomy holds for both kinds of studies. In step 2, we obtained information on the survival of breast-conservation and mastectomy patients in day-to-day medical practice. Specifically, from the SEER database, we drew records for a relatively homogeneous set of patients who, on the basis of several characteristics, were comparable to those enrolled in randomized studies. For this group of SEER patients, we conducted an analysis of survival following breast-conservation therapy and mastectomy. SEER results were adjusted for tumor size and several other variables so that patients who had received breast-conservation therapy would be \u201cmatched\u201d to those who had received mastectomy. The matching was intended to minimize the effects of differing characteristics of patients who received breast-conservation therapy and mastectomy. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to check for selection bias on life-threatening factors unrelated to cancer (such as heart-disease). In step 3, we compared (1) the summary results for the single-center and multicenter randomized studies to (2) the results of our analysis of cases selected from the SEER medical practice data. We also considered the logic of our analyses and, in particular, whether the resulting evidence was sufficient to conclude that\u2014in day-to-day medical practice\u2014 breast- conservation therapy has been followed by survival similar to that observed for mastectomy. Throughout step 3, we drew on the principles of \u201ccross design synthesis.\u201d", "In this report, we use the term \u201csimilar\u201d when the observed difference between the survival rates (1) is not statistically significant and (2) has an absolute value of less than 1.5 percentage points. Conversely, when a comparison of survival rates shows a difference of 1.5 percentage points or larger\u2014and that difference is also statistically significant\u2014we state that one rate is higher (or lower) than the other."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Single-Center and Multicenter Studies", "paragraphs": ["Step 1 (the analysis of randomized studies) began with the identification of relevant single-center and multicenter studies through bibliographic searches and a survey of U.S. breast cancer researchers. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: randomization of enrolled patients to alternative treatments\u2014breast-conservation therapy or mastectomy; breast-conservation therapy that included lumpectomy, nodal dissection, and radiation; no confounding treatments (such as the administration of an additional therapy to one treatment group); availability of 5-year survival rates by treatment group among node-negative patients (either previously published in a scholarly research journal or provided at our request); and published in English (if a non-U.S. study).", "Six studies\u2014three single-center and three multicenter studies\u2014met these criteria. (See table 1.) Almost 2,500 node-negative breast cancer patients were enrolled and treated in these randomized studies.", "The treatment effect\u2014that is, the effect of breast-conservation therapy relative to mastectomy\u2014is represented by a comparison of survival following breast-conservation therapy to survival following mastectomy. (See table 2.) by subtracting the 5-year survival rate for mastectomy patients from the 5-year survival rate for breast-conservation patients to determine the difference between the rates; and by calculating the odds ratio (dividing the odds of surviving with breast-conservation therapy by the odds of surviving with mastectomy).", "As indicated in table 2, the breast-conservation and mastectomy treatment groups experienced similar survival rates in each of the studies, and the odds ratios are close to 1 (the point of equivalence). The confidence intervals for the odds ratios all overlap 1, indicating no statistically significant difference in survival odds for the two treatments. However, the confidence intervals surrounding these estimates are quite broad, indicating a lack of precision in the individual-study estimates. (The U.S.-NSABP figures in table 2 are taken from recalculations published by an NCI contractor in March 1994. The recalculations were published following charges of fraudulent data collection at one U.S.-NSABP center; they exclude the data from that center.)", "A meta-analysis combining the results for node-negative patients across studies gives more precise estimates of the treatment effect. Table 3 shows meta-analysis results summarizing the treatment effect for single-center studies, multicenter studies, and both types of studies taken together. In addition, table 3 shows meta-analysis results calculated in two ways: (1) including the U.S.-NSABP recalculations published in March 1994 and (2) omitting U.S.-NSABP results entirely.", "Similar rates of 5-year survival characterized the breast-conservation therapy and mastectomy groups\u2014not only in single-center studies (93.7 percent for breast-conservation patients and 93.7 percent for mastectomy patients), but also in multicenter studies, which may more closely approximate medical practice (88 percent for breast conservation and 88 percent for mastectomy, omitting U.S.-NSABP). Again, the odds ratios are close to 1, and the confidence intervals all overlap 1, indicating no statistically significant difference for any group of randomized studies.", "Finally, referring again to tables 2 and 3, the 5-year survival rates appear to be higher in single-center studies than in multicenter studies. This could be because of more effective treatments in single-center studies, varying tumor-size limits across the studies, or hidden cross-study differences in patient prognoses prior to treatment.

Table 4 shows the specific criteria we used in selecting SEER cases; the resulting SEER dataset included 5,326 cases that we believe are at least roughly comparable to the participants in randomized studies. (Appendix I assesses the kinds of patients who participated in randomized studies and discusses SEER cases lost to follow-up.)", "As described below, our statistical analysis of the selected SEER cases used \u201cpropensity-score\u201d adjustments (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1984) that essentially \u201cmatched\u201d the kinds of patients who received breast-conservation therapy and mastectomy on demographic characteristics and tumor size. Using these adjustments, we found that, on average, similar patient survival followed the two treatments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Treatment Effect for SEER Cases", "paragraphs": ["To achieve matched groups of patients for the two treatments, the 5,326 SEER cases were first divided into five quintiles, as shown in table 5. Patients were assigned to these quintiles based on their propensity scores, which were calculated to indicate each patient\u2019s likelihood of receiving breast-conservation therapy. Patients in the first quintile shown in table 5 have very low propensity scores; that is, they are the kinds of patients who were quite unlikely to receive breast-conservation therapy. (An example of a patient with an extremely low propensity score would be a woman in her sixties, living in Iowa, diagnosed in 1983\u2014the earliest year examined here\u2014with a tumor sized 3 to 4 cm.) By contrast, patients assigned to each successive quintile were more likely to receive breast-conservation therapy. (An example of a patient with a relatively high propensity score would be under 40 years old, non-Asian, living in the San Francisco- Oakland or the Seattle-Puget Sound area and diagnosed in 1985\u2014the most recent year examined\u2014with a very small tumor.)", "In table 5, 5-year survival estimates are shown separately for breast- conservation patients and for mastectomy patients in each quintile. Within each quintile, patients are homogeneous, and the survival rates for the two treatments represent an estimate of the treatment effect for that quintile. The bottom rows of table 5 show the overall survival rates used to calculate the treatment effect for all selected SEER cases taken together. These summary rates, which are termed \u201cadjusted across quintiles,\u201d are clearly similar to each other: 86.3 percent for breast-conservation therapy and 86.9 percent for mastectomy.", "The adjusted breast-conservation rate (86.3 percent) was calculated by combining the five separate quintile survival rates for breast-conservation patients\u2014giving each of the five rates an equal weight of one-fifth. The adjusted mastectomy rate (86.9 percent) was calculated using analogous procedures. Thus, the adjusted survival rates are based on \u201cmatched\u201d treatment groups; that is, the kinds of patients who were unlikely to receive breast-conservation therapy contribute equally to the breast- conservation and the mastectomy survival estimates\u2014as do the kinds of patients who were much more likely to receive breast- conservation therapy. In this way, selection bias on measured variables was minimized.", "As shown in table 6, the difference between the adjusted 5-year survival estimates for breast-conservation and mastectomy patients is just six-tenths of a percentage point, the odds ratio is relatively close to 1, and the confidence interval overlaps 1, indicating no statistically significant difference. Thus, on average, the two treatments appear to produce similar results in day-to-day medical practice.", "However, referring again to table 5, the results shown for quintile 3 do not meet our criteria for use of the term \u201csimilar\u201d because the observed (nonsignificant) difference between the survival rates is greater than 1.5 percentage points. According to our criteria, this nonsignificant pattern should be regarded as inconclusive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Further Check on Medical Practice Results", "paragraphs": ["The propensity-score adjustments were intended to minimize selection bias on measured variables, such as tumor size and demographic characteristics. However, noncancer-related life-threatening illnesses or conditions, such as serious heart disease, were not measured in the SEER data and therefore could not be included in the propensity score. Such illnesses or conditions might at once influence treatment selection and limit 5-year survival\u2014and could represent a form of selection bias not accounted for by the propensity scores.", "SEER data does, however, include codes for cause of death. Therefore, it was possible to check for selection bias on illnesses and conditions not related to cancer in the following way: We performed a sensitivity analysis in which we reproduced table 5 omitting patients who were coded as having died of illnesses and conditions unrelated to cancer within the 5-year interval. As indicated in table 7, with those patients omitted, the difference in survival following breast-conservation therapy and mastectomy is, on average, again within 1.5 percentage points of zero, and it is not statistically significant.", "At the same time, however, the breast-conservation and mastectomy survival rates within each of the first three quintiles fall short of our criteria for similarity; specifically, although the differences between the breast-conservation and mastectomy survival rates for these quintiles are not statistically significant, each is slightly larger than 1.5 percentage points. According to our criteria, the separate results for quintiles 1 through 3 are inconclusive. Yet when results for these quintiles are considered together\u2014and compared to the results for quintiles 4 and 5\u2014there are two potential implications: (1) breast-conservation therapy may not have been quite as effective as mastectomy for some of the patients who were less likely to receive it\u2014such as those who resided in \u201clow-lumpectomy\u201d areas (in which breast-conservation therapy was relatively uncommon); and (2) breast conservation has been at least as effective as mastectomy for those who were most likely to receive it.", "There are various possible explanations for this nonsignificant pattern, based on the different components of the propensity score. (See appendix I.) However, at the present time, exploratory analyses would be difficult, at best, because within the rather homogeneous group of patients examined in this report, there is a relatively small number of breast-conservation patients (1,072) and only about one-third of them (340) fall into quintiles 1 through 3."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cross Design Comparisons and Strength of the Evidence", "paragraphs": ["Step 3 consists of cross design comparisons and a consideration of the evidence. An informal comparison of the summary results for step 1 and step 2 suggests that the average treatment effect estimated in the statistical analysis of selected SEER cases is similar to the effects observed in the single-center and multicenter randomized studies. The more precise comparisons in tables 8 and 9 show that, quantitatively, this is indeed the case. But do these data constitute sufficient evidence to conclude that the effectiveness of breast-conservation therapy in day-to-day medical practice really is, at least on average, similar to its effectiveness in randomized studies?", "To address this issue, we considered (1) the potential differences distinguishing the SEER analysis from single-center and multicenter randomized studies (including the potential for hidden selection bias in the SEER analysis) and (2) the impact that these potential differences might have on the treatment effects we observed. We then used an additional type of cross design comparison as a validity check."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Differences Across Study Designs", "paragraphs": ["Three potential cross design differences could affect comparisons of the treatment effect estimated for the SEER medical practice data to the treatment effects observed in single-center and multicenter randomized studies. These are potential differences in actual treatment effectiveness (SEER versus single-center and multicenter studies), potential differences in patients (again, SEER versus single-center and multicenter studies), which might be related to differences in treatment effectiveness, and lack of randomization in the SEER data versus randomization in the single-center and multicenter studies\u2014which could lead to differences in the estimates of treatment effectiveness.", "Each of these potential differences could affect the comparison of treatment effects (SEER versus single-center and multicenter studies) in the following ways: If there are real differences in treatment effectiveness (for example, if breast-conservation therapy is less effective than mastectomy in day-to-day medical practice), this would affect the comparison of effects\u2014SEER versus randomized studies. (This is, in fact, the hypothesis we have sought to test.) If there are differences in patients\u2014again SEER cases versus randomized studies\u2014this also could affect the comparison of effects, but only if breast-conservation therapy is, in fact, more or less effective for the particular kinds of patients who were included in the SEER analysis than for the kinds of patients included in the randomized studies.", "And, the lack of randomization in the SEER data could affect our estimate of the treatment effect in day-to-day medical practice if (1) the kinds of SEER patients who were selected for one treatment had better prognoses than those selected for the other treatment\u2014and (2) this was not corrected as part of our analysis.", "In the foregoing analyses, our intent was to test for whether the effectiveness of breast-conservation therapy relative to mastectomy was indeed the same in day-to-day medical practice as in single-center and multicenter randomized studies. In comparing the effect of nominally identical treatments across designs, our goal was to identify the first type of difference listed above. We therefore attempted to minimize the influence of each of the other two potential differences.", "With respect to differences in patients, we selected SEER patients that were at least roughly comparable to those treated in the randomized studies. With respect to selection bias, the fact that we began with a homogeneous group of SEER patients (node-negative, tumors 4 cm or less, age 70 or younger) argues against substantial amounts of bias. We used the propensity-score method to minimize bias on tumor size and on other measured variables. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to check for selection bias on life-threatening diseases or conditions other than cancer (for example, heart disease)\u2014and found none. Nevertheless, we realize that despite such efforts, some patient differences or some degree of hidden selection bias can persist.", "The similarity of the average treatment effect observed for the SEER medical practice data and the effects observed for the randomized studies (that is, the results shown in tables 8 and 9) argue that none of the potential differences listed above had a major impact. The most parsimonious interpretation of the data presented in tables 8 and 9 is that breast-conservation therapy is, on average, similarly effective to mastectomy in day-to-day medical practice.", "Logically, however, it is also possible that if two of three potential cross design differences occurred simultaneously, they could \u201cbalance each other out\u201d to produce a false impression of similar treatment effects across designs. Of particular relevance is the possibility that hidden selection bias in the SEER data analysis (specifically, a hidden bias toward selecting better-prognosis patients for breast conservation) could \u201ccounterbalance\u201d treatment differences (specifically, less effective breast-conservation therapy in medical practice)\u2014and thus create an impression of similar treatment effects across study designs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Combined-Treatments Survival Rates", "paragraphs": ["We reasoned that an additional indication of the relative effectiveness of treatments across designs would be afforded by a comparison of (1) the combined-treatments survival rate for the SEER analysis to (2) the corresponding rates for single-center and multicenter studies. Logically, the SEER combined-treatments survival rate is not affected by internal selection bias. Thus, if the SEER rate proved to be similar to the corresponding rates in single-center and multicenter studies, this would point to minimal differences both in patients and in treatment effectiveness across the designs. In short, similar combined-treatments survival rates for the selected SEER cases and for a set of randomized studies would support the conclusion of similar overall effectiveness of breast conservation in day-to-day medical practice and in the randomized studies.", "In contrast, if the SEER combined-treatments survival rate proved to be different from the corresponding rates for randomized studies, a number of interpretations would be possible\u2014including a difference in patients as well as a difference in the general quality of treatments being given.", "In comparing combined-treatments survival rates across studies, it is necessary to take account of any differences in tumor size\u2014specifically, any differences between the tumor sizes of the selected SEER patients and the patients in the single-center and multicenter randomized studies. This is because tumor size is related to patient survival. As previously noted, four of the six randomized studies had a tumor-size limit of 4 cm, whereas two studies had a limit of 2 cm; the roughly comparable set of SEER patients had a tumor-size limit of 4 cm.", "The comparison of combined-treatments survival rates is easiest to make for SEER data versus multicenter studies. This is because all multicenter studies had, in effect, the same tumor-size limit (4 cm) and the SEER cases selected for our analyses were also subjected to the 4-cm limit. Therefore, in this section, we separately discuss (1) the comparison of the SEER combined-treatments survival rate to the combined-treatments survival rate for multicenter studies and (2) the corresponding comparison for SEER and single-center studies.", "Table 10 (first row) shows the combined-treatments 5-year survival rate for the full set of SEER cases used in the foregoing analyses; this rate\u201486.9 percent (or 87 percent, rounded)\u2014is appropriate for comparison to the multicenter studies. As shown in the bottom row of table 11, the difference in rates is only 1 percentage point and is not significant. The most parsimonious explanation of this result is that, at least on average and with respect to 5-year survival, there are (1) no substantial differences between the patients in our SEER analysis and the patients in the multicenter studies and (2) no large difference between the effectiveness of breast-conservation therapy or mastectomy across the two types of analyses.", "The comparisons are more complex for SEER versus the single-center studies because two of the three studies had a 2-cm limit. The SEER weighted composite estimate in the last row of table 10 (89.4 percent) combines (1) the survival estimate for the full set of selected SEER cases (4-cm limit) with (2) the survival estimate for the subset of cases defined with a 2-cm limit. (See table 10, note c.) This survival estimate is appropriate for comparison to the single-center studies\u2019 estimate (93.7 percent). From table 11, it is clear that with breast-conservation and mastectomy patients taken together, the 5-year survival rate for patients in single-center randomized studies is higher than the rate for the corresponding SEER estimate\u2014by a difference of 4.3 percentage points, which is statistically significant. The meaning of this finding is unclear. It could be explained by the argument that implementations of treatments in single-center studies are generally better than implementations in multicenter studies or day-to-day medical practice (which seems to be logical). But it could also be explained by hidden selection of patients with better prognoses for the single-center studies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In this report, we examined the relative effectiveness of breast- conservation therapy and mastectomy for patients treated in three contexts: single-center randomized studies, multicenter randomized studies, and day-to-day medical practice.

The best outcomes for both treatments occurred in the single-center studies; however, outcomes for the SEER medical practice patients were comparable to outcomes in the multicenter studies.", "We recognize that database analyses are vulnerable to hidden selection bias. But we believe such bias is likely to be minimal in the SEER analyses presented here because (1) a homogeneous group of patients was examined, (2) careful adjustments were made for differences in tumor size and demographic characteristics (using the propensity-score method), and (3) a check for possible selection bias on life-threatening factors unrelated to cancer (such as heart disease) reaffirmed our initial conclusion.

We wished to choose a cutting point that, in our judgment, would represent a difference in survival rates that could reasonably be considered \u201csimilar.\u201d Thus, we rejected potential cutting points that seemed too high (such as 5 percentage points) because we believed most patients would not consider survival rates that differed by that amount to be similar. In this context, a criterion of 1 percentage point or less versus a larger difference initially seemed reasonable. We chose 1.5 as the specific cutting point (that is, a difference of less than 1.5 percentage points versus 1.5 or greater) because it was possible to obtain most, though not all, survival estimates rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. patients in each treatment group.

We do not mean to imply that this figure represents the point at which a particular physician or patient would distinguish between a \u201cmeaningful difference\u201d and an irrelevant one. We are also cognizant of the fact that, for every 10,000 patients who receive a treatment characterized by even a 1-percentage-point lower survival rate than an available alternative treatment, there would be 100 deaths that could have been avoided by choosing the other treatment\u2014provided that the observed 1-percentage-point difference is, in fact, a real difference and not merely the result of random variation.", "In this report, we have avoided use of the term \u201cequivalent\u201d to describe the survival rates observed for breast-conservation and mastectomy patients. A technical reason for this is that to claim \u201cequivalent\u201d survival following the two treatments would require the confidence interval surrounding the difference to be so small that it could be entirely enclosed by a prespecified interval\u2014specifically, one defined such that all values within it would be justifiable as clinical equivalence. (See Fleiss, 1992.) That is, not only would we have to justify a difference of 1.5 percentage points as clinically equivalent, but both the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval surrounding our estimate of the difference would have to be within 1.5 percentage points of zero.
