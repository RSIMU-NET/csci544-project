In May 2005, Congress appropriated $908 million for relief and reconstruction. U.S. emergency relief efforts budgeted at $327 million were nearly completed in December 2005. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) plans to spend $496 million on longer-term reconstruction, focusing on Indonesia and Sri Lanka, with the remaining $85 million allocated to other U.S. agencies.

In this report, GAO describes USAID's (1) progress in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, (2) financial and technical oversight measures, and (3) implementation challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USAID has begun a number of reconstruction activities in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. As of January 31, 2006, approximately 8 months after Congress appropriated funding, USAID had obligated $111 million (32 percent) and expended $9 million (3 percent) of the $349 million budgeted for reconstruction in Indonesia, and it had obligated all and expended $2 million (2 percent) of the $85 million budgeted for reconstruction in Sri Lanka. However, rising prices of materials and labor in both countries may increase costs for many construction efforts, including USAID's \"signature\" projects, which are intended to generate greater visibility for U.S. assistance. In addition, revisions to initial assessments of site conditions may challenge USAID's ability to finish its signature project in Indonesia--a 150-mile road in Aceh Province--by September 2009, the estimated completion date. In Sri Lanka, the time needed to complete designs and plans may make it difficult to finish one part of USAID's signature project--a bridge at Arugam Bay--by March 2008, although this project is currently slightly ahead of schedule. USAID plans to complete most of its other reconstruction projects, such as building schools and restoring livelihoods, by September 2007. USAID has established financial and technical oversight for its tsunami recovery programs in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. For financial oversight, USAID plans to arrange a concurrent audit of the signature road project in Indonesia and strengthen Indonesian and Sri Lankan audit capacities. For technical oversight, USAID has begun to add staff to oversee its signature construction projects and has acquired additional construction engineering expertise from another U.S. agency. An additional engineer will start work in Indonesia in May 2006. In Sri Lanka, USAID has added two engineers to its staff and plans to hire an additional construction oversight engineer in April 2006, prior to beginning construction. In implementing its Indonesian and Sri Lankan reconstruction programs, USAID faces several broad challenges. These include working in regions with long-standing conflicts, coordinating with host governments and nongovernmental organizations, and ensuring that non-tsunami-related development assistance activities are not neglected. To address these challenges, USAID has taken actions such as engaging in peace-building initiatives, participating in regularly scheduled coordination meetings, and hiring and reassigning staff to assist with increased workloads."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On December 26, 2004, a severe earthquake in the Indian Ocean off the  coast of Indonesia created a major tsunami that struck 12 countries in Asia  and East Africa.

Following initial emergency  response efforts by the United States and other donors, individuals,  national governments, and others around the world pledged more than $13  billion to assist in rebuilding tsunami-affected areas throughout the region.  In May 2005, Congress appropriated approximately $908 million in  assistance for tsunami relief, reconstruction, and related programs. Beyond  $327 million that was budgeted for survivors\u2019 immediate needs for  medicine, food, and shelter, approximately $496 million is budgeted for  longer-term reconstruction and related programs to be administered by the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

The proposed project, budgeted at $245 million, consists of  building a 150-mile paved two-lane road and more than 100 bridges and  culverts along the western coast of Aceh Province on the island of Sumatra,  from the provincial capital of Banda Aceh to the city of Meulaboh. The  tsunami\u2019s impact destroyed or badly damaged much of the original road, a  vital transportation route for the region. USAID agreed to reconstruct the  road to support the Indonesian government\u2019s overall reconstruction  strategy, with the goal of helping to restore the economic strength of the  area and promoting the redevelopment of the affected communities.  According to an Indonesian government report, the road is key to  revitalizing the economy of Aceh Province and to successfully initiating  other reconstruction efforts. Figure 4 shows the approximate route of the  planned road and photos of damage caused by the tsunami.", "USAID plans to design and construct the signature road in three distinct  phases, with separate contracts for each phase. USAID also entered into  interagency agreements with USACE for technical support. In early 2005,  USACE and USAID conducted a preliminary assessment of site conditions  and prepared the cost estimate that USAID submitted to Congress. The  three phases for the signature road project are as follows (see app. III for  more details): 1. Maintain a rehabilitated 50-mile temporary segment and  construct a short segment. In August 2005, an Indonesian firm began  maintaining a temporary 50-mile road segment, from Banda Aceh to  Lamno, and designing and constructing a new 3-mile segment. This  maintenance work is intended to ensure that the temporary segment,  recently rehabilitated by the Indonesian army, remains passable until  permanent construction is completed. 2. Design the signature road and supervise its construction. The  second contract, for designing most of the 150-mile road and  supervising construction work, was awarded to a U.S. firm in  November 2005. The firm will supervise construction of the 3-mile  segment, develop plans and specifications for the remaining 147 miles,  and assist USAID in awarding and supervising construction of the  signature road. 3. Construct the signature road. USAID plans to award a third contract  by September 2006 to construct the 147-mile segment of the signature  road.", "However, several factors\u2014limited site information, rising materials and  labor costs, and land acquisition issues\u2014may increase the signature road  project\u2019s total costs and the difficulties of completing it within the intended  time frame.", "Limited site information. A joint USAID-USACE team initially  assessed conditions and developed a cost estimate for building the  road. The estimate was based on using undamaged sections of the  existing road and large segments of the temporary road placed by the  Indonesian Army. A 20 percent contingency was included in the cost  estimate because much of the road\u2019s planned route was inaccessible,  resulting in the team approximating site conditions and developing  plans based on their assumptions. However, actual costs may still  exceed the estimate because plans for routing the road have changed.  According to USACE, current plans show that large segments of the  road are now planned to be placed along new undeveloped routes\u2014not  along existing routes as initially planned. This change is expected to  result in the need for more earthwork and related construction activities  than originally anticipated.", "Rising costs. Increasing costs for materials and labor will also likely  affect the road construction project\u2019s overall cost. Demand for  construction labor and materials has risen dramatically in Aceh  Province and, according to USAID officials, will likely continue to rise.  For example, a USAID official reported that the price of fuel oil used for  construction equipment had risen more than 250 percent, from $0.17 per  liter in February 2005 to $0.60 per liter in December 2005. According to  the United Nations Development Program, posttsunami construction  spending in and around Aceh is expected to increase fortyfold from  pretsunami levels, from $50 million to $2 billion per year, and 200,000  additional workers will be needed to meet construction demands.  Because the demand for skilled workers is greater than the number  available, labor costs for reconstruction projects requiring skilled  workers may rise.", "Land acquisition. Awarding the signature road construction contract  by September 2006 may be difficult because of uncertainties regarding  the road alignment and acquiring the needed right-of-way. The alignment  of the new road will differ from the former road because, in some  locations, the former roadbed is either submerged or was rendered  otherwise inaccessible by the tsunami\u2019s impact. According to a USAID  official, the design contractor intends to propose a final road alignment  to Indonesian authorities by mid-May 2006. Once the alignment is  approved, the Indonesian government must coordinate with multiple  jurisdictions to obtain land. USAID helped establish a technical steering  committee with Indonesian government entities to facilitate land  acquisition issues. However, progress depends on the Indonesian  government\u2019s timeliness in acquiring the land and establishing  right-of-way.", "USAID expects to have more comprehensive cost estimates and schedule  projections for the signature road project in June 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other USAID Reconstruction Activities in Indonesia May Also Exceed Cost and Schedule Projections", "paragraphs": ["USAID has initiated other projects in Indonesia, some of which may exceed  initial cost and time estimates.

Other  projects will assist communities in preparing solid waste management  plans, helping rebuild business districts, and constructing markets. Two  planned projects include helping to build a teacher-training facility in  Banda Aceh and rehabilitate the fishing industry by constructing port  facilities, fishing vessels, and ice-making facilities. According to the  USAID official responsible for overseeing the project, the  teacher-training facility project is unlikely to begin as initially scheduled  because of the time it has taken to plan and assess site conditions. He  added that, even if the project does begin on time, the schedule is  unlikely to be achieved, and because of rapidly escalating costs for  materials and labor, the project is at risk of exceeding its budget.", "Technical assistance for good governance.
