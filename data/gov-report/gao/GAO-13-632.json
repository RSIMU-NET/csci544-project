According to VHA officials, the  increase in spending was primarily due to the increased number of  veterans claiming mileage reimbursement, a rise in the average number  of claims per veteran, and higher mileage reimbursement rates.

The audit revealed  problems such as inadequate management and oversight, and inaccurate  payment amounts. Specifically, the VA OIG reported that it did not have  reasonable assurance that Beneficiary Travel Program costs were  accurate or were being paid only to eligible veterans. The VA OIG report  found that from January 2010 through March 2011 VA paid $89 million  more in beneficiary travel reimbursements than facilities approved,  including $42.5 million in unexplained payments. On the basis of its  findings, the VA OIG recommended that VHA establish and implement  procedures to strengthen authorization, payment, and oversight controls  for the program. VHA concurred with the OIG\u2019s findings and  recommendations and reported that it would, among other things, be  implementing several initiatives to address the findings.", "Additionally, VHA has identified the Beneficiary Travel Program as being  susceptible to significant improper payments. The Improper Payments  Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) requires agencies with  programs identified as being susceptible to significant improper payments  to estimate the annual amount of improper payments for each program  and publish these estimates and corresponding corrective actions in an  annual report; VA includes this information in its annual Performance  and Accountability Report. For VA\u2019s 2012 Performance and Accountability  Report, VHA estimated that the Beneficiary Travel Program had   $71 million in improper payments. IPERA also requires federal  agencies\u2019 inspectors general to annually determine whether their  respective agencies are in compliance with IPERA requirements and to  report on their determinations. In March 2013, the VA OIG reported  limitations in VHA\u2019s methodology for estimating improper payments for  the Beneficiary Travel Program and other programs but noted that this  was not a matter of noncompliance with IPERA requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Developed Efforts to Improve the Beneficiary Travel Program, but Lack of Internal Controls May Impede Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["VHA has developed multiple efforts to improve the management and  oversight of its process for reimbursing veterans\u2019 travel expenses for  medical appointments.

(See table 1.) These efforts\u2014many of which  medical centers are or will be required to implement\u2014are expected to  increase the consistency of how the program is administered. For  example, the Dashboard, a Web-based software, provides a standardized  process that medical centers are required to use to determine a veteran\u2019s  eligibility for travel reimbursement, the amount of any deductibles, and the  number of miles from the veteran\u2019s residence to the closest VA medical  facility where care could be provided.", "The efforts are in various stages of development and implementation,  with some being fully implemented in all medical centers, while others are  in earlier stages. For some of the efforts, VHA has utilized a pilot process  in a small number of medical centers to help identify and resolve potential  problems before releasing the efforts VHA-wide to all medical centers.  For example, in the fall of 2012, VHA piloted the Electronic Funds  Transfer (EFT) effort\u2014a process for transferring travel reimbursement  funds electronically into veterans\u2019 bank accounts\u2014in medical centers in 2  of the 21 VISNs. The EFT effort\u2014along with VHA\u2019s Debit Card effort, a  VHA-wide card that veterans can use to receive travel reimbursement  electronically\u2014implements a Department of the Treasury requirement for  federal agencies to convert cash payments to electronic funds payments  by March 1, 2013. VHA has requested and received an extension from  the Department of the Treasury on the implementation of electronic funds  payments to allow VHA to simultaneously implement both the EFT and  Debit Card efforts. VHA anticipates VHA-wide implementation of both  efforts by December 31, 2013.", "Some of VHA\u2019s efforts to improve the Beneficiary Travel Program have  been developed in response to OIG and IPERA report findings as  corrective actions to improve monitoring and oversight of the program and  to decrease improper payments. One such effort is the Facility Audit  Tool\u2014a tool used to audit facilities\u2019 past travel reimbursement  transactions and operations through a more standardized process.  Currently this tool is being used by VHA\u2019s Office of Finance to annually  audit programs identified as susceptible to improper payments under  IPERA. VHA officials told us that this tool may ultimately be used by  VISNs to audit their facilities\u2019 past travel reimbursement transactions and  operations, but did not have a time frame for its VHA-wide  implementation.", "Officials from the six medical centers we interviewed told us the new  efforts that have been implemented generally improved or would improve  some aspects of the Beneficiary Travel Program. For example, medical  center officials reported that the implementation of the Dashboard had  increased staff efficiency by decreasing the time needed to determine a  veteran\u2019s eligibility, as well as increased the accuracy of payments, in line  with VHA\u2019s goals for this program. In addition, officials said EFT would  help improve oversight over the payment process. Compared to the  process of paying veterans in cash, EFT provides an opportunity for the  medical center staff\u2014in this case the fiscal office staff\u2014to review and  audit travel payments before a reimbursement is issued to the veteran.  Officials said these reviews could help medical centers reduce improper  payments, and that EFT also improves security at medical centers  because less cash is on hand for reimbursements.", "Although medical center officials provided positive feedback on some of  the efforts, they also identified implementation challenges. For example,  medical center officials reported difficulty tracking EFT reimbursements,  and that staff members had received many calls from veterans who were  confused by only limited information transmitted with the EFT direct  deposits. In addition, when veterans claimed reimbursements for multiple  appointments, they did not know which appointment was associated with  which electronic reimbursement payment, or which reimbursements were  still pending. According to medical center officials, investigating pending  reimbursements is time consuming and takes time away from staff  members\u2019 reimbursement-processing responsibilities. Medical center  officials also said the lack of information transmitted with the payments  hinders acceptance of the EFT process in general, as veterans do not  have complete confidence that their reimbursements are timely and  accurate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Internal Controls for Some Efforts May Hinder VHA\u2019s Ability to Improve the Beneficiary Travel Program", "paragraphs": ["In our review of VHA\u2019s efforts to improve the Beneficiary Travel Program,  we found that internal controls were lacking for some of the efforts. The  implementation of internal controls is important for ensuring efforts  achieve intended outcomes and minimizing operational problems. Without  these internal controls in place, VHA cannot ensure that the efforts will  meet its goals, such as improved management and oversight.", "Plan for Evaluating Performance Indicators. VHA has not developed a  plan for evaluating VHA-wide performance indicators for at least one of its  efforts, the Beneficiary Travel Analytics Tool (Data Mining Tool), as would  be consistent with internal control standards. According to established  internal control standards, efforts to improve performance and efficiency  should include the evaluation of appropriate performance indicators of the  effort to gauge progress and inform decision making in resolving any  problems. The Web-based Beneficiary Travel Analytics Tool,  implemented March 31, 2013, generates travel reimbursement pattern  reports\u2014reports identifying questionable veteran reimbursement patterns  that may indicate improper payments, such as frequently changing  addresses on reimbursement claims, which may be done to  inappropriately increase travel reimbursement amounts. According to  VHA officials, medical centers are expected to use the reports generated  by the tool to diagnose any problems in their own travel reimbursement  processes and to implement appropriate corrective actions. VHA expects  medical centers to submit documentation to VHA\u2019s Chief Business Office  on any resulting corrective actions they have taken. Officials told us that  they expect to review the corrective actions; however, as of May 14,  2013, they did not have a documented plan for evaluating travel  reimbursement pattern data collected for all medical centers on an  aggregated (VHA-wide) basis.", "An appropriate evaluation plan consistent with internal controls would  include documentation of the frequency of performance indicator  evaluations, and an analysis plan for assessing either all, or a portion of,  the travel reimbursement pattern data. Officials acknowledged the need  to fully develop a plan to ensure that potential weaknesses are identified  so that needed program improvements may be made. A plan for  evaluating the data on a VHA-wide basis is necessary to ensure that the  power of the Beneficiary Travel Analytics Tool is more fully realized.", "Timely Guidance. VHA has not provided timely guidance to medical  centers on its new EFT effort, as would be consistent with internal control  standards. According to these standards, reliable and timely program  information should be provided to management and others to ensure that  responsibilities are being carried out and VHA goals are being met.  Specifically, despite being aware of the March 1, 2013, Department of the  Treasury deadline for implementation of EFT in December 2010, VHA did  not provide guidance to medical centers on how to implement the effort  until February 22, 2013. Had the guidance been provided earlier, it would  have provided timely, key information to medical centers on the  implementation of EFT, including the process that medical centers should  be using to enroll veterans; the procedures for veterans to request a  waiver from an electronic payment when they have an immediate need  for a cash payment; and VHA\u2019s contingency plan for the travel  reimbursement process due to its delay in providing policies for  implementing EFT VHA-wide. By delaying the issuance of the guidance,  VHA failed to ensure that all medical centers were provided with  consistent and timely guidance, which, according to medical center  officials we spoke with, led to frustration for medical centers, as well as  confusion for veterans. For example, most medical centers in our review  already had developed their own local procedures for enrolling veterans  into EFT and processing payments before VHA\u2019s EFT pilot began;  officials from some of the medical centers in our review expressed  frustration that they would have to revise some of these processes when  the VHA-wide effort was eventually implemented.", "Effective Communication. VHA also did not provide a communication  plan for sharing information on EFT with medical centers and veterans in  a timely manner, as would have been consistent with internal control  standards. Specifically, VHA did not share information on EFT with  medical centers to help them inform veterans of the coming changes until  February 22, 2013. VHA officials acknowledged they failed to develop a  communications plan in a timely manner, and agreed that this is  something they should have done to help ensure the success of the  conversion to EFT. By not communicating this information in a timely  manner, VHA did not ensure that medical centers had consistent and  accurate information for informing veterans of the change in payment  options, potentially affecting veterans\u2019 enrollment in EFT and their  satisfaction with the new reimbursement process. Although officials from  some medical centers we spoke with said they have developed their own  materials for communicating with veterans about EFT, having  communication materials come from VHA headquarters would have  carried more weight with veterans and provided more consistency across  all medical centers for this VHA-wide effort.", "Plan for Monitoring Compliance. VHA has not developed a plan to  ensure medical centers\u2019 compliance with the efforts or its existing policies,  as would be consistent with internal control standards. For example,  medical centers are required to use the Dashboard, and VHA officials told  us that VHA-wide procedures for using the Dashboard will be included in  the program\u2019s revised Standard Operating Procedures. However, VHA  officials told us they do not have a plan in place to ensure that each  medical center is using this new software. Without knowing whether all  medical centers are using this required software or using it consistently,  VHA cannot ensure that the Dashboard\u2019s goals, including standardizing  the mileage calculations, will be realized.", "Furthermore, because medical centers have the flexibility to develop local  procedures for administering the Beneficiary Travel Program, it is  important that VHA monitor local procedures to ensure they are  consistent with VHA policies. For example, one medical center in our  review automatically generates travel reimbursement payments to eligible  veterans after each completed appointment. Thus, instead of applying for  reimbursement after each medical center appointment, eligible veterans  who have a signature on record can simply leave the medical center after  their appointment and receive their reimbursement payment by mail or  direct deposit. Acknowledging that this automatic payment procedure is  different from other medical centers, medical center officials said it has  greatly increased the efficiency of their management of the Beneficiary  Travel Program and has received positive feedback from veterans and  staff. Monitoring compliance with program policies, especially due to  differences in local procedures, is an important internal control for  ensuring that program goals are being met.", "Use Information to Improve Efficiency. VHA does not routinely collect  information on medical centers\u2019 local procedures for administering the  Beneficiary Travel Program to identify and share best practices.  According to federal internal control standards, identifying and sharing  best practices is an essential part of ensuring an effective and efficient  use of resources. For example, officials at one of the medical centers we  interviewed said that installing drop boxes at multiple locations around  their facility was a simple and efficient way to make the process more  convenient for veterans, shorten lines at the Beneficiary Travel Office,  and improve staff productivity. Some medical center officials described  sharing best practices on an ad hoc basis with colleagues in other  medical centers, and said that learning from others\u2019 experiences is  valuable to their administration of the Beneficiary Travel Program.  Although VHA officials described one instance of evaluating a software  program for national use that was developed and implemented at one  medical center, they have not regularly solicited information on best  practices; instead, they have relied on medical center and VISN officials  to identify and share information. A more systematic identification and  sharing of best practices would enhance medical centers\u2019 access to the  same information in order to minimize problems and maximize  efficiencies within the Beneficiary Travel Program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["For more than 70 years, VHA\u2019s Beneficiary Travel Program has  reimbursed eligible veterans for travel expenses associated with medical  appointments.
