For example, some regions have experienced challenges in maintaining the delivery of natural gas supplies to power plants. In particular, severe cold weather in the central and eastern U.S. in 2014 led to higher than normal demand for gas for home heating and to generate electricity. Challenges delivering fuel to natural-gas-fueled power plants resulted in outages at some plants. System operators took various steps to limit the effect of this event, including relying on power plants that utilize other fuel sources that were more readily available at the time, such as coal and oil-fueled power plants, and implementing certain emergency procedures.", "Prices : Increased gas-fueled generation has influenced electricity prices, with wholesale electricity prices and gas prices generally fluctuating in tandem over the past decade. The effect of the increased use of wind and solar sources on consumer electricity prices depends on specific circumstances. Among other things, it depends on the relative cost of wind and solar compared with other sources, as well as the amount of federal and state financial support for wind and solar development that can offset some of the amount that consumers might otherwise pay.

Therefore, actual electricity consumption may  be higher than suggested by retail electricity  sales data.  According to EIA, this effect is  difficult to measure because data on electricity  generated from distributed generation sources  are not readily available.", "Changes in the economy: Changes in electricity consumption are  often closely linked to the economy, according to EIA.the economic recession from late 2007 through 2009 was associated  with a large drop in electricity consumption in the industrial sector.

For example, according to EIA, a new refrigerator  purchased today uses less than a third as much electricity as one  purchased in the late 1970s, despite the larger size of today\u2019s  refrigerators.", "Changes in the uses of electricity: Consumer uses of electricity  have changed over the last decades, affecting the nature of electricity  consumption. For example, the growing use of computers and home  entertainment devices has increased the use of electricity. In addition,  air conditioning has become more widely used in U.S. households. As  a result, a heat wave\u2014often associated with peak levels of electricity  consumption\u2014may lead to more electricity consumption during peak  periods than in the past.", "Demand-response activities: Another factor that may have affected  consumption trends, particularly peak consumption, is the increasing  use of demand-response activities\u2014steps taken to encourage  consumers to reduce consumption during periods of high demand  when the costs to generate electricity are high. For example, system  operators may call on industrial consumers to reduce their electricity  usage during periods of high demand in exchange for a payment or  other financial incentive. In March 2014, we cited FERC data  suggesting that the extent of demand-response activities had  increased overall\u2014more than doubling from 2005 to reach about 8.5  percent of potential reduction in peak consumption in 2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Changes in Generation and Consumption Require System Operators to Take Additional Actions to Maintain Reliability and Affect Electricity Prices to Varying Extents", "paragraphs": ["According to literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed,  changes in electricity generation and consumption have required system  operators to take additional actions to maintain reliability.

Although all fuel-based electricity generation can  face fuel supply challenges, natural-gas-fueled power plants face  different challenges than sources such as coal, oil, and nuclear. For  example, natural gas is not easily stored on site, so the ability of a  natural-gas-fueled power plant to generate electricity generally  depends on the real-time delivery of natural gas through a network of  pipelines. Some regions have recently experienced challenges in  maintaining the delivery of natural gas supplies to power plants. For  example, in January 2014, a severe cold weather event know as a  \u201cpolar vortex\u201d affected much of the central and eastern United States,  causing significant outages at plants using various fuel sources and  leading to higher than normal demand for natural gas for both  electricity generation and home heating. According to FERC, there  were no widespread electricity outages. However, challenges  delivering fuel to natural-gas-fueled power plants posed significant  concerns and resulted in outages at some natural-gas-fueled power  plants. System operators took various steps to limit the effect of this  event, including relying on power plants that utilize other fuel sources  that were more readily available at that time, such as coal and oil,  issuing public appeals for conservation, utilizing demand-response  resources, and implementing certain emergency procedures. Going  forward, several stakeholders raised concerns about the sufficiency of  natural gas pipeline capacity in some regions to meet potential greater  future needs. However, FERC has reported that actions taken since  the 2013\u20132014 winter\u2014including improved communications between  the electricity and natural gas industries and additional cold-weather  preparation\u2014led to better operational performance during the 2014\u2013 2015 winter, which also presented extremely challenging cold-weather  conditions. In addition, a recent Department of Energy (DOE) study  suggests that the future needs for interstate natural gas pipelines may  be modest relative to the historical level of pipeline capacity  additions.", "Effects of distributed generation on  system operations to maintain reliability  The addition of distributed generation such as  rooftop solar can present unique challenges  that system operators must manage to  maintain reliability. Several stakeholders told  us that because distributed generation occurs  behind a consumer\u2019s meter, such as at an  individual residence or business, changes in  generation are not visible to or controllable by  the system operator without the installation of  specialized technology.   Regarding the lack of visibility, increases in  distributed generation would be seen by the  system operator as decreases in demand,  since the electricity generated is used on-site  and displaces electricity that would have been  provided through the grid. Because system  operators only see the net effect of these  changes, it is more difficult for them to  understand and predict demand.   Regarding lack of control, if distributed  generation results in more electricity than  customers can use on site, electricity flows  can exceed equipment technical  specifications, which could require equipment  upgrades. Additionally, if there is more  distributed generation than can be used by all  customers, the imbalance of supply and  demand could put the stability of the grid at  risk.    Accommodating increased distributed  generation may therefore require system  operators to, among other things, use models  to predict distributed generation patterns or  install advanced controls to make distributed  generation visible to and controllable by the  utility in order to maintain electric reliability.", "GAO-12-635. the polar vortex.

Changes in electricity  consumption may require system operators to take additional actions  to maintain reliability both in the long and short-term. Over the long- term, system operators need to ensure they have sufficient generating  and transmission capacity to meet forecasted consumer electricity  needs. This means that a system operator may need to continually  add more transmission or generation capacity when peak demand is  rising, even if average consumption is stable or declining. In the short- term, system operators may need to take actions to increase or  decrease the use of power plants and demand-response resources to  address deviations between forecasted and actual consumption.  According to NERC, the electricity industry faces several challenges  in forecasting electricity consumption, because conservation  programs, distributed generation, and other changes in electricity  consumption have increased the uncertainty of traditional forecasting  methods used in long-term and short-term planning.", "The degree to which system operators have had to take additional actions  to maintain reliability in response to changes in generation and  consumption varies regionally based on the extent of these changes and  other characteristics. For example, the extent to which system operators  manage the grid in response to wind and solar growth will depend on  factors such as the relative amount of generation from wind and solar  power plants compared to traditional power plants, the size of a region\u2019s  grid and how interconnected it is with neighboring grids, and other factors.  In this regard, representatives of Midcontinent Independent System  Operator said they have been able to reliably accommodate larger  amounts of wind generation without major operational challenges or the  need for significant additional ancillary services because the large size of  their grid and its extensive connections to neighboring grids provide a  broad base of power plants that system operators can use to balance  variations in the output of wind power plants.literature we reviewed and representatives of the largest utility in Hawaii,  while that state has been able to reliably integrate high levels of wind and  solar, its isolated island grids means it has no neighboring grids to turn to  for balancing variations in the output of wind and solar electricity  generation. Therefore, system operators there have fewer backup  resources to turn to in the event of an unexpected change in wind and  solar output than system operators managing larger, more integrated  grids."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Generation and Consumption Influence Electricity Prices, but the Net Effect Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Changes in generation and consumption, together with associated  actions system operators have taken to maintain reliability, have  influenced consumer electricity prices in complex, interrelated, and  sometimes contradictory ways, and the net effect of these changes on  consumer prices is unclear, based on our review of literature and  discussions with stakeholders. National average real consumer electricity  prices were nearly 11 percent higher in 2014 than 2001, but prices over  this period fell in 5 years, rose in 6 years, and were relatively stable in 2  years (see fig.7). Prices and trends vary by consumer type and region.  (App. V provides additional information on prices by consumer type and  region.)", "Several stakeholders we interviewed and literature we reviewed  highlighted several ways changes in generation and consumption,  together with associated actions system operators have taken to maintain  reliability, have influenced electricity prices. In many cases, these  changes in generation and consumption affect prices at the wholesale  level. The extent to which and how quickly such wholesale price changes  flow through to retail consumer prices depends on a region\u2019s regulatory  structure, individual retail contracts, consumer type, and other factors. A  complete assessment of these factors and their net effect was outside the  scope of this report. Nevertheless, literature and stakeholders highlighted  the following ways changes have influenced prices:", "Wholesale electricity prices and natural gas prices have tended  to move in tandem. Increases in gas-fueled generation have  influenced electricity prices, and average annual prices of natural gas  and wholesale electricity\u2014electricity for resale\u2014at key hubs have  generally moved in tandem since 2002, the earliest year for which  data are available. (Fig. 8 shows real annual average natural gas  prices and electricity prices at a key wholesale gas hub and a key  electricity hub.) Specifically, natural gas prices more than doubled  from 2002 to a peak in 2005, declined somewhat, and peaked again  in 2008. According to EIA, these increases in prices were initially due  to increasing demand for natural gas and hurricanes that disrupted  Gulf Coast natural gas production, among other factors. Natural gas  prices dropped in 2009 and have remained low since\u2014the result of  lower demand due to the economic recession and increasing natural  gas production from development of shale gas resources, among  other factors. These changing natural gas prices generally contributed  first to higher and then lower wholesale electricity prices since 2002.  Additionally, as discussed previously, pipeline constraints and  competing demands have affected the delivery of natural gas in some  regions. This situation has influenced natural gas and wholesale  electricity prices during the winter months. For example, during  January 2014, the month a polar vortex occurred, monthly natural gas  and wholesale electricity prices in New England\u2014a region heavily  dependent on natural gas for generating electricity\u2014reached their  highest levels, according to available historical data. Prices  moderated the following winter, with January 2015 wholesale  electricity prices in New England around 60 percent lower than prices  the previous January. More generally, FERC reported that wholesale  electricity prices were more moderate in January and February 2015  compared to January and February 2014, helped by more stable and  less volatile natural gas prices.", "Negative wholesale electricity prices  In some instances, wholesale electricity  markets experience negative prices\u2014that is,  power plant owners paying consumers to take  their electricity. For example, owners of  certain power plants are sometimes unwilling  or unable to reduce their generation even if  there is little or no demand for the electricity  they generate. This can be the case for  owners of wind plants, which may receive $23  per MWh of electricity generated from the  federal Production Tax Credit, sometimes  making it economically beneficial for these  wind plants to pay consumers to take their  electricity so they can continue to receive the  credit. It can also be the case for power plants  that are costly to shut down and restart, such  as nuclear plants. Owners of these power  plants may be willing to accept negative  prices for a short time in order to avoid the  cost of shutting the plant down.  Our analysis of available hourly data at  electricity hubs within U.S. regional  transmission organizations indicates that  negative prices occurred on average 0.7  percent of the time from 2005 through 2014.", "Specific trends in instances of negative prices  varied by electricity hub, and the annual  percent of negative prices varied across the  hubs, ranging from 0 percent to 9.8 percent  over that time period. In most cases, any  payment consumers might receive as a result  of these negative prices is more than offset by  the cost of purchasing electricity in other  hours. However, negative prices could affect  the profitability of individual power plants in  areas where negative prices occur. expected to contribute to lower prices.regionally and over time based on, among other things, what  alternative power plants exist in a region, the cost of those  alternatives, and the amount of federal and state financial support for  wind and solar development. For example, according to a DOE study   published in 2014, the average cost of procuring electricity from wind  power plants was lower than the cost of purchasing electricity through  the wholesale markets in 2005\u2014a time of high natural gas and  wholesale electricity prices. Conversely, in 2009, after the price of natural gas and wholesale electricity had dropped, the average cost of  procuring electricity from wind power plants was higher than the cost  of purchasing electricity through the wholesale markets. Some of the  costs of wind and solar projects are paid for by taxpayers, which can  offset the prices that some retail consumers may have otherwise had  to pay for electricity generated from wind and solar. According to this  DOE study, prices for procuring wind have been lower as a result of  federal and, in some cases, state tax incentives. Second, as with the  addition of other new power plants, the effect of new wind and solar  sources on consumer prices also depends on the relative costs of any  transmission and ancillary services system operators determine are  needed to reliably integrate wind and solar sources into the grid. To  the extent that additional ancillary services and transmission upgrades  are needed, these costs may be passed on to consumers,  contributing to higher electricity prices. For example, Texas recently  completed a significant transmission project primarily designed to  move electricity generated by wind power plants in remote parts of the  state to population centers, such as Dallas and Austin. The project  has cost close to $7 billion, which will be recovered from Texas  electricity consumers through retail electricity prices. Traditional power  plants also face grid integration costs. Taken all together, the addition  of wind and solar sources could have contributed to higher or lower  consumer electricity prices at different times and in different regions.", "Financial viability of baseload power  plants  Lower utilization and lower electricity prices  have affected the financial viability of some  power plants that have traditionally operated  as baseload plants in restructured regions,  according several stakeholders we  interviewed and literature we reviewed. In  some instances, baseload plants have been  utilized less often in recent years as natural  gas-fueled plants have become more cost  competitive and the levels of wind and solar  generation have increased. Additionally, lower  annual wholesale electricity prices starting in  2009 have reduced the revenue power plants  earn when they are operating. According to  several stakeholders and literature, these  factors have sometimes made it difficult for  baseload power plants to recover their costs  and earn a profit. These difficulties can be  exacerbated if additional investment is  needed to continue to operate the power  plant, for example, the installation of pollution  controls to comply with environmental  regulations. Some baseload coal and nuclear  plants have retired in recent years, with these  factors reportedly influencing their decision.  For example, Entergy retired its 604 MW  Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in 2014, which  company financial filings attributed to  sustained low natural gas and wholesale  electricity prices and high power plant costs,  among other factors. According to several  stakeholders and literature, if plant utilization  and wholesale prices remain low, owners  could choose to retire more unprofitable  plants in the future, which could raise  reliability and price concerns.", "The effect of retirements on prices may vary. The effect of power  plant retirements on prices may vary, depending on the cost of the  retiring power plant compared to the costs of existing power plants  and power plants built to replace retiring power plants, among other  things. If retiring plants are less expensive than existing and  replacement power plants, their retirement would generally be  expected to raise prices. For example, according to EIA, after the  initial shutdown of San Onofre Nuclear Generation Station in 2012\u2014a  large nuclear power plant in Southern California that produced low- cost electricity\u2014prices in Southern California increased in 2012 and  2013, a change that EIA said is likely attributable in part to the need  for more expensive generation in that region to fill the shortage from  San Onofre\u2019s closure. Alternately, if retiring power plants are  replaced by power plants with similar or lower costs, prices could  remain unchanged or decline in some hours. The relative cost of  retiring and new power plants depends on the specific circumstances  of the retiring and potential replacement plants, and may change over  time with changing fuel prices and other market factors.", "Lower electricity consumption could reduce prices. Lower  consumption of electricity\u2014whether in all hours or, particularly, at  peak times\u2014can lower the price of electricity in wholesale markets, a  decline that may translate into lower prices for retail consumers.  Electricity consumption could decline in a given hour, for example,  because of demand-response activities in which consumers reduce  their electricity consumption in response to prices or other incentives.  Electricity consumption could also decline over a longer time period\u2014 for example because of reduced consumption due to a slowdown in  economic growth or increased adoption of energy efficient  technologies. These declines in consumption could lower prices in  some or all hours by reducing use of the highest cost plants.
