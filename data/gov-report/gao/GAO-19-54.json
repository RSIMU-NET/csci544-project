When awarding a  contract competitively, DOD has a number of source selection processes  it can use to evaluate firms\u2019 proposals. One process DOD can use is a  best value, lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) process. In the  LPTA process, DOD awards the contract to the firm presenting the lowest  priced proposal that is technically acceptable, and no tradeoffs are  permitted. Alternatively, DOD can use a best value tradeoff process, in  which it can vary the relative importance of cost or price to other factors  such as a firm\u2019s technical capability or past performance. In these cases,  DOD may award a contract to a firm offering other than the lowest-priced  proposal if it determines that a higher-priced proposal provides a  worthwhile benefit to the department.", "Section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2017, as amended, required DOD to revise the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to allow the use of the LPTA  process only when eight criteria are met.

The specific criteria are discussed in the background  section of this report.", "Section 813 also included a provision that we report no later than  December 1, 2017, and annually thereafter for 3 years on the number of  instances where DOD used the LPTA process for contracts exceeding $5  million, as well as an explanation of how contracting officials considered  the criteria identified in Section 813. In November 2017, we issued our  first report as required by Section 813. This second report (1) determines  the extent to which DOD used the LPTA process in competitively  awarded contracts and orders valued at $5 million and above in fiscal  year 2017; (2) identifies the reasons why contracting officials used the  LPTA process for selected contracts and orders; and (3) for those same  selected contracts and orders, assesses the extent to which contracting  officials considered the eight criteria listed in Section 813.", "DOD does not maintain centralized data on which source selection  procedure is used to award contracts and orders. Consequently, to  determine the extent to which DOD used the LPTA process in  competitively awarded contracts and orders valued at $5 million and  above in fiscal year 2017, we used data from the Federal Procurement  Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to identify the population of  DOD contracts that were reported as competitively awarded contracts  and valued at $5 million and above in fiscal year 2017. This resulted in  the identification of approximately 3,000 contracts. We focused our review  on the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)  because they accounted for 96 percent\u2014or almost 2,900\u2014of the DOD  contracts competitively awarded during this time. In addition to contracts,  we used data from FPDS-NG to identify a population of approximately  1,800 DOD task and delivery orders with an estimated value of $5 million  and above that were reported in FPDS-NG as competed under multiple  award, indefinite delivery indefinitely quantity (IDIQ) contracts during this  time. We again focused our analysis on the Army, Navy, Air Force and  DLA which accounted for 81 percent\u2014or about 1,400\u2014of these orders.", "Using these data, we randomly selected a generalizable sample of 94  contracts and 91 orders from the respective populations of contracts and  orders above. For each contract and order in our sample, we requested  that DOD identify the source selection method used. We independently  verified DOD\u2019s responses by reviewing solicitations. We removed five  contracts and eight orders from our sample. Of the five contracts, we  removed three contracts from our sample because they were incorrectly  classified in FPDS-NG as having been competed when they were not;  one contract because it was terminated after award due to a bid protest;  and one contract because it was classified. Similarly, of the eight orders,  we removed seven from our sample because they were incorrectly  classified in FPDS-NG as being competitively awarded when they were  not and one because it was incorrectly identified as having a value over  $5 million. After removing these contracts and orders, our generalizable  sample consisted of 89 contracts and 83 orders. By tracing relevant  FPDS-NG data to the contracts and orders we reviewed, we determined  these data were sufficiently reliable for us to project the number of  contracts and orders valued over $5 million that the Army, Navy, Air  Force, and DLA competitively awarded in fiscal year 2017 using the LPTA  process.", "To identify the reasons why contracting officials chose to use the LPTA  process and to assess whether those officials considered the eight criteria  in Section 813, we selected from our sample six contracts and eight  orders that used the LPTA process. We selected these 14 contracts and  orders to include a mix of the most frequently purchased products and  services. Of these 14 contracts and orders, four orders were for services  for which Section 813 directs DOD to avoid using the LPTA source  selection process, to the maximum extent practicable. For all of these  selected contracts and orders, we obtained and analyzed relevant  contract file documents including the acquisition plan, solicitation, and  source selection decision document, and we interviewed contracting  officials. Findings from our review of these 14 contracts and orders  cannot be generalized to all contracts and orders that used the LPTA  process.

DOD may elect to use the LPTA process where the  requirement is clearly defined and the risk of unsuccessful contract  performance is minimal. In such cases, DOD can determine that cost or  price should play a dominant role in the source selection. When using the  LPTA process, DOD specifies its minimum requirements in the  solicitation. Firms submit their proposals and DOD determines which of  the proposals meet those requirements. No tradeoffs between cost or  price and non-cost factors (for example, technical capabilities or past  performance) are permitted. Non-cost factors are rated on an acceptable  or unacceptable basis. The award is made based on the lowest priced,  technically acceptable proposal submitted to the government. With either  the LPTA or the tradeoff process, contracting officials may establish a  competitive range and conduct discussions with offerors before selecting  an offer for award.", "By contrast, DOD may elect to use the tradeoff process in acquisitions  where the requirement is less definitive, more development work is  required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these  instances, non-cost factors may play a dominant role in the source  selection process. Tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors allow  DOD to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The FAR requires  DOD to state in the solicitation whether all evaluation factors other than  cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than,  approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price.", "Contracting officials have broad discretion in the selection of the  evaluation criteria that will be used in an acquisition. A written acquisition  plan generally should include a description of the acquisition\u2019s source  selection process and the relationship of the evaluation factors to the  acquisition objectives, but the FAR does not explicitly require contracting  officials to document the reasons why the specific source selection  procedures or evaluation factors were chosen.", "DOD\u2019s March 2016 Source Selection Procedures offer additional  guidance regarding the use of the LPTA source selection process. The  procedures are mandatory for acquisitions conducted as part of a major  system acquisition program and all competitively negotiated FAR part 15  acquisitions with an estimated value over $10 million. The March 2016  guide states that the LPTA source selection process may be used in  situations where there would not be any value on a product or service  exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. The guide  also states that such situations may include acquisitions  for well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services; where risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal; and where DOD has determined there would be no need or value to pay  more for higher performance.", "Section 813, as amended, requires that DOD revise the DFARS to  require that the LPTA process only be used in situations when the  following eight criteria are met.  1.  DOD can clearly describe the minimum requirements in terms of  performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to  determine acceptability of offers.  2.  DOD would realize no, or little, value from a proposal exceeding the  solicitation\u2019s minimum technical requirements.  3.  The proposed technical approaches can be evaluated with little or no  subjectivity as to the desirability of one versus the other.  4.  There is a high degree of certainty that a review of technical proposals  other than that of the lowest-price offeror would not identity factors  that could provide other benefits to the government.  5.  The contracting officer has included a justification for the use of the  LPTA process in the contract file.  6.  The lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs, including for operations  and support.  7.  DOD would realize little or no additional innovation or future  technological advantage by using a different methodology.  8.

One of those types is an IDIQ contract, which provides for  an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a  fixed period of time. The FAR implements a statutory preference for  multiple-award IDIQ contracts, which are awarded to two or more  contractors under a single solicitation. These contracts allow agencies to  establish a group of prequalified contractors to compete for future orders  under streamlined ordering process once agencies determine their  specific needs. These contracts can be awarded using a source selection  process that is on the best value continuum, such as LPTA or tradeoff.", "When a concrete need arises, a contracting officer will issue a task order  for services or delivery order for products. DOD frequently issues orders  under IDIQ contracts to address its needs. DOD obligated approximately  $133 billion\u201440 percent of its total fiscal year 2017 contract obligations\u2014 through such orders.

In October 2010, we found that, for 60 of the 88  contracts we reviewed, DOD used a tradeoff process and weighted non- cost factors as more important than price. In these cases, DOD was  willing to pay more when a firm demonstrated it understood complex  technical issues more thoroughly, could provide a needed product or  service to meet deadlines, or had a proven track record in successfully  delivering products or services of a similar nature. In addition, we  determined that when making tradeoff decisions, DOD selected a lower  priced proposal nearly as often as it selected a higher technically rated,  but more costly, proposal. In so doing, DOD chose not to pay more than  $800 million in proposed costs by selecting a lower priced offer over a  higher technically rated offer in 18 of the contracts we reviewed. The  majority of solicitations where non-cost factors were equal to or less  important than cost were for less complex requirements. We also found  that DOD faced several challenges when using the best value tradeoff  process, including difficulties in developing meaningful evaluation factors,  the additional time investment needed to conduct best value tradeoff  procurements, and a greater level of business judgment required of acquisition staff when  compared to other acquisition approaches.", "To help DOD effectively employ the best value tradeoff process, we  recommended that DOD develop training elements such as case studies  that focus on reaching tradeoff decisions. DOD concurred and  implemented the recommendation in August 2012.", "In 2014, we found that DOD had increased its use of the LPTA process  for new contracts with obligations over $25 million, using the LPTA source  selection process to award an estimated 36 percent of new fiscal year  2013 contracts compared to 26 percent in fiscal year 2009. We found that  contracting officials\u2019 decisions on which source selection process would  be used was generally rooted in knowledge about the requirements and  contractors. For contracts with obligations over $25 million, DOD used  the LPTA source selection process primarily to acquire commercial  products such as fuel, and we identified relatively few uses of the LPTA  process to acquire higher dollar services. For contracts with obligations  over $1 million and under $25 million, DOD used the LPTA process an  estimated 45 percent of the time for a mix of products and services,  including fuel, aircraft parts, computer equipment, construction-related  services, engineering support services, and ship maintenance and  repairs.

We found that  the Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used the LPTA source selection  process for information technology and selected support services  contracts valued at $10 million or more that were awarded in the first half  of fiscal year 2017. Our analysis found that the three military departments  awarded 781 new contracts valued at $10 million or more during this time  frame. Of these 781 contracts, 133 contracts were awarded for  information technology and support services. However, only 9 of the 133  contracts used the LPTA source selection process.

The contract had a one-month mobilization period, a 5-year  base ordering period, and two 1-year option ordering periods.  According to Air Force officials, the contract\u2019s requirements were well- defined because the standard tasks and processes, such as engine  maintenance, corrosion prevention, and aircraft washing, are strictly  defined by an Air Force instruction. Contracting officials determined  there was a low risk of contractor failure because (1) the pool of  qualified firms interested in performing this type of contract is limited,  and (2) the incumbent workforce had to be offered the chance to  continue working under any new contract, regardless of the  management company that won the award.", "The Navy issued an order under a multiple-award IDIQ contract, with  a value of $6.1 million, to renovate office space in two buildings at a  naval air station. The Navy determined that the risk of contractor  failure on this order was low because the contractor was pre-qualified  as part of the initial contract award.

Two of the four contracting officials for the products we  reviewed stated they made this determination for these purchases.  However, the other two stated that they would not have known how to  consider this criterion for their procurements.

Additionally, an Air Force contracting  official who purchased Blackberry licenses stated that it was unclear if  this criterion would apply to such licenses, and if it did, whether a 1-year  license would be considered a short-shelf life.

For  example, 7 of the 14 contracting officials generally stated the criteria in  Section 813 could apply at the order level depending on the nature of the  requirement. They stated that requirements are determined when issuing  orders and, as a result, it is possible that methods including the LPTA  process or a tradeoff process could be used when issuing orders.  Conversely, the remaining 7 contracting officials stated the criteria should  not apply to the issuance of orders, in part, because these criteria would  generally have been considered at the time the IDIQ contract was  awarded. Military department policy officials we interviewed generally  believed that the criteria in Section 813 should not be applicable to  orders. When we raised this issue, a DPC official stated that DOD plans  to address whether the Section 813 criteria are applicable to orders when  DOD revises the DFARS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As DOD prepares to revise the DFARS to implement the eight criteria in  Section 813, as amended, it has an opportunity to address the issues we  identified. DOD stated its intent to require a written justification for using  LPTA and to address whether the Section 813 criteria are applicable to  the issuance of task and delivery orders. It is equally important that, in  revising the regulation, DOD also clarify how contracting officers are to  determine if a good is expendable in nature, nontechnical or have a short  life expectancy or shelf life, and how they are to consider if the lowest  price reflects full life-cycle costs, including for operations and support for  services as well as products.
