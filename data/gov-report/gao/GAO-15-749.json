Threats, such as cyber attacks, also have the potential to cause disruptions. In its June 2014 Annual Energy Management Report (Energy Report) to Congress, DOD reported 180 utility disruptions lasting 8 hours or longer, with an average financial impact of about $220,000 per day, for fiscal year 2013. Installation officials provided specific examples to GAO, such as at Naval Weapons Station Earle, New Jersey, where in 2012, Hurricane Sandy's storm surge destroyed utility infrastructure, disrupting potable and wastewater service and resulting in almost $26 million in estimated repair costs. DOD officials also cited examples of physical and cyber threats, such as the \u201cStuxnet\u201d computer virus that attacked the Iranian nuclear program in 2010 by destroying centrifuges, noting that similar threats could affect DOD installations.", "DOD's collection and reporting of utility disruption data is not comprehensive and contains inaccuracies, because not all types and instances of utility disruptions have been reported and there are inaccuracies in reporting of disruptions' duration and cost. Specifically, in the data call for the Energy Reports, officials stated that DOD installations are not reporting all disruptions that meet the DOD criteria of commercial utility service disruptions lasting 8 hours or longer. This is likely due, in part, to military service guidance that differs from instructions for DOD's data collection template. In its Energy Reports, DOD is also not including information on disruptions to DOD-owned utility infrastructure. There also were inaccuracies in the reported data. For instance, $4.63 million of the $7 million in costs reported by DOD in its June 2013 Energy Report were indirect costs, such as lost productivity, although DOD has directed that such costs not be reported. Officials responsible for compiling the Energy Report noted that utility disruption data constitutes a small part of the report and they have limited time to validate data. However, without collecting and reporting complete and accurate data, decision makers in DOD may be hindered in their ability to plan effectively for mitigating against utility disruptions and enhance utility resilience, and Congress may have limited oversight of the challenges these disruptions pose.", "Military services have taken actions to mitigate risks posed by utility disruptions and are generally taking steps in response to DOD guidance related to utility resilience. For example, installations have backup generators and have conducted vulnerability assessments of their utility systems. Also, DOD is in the planning stages of implementing new cybersecurity guidance, by March 2018, to protect its industrial control systems (ICS), which are computer-controlled systems that monitor or operate physical utility infrastructure. Each of the military services has working groups in place to plan for implementing this guidance. However, the services face three implementation challenges: inventorying their installations' ICS, ensuring personnel with expertise in both ICS and cybersecurity are trained and in place, and programming and identifying funding for implementation. For example, as of February 2015, none of the services had a complete inventory of ICS on their installations. Without overcoming these challenges, DOD's ICS may be vulnerable to cyber incidents that could degrade operations and negatively impact missions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD work with the services to clarify utility disruption reporting guidance, improve data validation steps, and address challenges to addressing cybersecurity ICS guidance. DOD concurred or partially concurred with all but one recommendation and disagreed with some of GAO's analysis.

To accomplish their missions, DOD installations inside and  outside the continental United States must have assurance that they can  continue to operate in the face of man-made and weather-induced utility  interruptions that affect electric, potable water, wastewater, and natural  gas services. According to DOD, threats such as cyber attacks on  industrial control systems (ICS) and hazards such as severe weather  events are a risk to ensuring the reliable provision of utility services to its  installations. For example, in a March 2014 memorandum, DOD noted  that cyber infiltration through ICS used to control and monitor utilities  could result in a serious mission-disabling event. Specifically, ICS could  be used as a gateway into the installation\u2019s information technology  system or possibly DOD\u2019s broader information networks. In addition,  DOD\u2019s April 2015 Cyber Strategy states that adversaries can target  utilities\u2019 ICS and cyber attacks could present a significant risk to national  security. Also, according to March 2014 congressional testimony given  by DOD, extreme weather events\u2014such as hurricanes\u2014have caused  utility disruptions that can affect mission continuity. Further, climate  change increases the likelihood of such events and DOD must be  prepared for\u2014and have the ability to recover from\u2014utility disruptions that  impact mission continuity on DOD installations.", "In recent years, a number of DOD efforts have highlighted the importance  of utility resilience\u2014the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing  conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions caused by  deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring events.

Since 1997, the security of  federal cyber assets has been on our list of high-risk areas and we have  found that the federal government continues to face challenges in  effectively implementing cybersecurity policies. GAO and agency  inspector general reports have identified challenges in a number of key  areas of the government\u2019s approach to cybersecurity including those  related to protecting government information and systems and the  nation\u2019s critical cyber infrastructure. Also, in 2013, we added climate  change to our list of high-risk areas, focusing on limiting the federal  government\u2019s fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks. In  doing so, we found that climate change is considered by many to be a  complex, crosscutting issue that poses risk to many environmental and  economic systems and presents a significant financial risk to the federal  government. In May 2014, we found that DOD\u2019s implementation of  guidance directing the consideration of climate change in installation  planning is likely to vary across the department and that DOD processes  for approving and funding infrastructure projects did not explicitly account  for climate change. We made recommendations that DOD develop a  plan and milestones for completing climate change vulnerability  assessments of installations; provide further information to installation  planners, clarifying actions that should be taken to account for climate  change in planning documents; and clarify the processes used to  compare military construction projects for funding, to include  consideration of potential climate change impacts. DOD concurred with  our recommendations.", "House Report 113-446, accompanying H.R. 4435, a bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, included a provision that  GAO review DOD\u2019s and the military services\u2019 actions to ensure mission  capability in the event of disruptions to utility services. Our study  examines electric, potable water, wastewater, and natural gas services at  domestic and overseas military installations. This report addresses (1)  whether threats and hazards have caused utility disruptions on DOD  installations, and if so, what impacts they have had; (2) the extent to  which DOD\u2019s collection and reporting of information on utility disruptions  is comprehensive and accurate; and (3) the extent to which DOD has  taken actions, and developed and implemented guidance, to mitigate  risks to operations at its installations in the event of utility disruption. This  is a publicly releasable version of a report, marked for official use only,  which we issued in July 2015. This report does not identify specific  vulnerabilities in defense, or defense-related, structures or systems\u2014 information that DOD deemed to be sensitive.

Also, the methodology used for  both reports is the same.", "To determine whether threats and hazards have caused utility disruptions  on DOD installations\u2014and if so\u2014what impacts they have had, we  reviewed various documents on utility disruptions, resulting impacts on  installation operations, and interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable  sample of 20 DOD installations from inside and outside the continental  United States. To identify instances of utility disruptions on DOD  installations, we reviewed the military services\u2019 data submissions for  DOD\u2019s Annual Energy Management Reports (Energy Reports) for fiscal  years 2012, 2013, and 2014. Because DOD\u2019s data in its Energy Reports  do not provide specific examples of disruptions and their impacts, we  conducted independent research using publicly available information,  such as news articles, the details of which we then asked officials from  the military services to verify. We chose to collect data from 2005 to 2014  for the purposes of collecting a large number of examples of utility  disruptions and their impacts. Further, we used our data and DOD\u2019s data  to choose the 20 installations to include in a nongeneralizable sample.  Our selection was based on whether an installation had more than one  instance of utility disruption, or had a disruption of multiple types of utility  service; and we chose installations from each military service. To each  installation, we sent questions regarding the instances of utility  disruptions identified in our research and the impacts of those disruptions.  From the 20 installations, we gathered information on utility disruptions  and their impacts; actions they had taken to mitigate such impacts; and  implementation of selected pieces of DOD utility resilience guidance,  discussed in more detail below. The installations in our sample provided  information on utility disruptions from 2005 to 2014, lasting 8 hours or  longer. In our sample of 20 installations, 18 installations reported  disruptions lasting 8 hours or longer that occurred in fiscal years 2012,  2013, or 2014; and 2 installations reported disruptions lasting 8 hours or  longer that occurred prior to fiscal year 2012. Although the information we  collected was not representative of all installations, we determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting the  number and certain characteristics of utility disruptions, as reported by the  installations\u2019 officials. Table 2 in appendix I lists the installations we  visited or contacted and their locations.", "To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s collection and reporting of  information on utility disruptions is comprehensive and accurate, we  reviewed the statutory reporting requirement, compared the military  services\u2019 data submissions in response to the requirement in fiscal years  2012 through 2014 with information we collected independently, and  reviewed DOD\u2019s process for collecting and reporting on this data. For its  annual Energy Reports, DOD is statutorily required to report on\u2014among  other things\u2014the total number and location of utility outages on  installations. To respond to this requirement, the military services provide  information to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).

When  comparing the data from our sample with the military service data  submitted to DOD, we included only the disruptions that occurred on the  sample\u2019s installations from fiscal years 2012 through 2014. We also  reviewed documents on, and met with military service headquarters and  OSD officials about, data reporting instructions and the processes to  collect, validate, and report the data. To assess the accuracy of DOD\u2019s  reporting, we reviewed utilities disruption data submitted by the military  services to OSD, discussed the data validation processes used by  officials at both the military services\u2019 headquarters and OSD, and  reviewed OSD data validation documentation.

Installation officials explained that this  erosion has damaged a variety of installation infrastructure, including  utilities.", "According to our review of information provided by officials from the 20  installations we visited or contacted, the fiscal impact of utility disruptions  can vary. Examples of fiscal impact include the following:  In late October and early November of 2012, storm surge from  Hurricane Sandy destroyed potable water and wastewater utility  infrastructure of a pier at Naval Weapons Station Earle, New Jersey.  This damage resulted in a disruption of potable water and wastewater  services to docked ships. Disruption of these utility services lasted  about 1 month until\u2014according to installation officials\u2014the installation  could contract to provide temporary potable water and wastewater  services, with a variety of costs for the government. For example,  according to an installation official, one contract to provide temporary  utility service totaled about $2.8 million. Also, according to Navy  documentation, the Navy has estimated that more than $23 million will  be required to replace the destroyed infrastructure. Vandenberg Air  Force Base has also experienced disruptions of potable water utility  service. For example, a November 2014 disruption of water used by a  power plant that provides electricity to a launch pad had an estimated  repair cost of $15,000. Figure 6 shows the repair of damaged potable  water infrastructure on Vandenberg Air Force Base.", "During unusually cold temperatures in January 2014, the utility  company that provides natural gas service to the Army\u2019s Aberdeen  Proving Ground, Maryland, implemented a curtailment agreement with  the installation. Such agreements allow the utility provider to reduce  service during periods of unusually high demand. However, due to  mechanical failures, several of the installation\u2019s heating boilers were  unable to switch from using natural gas to using fuel oil. As result, the  installation was not able to curtail its purchase of natural gas, and was  fined almost $2 million by the utility provider.  In our May 2014 report on DOD\u2019s adaptation to climate change for  infrastructure, we also found fiscal impacts of climate change on  installations\u2019 utility resilience. For example, in 2013, Fort Irwin,  California, experienced three power disruptions in a span of 45 days.  Caused by extreme rain events that created flash flooding, each  disruption lasted at least 24 hours. The disruptions limited the  effectiveness of instrumentation used to track the training at the  National Training Center and provide information used for after-action  feedback. To increase future utility resilience, Fort Irwin requested  more than $11.5 million for 31 backup generators. In our May 2014  report, we noted that weather-related fiscal impacts on infrastructure  may increase in their frequency or severity due to climate change. If  so, DOD\u2019s maintenance costs for these weather-related fiscal impacts  are likely to increase.", "Physical and cyber threats also have the potential to cause utility  disruptions with impacts on installation operations. According to DOD  officials, while there are no known malicious physical acts that have  caused utility disruptions on DOD installations lasting 8 hours or longer,  such acts have the potential to cause utility disruptions, with resultant  impacts on installation operations. For example, according to the Federal  Bureau of Investigation and the Pacific Gas & Electric utility company, in  April 2013 an individual or individuals cut fiber optic cables and fired over  100 bullets into 13 large transformers located at a California substation  operated by the company, damaging the transformers. According to DOD  officials, this incident did not result in disruption of electrical service at  DOD installations. However, they explained that the incident is an  example of the type of utility disruption threat posed by physical terrorism.", "In addition, based on our review of DOD documents and discussions with  DOD officials, the department\u2019s utility infrastructure is also under cyber  threat. According to DOD\u2019s April 2015 Cyber Strategy, the global  proliferation of malicious code or software, called \u201cmalware,\u201d increases  the risk to U.S. networks and data. A variety of adversaries can purchase  destructive malware and other capabilities on the black market. As cyber  capabilities become more readily available over time, DOD assesses that  state and nonstate actors will continue to seek and develop cyber  capabilities to use against U.S. interests. Further, according to the March  2014 OSD memorandum discussed previously, DOD\u2019s computer  networks and systems\u2014including ICS\u2014are under \u201cincessant\u201d cyber  attack and damage to or compromise of any ICS may be a mission  disabler.

The first category of cyber threats includes the  removal of data from an ICS or a DOD network connected to an ICS.  According to OSD\u2019s March 2014 memorandum, a serious mission- disabling event could occur if an ICS was used as a gateway into an  installation\u2019s information technology system or possibly DOD\u2019s broader  information networks. The second category of cyber threats involves the  insertion of false data to corrupt the monitoring and control of utility  infrastructure through an ICS. In its March 2014 memorandum, OSD  noted that disruption of a computerized chiller controller could  deleteriously impact critical military operations and readiness. Figure 7  details an example of a potential cyber attack provided by Navy officials.", "The third category of cyber threats is the physical destruction of utility  infrastructure controlled by an ICS. According to United States Cyber  Command officials, this threat\u2014also known as a \u201ccyber-physical effect\u201d\u2014 is the threat about which they are most concerned. This is because a  cyber-physical incident could result in a loss of utility service or the  catastrophic destruction of utility infrastructure, such as an explosion.

The overall process, with participation by  installations, military service headquarters, and OSD, is detailed in figure  8.", "According to our review of the June 2013 and June 2014 Energy Reports,  other DOD documents, and discussions with an OSD official responsible  for planning and implementing utility resilience activities, DOD uses the  utility disruption data in a number of ways. First, DOD has analyzed these  data to support a review of existing DOD guidance on power resilience at  DOD installations that is presently informing the department\u2019s policy.  Second, according to an OSD official, DOD can use the utilities disruption  data as a baseline to establish trends that inform future strategic planning  and policymaking. Further, the official explained that these are the only  utility disruption data collected for the Energy Reports, and so are  especially important to informing DOD\u2019s utility resilience efforts, noting  that it is important for OSD decision making to be driven by analyzing  data. Also, the official explained that analyses of the utility disruptions\u2019  average duration could inform decisions about which type of backup  power infrastructure is the most cost-effective to install on installations.  For example, if the average duration of a disruption is 2 to 3 days,  individual generators may be the most cost-effective option. In contrast, if  the average duration of a disruption is 7 days or longer, natural gas- powered plants located on installations may be the most cost-effective  option. Third, DOD uses the utility disruption data collected from its  installations to meet the requirement in Section 2925 of Title 10 of the  United States Code to report to Congress on\u2014among other things\u2014the  total number and location of utility outages on installations, their financial  impact, and mitigation measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Collection and Reporting of Utilities Disruption Data Are Not Comprehensive and Some Data Are Not Accurate", "paragraphs": ["DOD instructions in a template used to collect utility disruption data from  installations stipulate that installations should report on external,  commercial utility disruptions lasting at least 8 hours. According to  officials from the military service headquarters and OSD, they do not  review installations\u2019 utilities disruption data to determine whether there  are instances that meet the reporting criteria but are not included.  Officials from three of the military service headquarters and OSDthat, in fiscal years 2012 through 2014, there were installations that did   stated  not report on all disruptions that meet these criteria. By comparing the  utility disruptions we identified through our independent research to those  submitted by the military services to OSD, we confirmed cases of  underreporting by installations from all four services, although our  comparative analysis does not quantify the extent of underreporting. For  example, in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the Army did not report at least  four disruptions, including a 1-week potable water main break at Camp  Darby, Italy. Also, in fiscal year 2012 the Navy and Marine Corps did not  report at least eight disruptions, seven of which were multiday electrical  disruptions that occurred as a result of the June 2012 derecho storm,  including a disruption at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Thus, for fiscal  year 2012, the number of the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 unreported  disruptions is at least more than double the number of reported  disruptions. In addition, for fiscal years 2013 and 2014, the Navy and  Marine Corps did not report a total of at least four disruptions.", "Further, according to instructions in the data collection template,  installations are supposed to submit data only on external, commercial  utility disruptions, not those associated with DOD-owned utility  infrastructure, such as the mechanical failure of a DOD-owned  transformer or a potable water pipe bursting. This results in  underreporting of disruptions in DOD\u2019s Energy Reports. As noted above,  at the 20 installations we visited or contacted, more than 90 percent of  disruptions involved DOD-owned infrastructure. Specifically, for fiscal  years 2012 to 2014, installations in our sample experienced almost 140  utility disruptions involving DOD infrastructure, which would not be  captured in the Energy Reports. According to officials from multiple  installations we visited or contacted, aging DOD-owned utility  infrastructure contributes to utility disruptions. For instance, Kadena Air  Force Base officials explained that \u201cfailing\u201d DOD-owned utility  infrastructure creates challenges to maintaining support to the  installation\u2019s mission. The officials provided one example, noting that  some wastewater pipes were cast in 1947 and have been in use for over  65 years. Kadena Air Force Base officials told us that, from 2011 to 2014,  the installation experienced at least 40 disruptions of electrical, potable  water, and wastewater utility services stemming from DOD-owned  infrastructure that officials estimate lasted at least 8 hours.", "DOD instructions in the data collection template also stipulate that  installations should submit costs related to mitigating utility disruptions,  such as the cost of generators or fuel on which generators run. In fiscal  years 2012, 2013, and 2014, three of the four military services submitted  disruption data to OSD that did not include information on mitigation  costs. For 194 of those disruptions\u2014or 48 percent of the 404 utility  disruptions reported to OSD for that period\u2014installations did not report  mitigation costs. Because it is common for DOD installations to have  backup generators that provide power during electrical disruptions\u2014and  an OSD official stated that the majority of reported disruptions are  electrical\u2014it is likely that installations reporting electrical disruptions also  experienced costs associated with generators. For instance, Navy  officials noted that almost every Navy installation has at least some  generators that would run during a disruption and these generators  consume fuel that would need to be replaced at a cost. Thus, it is likely  that DOD underreported certain costs associated with disruptions such as  fuel costs for generators.", "In addition to underreporting, our review of the fiscal years 2012 through  2014 utilities disruption data submitted by the military services to OSD  and discussions with OSD officials show there were inaccuracies in  duration and cost data on disruptions reported in DOD\u2019s June 2013 and  June 2014 Energy Reports. In regard to the duration of disruptions, three  of the four military services included disruptions lasting less than 8 hours  in the data they submitted to OSD. In total, the military services submitted  32 disruptions lasting less than 8 hours for fiscal years 2012 through  2014. However, according to an OSD official, the fiscal year 2012 and  2013 disruptions lasting less than 8 hours were included in the data  reported in the June 2013 and June 2014 Energy reports, constituting  about 12 percent of the 266 disruptions DOD reported. Further, for fiscal  years 2012 and 2013, a total of 104 disruptions were submitted with  incomplete information on duration. Specifically, these disruptions  lacked start and end times. According to our analysis of Air Force  disruptions reported to OSD for fiscal year 2012 and OSD information on  the number of Air Force disruptions reported in the June 2013 Energy  Report, it is likely that the disruptions were included in the data reported  in that report. Further, according to OSD officials, the Army disruptions  were included in the data reported in the June 2014 Energy Report. The  104 disruptions without complete information on duration account for  almost 40 percent of the 266 disruptions that DOD reported for fiscal  years 2012 and 2013.", "There were also inaccuracies regarding the cost of disruptions. As  discussed above, DOD instructions in the data collection template  stipulate that installations should submit direct costs related to mitigating  utility disruptions, such as the cost of generators or fuel for them. The  instructions also stipulate that indirect costs related to utility disruptions,  such as an installation\u2019s lost productivity, should not be submitted. For  fiscal year 2012, the Army submitted costs related to the disruption of  electrical utility service at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as a result of the June  2012 derecho storm. According to the Army\u2019s descriptions of these  submissions, a total of $4.63 million was for indirect costs, specifically:  lost sales, spoiled inventory (e.g., food, medicine), or lost productivity.  However, according to OSD officials, these costs were included in the  data reported in the June 2013 Energy Report. This $4.63 million of  inaccurately reported indirect costs accounts for 66 percent of the  approximately $7 million in total costs reported by DOD for fiscal year  2012.", "Based on our review of the fiscal year 2014 data submitted by the military  services to OSD\u2014and OSD\u2019s data validation efforts\u2014the accuracy of  DOD\u2019s data may be improving. For example, based on our review, the  services\u2019 fiscal year 2014 data contained some inaccuracies, but there  were fewer duration and cost inaccuracies than in the fiscal year 2013  data. Also, OSD\u2019s data validation documentation show OSD removed  several inaccurate military service submissions before providing the final  fiscal year 2014 data set to the Congress. However, challenges remain in  the data collection instructions DOD provides to its installations and in the  department\u2019s review and validation of data, which could hinder consistent  improvement over time.", "According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, program managers need operational and financial  information in order to determine whether they are meeting their  agencies\u2019 plans and goals, and to promote the effective and efficient use  of resources. Also, in previous work examining how DOD was meeting  reporting requirements, we found that complete and accurate data are  key to meeting such requirements. In addition, in previous work  examining\u2014among other things\u2014DOD\u2019s efforts to effectively implement  existing guidance, we found that clear and complete guidance is  important to the effective implementation of responsibilities. The  standards also emphasize the importance of accurately recording events.  Further, according to the standards, managers should continually assess  their processes to ensure the processes are updated as necessary. In  addition, according to the Project Management Institute\u2019s 2013 guide to  project management, standard practices in program management  include\u2014among other things\u2014reviewing a process on a regular basis to  recommend changes or updates to the process.", "DOD\u2019s underreporting of some disruptions that met the criteria laid out in  DOD reporting instructions, and not including disruptions of DOD-owned  utility infrastructure in the Energy Reports, are likely due to two factors  related to instructions in DOD\u2019s data collection template for installations.  First, the underreporting of disruptions that meet DOD\u2019s criteria is likely  due to inconsistent guidance provided to installations. Specifically,  headquarters officials from both the Marine Corps and Air Force stated  that they provided verbal guidance to their installations to submit  disruptions only if the disruptions met service-specific criteria different  than those stipulated in DOD\u2019s data collection template. For example, Air  Force headquarters officials explained that, for collection of data for fiscal  year 2014, they instructed their installations to submit disruptions only if  they were not mitigated by back-up utility infrastructure, such as an  electrical disruption mitigated by a generator. However, the data  collection template does not instruct installations to limit their submissions  based on these criteria. Also, based on our review, DOD\u2019s instructions to  installations place inconsistent emphasis on electrical and nonelectrical  utilities and provide an unclear scope of the data to be submitted. For  instance, the instructions begin by listing the electrical, water, and gas  utilities on which the installation is supposed to report, but the  instructions\u2019 details refer only to disruptions in electrical power. Officials  from several installations we visited found these instructions confusing.  For example, officials from two of the installations stated that they did not  submit information on potable water disruptions due to the confusing  nature of the instructions.", "Second, the instructions in the data collection template stipulate that  installations are to submit only external, commercial disruptions  because\u2014according to an OSD official\u2014DOD decided to limit the scope  of data collection and reporting to external, commercial disruptions. The  official explained that when the statutory requirement to collect data on  utility disruptions began in fiscal year 2012, DOD\u2019s rationale was that  almost all of the electricity used by its installations is provided by non- DOD entities such as external, commercial utility companies.", "As discussed above, the military service headquarters and OSD take  various steps to validate utility disruption data submitted by the  installations and military services, respectively, but the time and rigor they  commit to reviewing the disruption data are limited, which could affect  their comprehensiveness and accuracy. Specifically, according to officials  from both the military service headquarters and OSD, the structure of the  current process for collecting and reporting data in the Energy Reports  gives relatively little time to validate the utilities disruption data. DOD  officials explained that, out of the 5-month process for collecting and  reporting these data, there are 3\u20134 weeks in which they review utility  disruption data. Also, officials from certain military service headquarters  explained that their review of installations\u2019 data looks for clear \u201coutliers\u201d or  data that seem incorrect and that they rely on installations to provide  accurate data on instances of commercial external utility disruptions and  associated mitigation costs. In addition, OSD spends about 2 weeks  reviewing all of the data required for the Energy Report, including the  disruption data. OSD\u2019s validation efforts include questions for the military  services that address individual items submitted by each service.  According to an OSD official, the 2 weeks it has allotted to review all of  the Energy Report\u2019s data means that it is difficult to verify installation-level  information.", "An OSD official and certain headquarters officials also explained that\u2014in  their limited time to validate all of the data included in the Energy  Reports\u2014they prioritize validation of other data types above their review  of the utilities disruption data. These other types of data represent the 11  other categories of data that DOD is required to include in the Energy  Report. According to certain military services headquarters officials, they  prioritize validation of other data types above their review of the utilities  disruption data because they feel OSD places a higher priority on other  data, such as those related to DOD requirements or renewable energy  projects. In our review of OSD\u2019s data validation of the military services\u2019  fiscal years 2013 and 2014 data for the Energy Reports, we found that a  large majority of the questions are about types of data other than utilities  disruption data.", "As we discussed previously, our sample of 20 installations is nongeneralizable, and so  we cannot assume that this trend applies to the universe of DOD\u2019s installations. However,  the research conducted on these installations provides valuable insight for our study. For  more information on our research methodology, see appendix I. to report, given that 66 percent of the costs DOD included were indirect  costs. Because DOD used these data to support an existing utility  resilience initiative and may use the data to inform future planning and  policymaking, accurate data are especially important to informing DOD\u2019s  utility resilience efforts.

For  example, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton has about 158 facilities  with active emergency generators that it utilizes during electrical  disruptions. Further, the installation has identified a prioritized order  for refueling, the goal of which is to keep the generators operating  during emergency situations.", "At the locations we visited or contacted, installations have taken a  number of actions to mitigate risk to potable water and wastewater  utility service. For instance, at Wheeler Army Airfield, Hawaii, officials  explained that\u2014in the event of an electrical disruption disabling  potable water pumps\u2014the installation\u2019s potable water system is fed  by water tanks, and certain pump stations have emergency  generators. In addition, Vandenberg Air Force Base has a sewage  pond that can store up to 3 days\u2019 worth of sewage in the event that  the pipes leading to the treatment facility cannot be used. Installations  have also developed contingency plans for access to potable water  resources in addition to their primary source. Further, certain  installations have upgraded their utility infrastructure in order to  improve its resilience. According to Naval Weapons Station Earle  officials, the potable and wastewater infrastructure, destroyed by  Hurricane Sandy, is designed to be stronger and thus more resilient in  the face of future extreme storms. Figure 9 shows both the damaged  and repaired infrastructure.", "In addition, installations in our sample have taken steps to plan for  emergency situations in which utility service could be disrupted. For  example, the Naval Base San Diego, California, emergency management  plan has an appendix that addresses potential disruptions in electrical,  potable water, and wastewater utility service; includes planned response  actions; and lists installation organizations responsible for certain actions.  Also, according to officials at Tengan Pier and White Beach in Japan,  both installations participate in emergency management exercises that  provide them with the opportunity to focus on various utility disruption  scenarios, such as an exercise that features a typhoon scenario. Finally,  Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, has an emergency  management plan that identifies all emergency resources available at the  installation such as portable generators, portable pumps, generators  providing power to other utilities (water production facilities, wastewater  treatment plant, and lift stations), and information on emergency  capabilities and assessment teams.", "The installations in our sample also are generally taking steps in  response to DOD guidance related to utility resilience and have taken  steps to mitigate the risk to installations posed by utility disruptions  caused by both threats and hazards.headquarters officials, there are several pieces of DOD-wide guidance  related to utility resilience. Table 1 summarizes selected DOD guidance  and our analysis of implementation efforts by installations in our sample.  Examples of actions taken by installations to implement this guidance  follow the table.", "Based on our review of DOD documents and discussions with officials at  military service headquarters and installations, implementation efforts  include actions such as preparing emergency response plans, conducting  vulnerability assessments, and assessing the condition of utility  infrastructure. For example, Aberdeen Proving Ground\u2019s emergency  response plan identifies utility system vulnerabilities, emergency  preparedness requirements, and remedial actions intended to mitigate the  risk of potential utility service disruptions. Officials from several locations  stated that their installations had undergone various assessments of the  vulnerability of utility infrastructure to terrorist attack. Furthermore,  officials from Naval Base San Diego and Naval Air Weapons Station  China Lake stated that they were conducting a utility inventory and risk  assessment, which would assess and rate the condition of the utility and  also document the consequences of failure of utility infrastructure.", "In addition to mitigation actions and implementation of guidance taken at  the installation level, DOD has undertaken a number of department-wide  initiatives to enhance utility resilience. For example, in 2013, the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment directed a  review of existing DOD guidance on power resilience at DOD  installations. While reliable and continuous access to all types of utilities  is important to DOD missions, OSD officials stated that they focused this  review on power because other utility services may depend on\u2014and  many DOD missions specifically rely on\u2014reliable access to power.  Officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations and Environment are currently reviewing the responses from  the DOD installations, which were compiled and submitted by each  military service, and developing recommendations for power resilience  requirements.", "In addition, DOD has taken\u2014or participated in\u2014efforts to enhance  department-wide cybersecurity of ICS. For instance, the United States  Cyber Command and the Joint Test and Evaluation Program\u2014under the  Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, Office of the Secretary of  Defense\u2014initiated a collaborative effort in 2014 to develop a set of  procedures to detect, mitigate, and respond to cyber incidents on DOD  ICS perpetrated by advanced persistent threat actors, such as nation  states. These procedures are intended to be employed by DOD  installation personnel such as installation information technology  managers and ICS facility engineers. An official from the command stated  that the draft procedures will be tested at a joint exercise in June 2015  and expects the procedures to be completed by December 2015.", "Also, according to our review of documents from the Department of  Homeland Security and DOD\u2014and discussions with officials from both  agencies\u2014DOD has undertaken efforts to better understand cyber  threats to ICS that monitor and control DOD utility infrastructure on which  DOD relies. In one example of such efforts, the Idaho National  Laboratory\u2014under the direction of the Department of Homeland Security  and with participation from DOD\u2014conducted the Aurora Test in 2007.  This test demonstrated how catastrophic physical damage can be caused  to utility infrastructure\u2014in this case a diesel generator\u2014from a remote  location through an adversary\u2019s exploitation of vulnerabilities in the ICS  used to monitor and control electrical substations. After the test, the  diesel generator was inspected and it was determined that it would not be  capable of operation without extensive repairs or a complete overhaul.  While not all generators are configured in the fashion of the Aurora Test,  U.S. Cyber Command officials stated that the Aurora Test is applicable to  DOD generators since some have the same equipment as discussed in  the Aurora Test and that cyber methods can be used to misconfigure how  this equipment operates causing damage or destruction to the equipment.

DOD Instruction 8510.01  replaces the previous DOD policy for information assurance, the DOD  Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process, which  primarily addressed security related to information technology systems.  According to officials, the former accreditation process required that the  communication connection between an ICS and a DOD communication  network be accredited. However, it did not require ICS to be certified and  accredited. DOD officials stated it would be very rare for any organization  to have conducted an assessment of the cyber vulnerabilities of an ICS  system on a DOD installation because\u2014before DOD\u2019s adoption of DOD  Instruction 8510.01\u2014ICS had not been a focus of security assessments.

According to military  service officials, the services have not yet implemented DOD Instruction  8510.01 and transitioning to the instruction is a complex and difficult task.  Evidence of this difficulty is that\u2014according to officials from the office of  the DOD Chief Information Officer\u2014DOD revised the original time frames  to transition to DOD Instruction 8510.01 because they were unachievable.  Specifically, the original time frames required the military services to  transition ICS without a current accreditation to DOD Instruction 8510.01  by September 2014, among other things. DOD\u2019s adjusted time frames  allow the services until the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 to  implement DOD Instruction 8510.01. According to Army officials, the  adjusted time frames will allow the military services additional time to plan  for the transition. However, even with the additional time, the services  may be challenged to implement DOD Instruction 8510.01.", "Military service headquarters officials stated that they are still developing  an inventory of their services\u2019 respective ICS. DOD Instruction 8510.01  requires that ICS should be categorized based on the potential impact on  an organization. As part of this categorization, it is necessary to inventory  the ICS and collect information about the system, such as the type of  information collected and maintained on the system and technical aspects  of the system, such as the type of operating system used. Military officials  we spoke with explained that an inventory of ICS is an important tool for  managing the various types and locations of ICS on military installations.  Navy officials explained that a complete inventory of ICS would help  headquarters officials communicate information about updated security  vulnerabilities to system owners.", "However, as of February 2015, none of the military services had a  complete inventory of existing ICS. While each service is taking steps to  obtain a complete inventory, the data collection process is challenging.  For example, the Air Force is planning on issuing a data call to its  installations in May 2015 and expects that the process will take 6 months  to complete. Currently, Air Force officials stated that they are aware of  280 ICS across the Air Force and estimate that the total number of  systems on active-duty Air Force bases is around 1,900. Marine Corps  officials stated that they also issued a data call to their installations to  collect information on the numbers and types of ICS, but the information  that they received was only 80 percent complete. Marine Corps officials  explained there are challenges that impeded their ability to collect the  information. For example, officials stated that the management of ICS at  the installation level is decentralized such that no one individual has  visibility over all of the ICS on the installation. Navy officials stated they  have an ICS inventory of about 18,000, which includes about 37,000  buildings. Officials stated that obtaining a complete list may be  challenging without the authority to address all organizations on Navy  installations. In addition, they stated that some tenants on Navy-operated  installations do not wish to share information about their ICS. However, if  the ICS owned by another service on a joint base\u2014or by a tenant on  Navy base\u2014is connected to a Navy network, it may be a cybersecurity  risk to the Navy installation. Also, Navy officials stated that it is still  unclear which organizations on Navy bases have the responsibility for  these types of ICS, and that the Navy will need to overcome these  challenges if it is to have a complete ICS inventory.", "Furthermore, officials from each military service stated that identifying  personnel with the appropriate expertise will be a challenge due to a  shortage of personnel with experience in both the operation and  maintenance of ICS and in cybersecurity. DOD Instruction 8510.01 states  that qualified personnel should be assigned to risk management  framework roles. According to United States Cyber Command and  military services headquarters officials, there are very few personnel that  have both the cybersecurity technical skills and the skills regarding the  operation and maintenance of ICS. Specifically, the Navy does not have  the personnel with expertise to determine the necessary cybersecurity  controls for each ICS or to maintain the cybersecurity controls for the ICS  once they are in place. Air Force officials stated that the most important  issue related to implementation of DOD Instruction 8510.01 for ICS at the  installation level is the lack of a qualified staff member assigned the  responsibility for ICS cybersecurity. Moreover, officials also identified a  lack of available training to provide personnel with the necessary skills.  For example, Army and Navy officials stated that the DOD training and  certification classes currently available are specific to information  technology systems such as desktop computers, and not to ICS. The  Marine Corps has begun providing training to a limited number of  personnel, but had to use training provided by the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Industrial Control System Cyber Emergency  Response Team. Department of Homeland Security officials stated that  they have limited capacity and are not funded or staffed to support the  training needs of DOD.", "Military service headquarters officials also stated there are several  funding-related challenges to implement DOD Instruction 8510.01,  including that implementation may require significant resources and costs  involved in implementation have not been fully identified. DOD Instruction  8510.01 states that it is DOD policy that resources for implementing the  DOD Risk Management Framework must be identified and allocated as  part of the Defense planning, programming, budgeting, and execution  process. For example, a required aspect of implementation is identifying  resources to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities discovered through the  assessment process.", "According to some estimates provided by the military service  headquarters officials, implementing DOD Instruction 8510.01 for ICS  will require substantial resources. For example, Navy officials  estimated that the Navy will need \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d to secure ICS  over what they characterized as the long term, 10 to 20 years, which  involves developing a standardized approach that helps protect ICS  and implementing updates to systems so that the systems are  operating within current cybersecurity standards.officials, this cost figure also includes all of the necessary training   According to the  involved and the creation of new positions. In addition, Marine Corps  headquarters officials estimate that the cost to implement DOD  Instruction 8510.01 could range between $3.8 million to $4.2 million  per year for the \u201cfirst few years\u201d of implementation. The officials  stated that these costs include funding to develop the technical  capability that is being developed in partnership with the Navy and  hiring contractor support to assess ICS against the cybersecurity  standards.", "Further, military service headquarters officials explained that the  military services have not yet programmed funding for  implementation. For example, Army officials stated that they anticipate  including $2.5 million in the fiscal year 2017-2021 budget request to  be used in fiscal year 2017 to conduct an inventory of ICS, however  budget decisions have not yet been made for these budget years.  Further, no funding is programmed for fiscal years 2015 and 2016.  Navy officials stated that some tasks related to ICS cybersecurity  have been funded using existing funds. For example, funds from the  Navy Facilities Engineering Command\u2019s working capital fund were  used to pay for some ICS cybersecurity assessments. However, the  Navy has not yet specifically programmed funds to implement DOD  Instruction 8510.01.  In addition, military service officials stated that they have not fully  identified the costs involved in implementing DOD Instruction 8510.01  and face challenges in identifying those costs. For example, Army and  Marine Corps officials stated that it is difficult to develop an accurate  estimate of resources needed to support the implementation of DOD  Instruction 8510.01 without a complete inventory and prioritization of  ICS, which is not yet complete. Specifically, Marine Corps officials  stated that while they have developed an estimate, it is still just their  \u201cbest guess\u201d based on available information. Furthermore, Air Force  officials explained that one of the elements of the overall cost to  implement DOD Instruction 8510.01 depends on the costs associated  with the technical capability the Air Force is developing in order to  implement DOD Instruction 8510.01. However, officials explained that  they are still in the early stages of developing the capability and have  not fully identified the costs. Without knowing the costs, officials  explained that they cannot estimate the overall costs to implement  DOD Instruction 8510.01.", "Challenges with conducting an inventory of existing systems, identifying  individuals with the necessary expertise, and programming and identifying  funding to implement DOD Instruction 8510.01 may hamper the military  services\u2019 abilities to plan for and execute the implementation of DOD  Instruction 8510.01 by the March 2018 time frame. For example, if the Air  Force\u2019s inventory is not completed until November 2015, it only has 28  months to transition an estimated 1,900 ICS to DOD Instruction 8510.01,  which means that almost 70 ICS would need to be accredited each month  to meet DOD\u2019s time frames. In addition, given that there are three  remaining fiscal years until DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2018 deadline for fully  transitioning to DOD Instruction 8510.01, the fact that the military services  have not programmed for or fully identified transition costs means that the  services may be at risk of not adequately funding key transition tasks.  According to DOD\u2019s April 2015 Cyber Strategy, because DOD\u2019s  capabilities cannot necessarily guarantee that every cyberattack will be  denied successfully, the department must invest in resilient and  redundant systems so that it may continue operations in the face of  disruptive or destructive cyberattacks on DOD networks. Until DOD  Instruction 8510.01 is implemented, DOD installations\u2019 ICS remain  vulnerable to exploitation because of a lack of cybersecurity controls.  Vulnerabilities in ICS can be exploited by various methods causing loss of  data, denial of service, or the physical destruction of infrastructure. For  instance, as previously discussed, Stuxnet is an example of a computer  worm, a method of cyberattack that can target ICS vulnerabilities. In  2010, Stuxnet targeted ICS used to manage centrifuges in an Iranian  nuclear processing facility. According to DOD, the same type of ICS can  be found in the critical infrastructure on numerous DOD installations.  Without overcoming challenges related to completing inventories,  acquiring and training personnel, and identifying and programming for  funding, all of which are required under DOD Instruction 8510.01, the  military services\u2019 ICS may be vulnerable to cyber incidents that could  degrade operations and negatively impact missions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To support its operational missions, DOD depends on reliable access to  electrical, potable water, wastewater, and natural gas utility services on  its installations. As events of the past few years have demonstrated, this  access can be disrupted by hazards such as extreme weather and  mechanical failures. These extreme weather events may be further  exacerbated by the impacts of climate change. In addition, as we and  DOD have noted, utilities are vulnerable to threats from physical and  cyber terrorism. Given the possibility of disruptions that result in serious  operational impacts, decision makers in DOD and Congress need reliable  information on the actual scope of disruptions in order to exercise  oversight and ensure that resources are available to take necessary steps  at installations and across the department to increase resilience. Without  guidance that clarifies the reporting requirements of installations\u2014 including the need to fully report on all types of disruptions, including  disruptions of nonelectrical utilities\u2014and requires the inclusion of  disruptions to DOD-owned utilities, decision makers may lack a  comprehensive understanding of the types of utility disruptions on DOD  installations. In addition, DOD and the military services have the  opportunity to take steps that could improve the comprehensiveness and  accuracy of the data they collect, such as assessing the effectiveness of  the current 5-month data collection process. Data that are more complete  and accurate are important, especially given that DOD has stated that the  utility disruption data it collects have been used to support ongoing and  future plans for resiliency initiatives. As our report indicates, installations  have taken steps to mitigate the impacts of disruptions and increase  resilience, with infrastructure that provides redundancy and through the  implementation of utility resiliency guidance. However, DOD and the  military services face several challenges in supporting the department\u2019s  effort to implement its Risk Management Framework for ICS. We  recognize that DOD is in the early stages of this effort and that it plans on  full implementation. Full implementation is important, since cyber attacks  on ICS can lead to the loss of operational data and disruption of utility  service. As previously discussed, we have identified long-standing  challenges with the government\u2019s cybersecurity efforts. Without taking  steps now to conduct an inventory of existing ICS, identify individuals with  the expertise needed to implement DOD Instruction 8510.01, and  program and identify resources for implementation, the military services  risk future delays in their efforts to plan and execute the steps necessary  to protect installation infrastructure from utility disruptions that could have  direct operational mission impacts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to provide DOD and Congress with more comprehensive and  accurate information on all types of utility disruptions, we recommend that  the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and  Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment to take  the following two actions to provide more consistent guidance to the  installations:", "First, in guidance provided to their installations, the military services  should clearly state that all disruptions lasting 8 hours or longer  should be reported, regardless of the disruptions\u2019 impact or mitigation.  In addition, the military services and OSD should work together to  revise the data collection template\u2019s instructions, clarifying that  disruptions in all four categories of utility service\u2014electrical, potable  water, wastewater, and natural gas\u2014should be reported.", "Second, the military services and OSD should revise the data  collection template\u2019s instructions to include reporting of disruptions  caused by DOD-owned utility infrastructure.", "Also, in order to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of certain  data submitted by the military services to OSD and reported in the Energy  Reports\u2014such as potentially underreported data on mitigation costs and  inaccurate data on both disruptions\u2019 duration and cost\u2014we recommend  that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretaries of Army, Navy, and  Air Force, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment to work  together to improve the effectiveness of data validation steps in DOD\u2019s  process for collecting and reporting utilities disruption data. For example,  the military services and OSD could determine whether more time in the  5-month process should be devoted to data validation and whether equal  priority should be given to validating all types of data included in the  Energy Reports.", "Further, in order to minimize the risk of delays in their efforts to implement  DOD Instruction 8510.01, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps to address challenges related to  inventorying existing ICS, identifying personnel with the appropriate  expertise, and programming and identifying funding, as necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD and the Department of  Homeland Security for review and comment; both departments provided  technical comments that we considered and incorporated as appropriate.  DOD provided written comments on our recommendations, which are  reprinted in appendix III.", "In its written comments, DOD partially concurred with our first two  recommendations (now combined as one recommendation), concurred  with two recommendations, and non-concurred with one  recommendation. DOD also stated that it did not agree with GAO\u2019s  analysis of the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the department\u2019s  reporting on utility disruptions in the June 2013 and 2014 Energy Reports.  However, as discussed in this report, DOD\u2019s collection and reporting of  utilities disruption data are not comprehensive and some data are not  accurate. For instance, in regard to comprehensiveness, we confirmed  cases of installations in each military service that did not report on the  commercial, external disruptions on which they are directed to report by  DOD reporting guidance. Also, in regard to accuracy, there were  inaccuracies in duration and cost data on disruptions reported by DOD.  For example, more than 100 disruptions without complete information on  duration account for almost 40 percent of the disruptions that DOD  reported in the June 2013 and 2014 Energy Reports.", "Our first recommendation\u2014aimed at providing DOD and Congress with  more comprehensive and accurate information on all types of utility  disruptions\u2014originally appeared as two recommendations in the draft  report provided to DOD for comment. Based on that draft, DOD partially  concurred, asking us to consider combining the two recommendations,  because they both impact DOD guidance. DOD\u2019s suggested combination  of our first and second recommendations\u2014as written in the department\u2019s  response\u2014meets the intent of the original two recommendations. Thus,  we have combined them into one recommendation, and in subsequent  conversations with DOD, an OSD official confirmed that the department  concurs with the combined recommendation. DOD\u2019s written responses  did not provide information on the timeline or specific actions it plans to  take to implement our recommendations.", "In regard to our recommendation originally appearing third\u2014that OSD  and the military services revise the data collection template\u2019s instructions  to include reporting of disruptions caused by DOD-owned infrastructure\u2014 DOD did not concur. The department stated that reporting on these  disruptions provides a \u201clow value proposition;\u201d the data collected by the  department for the Energy Reports is not being used to guide its strategic  decisions; and collecting the data would be \u201conerous.\u201d We disagree that  collecting data on utility disruptions caused by DOD-owned infrastructure  would be of low value. As discussed in the report, our research indicates  that DOD-owned infrastructure, which DOD controls, may play a larger  role in disruptions than indicated by the Energy Reports, which only  address external, commercial disruptions involving equipment over which  DOD has little control. For example, the installations we visited or  contacted reported disruptions involving DOD infrastructure with  significant impacts, such as delayed satellite launches at Vandenberg Air  Force Base and almost $26 million in estimated repair costs at Naval  Weapons Station Earle. In addition, DOD stated that the data we  collected on utility disruptions caused by DOD-owned infrastructure only  confirm trends in the data on external, commercial disruptions already  collected by DOD. However, we continue to believe its Energy Reports  may be missing a substantial number of disruptions by not including  disruptions caused by DOD-owned infrastructure. Our analysis found  that more than 85 percent of utility disruptions in our sample involved  DOD-owned infrastructure on which DOD does not report in the Energy  Reports. Further, the department stated that the utility disruption data it  collects for the Energy Reports is not being used to guide strategic  decisions. However, as previously discussed in our report, DOD has used  utility disruption data collected for the Energy Reports to support a DOD- wide utility resilience initiative. This was a strategic-level decision,  although based on limited information, since data on disruptions involving  DOD-owned infrastructure were not collected for DOD\u2019s annual reports.  We believe that, if DOD takes actions to improve the comprehensiveness  and accuracy of its utilities disruption data, the data could serve as a  valuable tool in making additional well-informed utility resilience  decisions. Collecting data on disruptions caused by DOD-owned  infrastructure may give the department information on disruptions it has a  greater ability to mitigate and DOD would have more complete  information on which to make any future strategic decisions, such as the  resiliency initiative discussed above. And, by collecting and reporting data  on utility disruptions caused by DOD-owned infrastructure, the  department would be giving Congress a more complete picture of  disruptions on DOD installations. Finally, DOD stated that collecting data  on disruptions caused by DOD-owned infrastructure would create an  \u201conerous\u201d reporting requirement that requires collection, review, and  coordination across the department. However, DOD provided no  evidence that collecting these additional data would be \u201conerous.\u201d The  installations we contacted were able to provide these data to us and  DOD\u2019s current data collection process already includes collection, review,  and coordination across the department.", "In regard to our recommendations originally appearing fourth and fifth\u2014 regarding improvements in DOD\u2019s process for collecting and reporting  utilities disruption data and addressing challenges in implementing DOD  Instruction 8510.01, regarding ICS\u2014DOD concurred. However, DOD did  not provide information on the timeline or specific actions it plans to take  to implement our recommendations.", "DOD also requested that, in our recommendations, we remove  references to the Marine Corps, because it is part of the Department of  the Navy. In regard to the issues on which we made recommendations,  the Marine Corps and Navy collaborate and take some shared actions,  under the Department of the Navy. However, the Marine Corps and Navy  also take actions that are specific to each military service. For example,  the Marine Corps and Navy headquarters collect utilities disruption data  from their installations through distinct processes and the two services  have distinct plans for implementing DOD Instruction 8510.01. For this  reason, we believe the recommendations are appropriately directed at the  Marine Corps and Navy as separate military services.", "We are providing copies to the appropriate congressional committees; the  Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, the Army, the Navy, and the  Air Force, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment.

Examples of  documents we reviewed include DOD and Department of Homeland  Security assessments of utilities\u2019 vulnerability to both hazards and threats,  and DOD\u2019s June 2013 and June 2014 Annual Energy Management  Reports (Energy Reports). In addition, we interviewed or contacted  officials from a nongeneralizable sample of 20 DOD installations from  inside and outside the continental United States. To identify the  installations for our sample, we took a number of steps. First, we  reviewed military service data submitted to the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) on utility disruptions that occurred on DOD installations  from fiscal years 2012 to 2014 and lasted 8 hours or longer. According to  our analysis of information provided by an OSD official, the military  services account for about 87 percent of the utility disruptions reported to  OSD for fiscal years 2012 to 2014. Because their installations account for  a large majority of reported disruptions, we focus on the military services\u2019  utility disruptions in this report. Because DOD\u2019s data in its Energy Reports  do not provide specific examples of disruptions and their impacts, we  conducted independent research using publicly available information,  such as news articles, the details of which we then asked officials from  the military services to verify. We collected additional data on utility  disruptions from 2005 to 2014 on installations inside and outside the  continental United States, in order gather a large number of utility   Next, we  disruptions lasting 8 hours or longer, and their impacts.reviewed the military services\u2019 data and the additional data we gathered,  in order to select the 20 installations to include in our nongeneralizable  sample. We selected installations based on whether the installations had  more than one instance of utility disruption, or had a disruption of multiple  types of utility service; and we chose installations from each military  service. For installations inside the continental United States, we visited  the sites, collected information in interviews, and gathered supporting  documentation. For sites outside the continental United States, we  collected written answers to the questions, along with supporting  documentation. From the 20 installations, we gathered information on  utility disruptions and their impacts; actions they had taken to mitigate  such impacts; and implementation of selected pieces of DOD utility  resilience guidance, discussed in more detail below. As discussed above,  the installations in our sample provided information on utility disruptions  from 2005 to 2014, lasting 8 hours or longer. In our sample of 20  installations, 18 installations reported a total of 150 disruptions lasting 8  hours or longer that occurred in fiscal years 2012, 2013, or 2014; 2  installations reported disruptions lasting 8 hours or longer that occurred   Although the information we collected was not  prior to fiscal year 2012.representative of all installations, the selection of these installations  provided valuable insights for our review. In addition, we assessed the  reliability of all computer-generated data provided by the installations in  our sample by reviewing existing information about the data and the  systems that produced the data and by interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data to determine the steps taken to ensure its  completeness and accuracy. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting the number and certain  characteristics of utility disruptions, as reported by officials from  installations in our sample. However, as noted in our report, we  determined those utilities disruption data reported by DOD in its June  2013 and June 2014 Energy Reports were not sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of comprehensively or accurately presenting the total number,  average duration, or cost of utility disruptions. Table 2 lists the  installations we visited or contacted and their locations.", "To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s collection and reporting of  information on utility disruptions is comprehensive and accurate, we  reviewed the statutory reporting requirement for the Energy Reports,  compared the military services\u2019 data submissions for fiscal years 2012  through 2014 with information we collected from the installations we  visited or contacted, and reviewed DOD\u2019s process for collecting and  reporting on this data. DOD is statutorily required to report on\u2014among  other things\u2014the total number and location of utility outages on  installations. To respond to this requirement, the military services provide  information to OSD. We reviewed the military services\u2019 submissions of   as well  utility disruption data to OSD for fiscal years 2012 through 2014,as the June 2013 and June 2014 Energy Reports in which DOD reported  these data. We reviewed these two reports because, at the time of our  review, DOD had not yet issued its June 2015 report. To identify the  comprehensiveness of DOD\u2019s reporting, we compared the military  services\u2019 data submissions to OSD with the independent research we  conducted at 20 installations in our sample, as described above. When  comparing the data from our sample with the military service data  submitted to DOD, we included only the 150 disruptions that occurred on  the sample\u2019s installations from fiscal years 2012 through 2014. In  addition, we reviewed DOD instructions on the data submissions that  provide information to the military services on the scope and type of  information the military services and their installations are supposed to  submit to OSD. We then compared the services\u2019 submissions to DOD  instructions for installations that provided these data. Our comparison  covered the 3 years the military services submitted data for DOD\u2019s  Energy Reports, fiscal years 2012 through 2014. Also, we reviewed  documentation of OSD\u2019s validation of the military services\u2019 submissions.  In addition, we met with officials at installations from our sample, the  military services\u2019 headquarters, and OSD to discuss how utilities data  were collected, validated, and reported. We also discussed the data  validation processes used by officials at both the military services\u2019  headquarters and OSD. Further, to determine how DOD uses these  utilities disruption data, we reviewed the June 2013 and June 2014  Energy Reports and met with officials at both the military services\u2019  headquarters and OSD. Finally, we compared DOD\u2019s processes for the  collection, validation, reporting, and use of these data to several leading  practices for the use and management of data and process improvement.  Sources for these leading practices include the Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government; our previous work that discusses  improvement of infrastructure planning processes to better account for  climate change impacts and improvement in the accuracy and  completeness of data used to meet reporting requirements; and the  Project Management Institute.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has taken actions and developed  and implemented guidance to mitigate risks to operations at its  installations in the event of utility disruption, we collected and reviewed  DOD documents related to actions taken to mitigate risks, utility resilience  guidance, and implementation efforts. We collected these documents  from the 20 installations in our nongeneralizable sample and from the  military service headquarters. To determine the extent to which DOD has  taken actions to mitigate risks to operations at its installations in the event  of utility disruptions, we reviewed documents such as those describing  backup generators on installations and the refueling plans for those  generators. We also reviewed documents describing installations\u2019 plans  for situations in which utility service is disrupted, to include emergency  management plans. To determine DOD guidance related to utility  resilience, we reviewed Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum  92-1, DOD Instruction 2000.16, DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards (Oct.  2, 2006, incorporating change Dec. 8, 2006), DOD Instruction 4170.11,  Installation Energy Management (Dec. 11, 2009), DOD Directive 3020.40,  DOD Policy and Responsibilities for Critical Infrastructure (Jan. 14, 2010,  incorporating change Sept. 21, 2012).

In addition, we  met with officials from our sample of installations, and from military  service headquarters to discuss actions taken to mitigate risks of utility  disruptions, identify guidance related to utility resilience, and to identify  steps taken to implement the guidance. Furthermore, we collected and  reviewed DOD documents and guidance related to cybersecurity of  industrial control systems (ICS), which are often used to monitor and  control utility infrastructure on DOD installations.
