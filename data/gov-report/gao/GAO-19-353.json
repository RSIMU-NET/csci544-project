These include accounts that fund retirement benefits, disability insurance, health insurance, and life insurance programs for civilian and military employees.", "The government's primarily cash-based budget generally does not record the full cost of commitments incurred until corresponding payments are made in the future. Therefore, the budget may not accurately reflect federal costs or the likely claim on federal resources for such activities. For some claims, such as pension and life insurance, the federal commitment occurs years before payments are reflected in the budget. Additionally, payments the government may be expected to make based on policies or past practices (but is not legally required to make) may not be evident in the budget. For example, the Commercial Space Launch Insurance Program created a potential liability to the government of up to $3.1 billion per licensed space launch in 2017 but never has been included in the budget. GAO previously recommended ( GAO-08-206 , and reiterated in GAO-14-28 ) that Congress consider expanding the use of accrual-based information in the budget documents submitted to Congress. However, this recommendation has not been implemented. Accrual measurement would provide enhanced control over future spending by recognizing long-term costs when decisions are made."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["This analysis provides additional support for GAO's 2007 recommendation that Congress consider improving recognition of fiscal exposures in budget documents such as by expanding use of information on expected future spending arising from present-day commitments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government administers many activities that protect a range  of parties from the effects of various adverse events\u2014including providing  insurance, guaranteeing loans, compensating victims for losses in  catastrophic events, and sharing insured losses from terrorist attacks.

You asked us to update the 2005  catalog and continue to identify opportunities for improving budgeting for  federal insurance activities. In this report, we (1) identify federal insurance  and other activities that transfer risk or losses to the federal government  and, where possible, identify cost- and exposure-related information on  these activities; and (2) use selected activities in this catalog to illustrate  some of the challenges we identified in past reports with measuring and  reporting fiscal exposures in budget documents.", "To identify federal insurance and other activities that transfer risk or  losses to the federal government, we used the following sources of  consolidated government-wide information: (1) the Financial Report of the  United States Government (Financial Report) and underlying data from  the Government-wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance  System (GTAS); (2) the Budget of the United States Government  (President\u2019s Budget); (3) the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance  (CFDA); and (4) the Code of Laws of the United States (U.S. Code). We  revised the criteria of our 2005 report, in part by using definitions of  federal insurance from the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board  (FASAB), to arrive at the following two criteria against which to assess  activities: (1) a risk of financial loss or actual financial loss to a third party  exists that stems from an adverse event; and (2) through the activity, the  federal government accepts some or all of the risk of financial loss or  actual financial loss from the adverse event by indemnifying,  guaranteeing, or providing benefits to the affected entity or beneficiary.  We applied the criteria to our information sources to compile our catalog  of federal insurance and other activities that transfer risk or losses to the  government. We also crosschecked our lists of federal activities identified  through the President\u2019s Budget or CFDA with activities identified in our  2005 report. We generally reported fiscal year 2017 financial and budget  data, as available. We obtained expert opinions on our catalog from  officials at the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), the Congressional Budget Office, and  FASAB, and from key GAO staff with relevant expertise, including  accountants, actuaries, and experts on budget appropriation and other  federal activities.

We reviewed our past findings, recommendations, and  matters for congressional consideration to identify key challenges  relevant to insurance and other activities. We selected six activities that  illustrate these challenges from activities we identified for this report.

Per the terms of the contracts, insurers  generally offer coverage for losses from specified events in exchange for  premium payments. Private insurers spread risk over a large enough  group of insured parties to reasonably predict total losses, then set risk- based premium rates to make a profit and cover costs, including claim  payments for covered losses, administrative expenses, and other  expenses associated with selling and servicing policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Insurance and Other Activities That Transfer Risk or Losses to the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["Similarly, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of insurance as it  relates to federal activities.

Even when premiums or fees exist, they may  not cover all costs, as federal expenditures can be driven more by policy  goals or agency missions than a desire to achieve fiscal solvency. For  example, by design, premiums collected through the Federal Crop  Insurance program do not cover its costs. One of the program\u2019s goals is  to help farmers manage the risks inherent in farming, such as the risk of  poor crop yields and declines in prices, and it does so while subsidizing  more than 60 percent of the premiums. In addition, Congress created the  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to address the increasing cost  of federal disaster assistance by providing flood insurance to property  owners in flood-prone areas, where such insurance either was not  available or prohibitively expensive through the private sector. Subsidized  premium rates, among other things, have precluded NFIP from achieving  rates that reflect the full risk of loss, and the program has not had  sufficient funds to pay claims.

Pursuant to the plan, FDIC raised assessment rates  and imposed a one-time special assessment to recapitalize the DIF.  To meet the projected liquidity needs for failures of FDIC-insured  depository institutions during the financial crisis, FDIC required the  banking industry to prepay its quarterly risk-based assessments for  the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the following 3 years.

To comply with the statutory requirement that large banks\u2014those with  total assets of $10 billion or more\u2014bear the responsibility of  increasing the DIF reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent,  FDIC imposed a quarterly surcharge on large banks.

Federal loan guarantees are any guarantees, insurance, or  other pledges with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal  or interest on any debt obligation of a nonfederal borrower to a nonfederal  lender. Thus, the federal guarantee transfers some or all of the risks of  borrower default from private lenders to the federal government.", "The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires agencies to estimate the  cost to the government of guaranteeing credit in the President\u2019s Budget,  beginning in fiscal year 1992. This cost, the loan guarantee subsidy cost  (referred to in this report as \u201csubsidy cost\u201d), equals the net present value  of the following cash flows at the time a loan guarantee is disbursed by  the lender: (1) the estimated payments by the government to cover  defaults, delinquencies, interest subsidies, or other payments; and (2) the  estimated payments to the government, including origination and other  fees, penalties and recoveries. If the present value of estimated cash  outflows exceeds cash inflows, there is a positive subsidy cost. If the  present value of estimated cash inflows exceeds cash outflows, there is a  negative subsidy cost, referred to as subsidy income. Every fiscal year,  subsidy costs are (1) estimated for the loan guarantees obligated during  that year and (2) reestimated for loan guarantees obligated in previous  fiscal years to update costs for actual loan performance and to  incorporate any changes in assumptions about future loan performance. If  reestimates increase subsidy costs, an agency would need additional  funds. If they decrease subsidy costs, an agency generally would return  funds to the general fund of the Treasury. Regardless of whether credit  programs are discretionary or mandatory, agencies do not need to  request additional appropriations to cover upward reestimates because  the Federal Credit Reform Act provides permanent indefinite budget  authority for this purpose.", "In addition, the loan guarantee liability in the Financial Report is the  present value of estimated net cash outflows. Thus, this liability is an  estimate of the exposure to the federal government because of all  outstanding loan guarantees. This liability is based on all loan guarantees  obligated in a given fiscal year and previous years that are outstanding as  of the end of a fiscal year.

The  program provides mortgage insurance to encourage lenders to make  credit available to borrowers not adequately served by the conventional  market, such as first-time homebuyers, minorities, and lower-income  families.

These challenges still exist, and to illustrate  them, we reviewed six activities from among those we identified that  transfer risk or losses to the federal government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government\u2019s Legal Commitment Varies, and Implicit Exposures for Some Activities May Not Be Evident in the Budget", "paragraphs": ["Federal activities that transfer risk or losses to the federal government  have a range of fiscal exposures in which the extent of the government\u2019s  legal commitment varies (see fig. 1). In 2003, we developed a conceptual  framework for fiscal exposures that notes fiscal exposures may be explicit  or implicit. Explicit exposures are commitments that the government is  legally required to fund, while implicit exposures arise not from a legal  commitment, but from current policy, past practices, or other factors that  may create the expectation for future spending. Some federal activities  have a combination of explicit and implicit exposures. For example, the  government is not legally required to cover PBGC insurance claim losses  in excess of PBGC\u2019s available resources. Therefore, claims up to the  statutory limit are explicit exposures, and losses in excess of PBGC\u2019s  available resources represent an implicit exposure for the federal  government to the extent there is an expectation that the government  would step in and cover losses beyond the program\u2019s reserves. In  contrast, loan guarantees under the MMI Fund represent an explicit  exposure only, because the government has a legal commitment to pay  claims if the borrower defaults on a loan.", "Implicit exposures may not be evident in the budget, because the  primarily cash-based budget records spending only when payments are  made. For example, as part of the Commercial Space Launch Insurance  Program, the federal government is potentially liable for damages from  commercial space launch accidents, subject to appropriation, up to $3.1  billion per licensed space launch in 2017. This program represents an  implicit exposure because a new appropriation\u2014which would represent  the federal government\u2019s legal commitment to pay for this program\u2014is  required to fund damages. Because there has never been such an event  or appropriation, this fiscal exposure has not been included in the budget.  According to Federal Aviation Administration officials, the agency has not  designed internal processes or procedures to address these potential  costs, such as estimating the costs, in part because the agency cannot  presume the government will provide funds until such an appropriation  were made.", "While implicit exposures do not present a legal commitment to the  government, the federal government historically has shown a willingness  to fund them in some cases. For example, NFIP has authority to borrow  funds from the U.S. Treasury. To the extent there is an expectation that  the federal government will cover claims exceeding the amount NFIP has  been authorized to borrow from the U.S. Treasury, NFIP represents an  implicit exposure. In October 2017 when NFIP was about to exhaust its  borrowing authority, Congress demonstrated its willingness to fund NFIP  implicit exposures by passing a supplemental appropriation, which the  President signed into law, that cancelled $16 billion of NFIP\u2019s past  borrowing from the U.S. Treasury. This allowed NFIP to borrow an  additional $6.1 billion that would have exceeded its borrowing authority  without this intervention, while also reducing its overall debt. Additionally,  in fiscal years 2005\u20132018 the federal government designated a total of  $138 billion in supplemental appropriations to the Disaster Relief Fund for  declared disasters (see fig. 2). These costs indicate that there was an  implicit exposure because Congress must pass a supplemental  appropriation to cover them. Congress passed at least one supplemental  appropriation for a major disaster in 9 of the 14 years during 2005\u20132018."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cash-Based Budgeting May Not Reflect the Government\u2019s Cost or Potential Costs from Risk- or Loss-Transferring Activities", "paragraphs": ["As we previously found, the federal budget may not accurately reflect the  government\u2019s costs or the likely claim on federal resources from activities  that transfer risk or losses to the government. Again, except for loan  guarantees, the federal government\u2019s primarily cash-based budget  generally does not record the full cost of commitments incurred in the  present until corresponding payments are made in the future. However,  for some claims, such as pension and post-retirement life insurance, the  federal commitment occurs years before the related cash consequences  are reflected in the budget. For example, the cost of pension plan  insurance accrued in a given year is not reflected in the budget; rather,  premiums are shown as receipts when they are collected and payments  are shown as outlays when they are made. In fiscal year 2017, the budget  showed PBGC\u2019s annual receipts exceeded its outlays by $4.8 billion. But  in the same year, the program also had a $76 billion negative net  position, which is one measure of the magnitude of the government\u2019s  fiscal exposure and is not included in the budget (see fig. 3).", "Similarly, the budget may not indicate the government\u2019s long-term  exposure from weather-related events. Like PBGC, NFIP reports  premiums in the budget as receipts in the year they are collected and  payments as outlays in the year they are made. The budget does not  currently include information on NFIP\u2019s liabilities, assets, or net position.  In fiscal year 2017, the budget showed a deficit (outlays exceeded  receipts) for NFIP of $2.2 billion, a modest deficit compared to NFIP\u2019s net  position in the same year, which fell by $11.5 billion to negative $37.4  billion (see fig. 4). NFIP\u2019s $30.425 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury at  that time, which was included in its liabilities, contributed to its net  negative position.", "We previously reported that FEMA is required by law to charge many  policyholders less than full-risk rates, otherwise known as subsidized  rates. We found that FEMA\u2019s budget does not recognize the subsidy,  making it difficult to analyze the effect of subsidized premium rates on the  overall financial stability of NFIP. In 2017, we recommended that  Congress consider comprehensive reform to improve NFIP solvency and  enhance national resilience to floods. At that time, we developed five  policy goals for evaluating options for reforming NFIP that included  requiring transparency of the program\u2019s federal fiscal exposure.  Congress is still considering various reforms related to NFIP.", "In addition, the budget request for the Disaster Relief Fund, which  provides a significant portion of the total federal response to major  disasters, traditionally has been intended to cover each fiscal year\u2019s costs  for previously declared disasters and the predictable cost of  noncatastrophic events. It does not pre-fund anticipated needs from  disasters that have yet to occur or seek funding for potential catastrophic  events. As previously noted and shown in figure 2, extreme weather  events have cost the nation more than $100 billion through supplemental  appropriations to the Disaster Relief Fund since fiscal year 2005.  According to the Analytical Perspectives of the President\u2019s 2019 Budget,  inflation, urbanization, and other factors are expected to contribute to  increasing future disaster response and recovery costs. Additionally,  climate change could increase the costs of severe weather events as  more frequent and extreme weather and climate-related events are  expected to continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social  systems, according to the United States Global Change Research  Program. This is one reason we added the federal government\u2019s fiscal  exposure created by climate change to our 2013 High Risk List.", "However, the increased fiscal exposures are not reflected in the Disaster  Relief Fund\u2019s financial measures in the budget. According to FEMA  officials, the agency does not forecast costs or exposures for catastrophic  disasters, in part because each catastrophe is different and presents its  own set of risks that would be very difficult to predict with reasonable  certainty.", "While the primarily cash-based budget may not represent an activity\u2019s  likely claim on federal resources, members of Congress and the public  have access to information on the fiscal health of the activities through  other avenues. Many of the activities we reviewed track exposures and  other relevant data internally and provide that information to Congress  and the public through a variety of reports outside the budget (see table  7). These include actuarial reviews, one-time analyses of various  subjects, and annual reports that provide detailed financial information.  For example, each year an independent actuarial contractor conducts two  separate actuarial reviews of the MMI Fund\u2014one for forward mortgages  and one for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (reverse mortgages)\u2014to  estimate the economic value of the two portfolios. FHA then compiles  statutorily required annual reports for Congress based on the results of  the actuarial analyses. The annual report includes the calculation of the  MMI Fund\u2019s overall capital ratio and some additional analyses of the MMI  Fund\u2019s financial condition.", "While these reports provide additional financial information, we previously  reported that decision-making is best informed if the government includes  in the budget the costs of its commitments at the time it makes them. If  the full cost of a spending decision is included in the budget when the  decision is made, then decision makers can consider the total costs when  setting priorities, compare the cost of an activity with its benefits, or  assess the cost of one method of reaching a specified goal against  another. Decision makers\u2019 ability to make informed choices would be  improved by increased transparency about the impact of policy decisions  on the expected path of spending and revenue.", "We previously recommended that Congress consider expanding the use  of accrual-based information to other activities, such as insurance,  because accrual measurement would advance the recognition of costs for  these commitments, especially those that involve cash flows over many  years. We determined that, for many programs, adopting accrual-based  information selectively within the current, primarily cash-based budget  might improve information while preserving up-front control. PBGC,  Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance (FEGLI), and NFIP officials  stated that adding limited accrual accounting information, such as the  balance sheet, to the President\u2019s Budget would be relatively easy. NFIP  officials agreed that while the financial statements and various reports  show the full liability of the program, including this information in the  budget would consolidate it in one place. The President\u2019s Budget  (Appendix) already includes a balance sheet from FHA\u2019s MMI Fund,  along with information on credit subsidy reestimates in the Federal Credit  Supplement of the budget as required by the Federal Credit Reform Act  of 1990. According to FHA officials, the main benefit of reporting  balance-sheet information in the budget is that the public, OMB, and  Department of Housing and Urban Development personnel have more  data that can be used to make decisions. FHA officials also noted that  creating a crosswalk between the financial reports and the budget has  been a challenge because there is not always a one-to-one relationship,  which is due to different reporting elements and concepts underlying their  measurement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Accrual Budgeting Better Recognizes Long- Term Costs, the Amount of the Exposure Can Be Hard to Measure for Some Activities", "paragraphs": ["Given the variation in fiscal exposures, we previously concluded that  while accrual budgeting better recognizes long-term costs, a uniform,  across-the-board approach to make fiscal exposures more apparent in  the budget may not be appropriate. One of several factors that should  be considered is the extent to which the magnitude of the exposure can  be reasonably estimated. The complexity and uncertainty surrounding  some exposures create significant cost estimation challenges, while other  activities are easier to estimate. For example, OPM considers various  factors that are fairly stable and easily known or can be reasonably  estimated (such as changes in the mortality of federal employees, federal  salaries, and interest rates) when calculating FEGLI\u2019s liability for current  and future life insurance coverage. Because of this, FEGLI officials noted  that they did not face significant challenges in estimating the program\u2019s  fiscal exposure.", "In contrast, exposures related to natural disasters are especially hard to  estimate. According to NFIP officials, the extreme variability of flood  losses is the single biggest challenge in estimating the program\u2019s  exposure. Similarly, officials from the Disaster Relief Fund said it is not  possible to forecast catastrophic disasters because each is different.  According to FEMA officials, the agency has begun working with  catastrophe modeling firms and others in developing better estimates of  loss exposures. While several components of the models are still in  development, FEMA officials believe they show promise to be useful tools  in the future.", "Agencies developed models to make estimates of fiscal exposures for  several of the activities we reviewed, although the agencies noted that  generating reasonably reliable estimates is difficult for a variety of  reasons, such as the sufficiency of data on potential losses and the  nature of the risks insured by the government. For example, PBGC  developed the Pension Insurance Modeling System to help the agency  better understand and quantify its long-term risk and exposure to loss  under different economic conditions and policy alternatives. Agency  officials stated that obtaining current, complete, comprehensive, and  reliable data on the company pension plans likely to present claims was  one of the most significant challenges in these estimates. FHA also uses  economic assumptions and historical data to estimate and reestimate the  net lifetime costs of the mortgages it insures. Agency officials noted that it  is difficult to produce these estimates because risk can vary based on a  variety of factors that are uncertain, volatile, or sensitive, such as the  economy and housing market. In recognition of this difficulty, the Federal  Credit Reform Act of 1990 provides permanent and indefinite budget  authority for upward reestimates, so that FHA can receive additional  funds when needed if reestimates increase subsidy costs.", "We previously recommended to Congress in 2007, and reiterated in  2013, that it consider requiring increased reporting of accrual-based cost  information where appropriate alongside cash-based budget numbers for  both existing and proposed activities\u2014where accrual-based cost  information includes significant future cash resource requirements not yet  reflected in the primarily cash-based budget. From 2009 through 2014,  several bills were introduced to budget for certain activities on an accrual  basis, but none were signed into law. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018  created the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriation Process  Reform, but no bills were signed into law as a result. The committee was  terminated by statute by December 2018. We continue to support this  recommendation to improve budget recognition of these fiscal exposures,  because, as shown, challenges remain in identifying and measuring fiscal  exposures.", "The government undertakes a wide range of activities that create fiscal  exposures by obligating the government to future spending or creating an  expectation for such spending. The federal budget both allocates and  controls resources, but does not provide complete information about  some significant fiscal exposures. Failure to understand and address  these exposures can have significant consequences. These fiscal  exposures will require future federal spending and will absorb resources  available for other activities. Not capturing the long-term costs of current  decisions limits Congress\u2019s ability to control federal fiscal exposures at  the time decisions are made.

RMA partners with  private insurers that sell and service policies. The program insures  farmers against losses on more than 100 crops, which include corn,  soybeans, wheat, cotton, and grain sorghum, as well as nursery crops  and certain fruits and vegetables.

The multiemployer program insures plans  arranged through collective bargaining between labor unions and  employers, with two or more employers participating in a plan. PBGC  provides financial assistance to multiemployer plans when they become  insolvent. According to PBGC, as of September 30, 2018, the  multiemployer program insured about 10.6 million people in  approximately 1,400 plans and about 62,300 people were receiving  benefits payments from plans receiving financial assistance from PBGC.", "Premium rates are set in law by Congress and plan sponsors or plans  pay per-participant flat premiums under both programs. In addition, under  the single-employer program, a plan sponsor or plan pays a variable-rate  premium based on its plan underfunding. PBGC receives no funds from  general tax revenue and assets from one program cannot be used to  support the other, so both programs must pay claims primarily from  nonfederal sources. The single-employer program had positive cash flow  during fiscal year 2018 and both programs have been able to maintain  enough assets to pay guaranteed benefits and financial assistance to  date.", "But historically, PBGC\u2019s statutory premium structure has not reflected  significant risks PBGC insures against\u2014for example, the risk that a  single-employer plan sponsor becomes bankrupt, forcing the termination  of an underfunded plan, or the risk that a multiemployer plan\u2019s financial  condition deteriorates, causing it to become insolvent\u2014imposing claims  on PBGC programs. As shown in table 10, PBGC\u2019s multiemployer  program had a negative net position (that is, total liabilities exceeded total  assets) at the end of fiscal year 2018. The single-employer program  reached a positive net position (for the first time since 2001) by the end of  fiscal year 2018. PBGC projects a positive net position in 10 years for the  single-employer program, but a negative net position for the  multiemployer program (negative $68.9 billion by the end of fiscal year  2027), although there is inherent uncertainty around such a projection.  PBGC\u2019s forecasts for the following decade and beyond based on current  economic conditions project a very high likelihood of insolvency for the  multiemployer program before the end of fiscal year 2025 if there are no  changes in law.", "In 2013, PBGC officials told us that once the multiemployer fund\u2019s cash  balance was depleted, the agency would have to rely solely on annual  insurance premium receipts to pay financial assistance to plans. The  precise effect that the insolvency of the multiemployer insurance fund  would have on retirees receiving the PBGC guaranteed benefit would  depend on a number of factors\u2014primarily the number of guaranteed  benefit recipients and PBGC\u2019s annual premium income at that time.  However, the impact likely would be severe.", "In 2012, we recommended that Congress consider redesigning PBGC\u2019s  premium structure to more fully reflect the risks posed by plans and  sponsors to the agency and improve PBGC\u2019s access to additional  information needed to assess risk and assist in setting premiums. In  2013, we also recommended that Congress consider comprehensive and  balanced structural reforms to reinforce and stabilize the multiemployer  program. As of December 31, 2018, Congress had yet to authorize a  redesign of PBGC's premium structure. However, in December 2014,  Congress enacted the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, which  substantially established in law certain key structural reforms to the  multiemployer system, including allowing severely distressed  multiemployer plans to reduce accrued pension benefits; expanding  PBGC\u2019s ability to assist financially distressed plans; and raising  multiemployer insurance premiums to provide PBGC with additional  resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deposit Insurance Fund", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures the deposits  of commercial banks and savings associations up to the statutory limit of  $250,000. According to FDIC, as of September 30, 2018, there were  5,486 insured depository institutions with total insured deposits of $7.4  trillion. FDIC administers the federal deposit insurance program through  its management of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which has two  primary purposes: (1) to insure the deposits and protect the depositors of  insured banks and (2) to resolve failed banks. FDIC manages the DIF by  determining the size of the fund and of the DIF reserve ratio (the ratio of  the fund balance to estimated insured deposits). The DIF is funded mainly  through quarterly risk-based assessments on insured depository  institutions, and it also earns interest income on its securities. The DIF  is reduced by the amount of losses and expenses associated with failed  banks and by FDIC operating expenses.", "The financial strength of the DIF can be gauged by comparing the fund\u2019s  actual reserve ratio to the minimum reserve ratio, and by measuring its  progress to the designated, or desired, reserve ratio. Section 334 of the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act increased  the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent and required  that the reserve ratio reach that level by September 30, 2020. To meet  these requirements, large banks paid temporary surcharges from the third  quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2018. In addition, under the  long-term DIF management plan, the FDIC Board of Directors set the  designated reserve ratio at 2.0 percent, with the goal of helping FDIC  maintain a stable insurance assessment rate and sustain a positive DIF  balance even during a serious economic downturn. In November 2018,  FDIC announced that the DIF reserve ratio had reached 1.36 percent (as  of September 30, 2018), exceeding the statutorily required minimum  reserve ratio of 1.35 percent ahead of the statutory deadline (September  30, 2020).", "Obligations of FDIC are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.  government. In addition, FDIC is authorized to borrow up to $100 billion  from the U.S. Treasury and issue and sell up to $100 billion in obligations to the Federal Financing Bank (see table 11). A statutory formula, known  as the maximum obligation limitation, limits the amount of obligations the  DIF can incur to the sum of its cash, 90 percent of the fair market value of  other assets, and the amount authorized to be borrowed from the U.S.  Treasury. The maximum obligation limitation for the DIF was $191.5  billion as of December 31, 2017.", "FDIC did not use its authority to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury  when the DIF was depleted and fell to negative $20.9 billion, its lowest  point in history, as a result of the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis. Instead,  FDIC first replenished the DIF through increased assessments and a one- time special assessment. These actions were taken pursuant to a  restoration plan established to replenish the DIF and raise the reserve  ratio to its designated minimum within the time limits prescribed by the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Finally, FDIC was able to improve the  liquidity of the DIF by requiring the banking industry to prepay its quarterly  risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the next 3  years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund", "paragraphs": ["The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) administers the  National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and provides up to $250,000  of insurance per depositor.

Other sources of income include premiums, when assessed as explained  below, and investment income. The financial performance of the Share  Insurance Fund can be measured by comparing the equity ratio to the  normal operating level (or desired equity ratio). The equity ratio is the total  of credit unions\u2019 contributions to the fund, less any gain or loss on  investments, plus accumulated retained earnings, divided by total insured  shares. By law, the equity ratio of the Share Insurance Fund cannot  decline below 1.20 percent and may not exceed 1.50 percent. If NCUA  expects the equity ratio to fall below this threshold, it must establish and  implement a restoration plan to rebuild the equity ratio, which must  include a premium assessment to each insured credit union.
