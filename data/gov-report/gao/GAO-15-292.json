GAO also found that officials' involvement and relationships with components varied significantly. DHS does not have a structure in place for overseeing the costs of 42 programs in sustainment (that is, programs that have been fielded and are operational) for which acquisition documentation requirements were waived in 2013. Sustainment costs can account for more than 80 percent of total costs, and all but one of these programs lack an approved cost estimate.

Specifically, PARM's fiscal year 2014 Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report (CASR), which was based on fiscal year 2013 data, contained inaccurate information on DHS acquisition programs. To develop the CASR, PARM drew from DHS's official system for acquisition program reporting, the Next Generation Periodic Reporting System (nPRS); however, the system is hampered by data issues, including inconsistent participation by program officials responsible for entering the data. Further, DHS has not provided useful information for certain CASR reporting requirements. DHS interpreted one requirement in a way that eliminated the need to report cost, schedule, or performance changes for almost half of the programs in the CASR. Holding programs accountable for maintaining their data in nPRS and providing decision makers with more in-depth information would enhance future acquisition reports and render the CASR a more effective instrument for DHS and congressional oversight.", "GAO Assessment of the DHS Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report Development Process"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS take a number of actions including developing written guidance for a consistent approach to oversight, addressing programs in sustainment, and enhancing data quality and reports to Congress.

Following are the four phases of the  acquisition life cycle, as established in DHS acquisition policy:  1.  Need: Department officials identify that there is a need, consistent  with DHS\u2019s strategic plan, justifying an investment in a new capability  and the establishment of an acquisition program to produce that  capability;  2.  Analyze/Select: A designated program manager reviews alternative  approaches to meeting the need and recommends a best option to  the acquisition decision authority;  3.  Obtain: The program manager develops, tests, and evaluates the  selected option. During this phase, programs may proceed through  acquisition decision event 2B, which focuses on the cost, schedule,  and performance parameters; and acquisition decision event 2C,  which focuses on low rate initial production; and  4.

Finally, DHS provided insufficient information to address  certain CASR reporting requirements. For example, the CASR did not  include annual planned procurement schedules containing estimates of  the units and/or increments for each program, although it was required to  do so."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data in DHS\u2019s Acquisition Program Reporting System Were Not Consistently Accurate", "paragraphs": ["For the nine programs in our review, we found that program offices did  not consistently enter and verify their data in nPRS. DHS established  nPRS as the system of record for acquisition program reporting in 2008,  and in 2012 the USM issued a memorandum to CAEs stating that  programs should make every effort to ensure that their data in nPRS is  complete, accurate, and valid on a monthly basis. According to the  memorandum, nPRS was intended to be a key tool for acquisition  program management, and help provide the capability to efficiently  assess the department\u2019s acquisition portfolio. DHS components have the  responsibility to ensure that their respective programs enter the data in  nPRS as required, and CAEs are required to ensure that the data is  validated and submitted in timely manner. However, we found that this  was not done consistently for the nine major acquisition programs in our  review, which are overseen by nine different DHS components.", "We examined nPRS data for the nine programs at two key points:  September 2013, the closing date for data for fiscal year 2013, and March  2014, the date when PARM issued its fiscal year 2014 CASR, which was  based on fiscal year 2013 program data. We found a number of problems  with the data. For example, as of September 2013, three programs we  reviewed did not enter expenditure data, the amount the programs  actually spent, in nPRS for fiscal year 2013 as required, and two of these  programs did not enter historical expenditure data at all.", "When we compared programs\u2019 entries of expenditure data over time, we  found additional discrepancies. As an example, the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s  Fast Response Cutter program\u2019s expenditure entries in nPRS increased  by more than $340 million from September 2013 to March 2014, even  though both of these entries were supposed to reflect fiscal year 2013  expenditures. A U.S. Coast Guard official stated that this increase was  due to a correction in the program\u2019s reported expenditures, to account for  all funds spent in fiscal year 2013 regardless of when those funds were  received. The official noted that the program\u2019s entry from September  2013 reflected only funds received in fiscal year 2013. However, the  reason for this change was not documented in nPRS. In another  example, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service\u2019s Verification  Modernization program\u2019s entries for total historical expenditures through  fiscal year 2012 decreased by almost $240 million when comparing these  data from September 2013 and March 2014. Figure 3 shows the  differences in reported expenditure data in nPRS for the Fast Response  Cutter and Verification Modernization programs.", "Large nPRS discrepancies such as these call into question the reliability  of the underlying data and whether DHS management has the information  it needs to provide oversight of major acquisition programs. PARM  officials have acknowledged ongoing issues with the data reported in  nPRS and noted that they are working to improve its quality. For example,  PARM provides a working group to the components to express their  views on the nPRS system and its processes. However, PARM officials  stated they do not have a mechanism to hold the programs accountable  for updating their data. Component and program officials told us that they  do not use nPRS for program management\u2014even though that was one  intended purpose of the system\u2014because the system is difficult to use  and does not meet their needs. For example, the OCIO National Capital  Region Infrastructure Operations program manager stated that his  program does not work with nPRS. For both September 2013 and March  2014, nPRS data fields for this program that were to be used to populate  the fiscal year 2014 CASR, such as the program description and last  acquisition review board date, were blank. Component and program  officials also stated that they use other internal tools, such as  spreadsheets, presentations, or project software for program  management purposes and to maintain current information. PARM has  not undertaken an effort to ascertain the root causes of why program  managers are not populating nPRS as required. As we have previously  reported, to be useful, performance information must meet users\u2019 needs  for completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, validity, and ease of  use. Unless DHS program managers consider nPRS to be a useful tool  for their own program management purposes, as intended, the problems  we found with inaccurate data are likely to persist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extensive Adjudication Process Did Not Correct Inaccuracies for Reported Life-Cycle Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["To further understand the reasons for program data inaccuracies in the  fiscal year 2014 CASR, we analyzed the steps that PARM undertakes as  part of an extensive adjudication process with the components regarding  the underlying nPRS data. We found that PARM\u2019s adjudication process  did not rectify key inaccuracies in the fiscal year 2014 CASR, specifically  regarding programs\u2019 life-cycle cost estimates. As a result, Congress may  not have received accurate program information. Prior to its release,  PARM conducts an extenstive adjudication process for the CASR  information, including reviews with program and various DHS  headquarters offices, in order to identify and address potential data  inconsistencies between the sources and draft report. This process began  in October after the close of the fiscal year and ended when the report  was published in March. We reviewed nPRS data from March 2014, the  date when PARM issued its fiscal year 2014 CASR (which is comprised  of fiscal year 2013 program data) to compare these data to what was  presented to Congress in the CASR. Figure 4 shows select elements of  the CASR development and adjudication process, along with our  assessment of those elements.", "The fiscal year 2014 CASR reported on a total of 82 major acquisition  programs. For four of the nine major acquisition programs in our review,  we found discrepancies between the CASR and nPRS for life-cycle cost  estimate data after the adjudication process, which should have  reconciled such inconsistencies. As an example of these discrepancies,  both across nPRS and between nPRS and the CASR, life-cycle cost  estimates for two programs differed even though the estimates were  associated with the same source and date. Another program, the  Electronic Health Record System, had three different life-cycle values  ranging from approximately $60 million to $80 million, a difference of over  35 percent, with two of those values presented in the CASR. Our analysis  of the data inconsistencies indicated that it was unclear whether  congressional CASR recipients received accurate program cost  information because there was no way to confirm which estimate was  correct or what the different estimates represented. PARM officials stated  that they are changing their process for the development of the next  CASR, which they expect to issue with the President\u2019s fiscal year 2016  budget submission, in an effort to more effectively match their reported  data to nPRS. Table 3 highlights discrepancies between the CASR and  nPRS for life-cycle cost estimate data for the four programs that we  reviewed.", "Further, PARM may have incorrectly included or excluded certain  programs in the CASR based on DHS\u2019s incomplete information on  program life-cycle costs. As we reported in 2014, unreliable cost  estimates have been an enduring challenge for DHS. PARM included  Level 1 and 2 programs from the MAOL in the CASR, as required, using  program life-cycle costs to determine program status. However, PARM  officials acknowledged that some programs\u2019 acquisition category levels  were incorrect in the CASR, and due to the lack of DHS approved life- cycle cost estimates, they would not know the scope of this issue. For  example, the CASR included program life-cycle cost estimate figures, but  did not indicate who approved these estimates (i.e., if they were approved  at the component or department level), or if anyone approved the  estimates at all. Because these cost figures may not accurately reflect the  actual life-cycle costs, programs may have been inappropriately included  or excluded from the CASR and ultimately not receive the appropriate  level of congressional oversight.", "We also found areas where additional explanation in the CASR would  have been helpful. For example, PARM listed the Electronic Health  Record System program in the CASR as a Level 2 program, while its  reported life-cycle cost estimate of approximately $70 million would  designate it a Level 3 program. PARM is not required to include Level 3  programs in the CASR. Electronic Health Record System officials  explained that the program was listed as Level 2 because DHS  management designated it as a \u201cspecial interest\u201d program in the MAOL,  which did make it eligible for inclusion in the CASR, but PARM did not  include this rationale in the CASR.", "In addition, program officials stated that the inflexibility of nPRS may  prevent the department from providing accurate program information in  the CASR. For example, officials from the National Protection and  Programs Directorate\u2019s Next Generation Network-Priority Service noted  difficulties in accurately reporting data on their program\u2019s increments in  nPRS. The officials stated that the program has multiple increments, each  with its own set of acquisition decision events. However, the program  reported one overall life-cycle cost estimate in nPRS, even though it has  estimates for each increment, because the system does not allow for the  inclusion of multiple estimates. Officials ultimately provided explanatory  comments in nPRS that noted the increment 1 estimate included only  acquisition costs while not specifying who approved the estimate, and  that PARM approved the increment 2 estimate in July 2013. Because  these incremental estimates were at different stages in their development,  combining them into a single estimate in nPRS, which PARM ultimately  reported in the CASR, did not provide Congress with an accurate picture  of the program\u2019s costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Did Not Provide Most Useful Information on Program Risks and Other Requirements for the CASR", "paragraphs": ["Of the 13 CASR reporting requirements, DHS provided insufficient  information for in-depth oversight for four of them, and in one case, DHS  did not comply with a reporting requirement. The first reporting  requirement was a rating of cost risk, schedule risk, and technical risk  associated with the program. PARM fulfilled this requirement by reporting  programs\u2019 top-five cost, schedule, and technical risks, instead of separate  ratings for each. However, this reporting was inconsistent. Programs  submitted these risks through DHS\u2019s Investment Management System,  but this system can contain more than five risks. As a result, program  officials stated that they did not know how PARM selected their top-five  risks for inclusion in the CASR. For example, the Strategic Air and Marine  Program listed nine risks in the system, but PARM only reported two risks  in the CASR. Further, the risk reporting in this section varied across the  programs in our review. For example:", "The Verification Modernization program had five risks, all of which  were technical.", "The Technology Infrastructure Modernization program used four  of its own risk categories, which do not track to the required cost,  schedule, and technical risks: reliability of systems; dependencies  and interoperability between this investment and others; security;  and business.", "The inconsistent risk reporting in this section prevents Congress from  making cost, schedule, and performance comparisons across DHS  programs.", "In addition, as part of a separate requirement for independent verification  and validation, PARM evaluated the overall risk of each program,  assigned each a numerical risk score, and published these scores in the  CASR. PARM officials computed these risk scores using a set of  weighted criteria. However, component and program officials told us that  they did not know how PARM evaluated the risk scores for their  respective programs. PARM, component, and program officials have  acknowledged that the CASR did not accurately reflect the cost,  schedule, and performance risks associated with the programs. PARM  officials were unable to provide us with the supporting data used to  generate the scores because they did not store this information in nPRS.  As a result, we were unable assess how PARM computed these scores  or determine the extent to which PARM\u2019s evaluation accurately reflected  program risks.", "Due to PARM\u2019s inability to provide us with supporting data, we reviewed  the Science and Technology Directorate\u2019s National Bio and Agro-Defense  Facility program\u2019s risk assessment in the CASR and found it lacked  details that could be useful to Congress and DHS management. PARM  gave the program a high risk score, in part, due to the lack of DHS  approval for the program\u2019s acquisition documents. A program official  stated, however, that the documents could not go forward for DHS  approval due to the program\u2019s lack of funding. The CASR did not contain  any clarifying explanation for the documents not being approved. Further  complicating the issue, the program\u2019s nPRS data in September 2013  conflicts with its CASR entry, and showed program documents approved  by DHS as early as 2009. Discrepancies such as this call into question  the value of the information DHS is providing to Congress in the CASR.  To gain more visibility into the reasons for these inconsistencies, we  reviewed the source documents for the National Bio and Agro-Defense  Facility program, provided to us by PARM, and found that the approval  dates for five out of six documents do not match what was listed in either  nPRS or the CASR. Table 4 compares the National Bio and Agro- Defense Facility program\u2019s reported document status according to nPRS  as of September 2013 and the CASR issued in March 2014, and the  source documents provided by PARM.", "In another example, in PARM\u2019s risk assessment of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Risk Mapping, Assessment and  Planning program, the CASR stated that the program was covered by the  USM\u2019s waiver of acquisition documents requirements and thus did not  include certain program data. However, an examination of nPRS showed  that, according to the system, the program had key documents, including  a mission needs statement and an acquisition program baseline approved  by DHS, which PARM did not list in the CASR and which could have  provided further information to decision makers.", "A second CASR reporting requirement was a program\u2019s planned  procurement schedule, including an estimate of the quantity to be  procured annually until completion. PARM did not comply with this  requirement. Instead, PARM provided the top-five contracts by dollar  value for each program, but these entries did not include procurement  quantity information for the programs. Some programs did report total  procurement quantities, but did not link these units to a schedule. PARM  officials noted that certain programs are not well-suited for reporting  procurement quantities, such as IT programs. However, in such cases,  the CASR should explain why no procurement quantities were listed.", "A third requirement was the reason for any significant changes in a  program\u2019s acquisition cost, quantity, or schedule from the prior annual  CASR. PARM officials interpreted these changes to only be those that  resulted in the submission of a new acquisition program baseline.  According to DHS acquisition policy, programs need to submit new  baselines when they breach defined cost, schedule, and performance  parameters defined in their original baseline. However, programs can  experience cost, quantity, or schedule changes that do not require a new  baseline. For example, the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility  program experienced a delay in its construction schedule. While this  program\u2019s baseline remains in place, the construction delay could impact  on-time delivery of the facility and is an example of a significant change  that could be reported in this section. In addition, the CASR included 38  programs without an approved acquisition program baseline; according to  PARM\u2019s guidance, the CASR would not include any cost, schedule, or  performance changes for these programs. By defining programs\u2019  significant changes as those that resulted in new baselines, PARM  eliminated the need to report on any cost, schedule, or performance  changes for almost half of the programs in the CASR, thereby limiting the  information available to Congress.", "Finally, we found that PARM did not include certain key program events  in the CASR, such as acquisition decision events or full operating  capability schedules. Such data, in addition to the acquisition program  baseline approval dates that PARM currently reports, would have  provided Congress with more robust information about the program  status. Table 5 lists these four CASR requirements and our assessment  of the information reported."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Effective, on-going oversight of DHS\u2019s broad portfolio of programs is  essential to ensure that programs are accountable for their performance  and that Congress and DHS decision makers receive useful, accurate,  and up-to-date information.

Furthermore, a consistent, defined approach  to oversight could limit overlap of responsibilities and give DHS more  insight into whether its acquisition programs are executing according to  cost, schedule, and performance goals.", "Likewise, as DHS acquisition programs move into the sustainment phase,  their costs continue to require monitoring. The USM\u2019s waiving of  documentation requirements for the 42 programs in sustainment in 2013  resulted in a lack of oversight of costs for these programs. As of yet, no  DHS office has been designated to take over monitoring those programs\u2019  operations and maintenance costs. Without an identified oversight body,  DHS lacks insight into those programs\u2019 performance and the execution of  their funding, which could potentially be billions of dollars. This is  particularly of concern given that only one program had an approved cost  estimate at the time of the waiver.", "Finally, DHS has not effectively communicated program status to  Congress through the CASR because it has provided out-of-date and  inaccurate information. Programs do not consistently report their own  data in nPRS, and components are not validating the information.  Although PARM\u2019s adjudication process may address some data issues,  data are not corrected in the source systems before being published in  the CASR. Further, while PARM has some flexibility in the implementation  of the CASR reporting requirements, in one case the requirement was not  met. In other cases, such as PARM\u2019s assessment of program risks, there  are opportunities for more transparency and clarity in the information  being transmitted to Congress.

We assessed (1) steps DHS has taken to improve  oversight and what gaps, if any, exist and (2) whether the data PARM  provides to DHS and congressional decision makers to carry out their  oversight responsibilities on program cost, schedule, and performance  are accurate and up-to-date.", "To answer these questions, we identified organizations within DHS, in  addition to PARM, that are responsible for oversight of major acquisitions  and determined their roles and responsibilities by analyzing DHS policies  and procedures, reviewing organizational charts, and interviewing policy,  budget, and acquisition oversight officials at the headquarters level.  Specifically, we reviewed DHS Acquisition Management Directive 102-01  (MD 102) and its associated guidebook\u2014DHS Instruction Manual 102-01- 001\u2014and the guidebook\u2019s 12 appendices.

To the extent possible,  we chose programs that have been identified as having \u201cconcerns/issues\u201d  or as being \u201cmonitored closely\u201d in PARM\u2019s high visibility meetings, which  include DHS senior leadership. In order to assess acquisition oversight  across the spectrum of DHS programs, we selected case study programs  with a variety of characteristics. We chose a mix of Level 1 and Level 2  programs, as defined in the fiscal year 2014 CASR, and included both IT  and non-IT programs. One of our nine case study programs, the  Electronic Health Record System, was classified as a Level 2 program in  the fiscal year 2014 CASR, but listed as a Level 3 program on the 2014  MAOL. We chose this program in order to examine the reasons for the  change and to determine the extent to which oversight varies for major  and non-major acquisition programs. Another factor used to select the  case studies was program risk, as measured by CASR risk scores. Risk  scores are included in the CASR\u2019s independent verification and validation  section and are derived from PARM\u2019s rating of program risk using a  standard set of criteria. We chose programs to include a mix of both high  and low CASR risk scores. For these case studies, we reviewed relevant  program documentation, such as acquisition decision memorandums, and  interviewed program officials.", "For the second objective, we collected and reviewed data from DHS\u2019s  official system of record for its acquisition programs, the Next Generation  Periodic Reporting System (nPRS), and compared that data to the fiscal  year 2014 CASR.

PARM then uses the program data in nPRS to help  generate its CASR.", "In order to assess the data reliability of nPRS, we reviewed select  acquisition program data from nPRS and compared this data to the  information contained in the CASR. Specifically, we used nPRS reports  for each of the nine case study programs from the end of fiscal year 2013,  when PARM pulled the program data from the system to begin generating  the fiscal year 2014 CASR. We then compared the data from those  reports to the issued CASR, as well as to the nPRS program reports from  March 2014\u2014the date that PARM released the CASR. The comparison of  those three sets of information allowed us to note discrepancies, including  missing data or outliers, between the system data and the issued data, as  well as if corrections were made to the system data following the release  of the report.", "We assessed various data elements from the nPRS program reports that  are used to generate the information contained in the CASR. We  reviewed data across a range of tabs contained in the nPRS program  reports such as general information, Acquisition Review Board history,  program status, budget and funding, acquisition program baseline  milestones, risk, and key documents. For each of the nine case study  programs, we assessed reports from the end of fiscal year 2013, as well  as March 2014, for a total of eighteen program reports. In addition, we  reviewed documents, such as the nPRS user manual and policies related  to data entry, and interviewed agency officials responsible for inputting  and reviewing the nPRS data.", "We determined that the nPRS data were not sufficiently reliable for our  purposes; however, we present the data for illustrative purposes only. For  example, for certain programs in our review, current and historical  expenditure data was missing. Another example from our analysis  showed differences in the life-cycle cost estimates for certain programs in  nPRS compared to those reported in the CASR. While the Under  Secretary for Management (USM) issued a memorandum that programs  are to update their nPRS data monthly, PARM officials recognized that  this does not happen consistently, and they acknowledged that there are  data accuracy issues with nPRS. In addition, when officials made updates  or changes to program-reported information due to the pending release of  the CASR, the programs were responsible for entering these updates or  changes into nPRS. Our analysis confirmed that certain programs in our  review did not update nPRS after going through the CASR reporting  process.", "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of nPRS and the CASR as tools for  DHS management and congressional oversight, we first reviewed the  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, which  established the provision for the USM to submit the CASR with the  President\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2015. In addition, we reviewed  Conference Report 112-331 for the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2012, which contained the information requirements for inclusion in the  CASR.
