The visits include evaluations of recent construction. Until 2019, FEMA's goal was to visit all communities considered to be high-risk every 5 years. However, FEMA did not meet this goal in Texas or Florida in 2008\u20132019 because of a lack of resources. Many high-risk communities received only one visit in this period, and some were not visited at all. Without regular monitoring, FEMA's ability to ensure communities comply with requirements is limited. FEMA and state specialists also are to close out records of these visits in FEMA's tracking system if they find no deficiencies or violations, or when the community has resolved any issues. However, in Florida and Texas GAO found that records for many visits remained open for several years, and FEMA staff were unsure whether this indicated unresolved deficiencies or incomplete recordkeeping. Unreliable recordkeeping hinders FEMA's ability to assess community compliance with NFIP requirements.", "After a flood, one key community responsibility is to assess whether flood damage on a property was substantial (50 percent or more of the property's value). In such cases, the community must ensure the properties are rebuilt to current NFIP standards. However, FEMA generally does not collect or analyze the results of these assessments, limiting its ability to ensure the process operates as intended. Furthermore, FEMA has not clarified how communities can access NFIP claims data. Such data would help communities target substantial damage assessments after a flood."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to FEMA: The agency should (1) assess different approaches for ensuring compliance with NFIP requirements, (2) ensure data on community visits are up-to-date and complete, (3) ensure communities collect data on substantial damage assessments, and (4) clarify policies on data sharing between FEMA and NFIP communities.

Seventeen days later, Hurricane Irma  became the strongest storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the  Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, and it caused an estimated $50 billion in  damage in Florida and other states. Homeowners with flood insurance  through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) were able to file  claims and receive funds to aid in their rebuilding efforts after the storms.  NFIP is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, and was  created to help reduce the cost of providing federal flood assistance to  repair damaged homes and businesses.

We conducted structured interviews with community floodplain  managers and emergency management coordinators, among others. For  the first objective, we analyzed the results of our structured interviews to  identify the challenges that community officials cited most frequently. For  the second objective, we analyzed FEMA\u2019s database of information from  its community assistance visits to determine the frequency of visits and to  understand unresolved deficiencies found during the visits. While these  data were sometimes incomplete, they generally were reliable for our  purposes of addressing frequency of visits and issues with deficiencies.

In eight of the 19  communities we visited, officials cited difficulties obtaining or retaining  sufficient staff to perform work such as conducting substantial damage  assessments or fulfilling CRS paperwork requirements. For example, one  floodplain official told us that after a major storm, the small floodplain  management office was overwhelmed with trying to inspect damaged  buildings to determine which would require rebuilding to current NFIP  standards. Another community we visited did not have a full-time  floodplain manager and relied on its building department, which is  responsible for issuing building permits, to implement NFIP requirements.

FEMA also may be hindered in its ability to  measure the effectiveness of substantial damage assessments, such as  the extent to which substantially damaged homes are rebuilt according to  NFIP requirements. It is especially important for FEMA to monitor  community compliance with the process for assessing substantially  damaged properties because this is the system FEMA uses to mitigate  flooded properties and reduce the risk of future losses. If FEMA does not  know how effectively this process operates, it could miss opportunities to  use the process to reduce the financial exposure of NFIP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Not Clarified How Communities Can Access NFIP Claims Data That Could Help Them after a Flood", "paragraphs": ["NFIP communities that we visited reported varying levels of access to  NFIP claims data and information. According to FEMA guidance, the  agency should provide local officials with information on their community  that includes the number of flood insurance policies in force, dollar  amount of coverage, and the number of claims. NFIP communities also  can access information on publicly available data on claims payouts.", "Officials in some communities we visited were able to access claims data  while officials in other communities were not. Some officials with whom  we spoke were unsure whether access was permissible. For example, an  NFIP community official in Texas said that FEMA told his office they could  not provide him with the data when he asked for it. Another Texas official  said that typically the communities do not have access to data on flood  losses and claims paid. In Florida, an official said that she was able to  access some data on NFIP claims in her area as long as the community  did not use the data to make substantial damage determinations.", "Community officials told us that it would be helpful for them to access  NFIP claims data after a flood. For example, a number of community  floodplain managers told us that having NFIP claims information from  FEMA would benefit their flood recovery efforts because it would allow  them to better target their substantial damage assessments and make  that process more efficient. Officials from other NFIP communities that we  visited stated that claims data could help them identify property owners  who were likely to start to rebuild and ensure they obtained permits,  which can be difficult to determine otherwise. Another group of  community officials said that claims data for their community indicated  NFIP paid out more than the community\u2019s own estimated value of the  insured homes in their community, indicating there may have been more  substantially damaged homes than they identified.", "FEMA officials acknowledged confusion among communities concerning  their access to NFIP claims data and said they have been working to  address it, noting that they must ensure compliance with the Privacy Act  of 1974, under which the agency can share certain data only with  organizations that have a programmatic need for the information.  Officials also said they have been working to streamline the process  through which NFIP communities can request claims data. For example,  they said they have been considering the most efficient methods for  sharing data with local communities that require post-disaster flood  information while protecting the privacy of the data. In addition, FEMA  officials said they have been drafting guidance\u2014which they expect to be  issued in 2020\u2014and a new form for community data requests. They said  their intent is that once communities are approved for access to a certain  type of data, they would not have to reapply for subsequent requests.  FEMA officials said the guidance will provide communities with access to  NFIP claims data on a property-by-property basis.", "Federal standards for internal control state that management should  externally communicate necessary quality information to achieve the  agency\u2019s objectives and address related risks. While FEMA has taken  positive steps toward reducing confusion surrounding communities\u2019  access to claims data, at the time of our review FEMA had not yet  finalized new guidance. As a result, we were unable to evaluate the  potential of these tools to effectively resolve communities\u2019 confusion over  appropriate access to claims information. Until FEMA clarifies the process  for communities to access claims data on properties within their  community, FEMA may be missing an opportunity to provide communities  with data that they would find helpful in the substantial damage  assessment process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FEMA relies on communities participating in NFIP to follow its floodplain  management requirements, which are designed to reduce the risk of flood  damage and the resulting cost to taxpayers. Community assistance visits  are the agency\u2019s primary tool for ensuring that communities implement  these requirements. However, in Texas and Florida FEMA often has not  conducted such visits to high-risk communities and lacks complete data  on the results. As a result, FEMA\u2019s ability to ensure that the communities  follow NFIP requirements is limited. In addition, FEMA does not have  ready access to data on substantially damaged properties and the related  documentation, which hinders its ability to determine if an NFIP  community has followed NFIP substantial damage assessment  procedures and correctly identified all substantially damaged homes.  This, in turn, limits FEMA\u2019s ability to evaluate NFIP\u2019s effectiveness.  Finally, confusion exists among some NFIP communities regarding their  access to NFIP claims data, potentially limiting the benefit such data  could provide to those communities in identifying substantially damaged  properties and ensuring all repairs of flood damage are done to NFIP  community standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of four recommendations to FEMA:  The Administrator of FEMA should assess different approaches, in  addition to community assistance visits, for using existing resources to  ensure communities\u2019 compliance with NFIP requirements.

This report focuses on NFIP  communities in Florida and Texas that were affected by Hurricanes Irma  and Harvey in 2017.", "For all three objectives, we reviewed FEMA guidance and regulations for  communities participating in NFIP and in FEMA\u2019s Community Rating  System. We interviewed officials from FEMA\u2019s Federal Insurance and  Mitigation Administration, as well as officials in two FEMA regional offices  in Georgia and Texas. We also visited 18 communities in Texas and  Florida, and an additional community in Louisiana, that were affected by  flooding in the 2017 hurricanes. We conducted structured interviews with  officials in these communities. We selected these communities to  represent a mix of large and small communities and because they  participate in FEMA\u2019s Community Rating System. The officials we  interviewed included floodplain managers, emergency management  coordinators, watershed managers, and representatives of homebuilder  associations. We also interviewed representatives of four national and  state floodplain associations, and three additional experts\u2014two academic  experts and a city official\u2014with significant knowledge of NFIP and  flooding issues.

To determine whether FEMA carries out the  community assistance visits in accordance with its own guidance, we  reviewed FEMA\u2019s guidance for specialists to prepare for, conduct, and  follow up on the visits. We also spoke with FEMA and other officials about  their experience with the visits to determine whether FEMA and state  specialists generally followed FEMA\u2019s guidance. To determine the extent  to which FEMA met its goal of visiting high-risk communities once every 5  years, we compared the data in the Community Information System on  community visits against the lists of Tier 1 (high-risk) and Tier 2 (lower- risk) communities provided by FEMA. We also analyzed the data to  determine the length of time that records from the community visits were  left open, and whether the records were complete. While we noted that  the data in the Community Information System were at times incomplete,  we found the data reliable enough to identify the frequency of community  assistance visits and issues with data entry.", "For our third objective, to examine how FEMA oversees community  implementation of NFIP requirements for conducting substantial damage  assessments, we reviewed FEMA policies and guidance, including NFIP  Floodplain Management Requirements outlined in 44 C.F.R.

We reviewed  FEMA data on the number of substantial damage assessments  performed in Florida and Texas after Hurricanes Irma and Harvey as well  as the number of damaged properties that received increased cost of  compliance funding. We discussed with community officials their  experiences conducting substantial damage assessments and the  challenges they faced in doing so. We also reviewed literature to identify  actions taken by NFIP communities after a flood, and we reviewed FEMA  documentation to determine the actions taken by FEMA and NFIP  communities after a flood.
