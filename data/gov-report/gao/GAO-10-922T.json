People attempting to obtain a U.S. passport illegally often seek to use the guise of a U.S. citizen to conceal their involvement with more serious crimes, such as terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, or murder. In March 2009, GAO reported on weaknesses in State's passport issuance process that could allow a terrorist or criminal to fraudulently acquire a genuine U.S. passport. Specifically, GAO easily obtained four genuine passports from State using counterfeit documents. In April 2009, GAO suggested that State take 5 corrective actions based on these undercover tests and State acknowledged those corrective actions. GAO was asked to perform additional proactive testing of State's passport issuance process to determine if it continues to be vulnerable to fraud. To do this work, GAO applied for seven U.S. passports using counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents, such as driver's licenses and birth certificates, to simulate scenarios based on identity theft. GAO created documents for seven fictitious or deceased individuals using off-the-shelf, commercially available hardware, software, and materials. Undercover investigators applied for passports at six U.S. Postal Service locations and one State-run passport office."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State's passport issuance process continues to be vulnerable to fraud, as the agency issued five of the seven passports GAO attempted to fraudulently obtain. While there were multiple indicators of fraud and identity theft in each application, State identified only two as fraudulent during its adjudication process and mailed five genuine U.S. passports to undercover GAO mailboxes. GAO successfully obtained three of these passports, but State had the remaining two recovered from the mail before they were delivered. According to State officials, the agency discovered--after its adjudication process--that the two passports were part of GAO testing when they were linked to one of the passport applications it initially denied. State officials told GAO that they used facial recognition technology--which they could have also used during the adjudication process--to identify the two remaining applications. GAO's tests show that State does not consistently use data verification and counterfeit detection techniques in its passport issuance process. Of the five passports it issued, State did not recognize discrepancies and suspicious indicators within each application. Some examples include: passport photos of the same investigator on multiple applications; a 62 year-old applicant using a Social Security number issued in 2009; passport and driver's license photos showing about a 10 year age difference; and the use of a California mailing address, a West Virginia permanent address and driver's license address, and a Washington, D.C. phone number in the same application. These were fraud indicators that should have been identified and questioned by State. State also failed to crosscheck the bogus citizenship and identity documents in the applications against the same databases that it later used to detect GAO's other fraudulent applications. State used facial recognition technology to identify the photos of GAO undercover investigators and to stop the subsequent delivery of two passports but not to detect fraud in the three applications that GAO received, which all contained a passport photo of the same investigator."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the results of our investigation of  the State Department\u2019s (State) passport issuance process. My testimony  today highlights the results of our most recent tests of this process, which  we have previously shown to be vulnerable to fraud. According to State,  over 13 million U.S. passports were issued in fiscal year 2009. U.S.  passports are one of the most sought after travel documents in the world,  allowing its holders entrance into the United States and visa-free passage  into many other countries. People attempting to obtain a U.S. passport  illegally are often seeking to use the guise of a U.S. citizen to conceal their  involvement with more serious crimes, such as terrorism, narcotics  trafficking, money laundering, and murder. For example, in December  2009, an alleged leader of a white supremacist gang was sentenced to 3  years in federal prison for making a false statement on a passport  application in order to flee a double-murder investigation.", "In March 2009, we reported on weaknesses in State\u2019s passport issuance  process that could allow a terrorist or criminal to fraudulently acquire a  genuine U.S. passport. Specifically, we easily obtained four genuine  passports from State using counterfeit and fraudulently obtained  documents. Over the years State has taken steps to protect against the  fraudulent use of U.S. passports by, for example, issuing only electronic  passports. However, terrorists and other criminals could still circumvent  these security measures by using stolen identities and fraudulent breeder  documents, such as birth certificates and drivers\u2019 licenses, to obtain  genuine passports. For example, in late 2006, State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic  Security initiated a multiyear investigation, uncovering a criminal  enterprise through which Jamaican and West African nationals bought  counterfeit New York City birth certificates to fraudulently obtain U.S.  passports. As a result, agents confiscated 17 fraudulently obtained U.S.  passports and intercepted 10 fraudulent passport applications. Further,  the fraudulent use of Puerto Rican birth certificates to obtain U.S.  passports was so widespread that in December 2009, the Puerto Rican  government enacted a law that invalidates all birth certificates issued  before July 1, 2010.", "This testimony responds to your request that we perform additional  proactive testing of State\u2019s passport issuance process to determine  whether it continues to be vulnerable to fraud. To perform this work, we  designed three test scenarios\u2014similar to those we used in our previous  testing\u2014that would simulate the actions of a malicious individual who had  access to another person\u2019s identity information, a practice commonly  known as identity theft. We then applied for seven genuine U.S. passports  and supported our applications with counterfeit or fraudulently obtained  documents, such as birth certificates and drivers\u2019 licenses, and the Social  Security numbers (SSN) and identities of fictitious or deceased  individuals. We fabricated these documents using publicly available  software, hardware, and materials.", "Our seven tests simulate an individual stealing another person\u2019s identity  and using it to obtain a passport. Five of our tests were based on  information and SSNs we had previously obtained from the Social Security  Administration (SSA) for the purpose of conducting undercover tests. One  of these included the identity and SSN of a five year old child to simulate a  malicious individual stealing the identity of a real child to get a passport.  Finally, in two other tests, we used the identities of individuals who died in  1966 and 1969. For six tests, we submitted our passport applications and  supporting materials at United States Postal Services (USPS) locations  that accept passport applications. For the other test, we submitted our  application and materials at State\u2019s regional Washington, D.C., passport- issuing office. We also briefed State officials on the results of our  investigation and discussed their actions on our tests.", "We conducted our work from January 2010 through July 2010 in  accordance with quality standards for investigations as set forth by the  Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A U.S. passport is not only a travel document but also an official  verification of the bearer\u2019s origin, identity, and nationality. Each day,  Americans submit them as identification to board international flights,  obtain drivers\u2019 licenses, cross the border from the United States into  Canada and Mexico, apply for loans, and verify their employability. To  acquire a U.S. passport for the first time, an applicant must provide  evidence of citizenship, or non-citizen nationality, such as a certificate of  birth in the United States or a naturalization certificate, and a valid  government-issued identification document that includes a photograph or  physical description of the holder (most commonly a state-issued driver\u2019s  license or identity card).", "Most passport applications are submitted by mail or in-person at one of  almost 9,400 passport application acceptance facilities nationwide. The  passport acceptance agents at these facilities are responsible for, among  other things, verifying whether an applicant\u2019s identification document  matches the applicant. Then, through adjudication, passport examiners  determine whether State should issue each applicant a passport.  Adjudication requires the examiner to scrutinize identification and  citizenship documents presented by applicants to verify their identity and  U.S. citizenship or non-citizen nationality.", "Since 2005, we have issued several reports on fraud vulnerabilities within  the passport issuance process and the subsequent actions taken by State  to prevent individuals from fraudulently securing passports. For example,  we reported that identity theft was among the most common means used  to commit passport fraud. In March 2009, we reported that our covert  testing of State\u2019s passport issuance process demonstrated how malicious  individuals might use identity theft to obtain genuine U.S. passports.  Through our work, we have identified two major areas of vulnerability in  State\u2019s passport issuance process.", "Passport acceptance agents and passport examiners have accepted  counterfeit or fraudulently acquired genuine documents as proof of  identification and citizenship. We reported in March 2009 that State  issued four genuine U.S. passports to GAO investigators, even though  the applications that we submitted contained bogus information and  were supported by counterfeit drivers\u2019 licenses and birth certificates.  The sheer variety of documents that are eligible to prove citizenship  and identity also complicate State\u2019s verification efforts.", "State\u2019s limited access to information from other federal and state  agencies hampers its ability to ensure that supporting documents  belong to the bearer. In 2005 we reported that the information State  used from SSA to corroborate SSNs was limited and outdated.  Although State and SSA had signed a memorandum in April 2004 giving  State access to SSA\u2019s main database, the memorandum had not been  implemented. Moreover, the memorandum did not include access to  SSA\u2019s death records, though State officials said they were exploring  the possibility of obtaining these records. Yet, in one case from our  covert testing in 2009, we obtained a U.S. passport using the SSN of a  man who died in 1965. In response to our prior findings, State officials  said that the lack of an automated check against SSA death records  was a long-standing vulnerability, but noted that Passport Services had  recently purchased a subscription to the Death Master File, which  included weekly updates of deaths recorded by SSA. State also  indicated that federal agencies limit its access to records due to  privacy concerns and the fact that State is not a law enforcement  agency. For example, it could not conduct real-time authentication of  the birth certificates presented by passport applicants. The agency  added that these documents present an exceptional challenge to fraud  detection efforts, due to the thousands of different acceptable formats  that the documents can be presented in. It further indicated that there  are also difficulties with verifying the authenticity of drivers\u2019 licenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Covert Testing of State\u2019s Passport Issuance Process Shows That Vulnerabilities Remain", "paragraphs": ["State\u2019s passport issuance process continues to be vulnerable to fraud, as  the agency issued five of the seven passports GAO attempted to  fraudulently obtain.

State officials indicated that  they then uncovered GAO\u2019s undercover tests by crosschecking the  fraudulent Florida birth certificate with the state\u2019s Bureau of Vital  Statistics.", "After State discovered our undercover test, the agency used methods and  resources not typically utilized to detect fraud during the normal passport  adjudication process to identify our remaining tests. For example,  according to State officials, they subsequently identified the two remaining  GAO applications by using facial recognition technology to search for the  photos of the applicants, who were our undercover investigators.
