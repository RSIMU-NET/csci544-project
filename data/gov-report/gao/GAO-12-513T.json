In contrast to other BRAC rounds that were primarily focused on achieving savings by reducing excess infrastructure, the Secretary of Defense identified three goals for BRAC 2005. Specifically, BRAC 2005 was intended to (1) transform the military, (2) foster jointness, and (3) reduce excess infrastructure to produce savings. These goals and the primary selection criteria\u0092s focus on enhancing military value led DOD to identify numerous recommendations that were designed to be transformational and enhance jointness, thereby adding to the complexity the BRAC Commission and DOD faced in finalizing and implementing the recommendations. Some transformational-type recommendations needed sustained attention by DOD and significant coordination and planning among multiple stakeholders. To improve oversight of implementation of the recommendations, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) required business plans for each BRAC 2005 recommendation to better manage implementation. In addition, DOD developed recommendations that were interdependent on each other. However, this led to challenges across multiple recommendations when delays in completing one recommendation led to delays in completing others. Specifically, DOD had to synchronize the relocations of over 123,000 people with about $24.7 billion in new construction or renovation at installations. Given the complexity of some BRAC recommendations, OSD directed the services to periodically brief it on implementation challenges. Furthermore, the scale of BRAC 2005 posed a number of challenges to the Commission as it conducted its independent review. For example, it reported that DOD\u0092s recommendations were of unprecedented scope and complexity, compounding the difficulty of its review. Moreover, the interdependent nature of some recommendations made it difficult for the Commission to evaluate the effect on installations that were both gaining and losing units simultaneously. Finally, the effect on communities from installation growth has led to challenges. For example, communities experiencing growth were hindered in their ability to effectively plan for off-base support such as adequate roads and schools due to inconsistent information from DOD around the 2007 time frame.", "DOD\u0092s fiscal year 2011 BRAC 2005 budget submission to Congress shows that costs to implement the BRAC recommendations grew from $21 billion originally estimated by the BRAC Commission in 2005 dollars to about $35.1 billion in current dollars, an increase of about $14.1 billion, or 67 percent. In constant 2005 dollars, costs increased to $32.2 billion, an increase of 53 percent. Costs increased mostly due to military construction as DOD identified the need for new and renovated facilities to enhance capabilities. In 2005, the Commission estimated net annual recurring savings of $4.2 billion and a 20-year net present value savings by 2025 of $36 billion. GAO\u0092s analysis shows annual recurring savings are now about $3.8 billion, a decrease of 9.5 percent, while the 20-year net present value savings are now about $9.9 billion, a decrease of 73 percent. As such, DOD will not recoup its up-front costs until 2018."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) latest round of base realignments and closures (BRAC),  commonly referred to as BRAC 2005. GAO has two long-standing roles in  the BRAC process. First, as requested by congressional committees for  the 1988 BRAC round and mandated by law since 1990, we have served  as an independent and objective observer of the BRAC process and have  assessed and reported on DOD\u2019s decision-making processes leading up  to proposed realignment and closure recommendations. We have  operated in a real-time setting and had access to significant portions of  the process as it evolved. Second, once the recommendations became  binding, our role has been to review DOD\u2019s efforts to implement the  recommendations, just as we routinely review the efficiency and  effectiveness of many other congressionally mandated or authorized  programs across the government. As such, we have issued about 50  reports related to the BRAC 2005 round and prior BRAC rounds since  1989 (see related GAO products at the end of this testimony) in addition  to our statutorily required report providing a detailed analysis of the BRAC  2005 selection process and the Secretary of Defense\u2019s proposed  realignment and closure recommendations to the BRAC Commission.", "DOD has faced long-term challenges in managing its portfolio of facilities,  halting degradation of facilities, and reducing unneeded infrastructure to  free up funds to better maintain the facilities it still uses and to meet other  needs. DOD has about 500 permanent installations in the United States  that comprise more than 300,000 buildings and about 200,000 other  structures with a replacement value of more than $800 billion. Costs to  build and maintain the defense infrastructure represent a significant  financial commitment. However, closing unneeded defense facilities has  historically been difficult because of public concern about the economic  effects of closures on communities, the perceived lack of impartiality of  the decision-making process, and legal requirements. DOD\u2019s  management of its support infrastructure is on our high-risk list, in part  due to the challenges DOD faces in eliminating unneeded infrastructure.  The BRAC process is designed to overcome obstacles to eliminating  unneeded infrastructure and to help DOD match needed infrastructure to  the force structure and to support military missions.  We reported in 2005  that DOD established and generally followed a logical and reasoned  process for formulating its BRAC 2005 recommendations.", "As the Secretary of Defense testified before both the Senate and House  Armed Services Committees 3 weeks ago, the President will request  Congress to again authorize the BRAC process, for 2013 and 2015. The  Secretary acknowledged that the BRAC process is controversial but  stated that it is the only effective way to achieve needed infrastructure  savings, and that the upcoming request comes as a result of DOD plans  to reduce its force structure.", "As directed by the House Armed Services Committee in its report  accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for 2008, we have  been reviewing BRAC 2005 to monitor implementation of the  recommendations and identify lessons that could be used to improve  future BRAC rounds should Congress authorize additional rounds. My  testimony today is based on work completed to date, and I will identify (1)  key factors and challenges that contributed to BRAC 2005  implementation and results and (2) the most-recent estimated costs and  savings attributable to BRAC 2005. We will also be reporting on lessons  learned from the BRAC 2005 round later this year.", "To identify some of the key factors and challenges that contributed to  BRAC 2005 implementation and results, we reviewed our previous work  and key documents related to BRAC 2005, such as BRAC business plans  that laid out the actions and timing of those actions to implement the  recommendations, briefings prepared by the military services on the  implementation status of the recommendations, and other key  documents. We interviewed the Chairman of the 2005 BRAC Commission  and members of the Commission\u2019s executive staff, key military  department officials involved in BRAC 2005, and the former Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) who oversaw  BRAC 2005 when DOD developed the recommendations that were sent  to the Commission. We also interviewed representatives of five of the  seven joint cross-service groups: Headquarters and Support Activities,  Industrial, Medical, Supply and Storage, and Technical. We performed  our work at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Basing  Directorate; the military departments; and other relevant offices.", "To identify the current estimated costs and savings, we used DOD\u2019s  annual BRAC 2005 budget submissions to Congress to conduct our  analyses of BRAC costs and savings. To evaluate changes in projected  net annual recurring savings from the BRAC Commission\u2019s original  estimates in 2005 through to fiscal year 2011, we used data OSD  provided on estimated savings in fiscal year 2012 because these data  more fully captured the expected savings. We calculated the 20-year net  present value savings by applying the same formulas and discount rate of  2.8 percent that the BRAC Commission used in 2005 to calculate the  savings. Although the Office of Management and Budget prescribes the  use of slightly different assumptions to calculate these estimates today,  we used the factors and assumptions used by the BRAC Commission for  consistency. To assess the reliability of DOD\u2019s BRAC cost and savings  data, we tested computer-generated data for errors, reviewed relevant  documentation, and discussed data quality control procedures with  officials at the OSD Basing Directorate. We determined that the data used  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of addressing the objectives of  this testimony. We performed this work from March 2011 to March 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

DOD was required to propose the  selection criteria to be used to develop and evaluate the candidate  recommendations, consistent with considerations specified in the statute  authorizing BRAC 2005. The criteria were to be made available for public  comment in the Federal Register. Congress subsequently codified the  eight final BRAC selection criteria used in BRAC 2005. The BRAC  statute directed GAO to evaluate the selection criteria. Figure 1 displays  the eight criteria. Importantly, Congress specified that the first four criteria  relating to enhancing military value were to be the priority criteria.", "DOD developed a force structure plan and infrastructure inventory.  Congress required the Secretary of Defense to develop and submit to  Congress a force structure plan laying out the numbers, size, and  composition of the units that constitute U.S. defense forces\u2014for example,  divisions, ships, and air wings\u2014based on the Secretary\u2019s assessment of  the probable national security threats over the ensuing 20 year period,  and an inventory of global military installations. The BRAC statute  directed GAO to evaluate the force structure plan and infrastructure  inventory.", "Secretary of Defense was required to provide certain certifications. On  the basis of the force structure plan, infrastructure inventory, and  accompanying analyses, the Secretary of Defense was required to certify  whether the need existed for the closure or realignment of military  installations. If the Secretary certified that the need existed, he was also  required to certify that the round of closures and realignments would  result in annual net savings for each of the military departments beginning  not later than fiscal year 2011. The BRAC statute directed GAO to  evaluate the need for the 2005 BRAC round.", "DOD began to develop options for closure or realignment  recommendations. The military departments developed service-specific  installation closure and realignment options. In addition, OSD established  seven joint cross-service teams, called joint cross-service groups, to  develop options across common business-oriented functions, such as  medical services, supply and storage, and administrative activities. These  closure and realignment options were reviewed by DOD\u2019s Infrastructure  Executive Council\u2014a senior-level policy-making and oversight body for  the entire process. Options approved by this council were submitted to  the Secretary of Defense for his review and approval. DOD developed  hundreds of closure or realignment options for further analysis, which  eventually led to DOD\u2019s submitting over 200 recommendations to the  BRAC Commission for analysis and review. The BRAC statute directed  GAO to analyze the recommendations of the Secretary and the selection  process, and we issued our report to the congressional defense  committees on July 1, 2005.", "BRAC Commission performed an independent review of DOD\u2019s  recommendations. After DOD selected its base closure and realignment  recommendations, it submitted them to the BRAC Commission, which  performed an independent review and analysis of DOD\u2019s  recommendations. The Commission could approve, modify, reject, or add  closure and realignment recommendations. Also, the BRAC Commission  provided opportunities to interested parties, as well as community and  congressional leaders, to provide testimony and express viewpoints. The  Commission then voted on each individual closure or realignment  recommendation, and those that were approved were included in the  Commission\u2019s report to the President. In 2005, the BRAC Commission  reported that it had rejected or modified about 14 percent of DOD\u2019s  closure and realignment recommendations.", "President approved BRAC recommendations. After receiving the  recommendations, the President was to review the recommendations of  the Secretary of Defense and the Commission and prepare a report by  September 23, 2005, containing his approval or disapproval of the  Commission\u2019s recommendations as a whole. Had the President  disapproved of the Commission\u2019s recommendations, the Commission  would have had until October 20, 2005, to submit a revised list of  recommendations to the President for further consideration. If the  President had not submitted a report to Congress of his approval of the  Commission\u2019s recommendations by November 7, 2005, the BRAC  process would have been terminated.

Since Congress did not pass such a resolution, the  recommendations became binding in November 2005.", "Congress established clear time frames for implementation.

Specifically, BRAC 2005 was intended to transform  the military, foster jointness, and reduce excess infrastructure to produce  savings. These goals and the primary selection criteria\u2019s focus on  enhancing military value led DOD to identify numerous recommendations  that were designed to be transformational and enhance jointness, thereby  adding to the complexity the Commission and DOD faced in finalizing and  implementing the BRAC recommendations. Some key challenges that  have confronted or continue to confront DOD or the Commission in  regard to BRAC 2005 are as follows.", "Some transformational-type BRAC recommendations required sustained  senior leadership attention and a high level of coordination among many  stakeholders to complete by the required date. The consolidation of  supply, storage, and distribution functions within the Defense Logistics  Agency is an example of an atypical use of the BRAC process. The  supply, storage, and distribution BRAC recommendation is  transformational because it focuses on complex business process  reengineering efforts involving the transfer of personnel and management  functions. As we previously reported, the Defense Logistics Agency was  faced with the potential for disruptions to depot operations during  implementation of the BRAC consolidation recommendation and took  certain steps we have identified as best practices to minimize the  potential for disruption. These included committing sustained high-level  leadership and including relevant stakeholders in an organizational  structure to address implementation challenges as they arose. To  implement the BRAC recommendations, the agency had to develop  strategic agreements with the services that ensured that all stakeholders  agreed on its plans for implementation, and had to address certain human  capital and information technology challenges.", "Similarly, another type of transformational BRAC recommendation that  required sustained senior leadership attention was the establishment of  the Navy\u2019s Fleet Readiness Centers. DOD expects this BRAC  recommendation to produce significant savings; however, as we  reported, this BRAC recommendation required sustained senior  leadership attention to ensure effective completion. Our prior work states  that sustained leadership is necessary to achieve workforce  reorganizations and agency goals.", "Implementation of some transformational BRAC recommendations\u2014 especially those where a multitude of organizations and units all had roles  to play to ensure the achievement of the goals of the recommendation\u2014 illustrated the need to involve key stakeholders and effective planning.  For example, to transform the reserve forces in many states, the Army  had planned to implement 44 BRAC recommendations to construct   125 new Armed Forces Reserve Centers by September 15, 2011.", "As we previously reported, the Army identified several potential  challenges, including completing all of the construction within the  statutory implementation period, changing force structure and mission  requirements that could affect the capacity of the new centers, and  realizing efficiencies based on limited testing of new construction  processes. Conversely, as we also previously reported, the Air Force  used a consultative process that involved stakeholders to assign new  missions to units that would lose flying missions as a result of 37 BRAC  recommendations affecting 56 Air National Guard installations. As a  result of this consultative process, Air National Guard units affected by  BRAC 2005 were assigned replacement missions, of which 83 percent  were highest priority, mission-critical missions, or a new flying mission.  However, implementation of these BRAC recommendations led to other  challenges that required significant stakeholder coordination. These  challenges included the capacity of Air National Guard headquarters to  develop new unit staffing documents, the need to retrain personnel for an  intelligence mission at a rate that exceeded the capacity of the relevant  school, and that Air National Guard Headquarters had not identified  bridge missions for all units that will face a delay between losing their old  flying mission and the startup of their replacement mission.", "Establishing a specific organizational structure to overcome likely  obstacles and help achieve desired goals. OSD emphasized the need for  joint cross-service groups to analyze common business-oriented  functions for BRAC 2005, an approach made more important by the  desire to develop transformational BRAC recommendations. As with the  1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds, these joint cross-service groups performed  analyses and developed closure and realignment options in addition to  those developed by the military services. However, our evaluation of  DOD\u2019s 1995 round indicated that the joint cross-service groups submitted  options through the military services for approval, resulting in few being  approved. Conversely, the number of BRAC recommendations developed by the joint cross-service groups increased significantly in the  BRAC 2005 round. This was due, in part, to high-level leadership  ensuring that the options were reviewed by a DOD senior-level group,  known as the Infrastructure Steering Group, rather than the military  services. As shown in figure 3, the Infrastructure Steering Group was  placed organizationally on par with the military departments.", "DOD had to develop BRAC oversight mechanisms to improve  accountability for implementation of the BRAC recommendations. For the  first time, OSD required the military departments to develop business  plans to better inform OSD of financial and status of implementation  details for each of the BRAC 2005 recommendations and to facilitate  OSD oversight. These business plans included information such as a  listing of all actions needed to implement each recommendation;  schedules for personnel relocations between installations; and updated  cost and savings estimates by DOD based on more accurate and current  information. This approach permitted senior-level intervention if warranted  to ensure completion of the BRAC recommendations by the statutory  completion date. Additionally, OSD recognized that the business plans  would serve as the foundation for the complex program management  necessary to implement the particularly complex transformational BRAC  2005 recommendations, and to delineate resource requirements and  generate military construction requirements.", "Interdependent recommendations affected DOD\u2019s ability to meet the  statutory deadline. Many of the BRAC 2005 recommendations were  interdependent and had to be completed in a sequential fashion within the  statutory implementation period. In cases where interdependent  recommendations required multiple relocations of large numbers of  personnel, delays in completing one BRAC recommendation had a  cascading effect on the implementation of other recommendations.  Specifically, DOD had to synchronize the relocations of over 123,000  people with about $24.7 billion in new construction or renovation.  Commission officials told us that unlike prior BRAC rounds where each  base was handled by a single integrated recommendation, in BRAC  2005, many installations were simultaneously affected by multiple  interconnected BRAC recommendations. For example, as we have  previously reported, as part of the BRAC recommendation to close Fort  Monmouth, New Jersey, personnel from the Army\u2019s Communications- Electronics Life Cycle Management Command located at Fort Monmouth  were to relocate to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. To  accommodate the incoming personnel from Fort Monmouth, Army  officials planned to renovate facilities that were occupied at the time by a  training activity that was to relocate to Fort Lee, Virginia, as part of  another BRAC recommendation. However, delays in completing new  facilities at Fort Lee delayed the relocation of the training activity from  Aberdeen, which in turn delayed the renovation of the Aberdeen facilities  to support the Fort Monmouth closure. Similarly, two buildings at Fort  Belvoir, Virginia, were to house certain Army organizations moving from  leased space as part of a BRAC recommendation. However, the buildings  at Fort Belvoir were occupied at the time by the Army Materiel Command,  which was to relocate to Huntsville, Alabama, as part of another BRAC  recommendation. Construction delays at the Huntsville location delayed  the command\u2019s ability to move, which in turn delayed renovation of the  space they were to vacate, consequently holding up the ability of the new  occupants to relocate from the leased space. Given the complexity of  these interdependent recommendations, OSD required the military  services and defense agencies to periodically brief it on implementation  challenges and progress.", "Some complex sets of individual actions were combined within individual  BRAC recommendations, complicating the Commission\u2019s review process.  The scale of BRAC 2005 posed a number of challenges to the  Commission as it did its independent review. First, the Commission  reported that it assessed closure and realignment recommendations of  unprecedented scope and complexity. Further, the executive staff of the  BRAC Commission told us that their task was made more difficult and  complex because many of the proposed recommendations put forward for  BRAC 2005 represented the DOD goals of furthering transformation and  fostering jointness, in addition to the more traditional base closures and  realignments. Moreover, many of the proposed BRAC recommendations  that DOD presented to the Commission for review were made up of  multiple individual actions, unlike prior rounds in which each base was  handled by a single integrated recommendation, according to the BRAC  Commission. The executive staff of the Commission also told us that it  was more difficult to assess the costs and the amount of time for the  savings to offset implementation costs since many of the  recommendations contained multiple interdependent actions, all of which  needed to be reviewed. Table 1 compares the number of individual  actions embedded within the BRAC 2005 recommendations with the  number of similar actions needed to implement the recommendations in  the prior rounds. The table shows that the number of individual BRAC  actions was larger in BRAC 2005 (813) than that from the four prior  BRAC rounds combined (387).", "Large size of BRAC 2005 may have contributed to the challenges  confronting the Commission. The Commission executive staff that we  interviewed said that they would have benefited from expertise built up  during the multiple successive smaller BRAC rounds that occurred in  1991, 1993, and 1995, since the Commission staff stayed in place from  one round to the next. However, because 10 years had elapsed since the  last BRAC round, many Commission staff were new to BRAC in 2005 and  had steep learning curves. This may have been compounded by the large  number and variety of BRAC actions DOD presented to them for review.  For example, the Commission reported that it struggled to fully  understand the net impact on bases that were both gaining and losing  missions at the same time, as in the interdependent BRAC  recommendations discussed above. While the Commission had the  authority to modify a BRAC recommendation, the Commission staff  expressed concern that rejecting one action of a recommendation could  potentially set off a cascade of effects rippling across several other  proposed recommendations because of the interdependency of the  individual actions.", "The effect on communities from installation growth has led to challenges  for the communities to ensure the provision of adequate services to the  installation. DOD\u2019s Office of Economic Adjustment and DOD have  devoted more resources to communities experiencing significant growth  as a result of the consolidation that occurred under BRAC 2005. This is a  change from prior BRAC rounds, when Office of Economic Adjustment  assistance was more focused on helping communities cope with the  closure of an installation than its growth. While some of the growth is  attributable to initiatives other than BRAC, including increases in Army  and Marine Corps force structure after 2007 and plans to rebase some  overseas forces to the United States, BRAC has contributed with the  transfer of about 123,000 positions from one installation to another within  the 6-year BRAC implementation period. As we have previously reported,  communities experiencing growth were hindered in their ability to  effectively plan for off-base support such as adequate roads and schools  due to inconsistent information from DOD around the 2007 time frame.  Further, DOD has missed opportunities to offer high-level leadership to  communities affected by the growth, suggesting the need for more  attention to this issue if a future set of BRAC recommendations leads to  installation growth rather than closure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs to Implement BRAC 2005 Increased as Estimated Savings Decreased", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2011 BRAC 2005 budget submission to  Congress and each annual submission throughout the BRAC 2005  implementation period shows that one-time implementation costs grew  from $21 billion originally estimated by the BRAC Commission in 2005 to   In  about $35.1 billion, an increase of about $14.1 billion, or 67 percent.constant 2005 dollars, costs increased to about $32.2 billion, an increase  of 53 percent. According to an OSD analysis of the increase in costs,  about $10 billion of the increase was attributable to construction for  additional facilities, increasing total military construction costs to about  $24.7 billion. In contrast, military construction costs for the four prior  BRAC rounds combined amounted to less than $7 billion. In a March  2010 testimony, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and  Environment) characterized the military construction for BRAC 2005 as a  major engine of recapitalization. Other reasons for the cost increases  include inflation and increased operations and maintenance,  environmental restoration, and other costs.", "Some cost increases have been attributed to unexpected expenses. For  example, DOD\u2019s cost to implement the recommendation to close the  Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and relocate medical  care functions to the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland,  and Fort Belvoir, Virginia, increased from about $989 million to about $2.7  billion due to higher military construction costs and other higher than  anticipated costs for moving and purchasing equipment, as we previously   Moreover, military construction costs to close Fort Monmouth,  reported. New Jersey, increased by $613.2 million from the BRAC Commission  estimate. One part of this recommendation included relocating the U.S.  Army Military Academy Preparatory School from Fort Monmouth to West  Point, New York, and part of the reason for the cost growth was that the  scope of the facility construction increased from approximately 80,000  square feet to more than 250,000 square feet, and planning officials  identified the need to spend additional money for rock removal needed for  site preparation.", "GAO, Military Base Realignments and Closures: Estimated Costs Have Increased While  Savings Estimates Have Decreased Since Fiscal Year 2009, GAO-10-98R (Washington,  D.C.: Nov. 13, 2009).", "9.5 percent decrease from the Commission\u2019s estimate.

For example, the Commission  approved 30 recommendations that were based on perceived high  military value and were not expected to result in 20-year payback.

In contrast, only four recommendations DOD  developed in all four prior BRAC rounds combined were not expected to  result in a 20-year payback.
