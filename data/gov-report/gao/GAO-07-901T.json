The data show that for 2002 to 2005 the most significant differences in average appraisal ratings were among African-Americans at all bands for most years compared with Caucasian analysts. Furthermore, the rating data for entry level staff show a difference in ratings for African-Americans in comparison to Caucasian staff at the entry-level from the first rating, with the gap widening in subsequent ratings. These differences are inconsistent with the concerted effort to hire analysts with very similar qualifications, educational backgrounds, and skill sets. In June 2006, we held an Senior Executive Service (SES) off-site meeting specifically focusing on concerns regarding the performance ratings of our African-American staff. Shortly thereafter, the Comptroller General decided that in view of the importance of this issue, GAO should undertake an independent, objective, third-party assessment of the factors influencing the average rating differences between African-Americans and Caucasians. We should approach our concern about appraisal ratings for African-Americans with the same analytical rigor and independence that we use when approaching any engagement. We must also be prepared to implement recommendations coming out of this review. Additional Efforts to Enhance Diversity Are Needed and Planned While we continue to have a major challenge regarding the average performance ratings of African-Americans, the percentages of African-Americans in senior management positions at GAO have increased in the last several years. GAO believes that the O&I monitoring reviews, direct access to top GAO management, and the other safeguards have played a significant role in these improvements. Specifically, from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2007, the percentage of African-American staff in the SES/Senior Level (SL) increased from 7.1 percent to 11.6 percent, and at the Band III level the percentages increased from 6.7 percent to 10.8 percent. Furthermore, the percentages of African-Americans in senior management positions at GAO compare favorably to the governmentwide percentages. While the percentage of African-Americans at the SES/SL level at GAO was lower than the governmentwide percentage in 2000, by September 2006, the GAO percentage had increased and exceeded the governmentwide percentage. At the Band III/GS-15 level, the percentage of African-American staff at GAO exceeded the governmentwide percentage in 2000 as well as in 2006. Nonetheless, as an agency that leads by example, additional steps should be taken."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Good Morning. I am Ron Stroman, the Managing Director of the Office of  Opportunity and Inclusiveness at the United States Government  Accountability Office (GAO). I am pleased to be here today to discuss  some of the steps we have taken to help enhance diversity and create a fair  and inclusive workplace at GAO. In these efforts, we are all affected by the  world we live in. Discrimination and intolerance are an unfortunate and  continuing reality in our country. Overcoming these barriers is more than  a professional responsibility for me. I have stood outside the Rayburn  House Office building wearing a suit and a tie during the middle of the day  trying to hail a cab only to have that cab driver pass me by in order to pick  up a white person standing less than five feet behind where I stood.  My  son has been stopped by the police repeatedly while driving because he  was driving through a community that the police didn\u2019t think he belonged  in.

He wanted to create a  work environment where differences are valued and all employees are  offered the opportunity to reach their full potential and maximize their  contributions to the agency\u2019s mission.  In 2001, the Comptroller General  changed the name of the Office of Civil Rights to the Office of Opportunity  and Inclusiveness and gave the office responsibility for creating a fair and  inclusive work environment by incorporating diversity principles in GAO\u2019s  strategic plan and throughout our human capital policies. Along with this  new strategic mission, the Comptroller General changed organizational  alignment of the Office of Opportunity and Inclusiveness by having the  office report directly to him. Also, in 2001, I was selected as the first  Managing Director of the Office of Opportunity and Inclusiveness.", "The Office of Opportunity and Inclusiveness (O&I) is the principal adviser  to the Comptroller General on diversity and equal opportunity matters.", "The office manages GAO\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)  program, including informal precomplaint counseling, and GAO\u2019s formal  discrimination complaint process. We also operate the agency\u2019s early  resolution and mediation program by helping managers and employees  resolve workplace disputes and EEO concerns without resorting to the  formal process. In addition, O&I monitors the implementation of GAO\u2019s  disability policy and oversees the management of GAO\u2019s interpreting  service for our deaf and hard-of-hearing employees. But effective efforts to  create a diverse, fair, and inclusive work place require much more.", "In furtherance of a more proactive approach, O&I monitors, evaluates, and  recommends changes to GAO\u2019s major human capital policies and  processes including those related to recruiting, hiring, performance  management, promotion, awards, and training.  These reviews are  generally conducted before final decisions are made in an effort to provide  reasonable assurance that GAO\u2019s human capital processes and practices  promote fairness and support a diverse workforce.", "Throughout the year, O&I actively promotes diversity throughout GAO.  For example, last year we met with the summer interns to discuss their  experiences and to provide guidance on steps that interns can take to  enhance their chances for successful conversion to permanent  employment at GAO. We also took steps to increase retention of our entry- level staff by counseling our Professional Development Program advisers  on the importance of consistent and appropriate training opportunities  and job assignments that afford all staff the opportunity to demonstrate all  of GAO\u2019s competencies. I also made several presentations that reinforced  the agency\u2019s strategic commitment to diversity, including a panel  discussion on diversity in the workforce, a presentation to new Band II  analysts on the importance of promoting an environment that is fair and  unbiased and that values opportunity and inclusiveness for all staff, and a  presentation to Senior Executive Service (SES) managers on leading  practices for maintaining diversity, focusing on top leadership  commitment and ways that managers can communicate that commitment  and hold staff accountable for results.", "This proactive and integrated approach to promoting inclusiveness and  addressing diversity issues differs from my experience as Director of the  Office of Civil Rights at a major executive branch agency. As Director of  that office, a position I held immediately before coming to GAO, I had little  direct authority to affect human capital decisions before they were  implemented, even though those decisions could adversely affect  protected groups within the agency. For the most part, my role was to  focus on the required barrier analysis and planning process. The problem  with this approach is that agencies generally make just enough of an effort  to meet the minimal requirements of the plan developed by this process. In  addition to these plans, diversity principles should be built into every  major human capital initiative, along with effective monitoring and  oversight functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Attract a Diverse Pool of Top Candidates", "paragraphs": ["The war for talent, especially given increasing competition with the private  sector, has made it more competitive for GAO and other federal agencies  to attract and retain top talent. Graduates of color from our nation\u2019s top  colleges and universities have an ever increasing array of career options.  In response to this challenge, GAO has taken a variety of steps to attract a  diverse pool of top candidates. We have identified a group of colleges and  universities that have demonstrated overall superior academic quality, and  either have a particular program or a high concentration of minority  students. They include several Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and institutions with a  significant portion of Asian-American students. In addition, GAO has  established partnerships with professional organizations and associations  with members from groups that traditionally have been underrepresented  in the federal workforce, such as the American Association of Hispanic  CPAs, the National Association of Black Accountants, the Federal Asian  Pacific American Council, the Association of Latino Professionals in  Finance and Accounting, and the American Association of Women  Accountants.

In order to maximize the  diversity of our summer interns, O&I reviews all preliminary student intern  offers to ensure that the intern hiring is consistent with the agency\u2019s  strategic commitment to maintaining a diverse workforce. O&I also meets  with a significant percentage of our interns in order to get their  perspectives on the fairness of GAO\u2019s work environment. Moreover, our  office recently analyzed the operation of the summer intern program and  the conversion process and identified areas for improvement.

It is important to implement safeguards to monitor  implementation of such systems. As a way to ensure accountability and  promote transparency, the Comptroller General made an unprecedented  decision to disseminate performance rating and promotion data. Over  some objections, the Comptroller General agreed to place appraisal and  promotion data by race, gender, age, disability, veteran status, location,  and pay band on the GAO intranet and made this information available to  all GAO staff. This approach allows all managers and staff to monitor the  implementation of our competency-based performance management  systems and serves as an important safeguard in relation to the processes.  As far as I am aware, no other federal agency has ever done this, nor am I  aware of any major corporation in America that has taken such an action.  The Comptroller General rejected the argument that an increased litigation  risk should drive the agency away from disseminating this information.  Instead he stood by his position that the principles of accountability and  transparency dictated that we should make this data available to all GAO  employees.", "In addition to making this data available to all GAO staff, O&I and the  Human Capital Office conduct separate and independent reviews of each  performance appraisal and promotion cycle before ratings and promotions  are final. In conducting its review of performance appraisals, O&I uses a  two-part approach; we review statistical data on performance ratings by  demographic group within each unit, and where appropriate, we conduct  assessments of individual ratings. In conducting the individual  assessments we (a) examine each individual rating within the specific  protected group; (b) review the adequacy of any written justification; (c)  determine whether GAO\u2019s guidance on applying the standards for each of  the performance competencies has been consistently followed, to the  extent possible; and (d) compare the rating with the self-assessment to  identify the extent to which there are differences. I meet with team  managing directors to resolve any concerns we have after our review. In  some instances ratings are changed, and in other cases we obtain  additional information that addresses our concerns.", "Our promotion process review entails analyzing all recommended best- qualified (BQ) lists. We review each applicant\u2019s performance ratings for  the last three years. In addition, we also review each applicant\u2019s  supervisory experience. I discuss concerns about an applicant\u2019s placement  with the relevant panel chair. I then meet with the Chief Operating Officer  and the Chief Administrative Officer to discuss any continuing concerns. A  similar process is used regarding managing director\u2019s selection decisions.", "In addition to these independent reviews, GAO provides employees with  several avenues to raise specific concerns regarding their individual  performance ratings. The agency has an administrative grievance process  that permits employees to receive expedited reviews of performance  appraisal matters.
