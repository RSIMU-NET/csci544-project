As the federal government obtains and processes information about individuals in increasingly diverse ways, properly protecting this information and respecting the privacy rights of individuals will remain critically important. GAO was requested to (1) identify the federal laws and guidance issued to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized use or disclosure and (2) describe agencies' progress in developing policies and documented procedures that respond to recent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to protect personally identifiable information that is either accessed remotely or physically transported outside an agency's secured physical perimeter. To do so, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, surveyed officials at 24 major federal agencies, and examined and analyzed agency documents, including policies, procedures, and plans. In commenting on a draft of this report, OMB stated that it generally agreed with the report's contents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Two primary laws (the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002) give federal agencies responsibilities for protecting personal information, including ensuring its security. Additionally, the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) requires agencies to develop, document, and implement agencywide programs to provide security for their information and information systems (which include personally identifiable information and the systems on which it resides). The act also requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop technical guidance in specific areas, including minimum information security requirements for information and information systems. In the wake of recent incidents of security breaches involving personal data, OMB issued guidance in 2006 and 2007 reiterating agency responsibilities under these laws and technical guidance, drawing particular attention to the requirements associated with personally identifiable information. In this guidance, OMB directed, among other things, that agencies encrypt data on mobile computers or devices and follow NIST security guidelines regarding personally identifiable information that is accessed outside an agency's physical perimeter. Not all agencies had developed the range of policies and procedures reflecting OMB guidance on protection of personally identifiable information that is either accessed remotely or physically transported outside an agency's secured physical perimeter. Of 24 major agencies, 22 had developed policies requiring personally identifiable information to be encrypted on mobile computers and devices. Fifteen of the 24 agencies had policies to use a \"time-out\" function for remote access and mobile devices requiring user reauthentication after 30 minutes of inactivity. Fewer agencies (11) had established policies to log computer-readable data extracts from databases holding sensitive information and erase the data within 90 days after extraction. Several agencies indicated that they were researching technical solutions to address these issues. Gaps in their policies and procedures reduced agencies' ability to protect personally identifiable information from improper disclosure. At the conclusion of GAO's review, OMB announced in November 2007 that agencies that did not complete certain privacy and security requirements, including those just described, received a downgrade in their scores for progress in electronic government initiatives. According to OMB, it will continue working with agencies to help them strengthen their information security and privacy programs, especially as they relate to the protection of personally identifiable information. In view of OMB's recent actions in this area and GAO's previous recommendations on improving agency information security and implementation of FISMA requirements, GAO is making no further recommendations at this time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Concerns regarding the security of personal information on federal  systems have been raised by incidents in which such information has been  compromised by the loss or theft of equipment or by unauthorized access.

In their fiscal year 2006 financial statement audit  reports, 21 of 24 major agencies indicated that deficient information  security controls were either a reportable condition or a material  weakness. Our audits continue to identify similar weaknesses in  nonfinancial systems. Similarly, in their annual reporting under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7  3512 (commonly referred to as the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity  Act of 1982), 17 of 24 agencies reported shortcomings in information  security, including 7 that considered it a material weakness. Agency  inspectors general have also noted the seriousness of information security,  with 21 of 24 including it as a \u201cmajor management challenge\u201d for their  agencies.", "According to our reports and those of inspectors general, persistent  weaknesses appear in the five major categories of information system  controls: (1) access controls, which ensure that only authorized  individuals can read, alter, or delete data; (2) configuration management  controls, which provide assurance that only authorized software programs  are implemented; (3) segregation of duties, which reduces the risk that  one individual can independently perform inappropriate actions without  detection; (4) continuity of operations planning, which provides for the  prevention of significant disruptions of computer-dependent operations;  and (5) an agencywide information security program, which provides the  framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that effective  controls are selected and properly implemented. Most agencies had  weaknesses in each of these categories.

Along with technical guidance from NIST, FISMA establishes a risk-based  approach to security management, which requires an agency, among other  things, to categorize its information and systems according to the potential  impact to the agency should the information be jeopardized. In the wake  of recent incidents of security breaches involving personal data, OMB has  issued guidance reiterating the requirements of these laws and guidance,  drawing particular attention to those associated with personally  identifiable information. In addition, OMB updated and added to  requirements for reporting security breaches and the loss or unauthorized  access of personally identifiable information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Privacy and Security of Personal Information Are Addressed in Several Federal Laws", "paragraphs": ["The major requirements for the protection of personal privacy by federal  agencies come from two laws, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the privacy  provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002. In addition, FISMA, which is  included in the E-Government Act of 2002, addresses the protection of  personal information in the context of securing federal agency information  and information systems.", "To protect personal privacy, the Privacy Act places limitations on  agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal information  maintained in systems of records. The act describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item,  collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is  maintained by an agency and contains his or her name or another personal  identifier. It also defines \u201csystem of records\u201d as a group of records under  the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name  of the individual or by an individual identifier. The Privacy Act requires  that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they  must notify the public by a notice in the Federal Register identifying,  among other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals  about whom information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of the  data, and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct  personal information. The act\u2019s requirements also apply to government  contractors when agencies contract for the development and maintenance  of a system of records to accomplish an agency function.", "The provisions of the Privacy Act are consistent with and based primarily  on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal  information\u2014the Fair Information Practices. These principles have been  widely adopted as the standard benchmark for evaluating the adequacy of  privacy protections; one of the principles is security safeguards. In this  regard, the Privacy Act requires agencies to \u201cestablish appropriate  administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security  and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated  threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in  substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any  individual on whom information is maintained.\u201d", "The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection for personal  information in government information systems by requiring that agencies  conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA). A PIA is an analysis of how  personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal  system. More specifically, according to OMB guidance, a PIA is an  analysis of how information is handled (1) to ensure handling conforms to  applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy; (2)  to determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining, and  disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information  system; and (3) to examine and evaluate protections and alternative  processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.", "Agencies must conduct PIAs (1) before developing or procuring  information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates  information that is in a personally identifiable form or (2) before initiating  any new data collections involving personal information that will be  collected, maintained, or disseminated using information technology if the  same questions are asked of 10 or more people. OMB guidance also  requires agencies to conduct PIAs when a system change creates new  privacy risks, for example, changing the way in which personal  information is being used. The PIA requirement does not apply to all  systems. For example, no assessment is required when the information  collected relates to internal government operations, the information has  been previously assessed under an evaluation similar to a PIA, or when  privacy issues are unchanged.", "Besides these primary laws, Congress has passed laws requiring protection  of personally identifiable information that are agency-specific or that  target a specific type of information. For example, the Veterans Benefits,  Health Care, and Information Technology Act, enacted in December 2006,  establishes information technology security requirements for personally  identifiable information that apply specifically to the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA). The act mandates, among other things, that VA  develop procedures for detecting, immediately reporting, and responding  to security incidents; notify Congress of any significant data breaches  involving personally identifiable information; and, if necessary, provide  credit protection services to those individuals whose personally  identifiable information has been compromised. Another example is the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),  which requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt  standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of health  information. These standards apply to agencies, such as the Department of  Defense and VA, to the extent they are covered by HIPAA.", "FISMA is the primary law governing information security in the federal  government; it also addresses the protection of personal information in the  context of securing federal agency information and information systems.  FISMA, which establishes a risk-based approach to security management,  defines federal requirements for securing information and information  systems that support federal agency operations and assets. Under the act,  agencies are required to provide sufficient safeguards to cost-effectively  protect their information and information systems from unauthorized  access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction, including  controls necessary to preserve authorized restrictions on access and  disclosure (and thus to protect personal privacy, among other things). The  act also requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an  agencywide information security program to provide security for the  information and information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency (including those provided or managed by another  agency, contractor, or other source).", "Specifically, the act requires that these information security programs  include, among other things,    periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could result  from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or  destruction of information or information systems; risk-based policies and procedures that cost-effectively reduce  information security risks to an acceptable level and ensure that  information security is addressed throughout the life cycle of each  information system;   subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for  networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems, as  appropriate;   security awareness training for agency personnel, including contractors  and other users of information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency;   periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices, performed with a frequency depending  on risk, but no less than annually, and that includes testing of  management, operational, and technical controls for every system  identified in the agency\u2019s required inventory of major information systems;   a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information security  policies, procedures, and practices of the agency;    procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents;    plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for information  systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.", "In addition, FISMA requires agencies to produce an annually updated  inventory of major information systems (including major national security  systems) operated by the agency or that are under its control, which  includes an identification of the interfaces between each system and all  other systems or networks, including those not operated by or under the  control of the agency.", "Like protecting other information and systems, protecting personally  identifiable information is dependent on agencies\u2019 having established  security programs that include the elements described above. Among  other things, agencies must identify the personally identifiable information  in their information systems, determine the appropriate risk level  associated with it, develop appropriate controls to secure it, and ensure  that these controls are applied and maintained.", "FISMA also establishes evaluation and reporting requirements. Under the  act, each agency must have an annual independent evaluation of its  information security program and practices, including control testing and  compliance assessment. Evaluations of non-national security systems are  to be performed by the agency inspectors general or by an independent  external auditor, while evaluations related to national security systems are  to be performed only by an entity designated by the agency head.", "FISMA also requires each agency to report annually to OMB, selected  congressional committees, and the Comptroller General on the adequacy  of information security policies, procedures, and practices, and  compliance with the act\u2019s requirements. In addition, agency heads are  required to annually report the results of their independent evaluations to  OMB.
