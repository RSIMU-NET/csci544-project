Yet determining the number and mix to meet current and future airlift requirements has become increasingly challenging given distinct differences between the two aircraft. While the C-5 can carry more cargo, the newer C-17 is more flexible since it can deliver to forward-deployed bases and has a higher mission capable rate. GAO was asked to identify the impact C-5 modernization cost increases have had on the mix of aircraft; assess the current C-5 modernization cost estimate; and identify C-17 production plans and issues related to production line shutdown. To conduct its work, GAO reviewed options DOD considered to meet its current and future strategic airlift requirements, and evaluated C-5 modernization and C-17 production line shut down cost estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has cut the number of C-5s it plans to fully modernize by more than half because of substantial cost increases in the C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Reengining Program (RERP) and plans to acquire more C-17s, with additional congressional funding. Currently, the Air Force plans to provide avionics upgrades to all 111 C-5s, limit RERP to 52 C-5s, and acquire 205 C-17s. However, this mix may change again, based in part on the results of a new mobility capabilities study, the findings of which DOD plans to release in May 2009. While the new study is expected to consider transport needs for the future force, DOD has not identified specific metrics it will use to make strategic airlift decisions--a concern GAO raised about DOD's previous mobility capabilities study and one DOD agreed to address in future studies. The Air Force currently estimates it will spend $9.1 billion on upgrading the C-5s. However, this estimate may be understated because DOD did not apply risk or uncertainty analyses to its RERP major cost drivers. Moreover, the current RERP is underfunded by almost $300 million and may be unachievable if the engine production schedule is not met. At the same time, the Air Force has not priced or budgeted for a new upgrade program it plans to begin in fiscal year 2010 to address certain modernization deficiencies and to add new capabilities. Some future costs, however, may be avoided should the Air Force justify retirement of some older C-5s and forego planned modifications. Careful planning is needed to ensure C-17 production is not ended prematurely and later restarted at substantial cost. Current production plans call for shutting down the C-17 production line in September 2010. However, results from the new mobility capabilities studies and potential C-5 retirements could lead to decisions to extend C-17 production beyond the 205 now authorized. Both the manufacturer and Air Force agree that shutting down and restarting production would not be feasible or cost effective due to the costs to reinstate a capable workforce, reinstall tooling, and reestablish the supplier base. At some point, the C-17 production line will shut down, and DOD will have to pay substantial costs that have not yet been budgeted. The manufacturer and Air Force shutdown estimates differ significantly--about $1 billion and $465 million, respectively--in large part because the manufacturer's estimate included assumptions about demolishing facilities and environmental remediation, while the Air Force's did not."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Strategic airlift provides the capability to rapidly deploy, supply, and  Strategic airlift provides the capability to rapidly deploy, supply, and  sustain U.S. combat forces worldwide.

Quantifying that risk and  uncertainty is considered to be a cost estimating best practice because it  captures the cumulative effect of risks and recognizes the potential for  error.", "In a memo documenting its independent cost estimate, the CAIG stated  that the biggest risk to the cost estimate was the purchase agreement  between Lockheed Martin and General Electric for the propulsion system  that is conditioned on specific annual procurement quantities. The CAIG  had estimated that the Air Force could save 18 percent by meeting the  quantity and schedule identified in the revised RERP.  However, CAIG  officials stated that if the budget is not sufficient to meet these agreed-to  quantities, then anticipated price breaks would not occur, resulting in  increased costs of the C-5 RERP to the government. Despite this  significant risk, the CAIG did not perform a risk/uncertainty analysis to  determine the extent to which costs would increase should the buy  quantity be cut. CAIG officials stated that they believe propulsion system  procurement risk has been mitigated because they have identified the  quantities necessary to meet the conditions of the purchase agreement and  the Air Force plans to fully fund to this estimate. Despite these assurances,  however, we have found that DOD often changes procurement quantities  and there is a risk that quantities for the C-5 RERP program may change.

Contractor and Air Force cost estimates vary widely,  ranging up to $1 billion and more, and need to be reconciled.  Only $37  million has been budgeted thus far."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Careful Planning Needed to Avoid Shutting Down and Restarting the Production Line", "paragraphs": ["Two alternatives to completely shutting down the C-17 production line  would be to slow down the rate of production or to close out current  production while preserving some ability to restart the line should  conditions change and additional C-17s are needed. Both options are not  attractive.  Slowing down production raises unit costs due to smaller  annual quantities.  Analysis indicates that, once closed, it would not be  feasible or cost effective to restart production due to costs for hiring and  training a new workforce, reinstalling tooling, and reestablishing the  supply base.  Therefore, careful planning to firmly and timely establish  future C-17 fleet requirements is important to avoid unnecessary costs  associated with a slowdown or a premature shutdown.", "Our review of contractor and Air Force plans identified the following  major challenges and substantial costs for restarting production:    A workforce of nearly 3,100 people would have to be hired and trained  following a complete shutdown. Boeing officials believe that the vast  majority of its current workforce will not be available for  reemployment 1 year after the shutdown. A union representative  stated that workers, whose average age is around 57 years, will either  retire or find other jobs during the shutdown period. Boeing does not  have the ability to move its workers to other production lines at its  Long Beach, California, plant because the C-17 is the last aircraft being  built at that facility.", "Production tooling would need to be dismantled, stored, and  maintained for the entire length of the shutdown. Tooling would then  have to be reinstalled and restored to its original working condition,  which officials believe would be no small feat considering the  significant amount of automation involved in the production process.  In addition, new tooling may need to be procured depending on design  changes that may occur during the shutdown period.", "Suppliers would have to be identified and their processes and parts  would have to be qualified.  Boeing officials stated that some suppliers  it deals with now may not be available and many other suppliers may  not participate in the C-17 production program because they may  develop alternative business ventures following the shutdown.  Suppliers of certain specialty parts are of utmost concern.", "Cost estimates to shut down and restart the C-17 production line are very  substantial.  In 2006, when various shutdown options were being  evaluated, Boeing estimated that the cost to shut down and restart would  be about $918 million; the Air Force estimated $2 billion. Table 4 shows  the main assumptions used to develop these estimates.", "Boeing and the Air Force used different cost-estimating assumptions when  completing their production shutdown and restart estimates, and neither  estimate reflects all potential costs. For example, Boeing\u2019s estimate only  addresses mothballing the production facility in anticipation of restarting  production, whereas the Air Force\u2019s estimate includes the costs to stop  and restart production as well as a final shutdown that would occur after a  second production run is completed.  Neither Boeing nor the Air Force  included costs to hire and train approximately 3,100 workers or to make  configuration changes that may have occurred to the aircraft during the  time period when the line was shut down. According to Boeing and Air  Force officials, these two cost categories could add millions of dollars to  their production shutdown and restart estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Has Not Budgeted Sufficient Funds for the C-17 Production Shutdown", "paragraphs": ["At this writing, the Air Force has allocated $37 million in its outyears  budget for C-17 production shutdown, far less than what is believed to be  needed.  As above, cost estimates vary and were not consistently derived.   Identifying and reconciling the full costs of shutdown is needed.  The Air  Force plans to negotiate and issue a postproduction contract to Boeing to  identify the disposition of tooling and other production assets and to  ensure that a viable sustainment supplier base has been established when  production has ended.", "In 2006, Boeing and the Air Force developed considerably different  estimates of about $1 billion and $465 million, respectively, for the cost of  shutting down production completely.  Table 5 below compares the two  cost estimates developed in 2006 and the underlying assumptions that  contributed most significantly to the differences.", "Differences between the two estimates can largely be attributed to the  underlying assumptions used. For example, in assessing alternatives for  shutting down the C-17 production facility at Long Beach, California,  Boeing considered three options for the site: redeploy the property to  Boeing for reuse, treat the property as an operating asset, or sell the  property. Boeing officials concluded that the current production facility  would not be used for future business and should be sold. Therefore, they  included costs to demolish facilities and for environmental remediation in  their estimate.  Air Force officials believe demolition and environmental  remediation costs should not be part of the shutdown costs and did not  include them.", "Since 2006, Congress has provided additional funding that the Air Force is  using to procure additional C-17s.  Thus, DOD officials stated that the  requirement to shut down the production has been delayed 1 year and now  estimate the shutdown costs to be $505 million, due to inflation. Boeing  has not updated its estimate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Strategic airlift is an essential, key enabler of U.S. military capability to  rapidly project forces worldwide. The C-5 and C-17 provide  complementary capabilities. However, DOD continues to struggle with  identifying the specific quantities and determining the optimal mix of  aircraft needed. Clarity is needed before committing additional billions of  dollars to C-5 modernization programs, establishing C-5 retirement  schedules, and/or acquiring additional C-17 aircraft. Careful planning is  also important to avoid the costs of shutting down the C-17 line  prematurely and later deciding to restart the production. The new mobility  studies, if done correctly, could bring clarity to strategic airlift capabilities  needed to support the future force and changed threats, as well as inform  future tactical airlift requirements because of the C-17\u2019s dual role.  Important metrics left out of the 2005 capabilities study\u2014such as specific  ton-mile mobility requirements and relative reliability rates\u2014are  considered critical factors in quantifying and analyzing cost-effective force  mixes. DOD concurred with our prior recommendation to use mobility  metrics to inform future mobility capabilities studies.  However, at this  writing, it is unclear whether DOD will use a million ton-mile metric in its  current analysis to determine the cost-effective mix of aircraft and guide  important investment decisions related to the expenditure of billions of  dollars.  Until comprehensive requirements\u2014supported by appropriate,  quantifiable metrics\u2014and the full costs for alternate courses of action are  identified, DOD decision making on the future size and mix of strategic  airlift is hampered, thus increasing the risk of incurring unnecessary costs  and establishing a less than optimal mix of strategic and tactical airlift  forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better inform decision makers and provide improved and quantifiable  projections of airlift mobility requirements and investment needs, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (Program Analysis and Evaluation) and U.S.  Transportation Command to take the following action:    Ensure that the new mobility capabilities study specifies the ton-mile  per day metric and other relevant metrics to support sound strategic  airlift decisions, including (1) the cost-effective mix of C-5 and C-17  aircraft consistent with national security strategy; (2) the number of   C-5s required to airlift equipment that can only be carried by that  aircraft; (3) C-5A retirement schedules, if warranted by analysis;   (4) the number of C-17s needed to accomplish both its strategic and  tactical roles; and (5) future procurement and modernization needs.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of  the Air Force to take the following two actions:    Prepare updated, reliable, and comprehensive cost estimates for C-5  modernization to include risk and sensitivity analyses on major cost  drivers for the RERP, the costs of a new modernization program, and  potential savings should some C-5A retirements be warranted.", "Identify and budget for the full costs to shut down the C-17 production  line in the time frame consistent with final decisions on the future size  of the C-17 fleet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report.

Accordingly, we redirected our recommendation to these offices  instead of the Air Force.", "DOD did not concur with the recommendation to prepare updated C-5  modernization cost estimates.  DOD stated that the modernization is being  accomplished in two phases\u2014the AMP and RERP\u2014and that the third  modernization effort we identified that is slated to begin in fiscal year 2010  is a sustainment program that would fall below the ACAT II threshold.   Further, department officials believe that the most recent cost estimates  for the AMP and RERP are sufficient and areas of concern and mitigating  factors related to the RERP estimate were identified during the Nunn- McCurdy process.", "We continue to believe updated estimates are warranted.  We are not  suggesting that the department revisit its RERP Nunn-McCurdy decision.  For the most part, we believe the CAIG did an adequate job identifying the  costs associated with 14 different RERP options, especially given the short  time frame in which the estimates had to be completed.  However, the  CAIG did not perform risk or uncertainty analysis, which is considered to  be a cost-estimating best practice.  Since the program is not fully funded  and the Air Force has not yet completed its analysis of mobility  requirements, there remains significant risk that funding will not be  available in outyears or that the quantities of C-5s and C-17s could change.   Therefore, we believe it is important that DOD identify a range of potential  costs based on different quantities, so that decision makers will have  adequate information for future budget decisions related to the number  and mix of strategic airlifters.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation to identify and budget for the  full costs to shut down the C-17 production line consistent with final  decisions on the future size of the C-17 fleet.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and  interested congressional committees.
