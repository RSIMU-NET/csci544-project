States have long provided the greatest share of funding for public community colleges between 40 and 45 percent of schools' total revenue, while federal funding, exclusive of student financial assistance, has been much smaller about 5 percent. Most states provide more funding for credit programs than noncredit programs. Most community colleges and technical schools track some education and employment outcomes for their students, but differences in state reporting requirements preclude aggregating these outcomes nationally. However, national studies of representative samples or cohorts of students conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics show that between half and two-thirds of community college students seeking some type of academic or occupational credential succeed in transferring to a 4-year institution or earning a degree, license, certificate, or diploma within 6 to 8 years of initiating studies.

Survey data  for all programs, except contract training, was for the fall term of 2002.  (We did not include proprietary schools, such as for-profit technical  schools, in our survey population.) We activated the survey Web site,  notified the 1,070 public community colleges and technical schools in our  survey population, and received responses from 758 community colleges  and technical schools (71 percent). We checked the survey responses for  obvious errors and problems, but did not independently verify the  accuracy of the information these schools provided.

We assessed the reliability of the IPEDS data, reviewing  NCES\u2019s methods for testing the internal consistency of data reported by  schools. We supplemented our survey data with visits to community  college and state officials in three states\u2014Florida, Texas, and  Washington\u2014and interviewed officials in a fourth state, North Carolina, by  telephone. Using the recommendations of education and workforce  experts at community colleges and professional organizations, we chose  these states because they differed in such ways as the extent of state  funding for credit and noncredit courses, the tracking of student education  and employment outcomes, the types of workforce development efforts,  and geographic location. We examined two or more schools in each state,  except for Texas where we only visited one school, selecting them on the  basis of expert recommendations to obtain a mix based on differences in  level of student enrollment and urban and rural locale. We also relied on  the findings of national outcomes studies regarded to be authoritative by  researchers and other experts in the field.

Community colleges have kept their \u201ctransfer function,\u201d  preparing students for 4-year institutions, while assuming a role in  occupational skills training and adult basic education. With open  admissions and low tuition policies, community colleges serve the needs  of a diverse student body, ranging from people without any type of  educational credential to those with advanced academic degrees. Between  1980 and 2000, the number of community colleges grew about 14 percent  with enrollments increasing about 32 percent; enrollments are projected  to increase about 14 percent from 2001 to 2013. According to data  compiled by NCES, community college students are more likely than   4-year college students to be 24 years of age or older, not enroll directly  after high school, attend part-time and work full-time while enrolled, be  financially independent for federal financial aid purposes, have  dependents, be a single parent, or not have a high school diploma.", "Community colleges and technical schools have a wide variety of program  types from which to draw. The programs include traditional academic  courses for students intending to obtain an associate degree or transfer to  a baccalaureate-granting institution as well as remedial education to bring  students to college-level proficiency and basic skills training for people  who want to improve their employability or pass the General Educational  Development examination. Separate from these program types, other  programs offer credit and noncredit occupational, professional, and  technical training leading to degrees, certificates, licenses, or diplomas for  new and existing workers; training developed for specific employers; and  other programs to meet the personal and professional interests of the local  community.

Two states we visited had strategies to help guide schools in  establishing programs that address the needs of local businesses and the  workforce. Florida, for example, created a targeted occupations list to  guide program offerings at community colleges. Colleges may offer  programs from the list without obtaining special permission or review  from the state. In Washington State, community college officials said that  colleges proposing new professional or technical programs must show  that the estimated output of the proposed program along with similar  programs statewide does not exceed the projected employment need. Our  survey data show many schools offer programs in occupations with  projected growth.

Among schools responding to our survey almost all community  colleges and technical schools were involved in at least one of three such  programs:    Over 90 percent of schools participated in dual or concurrent enrollment  programs that allowed high school students to attend college-level classes  and earn both high school and college credit.", "Nearly 75 percent of schools had \u201cTech-Prep\u201d programs that consist of 2  years of high school and 2 years of higher education or an apprenticeship  program leading to a credential in specific career fields such as welding or  accounting.", "Slightly less than half of schools participated in school-to-career programs  that link the high school with the business community to improve student  transitions to work.", "At the schools we visited, the demand for these programs could be seen in  the size of the enrollments.

These students could earn up to 1 year of college credit prior to high  school graduation.

School administrators have found that noncredit courses allow them to  address shifts in local labor markets, often in a short time. They can  develop and deliver noncredit courses more quickly than credit courses  because noncredit courses have a less complicated review and approval  process. Schools may use noncredit courses as a transition to adding or  deleting programs from the curriculum. In Florida, for example, a  community college official said the college collaborated with a local  hospital to develop a course for interpretive services that train  intermediaries to work between English speaking staff and foreign  language patients. The college started the course as noncredit with the  view of later converting the course to credit if interest and enrollment  grew. In contrast, declining numbers of students in a real estate program  led the college to change it from credit to noncredit.", "Benefits to students enrolled in noncredit programs often include low or  no tuition and fees, simpler enrollment procedures, less formal classroom  settings, and more flexible class schedules. Noncredit education helps  students wanting to upgrade skills, retrain for a new career, prepare for a  licensing exam, or pursue vocational interests. An administrator at a  North Carolina community college noted that many noncredit courses are  intended for students who do not want or need a degree\u2014or another  degree. For some people, completion of a few short-term noncredit  courses serves as a transition to the credit academic or occupational  pathway that leads to a degree or certificate.", "Perhaps one of the biggest benefits of noncredit programs is to provide  transitional education for people who leave high school unprepared for  college-level programs. Community colleges, with their open admissions  policies, are a prime source of instruction for the great number of students  needing remediation. Overall, more than a dozen states estimated that half  of students entering community colleges required some type of remedial  education, according to a state survey conducted by the  Education Commission of the States in 2001. The remaining 14 states  providing such data estimated the proportion of entering students needing  remediation ranged from a low of 10 to a high of 49 percent.

Contract training programs typically offer flexibility and responsiveness in  meeting the needs and schedules of trainees and their employers. In  consultation with the business or organization, the school may provide an  existing or specially created course, hold the training at the worksite or on  campus, and use existing faculty or hire instructors. Training may focus on  management, computer, language, customer service, or any other subject  that an employer considers important to improving its workforce.", "More than three-quarters of schools responding to our survey offered  contract training in the 2002-03 academic year.

However, contract training presents  an entrepreneurial challenge to community colleges and technical schools  since employers are free to choose other training sources, including in- house instructors, private contractors or consultants, 4-year colleges, or  other community colleges.

On the other hand, a representative from a community college  in North Carolina said that lower state funding for noncredit programs  encouraged the school to charge tuition at a level that would make the  program self-supporting, providing an additional revenue stream as  schools in this state are allowed to keep tuition received instead of  returning it to the state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contract Training", "paragraphs": ["Nearly two-thirds of community colleges and technical schools responding  to our survey reported receiving state funds to defray costs of delivering  employee training under contract to businesses, government entities, or  other employers, as shown in figure 9.

Under the Perkins Act, states are required to develop measures of  student performance such as competency attainment, job or work-skill  attainment, and retention in school or placement in a school, job, or the  military. Our survey showed that less than three-fourths of community  colleges and technical schools reported receiving vocational education  funds and would, therefore, be required to report such outcomes. Further,  while several states have created data links between unemployment  insurance earnings information and community college administrative  records to collect earnings data, each state varies in its ability to collect  such data because state laws, reporting procedures and higher education  agency organizations differ by state.", "Job training programs under Title I of the Workforce Investment Act  require states and localities to track participant performance. The  performance measures gauge program results in areas of job placement,  employment retention and earnings changes, as well as skill attainment  and customer satisfaction. Our survey results, however, showed that only  27, 62, and 63 percent of community colleges and technical schools  reported participating in WIA Youth, Adult Education and Dislocated  Worker programs, respectively, and are thus subject to these reporting  requirements.

National data are unavailable showing  education and employment outcomes for students enrolled in noncredit  occupational programs. However, NCES has conducted several studies  that provide some insight on the extent to which community college  students who are enrolled in accredited academic and occupational  programs meet their educational or employment goals. An NCES report  issued in June 2003 draws upon three earlier studies to provide data on  student outcomes based on representative samples or cohorts of students  that attended community colleges. The findings of this report suggest that  the national success rate for community college students, as measured by  transfer to a 4-year institution or completion of a degree or certificate, is  between half and two-thirds of students who enroll with intentions to  transfer or earn a credential. For example:    Results from one study showed that 51 percent of community college  students seeking some type of academic credential either received a  degree or certificate (39 percent) or transferred to a 4-year institution (12  percent) within 6 years of initiating their studies.", "A second study found that for a group of 1992 high school graduates that  enrolled in public 2-year institutions by December 1994, 63 percent of  students seeking an academic credential either received a degree,  certificate, or license (50 percent) or had attended a 4-year institution (13  percent) as of 2000.", "Both studies asked students who did and did not achieve their goals to  assess the impact of their postsecondary education on a variety of labor  market outcomes. Results showed that students who completed a degree  or certificate were more likely to say that their postsecondary education  increased their employment prospects (job opportunities, job  responsibilities, or salary) than those who left without obtaining a  credential.", "In 1995, NCES conducted a survey on remedial education in higher  education institutions and found that about two-thirds or more of  community college students successfully completed remedial courses  taken in reading (72 percent), writing (71 percent), and mathematics  (66 percent).

These  institutions can adapt quickly to changing local economic needs, in part,  through noncredit programs and contract training that offer both  individuals and employers an array of education and vocational  experiences needed to support shifting workforce demands. At the same  time, these schools are maintaining their position as a critical vehicle for  students seeking 2-year degrees or moving on to 4-year institutions.", "National studies conducted by the Department of Education provide some  information about community college student outcomes for those enrolled  in these degree programs. However, much less is known about the  outcomes of contract and noncredit training initiatives\u2014and because  many of these efforts are customized to meet specific local employer  needs, national studies may not be the most appropriate methodology.
