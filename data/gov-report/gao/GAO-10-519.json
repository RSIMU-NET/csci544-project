Certain federal laws help ensure that kindergarten-12th grade schools provide students with disabilities opportunities to participate in physical education (PE) and extracurricular athletics equal to those of their peers. However, national associations have questioned whether students with disabilities receive opportunities similar to their peers. Regarding students with disabilities, GAO was asked to examine (1) what is known about the PE opportunities that schools provide, and how do schools provide these; (2) what is known about the extracurricular athletic opportunities that schools provide, and how do schools provide these; and (3) how the Department of Education (Education) assists states and schools in these areas. GAO analyzed federal survey data; reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; and interviewed state, district, and school officials in selected states, as well as parents and disability association officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Schools provide students with and without disabilities similar opportunities to participate in PE but face challenges when serving students with disabilities. Students with disabilities spend similar amounts of time in PE class and exercising in class as students without disabilities, according to national data and GAO site visits. Most students with disabilities take PE with other students in general PE classes. To facilitate their participation, teachers may make accommodations for some students, such as providing additional modeling or repetition. Many state, district, and school officials GAO interviewed cited teacher preparation and budget constraints as key challenges to serving students with disabilities in general PE classes. For example, they said general PE teachers need more training opportunities on working specifically with students with disabilities, yet resources for training are not always available. Limited national data suggest that students with disabilities participate in extracurricular athletics, but do not distinguish whether these opportunities are offered through schools or community programs. Among the schools GAO visited, students with disabilities participated in athletics at varying rates, but at consistently lower rates than students without disabilities. Several factors, such as a student's disability type or outreach to students, may affect participation. Some schools or districts GAO interviewed provided opportunities by partnering with community programs or offering athletics designed specifically for students with disabilities, such as wheelchair basketball. District and school officials GAO interviewed cited a lack of information on ways to expand athletic opportunities, lack of clarity regarding schools' responsibilities, and budget constraints as key challenges. Education has provided little information or guidance on PE or extracurricular athletics for students with disabilities, and some states and districts GAO interviewed said more would be useful. According to agency officials, Education has not provided much information or guidance because it has targeted its limited resources on other areas, such as monitoring priorities specified in federal law. Officials from several states and many districts said they could benefit from Education helping states and schools to share information on practices or resources regarding PE and athletics for students with disabilities. Officials from districts and disability groups also said more clarification from Education on schools' responsibilities under federal law on extracurricular athletics for students with disabilities would be useful."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The health and social benefits of physical activity and athletic  participation for children are well established. These benefits may be even  more important for children with disabilities, including those with  cognitive and physical disabilities who have a greater risk of being  sedentary and having associated health conditions, such as obesity and  reduced cardiovascular fitness. Studies have shown that for students with  disabilities, regular physical activity may help control or slow the  progression of chronic disease, improve muscular strength, control body  weight, and enhance students\u2019 psychological well-being through additional  social ties and improved self-confidence and self-esteem.", "Certain federal laws and regulations help ensure that children with  disabilities are provided opportunities to participate in physical education  (PE) and extracurricular athletics that are equal to those of other  children. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)  mandates that states receiving federal grants under the act generally  ensure that eligible elementary and secondary school students with  disabilities receive a free appropriate public education which is defined as  certain special education and related services. Students with a range of  disabilities are protected under IDEA, including those with cognitive or  emotional disabilities and those with visual, hearing, or orthopedic  impairments. Another key federal law protecting students with disabilities  is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), which  prohibits entities that receive federal funds, such as elementary and  secondary schools, from discriminating against otherwise qualified  individuals with disabilities. Under the implementing regulations for both  IDEA and Section 504, schools are required to provide students with  disabilities equal opportunity for participation in extracurricular activities,  which often include athletics. In its administration of these federal laws,  the Department of Education (Education) provides oversight and  assistance to states and local education agencies, including administering  federal funds, monitoring IDEA and Section 504 compliance, and providing  guidance and technical assistance.", "Despite the health and social benefits of physical activity and the  existence of these federal laws, national associations have raised  questions about whether elementary and secondary schools are providing  students with disabilities similar opportunities in PE and extracurricular  athletics as compared to the opportunities of their peers without  disabilities. In light of these concerns, you asked us to address the  following:  1.  what is known about the PE opportunities that schools provide to  students with disabilities, and how do schools provide these  opportunities;  2.  what is known about the extracurricular athletic opportunities that  schools provide to students with disabilities, and how do schools  provide these opportunities; and  3.  how Education assists states and schools to provide opportunities in  PE and extracurricular athletics to students with disabilities.", "To address these issues, we examined pertinent data from four nationally  representative studies that provided the most current national survey data  available for our purposes: the 2006 School Health Policies and Programs  Study (SHPPS), the 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), 2001 data  from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2), and 2000 data  from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS). We  reviewed the methods and survey design used in these studies and,  through interviews with knowledgeable agency officials and our own  analyses, determined that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. While more recent data are available from NLTS2 and  SEELS, we determined that the data collected during the first wave of  these two longitudinal studies were more reliable for the purposes of  generating estimates of student participation in PE and extracurricular  athletics. In addition, we conducted site visits in five states (California,  Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, and New Jersey) and interviewed officials  from state departments of education and state athletic associations, school  districts, and schools. We also interviewed teachers, coaches, parents, and  students. In each state, we visited two school districts and four schools. In  addition, we conducted phone interviews with officials from state  agencies and district offices selected in Georgia and Texas. We chose  these seven states because they had relatively higher numbers of students  with disabilities nationwide and varied in whether they had policies  requiring elementary, middle, and secondary schools to teach PE, and  geographic location. We chose school districts that varied in their  percentages of students with disabilities, socio-economic status, and  classification as urban, rural, or suburban. In deciding between multiple  states or districts that met our selection criteria, we purposely chose some  that external stakeholders recommended as having innovative or  promising practices. To obtain information from parents, we set up  informal meetings with assistance from staff in Parent Training and  Information Centers in each state we visited. The information and data we  gathered from these site visits are not generalizable to all states and  districts. In addition to our site visits, we interviewed representatives from  21 national associations, community organizations, and experts in the  areas of disability, health, PE, special education, and athletics.

To receive  federal funds, states and local educational agencies must identify and  evaluate children who have a disability and provide special education and  related services, as well as supplementary aids and services when  necessary, to those who are eligible. Such services and supports are  formulated in an individualized education program (IEP), which is  developed, discussed, and documented by a student\u2019s IEP team. An IEP  team must generally include, among others, the parents of the child, a  general education teacher, a special education teacher, and the child when  appropriate. IDEA also requires the placement of students in the least  restrictive environment\u2014in which students with disabilities are educated  with students without disabilities\u2014to the maximum extent appropriate.  Regarding PE, IDEA regulations specify that schools must generally  provide opportunities for students to participate in regular or general PE  classes or, in some cases, specially designed PE if determined by the IEP  team. Regarding extracurricular athletics, districts and schools must take  steps to provide services to give students with disabilities an opportunity  to participate in extracurricular activities, which may include athletics,  equal to that of other students.", "Section 504 prohibits entities that receive federal financial assistance,  including elementary and secondary (K-12) schools, from discriminating  against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities. The Americans  with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA) is also a broad  antidiscriminatory law protecting individuals with disabilities. Education  interprets the ADA and Section 504 in a similar manner. While IDEA  students are covered under Section 504, other students who are not  covered under IDEA may still have a disability as defined under Section  504. Several of the most common disabilities of students included under  Section 504, but not always covered under IDEA, are attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, diabetes, and asthma. In 2006, about 444,000  students with disabilities were covered under 504, and not IDEA, based on  the most recent estimates from Education. These students may have an  education plan developed under Section 504 that sets forth their needed  regular or special education and related aids and services, but the federal  requirements for such a plan are much less detailed than for an IEP.  Similar to IDEA, Education\u2019s Section 504 regulations require that students  with disabilities be provided a free appropriate public education and learn  alongside students without disabilities to the maximum extent  appropriate. These Section 504 regulations also require that students with  disabilities must be provided equal opportunities to participate in PE  courses and extracurricular athletics. Unlike IDEA, however, Section 504  does not authorize any federal funding to schools to provide services to  students.

For example, states  must report to OSEP the amount of time that students who are covered  under IDEA spend in their state\u2019s general education classes, including PE.  The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), through its headquarters and 12 regional  offices, carries out enforcement activities related to Section 504, the ADA,  and other antidiscrimination laws. These activities include investigating  complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin,  sex, disability, or age. OSEP and OCR also help states and schools meet  their federal requirements and improve the quality of education by issuing  policy guidance, disseminating information, and providing technical  assistance to individual institutions.

Some district and  school officials also said that middle school can be particularly difficu some students with disabilities who may have more difficulty changing  into PE uniforms or opening combination locks on their PE lockers.  However, some schools overcame these challenges by waiving their PE  uniform policy or providing key locks to accommodate students with  disabilities. In addition, some parents and school officials noted that  ir  whether a student has a physical or cognitive disability may affect the experience. For example, officials in one school said that while students with physical impairments required more accommodations, they also may  have an easier time expressing their needs than students with cognitive  disabilities.

According to 2006 SHPPS data and  many teachers we interviewed, common informal adjustments that  teachers use for students with disabilities in PE class include simplifying  the instructional content, providing additional skill modeling or repetition,  and having peers without disabilities assist in teaching or coaching (see  fig. 3). School officials said that these types of informal accommodations  or modifications are generally not determined through the IEP process. In  contrast, schools we visited said that more formal accommodations or  modifications are usually determined through the IEP process and noted  on a student\u2019s IEP. These may include modifying assessments (e.g.,  allowing students to have more time to take tests); using specialized  equipment; or having individual aides or assistants work with students  during class.

Many state, district, and school officials we interviewed said that PE  teachers typically take one course on working with students with  disabilities in their undergraduate training. This coursework may not  always include practical experience working with students with  disabilities, and several studies found that PE teachers reported feeling  insufficiently prepared to teach students with disabilities. According to  SHPPS, only 32 percent of teachers surveyed who taught required PE  classes reported having received training on how to work with students  with long-term physical, medical, or cognitive disabilities in the 2 years  preceding the 2006 study. Officials from several disability, health, or PE  associations said that general PE or classroom teachers who lack training  or experience teaching students with disabilities may not know what to do  or how to provide the appropriate level of accommodations or effectively  adapt their instruction. Their lack of training and experience may result in  their excusing some students with disabilities from portions of the class,  according to two associations we interviewed. Some parents we spoke  with described instances in which their children sat on the side during  certain activities or were not encouraged to be as active as their  classmates.

Some  officials from states and districts said they provide professional  development opportunities to teachers through online training,  workshops, or conferences. However, budget shortfalls limited their  ability to offer additional training opportunities for PE teachers. Some  district officials told us that they would like to receive more information  on meeting the needs of students with disabilities in general PE settings.  For instance, officials from a rural district in Georgia said that they did not  have any teachers who specifically taught adapted PE and all students  were taught by a general PE or special education teacher. Officials from  this district acknowledged that their teachers would benefit from  additional training in adapted PE, but told us that they could only provide  training if it were available at a low cost or if they had additional  resources.", "Officials in many of the districts and schools we visited reported that  budget constraints created a challenge to providing PE to students with  disabilities, particularly in the general PE classroom. For example, many  district and school officials, including PE teachers, told us that budget  constraints in their schools have resulted in large general PE classes and  have hindered teachers\u2019 ability to provide students with disabilities the  individual attention they may need. In both of the districts in California  that we visited, teachers and school officials said that PE classes can  include over 45 students, often with only one teacher. Several teachers  noted that they would like to provide more individual attention to students  with disabilities in their classes but cannot do so while managing the rest  of the class. Another PE teacher in Minnesota said that large classes in a  spacious and noisy environment can be particularly hard for students with  emotional or behavioral disabilities who are very sensitive to such stimuli.  District and school officials said that additional staff, such as  paraprofessional aides who could work one-on-one with students with  disabilities, would help address the challenge of large classes. However,  officials said that budget constraints limit the use of aides. Finally,  teachers or district officials in several states told us that limited resources  for equipment, including special adapted equipment or facility renovations  for outdated gymnasiums, hindered their ability to effectively provide  opportunities to students with disabilities.", "A few state, district, school, and disability association officials we spoke  with cited a lack of importance placed on PE as a school subject  compared with academic subjects. Some state, district, and school  officials noted that the greater emphasis on assessments for reading and  math as required by federal law has led them to reduce the number of PE  classes that their students are required to take or PE elective courses that  they can offer. However, other district officials said their PE offerings  have not changed because state laws dictate PE requirements for students,  among other reasons.

In contrast, the percent of non-IDEA students who  participated in traditional extracurricular athletics ranged from 18 to 73  percent in these schools (see fig. 4). In all cases, the participation rates for  IDEA students were lower than for non-IDEA students, ranging from 10 to  56 percentage points lower.", "A number of factors may contribute to these differences among schools,  such as outreach to students with disabilities, priorities of school officials,  and the level of competitiveness among athletic teams. Some schools we  visited in Florida and California actively reached out to some students  with disabilities in an effort to recruit them for extracurricular athletics.  Several of the special education teachers in a California school we visited  also coached different sports teams; this dual role enabled them to  encourage students with disabilities to participate, according to one  official. Additionally, the leadership of school officials may affect students\u2019  participation in extracurricular athletics, according to some parents,  school officials, and officials from disability groups. One parent of a child  with a learning disability in California told us that administrators at her  daughter\u2019s school recognized that extracurricular athletics was an area  where she excelled and wrote into her IEP that she could participate even  if her grades did not qualify her. In contrast, the competitiveness of some  athletic teams can negatively affect participation among students with  disabilities. A district official we spoke with in Texas told us that  extracurricular athletics in his district were very competitive and that it  was unlikely that many students with disabilities would make these teams.  Additionally, one parent told us that she took her daughter who has a  neurological disorder out of the school volleyball team because of  competitive pressures from other parents and students. Perceptions  among students, parents, and schools can also affect student participation  in extracurricular athletics, according to a number of officials from  schools and disability organizations we interviewed. Specifically, students  with disabilities may not perceive themselves as athletic and therefore are  reluctant to try out for teams, while parents or schools may resist the idea  of students participating due to safety concerns.", "Student participation on sports teams varies by disability. In most of the  schools we visited, officials told us that students with disabilities who  participated in extracurricular athletics often had mild cognitive  disabilities or learning disabilities.

Many officials from schools and disability associations we  interviewed said that students with physical disabilities have fewer  opportunities in extracurricular athletics compared to students with  cognitive disabilities because fewer programs were designed for them. For  example, officials said that while students with learning or cognitive  disabilities could participate in traditional sports teams with little to no  modifications, students with physical disabilities may not be able to do so.

In addition, many schools we  visited said they have at least some teams that accept all students who try  out. These teams were usually those based on individual performance,  such as track or swimming, according to school officials. In contrast, other  teams, such as soccer or basketball, were very competitive and had a  limited number of positions available. Many school officials told us that if  a student did not get selected to play on a competitive team, they were  encouraged by coaches to play on a team that accepted all students.", "School officials reported that they provide varying levels of  accommodations for students with disabilities on traditional teams,  usually depending on the student\u2019s disability. For example, a high school  we visited in New Jersey provided an interpreter for a deaf student on the  baseball team, and a middle school we visited in California modified rules  for deaf and blind students on their wrestling team. State athletic  associations in Texas and Minnesota sometimes granted exceptions to  their policy on student age limits for students with disabilities. Other  methods to aid students with disabilities in extracurricular athletics were  less formal. Coaches told us that they may vary their style to meet  individual student needs as a practice of good coaching but did not  provide any specific accommodations for students with disabilities. For  example, coaches in schools that we visited in New Jersey and Florida told  us that they repeat rules or give instructions by modeling an activity for  students with cognitive or learning disabilities in order to help them better  understand game rules.", "A few schools provided extracurricular athletic opportunities to students  with disabilities through formal partnerships with community programs,  most commonly Special Olympics. While many schools provided referrals  to Special Olympics but did not otherwise facilitate participation, a few  schools we visited provided transportation, coaching, or funds to enable  students with intellectual disabilities to participate in Special Olympics.  Some of these schools also incorporated Special Olympics coaching and  activities into class time for students. In addition, a few schools and  districts we visited partnered with other community organizations to  provide extracurricular athletic opportunities. In Maryland, one high  school we visited collaborated with a local golf club to provide  extracurricular golf to students with disabilities and an elementary school  partnered with the city\u2019s parks and recreation program to provide a sports  program for these students.", "More recently, it introdced pted owling    to ddress chllenge tht ditrictced    regrding the lck of sufficient ner of    dent to form  tem or gret dince   etween ditrict tht mde regr competition    difficlt.

For instance, a number  of district officials said coaches do not receive training specifically on how  to work with students with disabilities. Some parents we spoke with said  that coaches who do not have such training can be overly focused on  winning and fail to fully include students with disabilities on their teams.  Other parents noted that coaches are rarely at IEP meetings, and one  parent in Minnesota told us that a coach improperly removed her child  from a team for being academically ineligible without considering the  student\u2019s IEP. Additionally, some states and districts lacked information  on how to implement new adapted athletic programs for students with  disabilities. For example, while the Florida High School Athletic  Association planned to initiate a wheelchair track event in the coming  year, state and district officials we spoke with said they had questions  about how eligibility would be determined and how to provide the  equipment needed for these students to participate. Other state athletic  associations we interviewed were hesitant to consider offering adapted  athletic programs because they did not know how competitive events  would be held or how teams would be formed.", "Further, some districts lacked information and clarity regarding their  responsibilities to provide opportunities under Section 504 for students  with disabilities who want to participate in extracurricular athletics equal  to those provided to other students. Officials in two districts and several  disability associations told us that Education\u2019s Section 504 regulations  regarding schools\u2019 responsibilities to provide extracurricular opportunities  are ambiguous. For example, a few disability associations noted that there  is lack of clarity regarding how \u201cequal opportunity\u201d should be defined.  Officials from another district questioned whether their responsibilities  included providing specifically designed programs for students with  disabilities, such as separate adapted athletics, particularly within a school  environment focused on greater inclusion for students with disabilities.", "State, district, and school officials often cited budget constraints as  another key challenge to expanding athletic opportunities to all students,  including those with disabilities. Officials from seven of the 10 districts we  visited said that overall budget constraints have affected funding for their  entire athletics program, including funds for personnel and equipment. For  example, a rural district we visited in Florida told us that they do not have  the resources to fund many personnel positions or buy equipment and that  they had to eliminate their athletic director position this year. Another  district in California told us that the state\u2019s budget situation has negatively  impacted all extracurricular athletics and the district is considering  dropping their sports teams in the near future. In addition, district officials  cited as a concern the high cost of transporting students with disabilities.  Officials in one district in Florida noted that transporting students with  disabilities was the largest cost in the district\u2019s extracurricular athletic  program. Some school and district officials we spoke with had concerns  about the facilities used for competitions. A district official in Florida  noted that many facilities are old and the costs associated with making  these fields accessible for students with disabilities would be challenging.

Beyond technical assistance to current or  prospective grantees for special education grants, OSEP has not provided  any other relevant information or support. OSEP officials said that OSEP  has not used its limited resources to provide such information or support  because IDEA\u2019s monitoring priorities are focused on other areas and the  office has not received relevant concerns or complaints from states,  schools, or parents.", "Similarly, OCR has not widely disseminated any detailed guidance or  information on schools\u2019 responsibilities to provide opportunities in PE or  extracurricular athletics for students with disabilities under Section 504,  according to agency officials and our review of OCR\u2019s Web site. Based on  data from OCR officials, 12,543 complaints were made to its office, from  fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2009, regarding elementary and secondary  school students with disabilities. Of these, 108 of the complaints filed  between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2009 (less than 1 percent)  pertained to discrimination regarding student participation in PE or  extracurricular athletics. From these 108 complaints, we reviewed a  subset of 20 and found that 16 alleged that a student was denied equal  opportunity to participate in extracurricular athletics. When resolving a  Section 504 complaint investigation, OCR may provide detailed guidance  or training to help individual districts or schools meet their responsibilities  regarding PE or athletics. However, according to OCR officials, such  guidance is tailored to the needs of the district or school based on facts  obtained through an OCR investigation, and OCR has not yet issued  guidance specifically on Section 504\u2019s requirements concerning PE or  athletics. Our review of OCR guidance found several documents that state  that students with disabilities may not be excluded on the basis of a  disability from an extracurricular activity, which may include athletics,  and that students must be provided opportunities to participate in these  activities equal to those of other students. However, with regard to PE and  extracurricular athletics, these documents do not provide information  beyond what is stated in the Section 504 regulations. In contrast, OCR has  provided more detailed guidance in other civil rights areas, such as letters,  pamphlets, and question and answer sheets. OCR officials said they have  not yet issued additional guidance on extracurricular athletic  opportunities for students with disabilities in part due to resource  constraints and their focus on other areas of civil rights, such as gender  discrimination in athletics or harassment based on race, sex, and  disability. They also noted that these areas have received more official  complaints and persistent concerns from constituents such as parents and  community groups.", "Through several grant programs, Education has administered a relatively  small amount of funds specifically to support PE or extracurricular  athletic opportunities for students with disabilities. For example, OSEP  administers a grant program that provides funding to institutes of higher  education for the development of special education personnel. In fiscal  year 2009, of the $91 million administered for these grants, about 2 percent  was used to support programs intended to provide undergraduate or  graduate training in the area of adapted PE. In the same fiscal year, OSEP  also administered about $8 million, as specifically directed by Congress, to  support Special Olympics programs. These federal funds are administered  under the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004 and are  intended to increase the participation of individuals with intellectual  disabilities in sports and competitive activities. They are also used to  design and implement Special Olympics education programs that can be  integrated into classroom instruction. In addition, the Office of Safe and  Drug-Free Schools (OSDFS) administers the Carol M. White Physical  Education Program\u2014the only dedicated PE program sponsored by  Education. However, according to OSDFS officials, less than 1 percent of  the program\u2019s overall funding of $77 million in fiscal year 2009 was used to  serve the specific needs of students with disabilities.

Officials from another state noted that Education could  collect information on promising practices and share these with institutes of  higher education that offer PE teacher training programs. Additionally,  officials from 14 out of 15 districts we interviewed indicated that additional  information or resources from Education on how to offer PE or  extracurricular athletic opportunities to students with disabilities would be  useful. For example, an adapted PE coordinator in a California district said  that while he draws on existing informational resources, such as private  sector Web sites and state or local conferences, he is constantly looking  for additional information from others in his field on good practices and  policies. Similarly, a PE and health director in a Florida district noted that as  more states implement new wheelchair track and field activities in the  general high school athletic program, supporting information and  procedural practices would be helpful.", "Further, a number of officials from various associations we interviewed,  including those representing special education, PE, and adapted sports,  said that Education should share information on successful practices or  provide informational resources such as factsheets or toolkits. Some  association officials also said that Education could give additional  attention to PE or extracurricular athletics, by providing information  online or promoting greater awareness through media campaigns.

Specifically, one district official noted that the lack of clarity in federal  requirements regarding how schools should define and provide equal  opportunities serves as a disincentive for schools to take proactive steps  to provide additional opportunities for students with disabilities. Another  said that while most districts give a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to provide equal  opportunities in extracurricular activities, including athletics, district  officials probably do not fully understand what it means to provide equal  opportunities until a problem arises, such as parent concerns or  complaints. According to this official, districts would benefit from  additional information on the legal issues or processes involved in  allowing students with disabilities to participate in extracurricular  athletics, as well as how to document instances in which a student is or is  not allowed to participate. Officials from another district noted that school  responsibilities related to special education services or supports for  activities that occurred after school, such as extracurricular athletics, as  opposed to those during the school day, were not entirely clear. Similarly,  officials from several disability groups noted that OCR could do more to  ensure that schools provide equal opportunities in extracurricular  athletics, such as by reminding schools of their responsibilities and what  they entail (e.g., through informational factsheets).

Garnering  additional resources to provide such opportunities is difficult at a time  when states and districts are operating under severe fiscal constraints.  However, certain districts and schools may have developed approaches or  activities to engage students with disabilities more fully in the PE  classroom or in extracurricular athletics, and leveraging their expertise  could be helpful to other schools that face challenges in these areas. Some  schools may also be uncertain about their exact responsibilities to provide  opportunities to students with disabilities equal to those of other students,  particularly regarding extracurricular athletics. Without additional  clarification from Education, schools may not be providing some students  full access to these opportunities.

To calculate the percentage of  students with disabilities in these studies who did not participate in sports,  we included students who reported not participating in any extracurricular  activities, as well as students who reported participating in some  extracurricular activities but not sports. SEELS and NLTS2 consist of  nationally representative samples of students who received special  education services. Students in SEELS were 6 to 12 years old and in at  least the first grade in 1999, and students in NLTS2 were 13 to 16 years old  and in at least the seventh grade in 2000 (see table 2).", "We selected these sources, in consultation with GAO methodologists,  because they contained nationally representative information about the  participation of students with disabilities in PE and extracurricular  athletics and were determined to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of our report.
