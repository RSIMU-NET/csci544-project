In addition, GAO found that HCFA could improve its regulatory approach to ensuring good HMO performance by adopting private-sector practices, such as: (1) requiring that HMO undergo accreditation reviews to obtain contracts with Medicare; and (2) requiring information about the care provided to beneficiaries to evaluate HMO performance when making contract decisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Congress is considering ways to attract Medicare beneficiaries to health maintenance organizations (HMO) and other forms of managed care in hopes of containing cost growth while preserving or improving quality and access to care.

In contrast, HMOs enroll 25 percent of the employed population. Recent growth of HMO enrollment in both Medicare and employed populations has been rapid. The number of Medicare HMO risk contracts increased 70 percent, to 154, in the 2 years preceding January 1995.", "HMOs offer the potential to coordinate all the services needed to treat a patient while controlling for overuse of costly services. The incentive for HMOs to control utilization comes from the payment method in which HMOs are paid a fixed amount per beneficiary for providing health care services. HMOs bear the financial risk for ensuring that their costs do not exceed their fixed payments.", "This report responds to your request that we review federal oversight of HMOs that enroll Medicare beneficiaries. Specifically, this letter responds to your interest in (1) the Health Care Financing Administration\u2019s (HCFA) monitoring of HMOs\u2019 compliance with federal quality assurance standards, (2) HCFA\u2019s enforcement actions against HMOs that do not meet federal standards, (3) the effectiveness of the process available to beneficiaries to appeal an HMO\u2019s decision to deny care, and (4) approaches the private sector is taking to assure HMO beneficiaries of quality care.

Under capitation, Medicare pays HMOs a fixed amount per month for each beneficiary. This method typically places HMOs at risk for health costs, thereby giving them a financial incentive to control the use of services, emphasize preventative care, and avoid unnecessary care.

For example, initial legislation authorizing a Medicare HMO program required quality of care standards at least equal to those prevailing in the HMO\u2019s service area. In addition, HMOs had to have sufficient operating experience and enrollment to permit evaluation of their capacity to provide appropriate care, and to sustain financial losses if the Medicare payment did not cover costs.", "Federal standards were strengthened as the government gained experience with HMOs. Currently, performance standards for HMOs serving Medicare beneficiaries are designed to safeguard beneficiary interests by ensuring the following:", "Plans have adequate finances and management. HMOs must meet financial solvency requirements, have minimum enrollments necessary to assume the financial risks, and provide adequate administration and management.", "Plans manage quality, utilization, and access to medical care. Plans must operate internal quality assurance systems to detect and correct patterns of underservice and poor quality care, provide reasonable access to specialists and services, and not transfer excessive financial risk to providers.", "Plans treat enrollees fairly. HMOs must use fair marketing practices that do not mislead or confuse enrollees, must provide necessary and covered services, and must follow equitable grievance and appeal procedures.", "Before an HMO may participate in Medicare, HCFA conducts a review to determine if the HMO meets federal requirements. During this \u201ccertification\u201d review, HCFA looks at several indicators of the HMO\u2019s ability to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. These indicators include documentation of financial condition, marketing projections, qualifications of management staff, and management information systems. After awarding a Medicare contract to an HMO, HCFA monitors its performance for continued compliance with federal requirements. HCFA also contracts with peer review organizations (PRO)\u2014independent, state-based organizations that use local doctors and nurses\u2014to assess quality of care provided to beneficiaries.", "HCFA has a variety of tools available to enforce compliance with standards.

The HMO questioned these findings, leading to a special PRO review and to the events discussed below.", "In 1992 and 1993 the PRO found serious quality problems in most of the risk contract HMOs in the Florida Medicare market, which has about 17 percent of all Medicare HMO enrollees. PRO review of hospitalized patients at one HMO, for example, raised serious issues about quality in 25 percent of the 109 cases sampled. After reviewing PRO findings, an internal HCFA task force suggested special investigations of quality assurance and utilization management practices at all Florida Medicare risk HMOs. PRO sampling of care in Florida Medicare HMOs, for example, found patterns of quality problems, including incorrect diagnoses, inappropriate assessment of test results, inappropriate treatment plans, underutilization, access concerns, delays in treatment, and treatment that was not competent or timely. Specific cases included the following:", "Delay in treatment. A beneficiary suffered recurrent urinary tract infections, tested positive for protein and blood in the urine, and had test results that suggested the presence of prostate cancer. Several months passed before the HMO referred him to a urologist and before the urologist performed further tests. The patient ended up in a hospital emergency room, and was treated for undiagnosed bladder cancer that had perforated the large intestine.", "Treatment not competent or timely. A beneficiary was treated with a blood-thinning drug that requires careful monitoring to avoid excessive bleeding. As a result of inadequate monitoring, the patient was admitted to a hospital with internal bleeding, which was found to be due to an excess of the blood-thinning drug.", "Denial of access. In a 24-hour period, a beneficiary with signs and symptoms of both pneumonia and a heart attack twice sought and was denied admission to a hospital. The HMO primary care physician concurred with both denials of admission. After the second attempt, the patient died on the way to his primary care physician.", "HCFA\u2019s oversight of one of the Florida risk HMOs illustrates the pattern that has emerged between HCFA and HMOs that do not take prompt actions to correct performance problems.

During this period, HCFA undertook special studies and received PRO reports that indicated continuing problems with quality of care. Nevertheless, it allowed the HMO to continue enrolling beneficiaries and operating as freely as a fully compliant HMO, until HCFA\u2019s 1994 investigation of quality assurance practices led to voluntary enrollment restrictions at selected medical centers. From 1988 to 1994, the HMO maintained and increased its revenues from Medicare by enrolling over 336,500 beneficiaries to replace the over 269,000 who disenrolled. The HMO had Medicare revenues in 1994 that exceeded $1 billion and constituted 72 percent of its total revenues.", "HCFA recently determined that the South Florida HMO has been responsive to its 1994 findings and in January 1995 approved the HMO\u2019s corrective action plan.

NCQA recently found many HMOs out of compliance with its standards. Of the 15 Florida Medicare plans NCQA had reviewed as of December 1994, only 1 received full accreditation, 8 received less than full accreditation, and 6 were denied accreditation.", "HCFA efforts to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality care from HMOs continues to be inadequate for three reasons.

The reviews check only that an HMO has procedures and staff capable of quality assurance and utilization management\u2014they do not check for effective operation of these processes. While HCFA has PROs under contract to review the medical care provided to HMO enrollees, HCFA does not link its contract compliance monitoring with PROs\u2019 monitoring, nor does it draw on PRO staff expertise that could help verify whether HMOs\u2019 quality assurance programs actually work. This explains why PROs were able to identify patterns of quality of care problems\u2014as they did in 1988, 1991, and 1993 at the South Florida HMO\u2014at the same time HCFA contract monitors cited no problems with the HMO\u2019s compliance with quality standards.", "HCFA\u2019s routine review and certification of an HMO\u2019s quality assurance program is completed without the participation of trained clinical staff and without systematic consideration of PRO findings. A routine HCFA review visit at an HMO generally involves about three people, without specialized clinical or quality assurance training, who spend a week or less focused largely on Medicare requirements for administration, management, and beneficiary services rather than on medical quality assurance. About a third of staff time is typically spent on quality-related matters. Monitoring officials of HCFA headquarters and in regions expressed the need for added trained staff to properly assess HMOs\u2019 quality assurance systems.", "In contrast with HCFA\u2019s approach, NCQA reviews last about a week, but focus primarily on quality assurance.

Through these efforts, HCFA is seeking to improve its current HMO certification process and to assess ways to coordinate with other organizations that oversee HMOs.

In the fee-for-service sector, claims data are available and can be used to detect potential overutilization of services. No comparable data exist in the Medicare HMO program to detect potential underutilization. As a result, even such basic information as hospitalization rates; the use of home health care; or the number of people receiving preventive services, such as mammograms, is unknown.", "Federal standards require that HMOs have information systems to report utilization data and management systems to monitor utilization of services. Yet HMOs often lack these data, and HCFA has not required that such data be standardized or that the data be submitted to HCFA and to the PROs. HCFA has broad legal authority to require that HMOs regularly report a wide variety of statistical information to the federal government. This includes specific authority to require data on patterns of utilization of medical services in HMOs, and the availability and acceptability of those services.", "In contrast with HCFA, the private sector has, over the past few years, moved to develop information and data standards that could enable purchasers and consumers to compare different HMOs. To enable such assessment of health plans\u2019 cost effectiveness and performance, a group of large employers and HMOs working with NCQA are developing the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS). These data constitute a set of performance measures to evaluate plans\u2019 quality of care, access to care, member satisfaction, utilization of services, and financial stability. Some employers already require their plans to submit HEDIS-based information.", "HCFA has now picked up on the private sector\u2019s approach and has begun developing HEDIS-type HMO performance measures geared to services provided to elderly Medicare beneficiaries.

The agency does not routinely assess whether HMO risk-sharing arrangements create a significant incentive to underserve, although the Congress gave the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authority, beginning April 1, 1991, to limit arrangements that it found provided excessive incentive to underserve. As of April 1995, HHS was still developing regulations and had not developed methods for gauging how much risk an HMO can legitimately pass to providers, or requirements that providers must meet to accept such risk.", "One HMO that a PRO identified as having an unusually high number of quality of care problems has been a concern to HCFA reviewers for several years because of its financial risk arrangements with providers. Under its risk-sharing arrangement, the HMO takes about 23 percent of its capitated payment for ambulatory services to administer the program and uses the remaining 77 percent to make capitated payments to providers. Over the years, several providers have lost money on care they provided to the HMO\u2019s patients.", "These providers\u2014often individual physicians or small physician groups\u2014are financially responsible to provide the HMO\u2019s enrollees all of their needed ambulatory services. Under such arrangements, every time a patient uses a primary care physician or specialist, or obtains diagnostic tests, the money comes out of the capitated payments the HMO makes to the provider responsible for delivering and managing the care.

As highlighted earlier, the cases we reviewed for this report illustrate this problem.", "The Congress granted HCFA authority to impose sanctions or monetary penalties on HMOs that fail to meet federal standards. HCFA\u2019s sanction authorities include stopping enrollment, stopping payment for new Medicare enrollees, imposing monetary penalties, and revoking Medicare contracts. HCFA can impose these sanctions or penalties for such actions as abusive marketing or underserving beneficiaries. Although the Congress first gave HCFA sanction authority in 1986, it was not until 1994 that HCFA issued regulations implementing this authority.", "Pursuing sanctions against noncompliant HMOs can be an administratively cumbersome and staff-intensive process, according to HCFA officials. HCFA\u2019s enforcement approach is to seek to document the causes of an HMO\u2019s problems and to attempt to get the HMO to correct problems, without resorting to sanctions.", "Under this approach, after HCFA staff show that an HMO is not meeting federal standards, the HMO then has an opportunity to address deficiencies by developing a corrective action plan. If the HMO does not implement the corrective action or the action is inadequate, then HCFA staff investigate the HMO\u2019s operations to further document the problems. An investigation could result in HCFA finding noncompliance and requesting a new corrective action plan. The process can then repeat itself.", "The outcome of this approach is that an HMO, without sanction, can take years before correcting identified deficiencies. We question whether this serves the best interests of Medicare or HMO beneficiaries. Two cases illustrate this:", "An Illinois HMO enrolled 29,600 people during a period of marketing abuses. In 1991, while the HMO was under investigation nationally for Medicare HMO marketing abuses, it purchased an Illinois HMO with a Medicare contract. By early 1992, HCFA noted that one-third of new enrollees in the plan disenrolled within 3 months. Moreover, HCFA began receiving beneficiary complaints about salespersons\u2019 misrepresentations and high-pressure tactics. HCFA\u2019s March 1994 review of the HMO\u2019s marketing cited numerous instances of deceptive and high-pressure sales tactics, including misrepresentation. HCFA also found instances of prohibited payments or gifts to induce people to enroll. In April 1994, the HMO submitted a corrective action plan addressing its marketing tactics and supervision of commissioned sales agents. In August 1994, HCFA and the HMO agreed on milestones for lowering the HMO\u2019s disenrollment rates. HCFA is monitoring the HMO\u2019s progress toward lowering its disenrollment and complaint rates. (See table I.1.)", "A California HMO tripled Medicare membership during a period when provider claims were not promptly paid and beneficiaries did not receive their appeal rights. HCFA\u2019s 1992 monitoring report noted the HMO\u2019s late payment of claims from providers and failure to process beneficiary appeals in a timely manner. The HMO submitted a corrective action plan to HCFA and for the next 2 years reported progress in achieving compliance. In 1994, however, HCFA found that the problems persisted. HCFA concluded that the HMO lacked sufficient staff and systems to organize, plan, control, and evaluate the administrative and management aspects of its Medicare operations. For example, HCFA found that the HMO failed to pay in a timely manner over 64 percent of the claims in a sample HCFA reviewed. In over 62 percent of a sample of appeals cases, HCFA found that the HMO failed to forward beneficiaries\u2019 appeals to HCFA within the specified 60 days. HCFA\u2019s February 1995 visit found that the HMO had made substantial improvements in processing claims and appeals, although problems remained. HCFA found additional unrelated problems as well. The HMO submitted a corrective action plan\u2014its third in 3 years\u2014in April 1995. In May 1995, HCFA approved most of the elements in the plan. The HMO submitted a revised corrective action plan addressing the remaining elements in June 1995. (See table I.2.)", "HCFA does not routinely release the results of its monitoring visits, or the comparative performance indicators it collects, to the public. Consequently, when an HMO violates federal standards, Medicare beneficiaries could remain unaware of problems that could influence their decision to join or remain enrolled in that HMO. HCFA\u2019s reluctance to disclose HMO-specific information it develops can work to the benefit of poor-performing HMOs, to the detriment of beneficiaries who make less-informed selections, and to the detriment of HMOs that comply with standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appeal Process Is Slow and Places Beneficiaries at Financial Risk", "paragraphs": ["Although intended to be a beneficiary protection against potential underservice by HMOs, the appeal process is too slow to effectively resolve disputes over services that beneficiaries believe are urgently needed. Moreover, some HMOs have extended the process even more by not processing beneficiaries\u2019 appeals within the prescribed time frames. This results in some beneficiaries returning to fee-for-service Medicare to obtain the services they believe they need, while others remain in HMOs but incur substantial out-of-pocket expenses with little certainty of repayment.", "Under Medicare regulations, beneficiaries in HMOs may appeal denials of service or the HMO\u2019s refusal to pay for services obtained from out-of-plan providers. The appeal process requires first that the HMO deny the service and second that the beneficiary ask for a reconsideration of the denial. If the reconsideration decision is not fully favorable to the beneficiary, the HMO is required to send the denial, along with medical information concerning the disputed services, to a HCFA contractor that adjudicates such denials. Since 1989, HCFA has performed its appeal reconsideration function through a contractor\u2014the Network Design Group (NDG) of Pittsford, New York. NDG hires physicians, nurses, and other clinical staff to evaluate beneficiaries\u2019 medical need for contested services and make reconsideration decisions.", "Under current HCFA standards, the process allows up to 6 months from the initial determination before an HMO must forward an appeal to HCFA, as shown in figure 1. Some HMOs take longer than HCFA standards, contributing to further delays. For instance, although HCFA allows HMOs a maximum of 60 days to reconsider a beneficiary\u2019s appeal, HCFA has found that several HMOs in California and Florida inappropriately retained beneficiary appeals between 130 and 200 days, on the average, before forwarding them to HCFA\u2019s adjudication contractor.", "Beneficiaries appealing their HMOs\u2019 coverage denial for nursing home care, home health care, or urgently needed care may find the process does not work quickly enough. In addition to the time it takes for an appeal to reach HCFA, most cases that reach HCFA for reconsideration have taken longer to resolve than the target of 30 days that HCFA and its contractor strive for. In 1993, 38 percent of appeals to HCFA were straightforward enough for HCFA\u2019s contractor to decide within 30 days. About 45 percent required about 3-1/2 months. More complex cases, where medical information was missing or where Medicare coverage rules were unclear, took over 6 months.", "Three examples illustrate how the process works for Medicare beneficiaries:", "A newly enrolled beneficiary requested physical therapy from an HMO physician to alleviate back pain. The beneficiary had suffered for years from severe back problems, which had been controlled by physical therapy. Although the HMO physician prescribed 17 sessions of physical therapy, the plan covered only one session. The beneficiary unsuccessfully appealed to the HMO and HCFA. More than a year after her therapy services were denied, the beneficiary was still waiting for a decision from an Administrative Law Judge.", "A beneficiary finding himself unable to walk or urinate was admitted to a hospital not affiliated with his HMO. He was discharged 2 weeks later only to be readmitted the next day after falling at home. The HMO denied the hospital\u2019s claim for $23,600 in services because it did not consider the need for care an emergency. The hospital billed the beneficiary. HCFA\u2019s reconsideration contractor concluded that the hospital services were needed to prevent renal failure, infection, and other complications. HCFA\u2019s contractor found the HMO liable for the cost of the hospital services\u2014over 7 months after the HMO\u2019s initial denial.", "Following surgery for lung cancer, a beneficiary repeatedly complained of pain and tenderness in the chest. X rays done shortly after surgery indicated possible remaining cancer, but no follow-up was done. After 14 months of continued complaints of pain, externally visible swelling led to new tests and the diagnosis that cancer had spread to the chest wall. An HMO oncologist explained that the only treatment available through the HMO had a modest success rate, and expressed willingness to refer the patient to a non-HMO center offering another treatment with a reported high success rate. The HMO denied the beneficiary\u2019s request. The beneficiary requested the services two more times. Although the HMO denied the services three times, it did not inform the beneficiary of his right to appeal. The HMO forwarded the case to HCFA for reconsideration after the third denial. At this point, the beneficiary learned from HCFA\u2019s contractor of the ongoing appeal and his right for reconsideration. HCFA\u2019s contractor upheld the HMO denial because of the experimental nature of the requested treatment and because the HMO offered a treatment considered appropriate. The beneficiary paid for $13,000 in services he obtained from the non-HMO center prior to deciding to return to fee-for-service, where Medicare covered the treatment for some beneficiaries.", "Medicare HMO beneficiaries who pay for services they believe are needed may be liable for those costs. In 1994, HCFA decided over 3,100 appeals, 80 percent of which were denied claims for reimbursement of services obtained from providers not affiliated with the HMO. The average claim was about $4,300, totaling over $15 million in disputed claims. HCFA\u2019s reconsideration contractor upheld HMO denials in 64 percent of the appeals, leaving beneficiaries liable for over $11 million in claims.", "HCFA is aware of the potential for improving the appeal process and has taken some steps toward this end. In November 1994, HCFA clarified its rules, allowing a beneficiary to appeal without a written denial notice from the plan. This could remove a significant barrier that beneficiaries in some HMOs faced in initiating appeals.", "HCFA also issued a rule in November 1994 extending to beneficiaries in HMOs the right to obtain expedited PRO review of HMO decisions to discharge them from a hospital.

In addition, three HCFA regional offices, accounting for about three-fourths of Medicare HMO enrollments, have implemented an automated tracking system for complaints.", "Beginning in 1994, HCFA has more aggressively used its regulatory authority under title 13 of the Public Health Service Act to get at root causes of HMO quality assurance problems. HCFA officials explained that they use the results to work cooperatively with plans\u2019 top management to correct weaknesses. Four investigations have been conducted since July 1994 on HMOs with apparent quality assurance problems, and a fifth was recently started. The first three of these investigations were done at Florida HMOs and resulted in findings of noncompliance with federal standards. The experience of designing and conducting these investigations provides an excellent basis for HCFA to design routine monitoring reviews that test HMOs\u2019 internal quality assurance. However, the experience gained from these investigations shows that increased staffing with better training or qualifications may be necessary for HCFA\u2019s routine monitoring.", "HCFA also announced that it plans to begin site visits to HMOs annually, beginning in fiscal 1996. Annual reviews may benefit where HCFA needs follow-up verification that HMOs have corrected deficiencies. They also may permit HCFA to focus in any one year on a particular aspect of HMO operations, potentially increasing effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HCFA recognizes that it needs to be more active as a sponsor for beneficiaries enrolling in Medicare HMOs. This entails selecting qualified HMOs to participate in the program, protecting beneficiaries\u2019 interests after they join an HMO, and informing beneficiaries of HMO performance. Although HCFA, to its credit, has taken a number of positive actions, it has not adequately developed and staffed routine monitoring of HMOs\u2019 quality assurance and other key operations to protect beneficiaries\u2019 interests; taken actions to obtain prompt compliance with existing quality-of-care or other beneficiary protection standards from those HMOs that are slow to correct problems; or given Medicare beneficiaries available information that could help them decide to enroll or to remain enrolled in an HMO.", "Moreover, HCFA has not issued regulations, originally called for in 1986 legislation, defining acceptable levels of financial risk an HMO can transfer to subcontracted providers.", "Private sector progress, weighed against continued shortcomings in HCFA\u2019s current compliance approach, suggests that HCFA needs to overhaul its compliance approach to be more consumer-oriented. This would include forbidding noncompliant HMOs from continuing to enroll beneficiaries, and publishing available data that beneficiaries can use to gauge HMOs\u2019 relative performances. In addition, HCFA could strengthen its quality assurance review efforts and streamline its beneficiary appeal process. We have recommended a variety of similar changes over the past decade and have observed some improvements in monitoring. But HCFA has remained reluctant to take strong enforcement actions and continues to rely on reviews of HMOs\u2019 quality assurance practices that do not verify their effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of HHS direct the HCFA Administrator to develop a new, more consumer-oriented strategy for administering the Medicare HMO program. This should include directing that HCFA routinely publish (1) comparative data it collects on HMOs such as complaint rates, disenrollment rates, and rates and outcomes of appeals, and (2) the results of its investigations or any findings of noncompliance by HMOs; verify the effective operation of all HMOs\u2019 quality assurance and utilization management practices, by applying sufficient trained staff during routine monitoring, and integrating PRO findings into HCFA\u2019s compliance monitoring reviews; and explore further options to streamline the appeal process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services disagreed with many of the report\u2019s findings, emphasizing that the report discusses monitoring and enforcement problems that occurred years ago and largely ignores substantial changes made in the last 2 years. HHS agreed, however, that there is room for improvement in the appeal process and in providing information to consumers. The full text of HHS\u2019 comments appears in appendix III.", "With regard to HHS\u2019 concerns about our use of old information, the three enforcement cases presented in this report were as timely a test of HCFA processes as we could select at the time of our review. They were the only cases identified by HCFA as either under investigation or having the potential for legal action when we began our fieldwork in June 1994. In addition, the South Florida quality assurance monitoring case was the first HMO to undergo HCFA\u2019s enhanced investigation effort to get at root causes of problems.", "HHS was also concerned that we did not examine important initiatives HCFA has recently undertaken to improve its HMO quality assurance monitoring. On the basis of additional information provided by HHS, we revised the report to recognize those initiatives that were relevant to the issues we addressed. Although we agree that HCFA\u2019s recent efforts have improved its monitoring capability, they do not change our conclusion that HCFA\u2019s routine monitoring of HMOs\u2019 quality assurance practices does not go far enough to verify compliance with federal requirements. This is primarily an issue of applying sufficient and appropriately trained staff to the task, something recognized by HCFA\u2019s own internal studies and endorsed by HCFA operations staff we met with. Other issues that affect the quality of this monitoring\u2014including the clarity and currency of regulations and standards\u2014are the subject of ongoing HCFA studies.", "HHS also disagreed with our position \u201cthat the number of times HCFA levies monetary penalties against HMOs is a measure of the intensity of . . . [the agency\u2019s] . . . oversight efforts.\u201d While we agree with HHS that monetary penalties can \u201csimply become a cost of doing business for HMOs,\u201d our point is that more aggressive enforcement can be more effective in bringing about HMO compliance. Our emphasis was on limiting HMOs\u2019 enrollment of new members as a penalty until the HMOs can clearly demonstrate that they have identified and corrected the root causes of problems. Our report also highlights another method of enforcing HMO compliance, which focuses on providing comparative HMO performance information to Medicare beneficiaries, who make marketplace decisions in selecting particular HMOs.", "HHS noted that we should have more comprehensively compared HCFA and NCQA quality assurance standards. This was not done for two reasons. The difference between NCQA and HCFA reviews that we judged most relevant was that NCQA reviews apply sufficient numbers of trained staff to provide some verification that HMOs have effective quality assurance and utilization management operations, while HCFA\u2019s routine reviews do not. The requirement for effective quality assurance and utilization management is common to both organizations\u2019 standards. Also, HCFA had a contract in process to compare its standards and review process with NCQA\u2019s and with several others.", "In the final analysis, our report emphasizes that HCFA is the primary sponsor of Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 interests when they enroll in HMOs. As such, HCFA has a responsibility to be proactive in its role, by collecting and publishing data to consumers in the marketplace, and by acting quickly and firmly to protect beneficiary interests when it has indications of poor care or abusive practices.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the date of this letter.
