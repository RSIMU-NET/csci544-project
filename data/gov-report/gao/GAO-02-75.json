The Civil Air Patrol is the civilian auxiliary of the Air Force and is  overseen by the Civil Air Patrol\u2013Air Force, a unit of the Air Education and  Training Command. Its mission includes emergency services such as  search and rescue, disaster relief, and counterdrug operations and the  promotion of aerospace education in schools. The 12th Congressional  Regional Equipment Center was established in 1992 as a demonstration  project to help municipalities and nonprofit organizations in western  Pennsylvania complete infrastructure projects that would otherwise be  too costly to undertake. The Center acquires excess heavy equipment, and  according to Center officials, rents it at below-market rates.", "Excess property items are dispensed on a first-come, first-served basis to  those activities with the same reuse priority. In fiscal year 2000, the  Department of Defense reused excess property valued at $1.9 billion, and  other federal agencies reused excess property valued at $2.5 billion.  Property that is not reused within the federal government is declared  surplus and is made available first to state and local governments and  nonprofit organizations. In fiscal year 2000, property valued at $334 million  was donated to state and local governments and others.

The three systems  also obtained over 9,000 unauthorized restricted or hazardous supplies,  even though all three have a two-tiered review and approval process for  property requests to verify, among other things, that the requested item is  within the authorized federal supply classes. The Air Force and Navy  Systems have issued guidance allowing their members to obtain property  outside the authorized federal supply classes on a case-by-case basis and  when properly justified. The Air Force requires this justification in writing.  The Army System is stricter and does not allow its members to have items  outside of the authorized federal supply classes.", "In their response to a draft of this report, Army System officials provided  another list of authorized federal supply classes that they said was used to  approve excess property requests.

According to Air Force and Patrol officials, very few  written requests for items outside of the 97 allowed federal supply classes  were submitted and approved by the Air Force during the 5-year study  period. Our analysis of Department records showed that during this  period, the Patrol received 1,720 orders for 94,000 supplies (valued at $8.1  million) that were not in the eligible federal supply classes. Civil Air Patrol  and Air Force policies differ on what must be done to obtain an item not  in the eligible federal supply classes. A Civil Air Patrol regulation states  that a request for an item not in the eligible federal supply classes may be  approved by the Air Force regional director for logistics if a valid need for  that item exists. Patrol officials stated that the list of eligible federal  supply classes is intended to be a guide, not a definitive list. However, the  Air Force instruction states that requests for items outside of the allowed  federal supply classes are approved on a case-by-case basis and require  written justification, which should be kept for 1 year. We asked for copies  of justification letters that had been submitted for ineligible items;  however, Civil Air Patrol and Air Force officials could not locate any and  could only recall receiving a few justification letters. According to an Air  Force official who oversees Patrol operations, in cases where a Patrol  regulation differs from an Air Force regulation, the Air Force regulation is  followed.  12th Congressional Regional Equipment Center. During the study period,  the Center staff submitted to Defense reutilization facilities almost 1,200  orders (for 382,000 supplies) valued at $5.1 million that were not included  in its agreement with the Defense Logistics Agency. Center officials stated  that they were aware the orders were for ineligible items but approved the  requests on the assumption that the reutilization facilities would reject any  that were deemed inappropriate. According to Center officials, fewer than  five property requests from 1995 to 2000 were rejected by the reutilization  facilities because of the type of property involved. In one instance, the  only one that officials could recall, the ineligible property included office  supplies, parachute cords, and computer equipment.", "The 12th Congressional Regional Equipment Center does not have to  obtain Department approval before submitting a property request to the  reutilization facilities, unless the item is not covered by its agreement with  the Defense Logistics Agency. In that event, according to the Defense  Logistics Agency, the Center is required to submit a written request to the  Agency, but has rarely done so. (In contrast, the Civil Air Patrol and the  Military Affiliate Radio System must have all their requests cleared by a  Department of Defense official.)  As a result, the Defense reutilization  facilities provide the only consistent external oversight of the Center\u2019s  property requests. According to Defense Logistics Agency officials, it is  not the role of the reutilization facility staff to determine whether a  property request is appropriate, although a couple of times a year the  Agency is contacted by a reutilization facility clerk questioning the  appropriateness of a particular property request submitted by the Center.

Some ineligible property seems  to be mission-related in that it is similar to property the programs are  eligible to receive. For example, 71 percent ($14.6 million) of the $20.5  million in ineligible property that the three Military Affiliate Radio Systems  obtained consisted of communication items and electrical or electronic  components.

In addition,  the Center is to only request property that is necessary for its operation.  No guidance has been issued to identify all the items covered by the  agreement. Similarly, the agreement does not address limits on the number  of ancillary items the Center can have. As a result, the Center was able to  acquire a large number of eligible supplies, including more than 20,000  hand tools and almost 900 pieces of firefighting equipment.
