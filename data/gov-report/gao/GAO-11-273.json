In response, the Department of Defense (DOD) established urgent operational needs processes to rapidly develop, modify, and field new capabilities, such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) technology, and counter-improvised explosive devices (IED) systems. However, GAO, the Defense Science Board, and others have raised concerns about the effectiveness, efficiency, and oversight of DOD's various urgent needs processes. GAO conducted this review to determine (1) what various entities exist within DOD for responding to urgent operational needs, and the extent to which there is fragmentation, overlap, or duplication; (2) the extent to which DOD has a comprehensive approach for managing and overseeing its urgent needs activities; and (3) the extent to which DOD has evaluated the potential for consolidations. To conduct this review, GAO examined DOD's urgent needs processes and collected and analyzed data from urgent needs entities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the past two decades, the fulfillment of urgent needs has evolved as a set of complex processes within the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, each of the military services, and the combatant commands to rapidly develop, equip, and field solutions and critical capabilities to the warfighter. GAO identified at least 31 entities that manage urgent needs and expedite the development of solutions to address them. Moreover, GAO found that some overlap exists. For example, there are numerous points of entry for the warfighter to submit a request for an urgently needed capability, including through the Joint Staff and each military service. Additionally, several entities have focused on developing solutions for the same subject areas, such as counter-IED and ISR capabilities, potentially resulting in duplication of efforts. For example, both the Army and the Marine Corps had their own separate efforts to develop counter-IED mine rollers. DOD has taken steps to improve its fulfillment of urgent needs, but the department does not have a comprehensive approach to manage and oversee the breadth of its activities to address capability gaps identified by warfighters in-theater. Steps DOD has taken include developing policy to guide joint urgent need efforts and working to establish a senior oversight council to help synchronize DOD's efforts. Federal internal control standards require detailed policies, procedures, and practices to help program managers achieve desired results through effective stewardship of public resources. However, DOD does not have a comprehensive, DOD-wide policy that establishes a baseline and provides a common approach for how all joint and military service urgent needs are to be addressed. Moreover, DOD lacks visibility over the full range of its urgent needs efforts. For example, DOD cannot readily identify the cost of its departmentwide urgent needs efforts, which is at least $76.9 billion based on GAO's analysis. Additionally, DOD does not have a senior-level focal point to lead the department's efforts to fulfill validated urgent needs requirements. Without DOD-wide guidance and a focal point to lead its efforts, DOD risks having duplicative, overlapping, and fragmented efforts, which can result in avoidable costs. DOD also has not comprehensively evaluated opportunities for consolidation across the department. GAO's Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide establishes that such a comprehensive analysis of alternative processes should be performed, to include a performance-based, risk-adjusted analysis of benefits and costs for each alternative. In an effort to examine various ways the department might improve its fulfillment of urgent needs, GAO identified and analyzed several potential consolidation options, ranging from consolidation of all DOD urgent needs entities to more limited consolidation of key functions. Until DOD comprehensively evaluates its strategic direction on urgent needs, it will be unaware of opportunities for consolidation as well as opportunities for increased efficiencies in its fulfillment of urgent needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop comprehensive guidance that, among other things, defines roles, responsibilities, and authorities across the department and designates a focal point to lead urgent needs efforts. GAO also recommends that DOD evaluate potential options for consolidation. DOD concurred with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the course of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. forces have  encountered changing adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures,  which challenged the Department of Defense (DOD) to quickly develop  and provide new equipment and new capabilities to address evolving  threats. Further, U.S. troops faced shortages of critical items, including  body armor, tires, and batteries. DOD\u2019s goal was to provide solutions to  urgent warfighter needs as quickly as possible to prevent loss of life or  mission failure. DOD had to look beyond traditional acquisition  procedures, to expand the use of existing processes to meet urgent needs,  and to develop new processes and entities designed to be as responsive as  possible to urgent warfighter requests. In addition to requests for  equipment from DOD\u2019s existing stocks, warfighters have requested new  capabilities, such as: technology to counter improvised explosive devices  (IED); intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) technology to  provide increased situational awareness; and command and control  equipment to enhance operations on the battlefield.", "In meeting urgent needs, it is important for DOD to efficiently use the  department\u2019s financial resources. Our past work on weapons acquisition  has shown that the department has often pursued more programs than its  resources can support. Our work also has shown that DOD has had  difficulty translating needs into programs, which often has led to cost  growth and delayed delivery of needed capabilities to the warfighter.", "Over the past 5 years, DOD has sponsored several reviews of its abilities to  rapidly respond to and field urgently needed capabilities in the 21st  century security environment. One completed by the Defense Science  Board in July 2009 identified more than 20 rapid-reaction programs and  organizations addressing DOD urgent warfighter needs. Another study,  completed by the Defense Science Board in September 2009, estimated  that these programs spent more than $50 billion over the period 2005 to  2009. Moreover, the Defense Science Board found that DOD had done  little to adopt urgent needs as a critical, ongoing DOD institutional  capability essential to addressing future threats, and it provided DOD with  recommendations on potential organizational and programmatic  consolidations in July and September 2009.", "DOD\u2019s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review cited that the department\u2019s  institutions and processes needed reforms to better support the urgent  needs of the warfighter; buy weapons that are usable, affordable, and truly  needed; and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and responsibly.  In addition, in 2007 DOD established a Chief Management Officer position  to ensure that core business operations are optimally aligned to support  the department\u2019s warfighting mission and that performance goals and  measures are established for improving and evaluating overall economy,  efficiency, and effectiveness of the department, among other functions.  Also, in August 2010, the Secretary of Defense initiated a major effort to  instill a culture of savings, and set a goal to identify $100 billion in savings  over a 5-year period.", "Our previous work has highlighted challenges with the department\u2019s  management and oversight of its urgent operational needs organizations  and processes. In April 2010, we reported that DOD\u2019s guidance over its  joint urgent needs processes was fragmented and outdated, and the  department was unable to fully assess how well those processes addressed  critical deficiencies or to measure the effectiveness of fielded solutions.  Likewise, in October 2009, we reported and testified on DOD\u2019s need to  improve visibility and coordination of its counter-IED efforts.", "We conducted this review under the authority of the Comptroller General  to conduct evaluations on his own initiative, in light of continuing  congressional interest in the department\u2019s ability to adequately fulfill  urgent needs and our prior findings regarding the department\u2019s oversight  and management of its urgent needs processes.  In addition, Title II of  Public Law Number 111-139 requires GAO to identify government  programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives with duplicative goals and  activities and to report those findings to Congress. Our objectives for this  review were to determine (1) what entities exist within DOD for  responding to urgent operational needs and to what extent, if any, there is  fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in their missions, roles, and  responsibilities; (2) to what extent DOD has a comprehensive approach  for managing and overseeing its various activities to address urgent needs  identified by warfighters in-theater; and (3) to what extent has DOD  comprehensively evaluated its urgent needs entities and processes and  identified potential for consolidations.", "To determine and describe the various entities within DOD that respond to  urgent operational needs and to what extent, if any, there is fragmentation,  overlap, or duplication, we used a data-collection instrument to obtain  information from DOD and military service entities identified in our scope  regarding their role in the urgent needs process, including how urgent  needs are submitted, validated, funded, and tracked, and how fielded  capabilities are sustained, transitioned, or terminated. We also analyzed  prior Defense Science Board reports that identified entities involved in the  process, and interviewed DOD and military service officials to gain an  understanding of mission, role, and responsibility as well as to gain insight  into other entities that may have a role in the fulfillment of urgent needs.  To determine the extent to which DOD has a comprehensive approach for  managing all of its various urgent needs processes, we analyzed strategic  management guidance as well as conducted comparative analysis of DOD  and military service policies for meeting urgent operational needs. We  interviewed DOD and military service officials to gain an understanding of  the department\u2019s efforts to satisfy urgent warfighter requirements as well  as the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of urgent needs solutions.  To determine the extent to which DOD has comprehensively evaluated its  urgent needs entities and processes, we interviewed key officials from  various DOD and military service entities as well as officials from selected  combatant commands to gain an understanding of how joint urgent  operational needs and service-based urgent needs are fulfilled. Using this  information, together with analysis of prior reports and studies and the  responses from our data-collection instrument, we developed potential  consolidation options for the department to consider. We analyzed these  options in terms of their potential capacity to gain increased efficiencies in  the visibility, coordination, management, and oversight of the  department\u2019s urgent needs processes as well as to reduce the potential for  duplication, overlap, and fragmentation.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2010 through March  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Such tactics made it evident that U.S. warfighters  were not always equipped to deal with the fast-changing tactics,  techniques, and procedures of the enemy. For example, one of the most  publicized of these adversarial capabilities was the use of IEDs. While U.S.  forces responded initially by changing tactics and techniques by  purchasing equipment locally, the department then determined it needed  to more quickly develop and deploy new capabilities. Some of DOD\u2019s  efforts to rapidly address counter-IED and other significant capability gaps  include the following:    Counter-IED Solutions\u2014Congress provides funding for joint urgent needs  related to countering IEDs through the Joint Improvised Explosive Device  Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), an organization that reports directly to the  Deputy Secretary of Defense. Congress has appropriated nearly $16 billion  through fiscal year 2009 to JIEDDO. JIEDDO has funded many counter- IED solutions to support the warfighter, including electronic jammers to  block radio-frequency signals that detonate IEDs. However, in our prior  work, we found that JIEDDO lacked full visibility over all counter-IED  initiatives throughout DOD, faced difficulties with transitioning its  counter-IED initiatives to the military services, and lacked criteria for  selecting which counter-IED training initiatives it will fund, which affect  its training investment decisions. We recommended that DOD improve its  visibility over all of DOD\u2019s counter-IED efforts, work with the military  services to develop a complete transition plan for initiatives, and define  criteria for funding training initiatives. DOD agreed with these  recommendations and identified several actions it had taken or planned to  take to address them.  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Technology\u2014DOD\u2019s  ISR systems\u2014including manned and unmanned airborne, space-borne,  maritime, and terrestrial systems\u2014play critical roles in supporting military  operations and national security missions. Effective ISR data can provide  early warning of enemy threats as well as enable U.S. military forces to  increase effectiveness, coordination, and lethality, and demand has  increased for ISR capabilities to support ongoing military operations. To  meet this growing demand, DOD is making sizeable investments in ISR  systems and related ISR capabilities. We have reported since 2005 that  DOD\u2019s ISR activities are not always well integrated and efficient,  effectiveness may be compromised by lack of visibility into operational  use of ISR assets, and agencies could better collaborate in the acquisition  of new capabilities. In January 2010, we recommended that DOD develop  overarching guidance for sharing intelligence information and that the  military services develop plans with timelines that prioritize and identify  the types of ISR data they will share. DOD agreed with these  recommendations and noted actions it planned to take to address them.", "Command and Control Equipment\u2014Urgently needed assets may include,  but are not limited to, satellite communication equipment for military  personnel who require a method for communicating with each other in  remote areas without established infrastructure, or distributed tactical  communication systems for warfighters in Afghanistan because current  handset devices do not operate adequately in the mountainous terrain. To  meet this demand, solutions are being sought from various sources that  include commercial off-the-shelf technology, other types of technology,  and other sources. We have reported on the challenges associated with  availability of such technology, including lengthy delays in the approval  and order processes. To address these and other urgent needs\u2013related  challenges, we made several recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s ability to  assess how well its processes are meeting critical warfighter needs,  address challenges with training, make decisions about when to use its  rapid acquisition authority, and make reprogramming decisions to  expedite fielding of solutions.

According to the Defense Science Board,  while DOD, the military services, and combatant commands took actions  to respond more quickly to demands to fulfill urgent needs, it became  apparent that within the last half decade the department, as well as the  acquisition community it depends on, has struggled in their ability to field  new capabilities in a disciplined, efficient, and effective way.

Some of these studies were initiated at the  direction of Congress. In fiscal year 2009, the House Armed Services  Committee approved the department\u2019s designation of a process  improvement officer who was tasked with applying Lean Six Sigma  process improvement techniques to the business practices of the  department. The committee recommended that the process improvement  officer examine the processes for rapid acquisition activities that have  been established since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began and  determine whether there were lessons learned that might be integrated  into the department\u2019s main acquisition process. The department  conducted the study and found (1) significant variability in response time  at the beginning of the process, indicating unnecessary delays; (2) senior  leadership involvement in the process enables rapid decision making; (3)  shorter decision processes and focused organizations enable quicker  response than under normal requirements; and (4) reprogramming  authority is cumbersome and adds time to the urgent needs process.  Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2009  included a provision that would require best practices and process  improvements to ensure that urgent operational needs statements and  joint urgent operational needs statements are presented to appropriate  authorities for review and validation not later than 60 days after the  documents are submitted. Specifically, the committee report noted that  over the last several years, operational commanders in Iraq had identified  urgent operational needs for MRAP vehicles, nonlethal laser dazzlers, and  other critical equipment. Further, the committee stated it was aware of  allegations that requests for some of these items not only went unmet, but  were not even presented for more than a year to the senior officials  responsible for validating the requests. In 2009, Congress required the  Secretary of Defense to commission a study by an independent  commission or a federally funded research and development center to  assess and report on the effectiveness of the processes used by DOD for  the generation of urgent operational need requirements, and the  acquisition processes used to fulfill such requirements. In response to  this requirement, the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics, asked the Defense Science Board to establish a task force to  conduct a study on the effectiveness of the processes used by the  department for the generation of urgent operational needs requirements  and the acquisition processes used to fulfill such requirements. In July  2009, the Defense Science Board released its report with  recommendations on potential consolidations necessary to rapidly field  new capabilities for the warfighter in a systematic and effective manner.", "Moreover, Section 803 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (the FY 2011 NDAA) amended the existing rapid  acquisition authority.  Previously, the authority could be used to eliminate  deficiencies that resulted in combat fatalities. The amended section now  permits the use of the authority to acquire and deploy certain supplies to  eliminate deficiencies that result in combat casualties, rather than just  combat fatalities. The amendment also increased from $100 million to $200  million the amount that can be used annually to acquire the supplies  necessary to address such deficiencies.", "Additionally, Section 804 of the FY 2011 NDAA, among other things,  requires the Secretary of Defense to review the processes for the fielding  of capabilities in response to urgent operational needs, consider  improvements to those processes, and report to the congressional defense  committees in January 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Fulfillment of Urgent Needs Involves a Number of Entities and Processes, Resulting in Fragmentation and Some Overlap of Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The fulfillment of urgent needs involves numerous joint, OSD and military  service entities, which have increased over time.

As previously reported by us and DOD, a complex set of  processes has evolved over time, involving numerous joint, OSD, and  military service entities over the past decade as the department seeks to  fulfill the capability gaps identified by warfighters. On the basis of DOD\u2019s  and our analysis, we have identified at least 31 entities that play a  significant role in the various urgent needs processes. Table 3 below  shows the 31 entities we identified and when they were established.", "Further analysis shows that these entities have three different missions  with respect to fulfilling urgent needs. First, some entities identify and  provide a quick response to threats presented by adaptive enemies, but  not always in support of urgent needs. Often these entities engage in  experimentation and rapid prototyping to accelerate the transition of  technologies to the warfighter. For example, the Rapid Reaction  Technology Office does not directly receive or validate joint or service  urgent needs, but rather anticipates disruptive threats and in response  funds solutions and new capabilities, some of which have fulfilled  validated joint urgent operational needs. Second, some entities specifically  process urgent needs and are generally involved from validation to  sourcing. For example, the joint urgent operational needs process is  overseen by Joint Staff J8, which receives and validates urgent need  requests, and the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, which facilitates a rapid  solution. In the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, various entities exist to  validate, facilitate, and source urgent needs for their respective processes.  Third, some entities focus on developing solutions in response to urgent  needs requests that have been validated, facilitated, and sourced by other  entities. These solution-development entities are mostly acquisition  program offices, such as Program Executive Office Night Vision /  Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition, which also develop  solutions in response to nonurgent needs as well as manage existing  systems. Finally, some entities are involved in two or more of the three  types of missions described above. For example, JIEDDO anticipates  threats, processes urgent needs requests, and develops solutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overlap Exists among the Numerous Entities Involved in Processing Urgent Requirements and Expediting Solutions", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis shows that overlap exists among urgent needs entities in the  roles they play as well as the capabilities for which they are responsible.  Table 4 shows the roles played by the various organizations in relation to  the activities involved in meeting urgent needs identified earlier.", "DOD entities at the joint level, and each of the services, also have their  own policies for meeting urgent needs. These policies result in seven  different processes for the fulfillment of urgent needs; additionally, the  Army Rapid Equipping Force also has an urgent needs process. For  example, warfighters may submit urgent needs, depending on their  military service and the type of need, to Joint Staff J8, JIEDDO, Army  Deputy Chief of Staff G-3/5/7, Army Rapid Equipping Force, Navy Fleet  Forces Command or Commander Pacific Fleet, Marine Corps Deputy  Commandant for Combat Development and Integration, Air Force Major  Commands, or Special Operations Command J8. These entities then  validate the submitted urgent need request and thus allow it to proceed  through their specific process. This contrasts with traditional  requirements and needs, which are generally processed under the Joint  Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS). JCIDS was  established to provide the department with an integrated, collaborative  process to identify and guide development of a broad set of new  capabilities that address the current and emerging security environment.", "Moreover, within some of the services, multiple processes and validation  points exist. For example, in the Army, urgent needs can be submitted via  two routes: (1) the warfighter can make a request to the Rapid Equipping  Force for approval by its Director; or (2) the warfighter can submit an  operational needs statement, documenting the urgent need to the Deputy  Chief of Staff for the Army G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting  Capabilities Division, for validation and prioritization. In the Air Force,  urgent needs are handled by the various major commands; however, Air  Force headquarters also has a process and an entity that can process  urgent needs that do not get fulfilled by the major commands.", "Furthermore, at the joint level, six entities facilitate urgent needs requests  and five entities provide sourcing support for urgent needs requests.  Officials from two combatant commands have expressed frustration with  the number of entities involved in the processing of urgent needs requests  and suggested that streamlining of the validation, facilitation, sourcing,  and funding processes would improve the timeliness of solutions.  Additionally, many entities track the fulfillment of urgent needs requests  and their solutions; however, most entities with a role in tracking focus  only on specific requests they process or solutions they developed. The  overlap created by numerous entities involved in processing urgent  requirements and expediting solutions may create fragmented efforts and  overall inefficiencies within DOD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Entities Respond to Requests for Similar Capabilities, Resulting in Potential Duplication of Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Multiple entities we surveyed reported a role in responding to similar  categories of urgently needed capabilities. We identified eight entities with  a role in responding to ISR capabilities, five entities with a role in  responding to counter-IED capabilities, and six entities with a role in  responding to communications, command and control, and computer  technology, among others.", "Over the course of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, multiple organizations  have been created to handle specific types of urgently needed capabilities  for urgent operational needs and these organizations also experience  overlap. For example, JIEDDO initially was established as an Army task  force and was changed to a DOD task force to meet urgent counter-IED  needs; however, counter-IED is not handled exclusively by JIEDDO, and  we have previously reported that JIEDDO and the services lack full  visibility over counter-IED initiatives throughout DOD and are at risk of  duplicating efforts. Similarly, we previously reported that many  biometrics activities are dispersed throughout DOD at many organizational  levels and that DOD has been focusing most of its efforts on quickly  fielding biometrics systems, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, to  address DOD\u2019s immediate warfighting needs without guidance to prevent  duplication of biometrics-related efforts. In 2010, the Army Biometrics  Task force was institutionalized as the Biometrics Identity Management  Agency to lead DOD activities to program, coordinate, integrate, and  synchronize biometrics technologies and capabilities. However, our  ongoing work has identified instances of potential duplication. For  example:    Both the Army and the Marine Corps continue to develop their own  counter-IED mine rollers with full or partial JIEDDO funding. The Marine  Corps\u2019 mine roller per unit cost is about $85,000 versus a cost range of  $77,000 to $225,000 per unit for the Army mine roller. However, officials  disagree about which system is most effective, and DOD has not  conducted comparative testing and evaluation of the two systems. Further,  JIEDDO officials said that JIEDDO cannot compel the services to buy one  solution over the other.", "The Navy developed a directed-energy technology to fill a critical theater  capability gap, yet JIEDDO later underwrote the Air Force\u2019s development  of the same technology to create a more powerful and faster-moving  equipment item than the Navy had developed. However, the Air Force has  now determined that its system will not meet requirements and has  deferred fielding the technology pending further study. This may have a  negative effect on the continued development of this technology by the  Navy or others for use in theater. For example, according to DOD officials,  during the recent testing of the Air Force\u2019s system, safety concerns were  noted unique to that system that may limit the warfighter\u2019s willingness to  accept the technology. However, according to Navy officials, the Navy  plans to begin fielding its system in 2011.", "While our review did find the potential for duplication, we also found  some cases where various entities took the initiative to work together,  resulting in collaboration to satisfy urgent needs. For example, the Joint  Rapid Acquisition Cell received eight validated joint urgent operational  needs requirements, and facilitated the integration of the eight separate,  but very much related, ISR and force-protection needs. Specifically, this  coordination involved the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, U.S. Central  Command, JIEDDO, and the Army to consolidate the validated  requirements, find a sponsor, and develop a solution. Approximately 6  months from the date of funding, the Army PEO\u2013Intelligence, Electronic  Warfare & Sensors, specifically Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance  and Target Acquisition, developed and fielded the Base Expeditionary  Targeting and Surveillance Sensors\u2013Combined, a flexible, moveable,  adjustable, scalable, and expeditionary base defense system for persistent  ground targeting and surveillance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have Comprehensive Guidance and Full Visibility to Effectively Manage and Oversee Its Urgent Needs", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken several steps to improve the management and oversight of  its urgent needs.

Moreover, OSD has been drafting Directive-Type Memorandum 10-002 to  establish policy, assign responsibilities, and outline procedures for the  resolution of joint urgent operational needs.

Additionally, our analysis found that DOD has a fragmented  approach in managing all of its urgent needs submissions and validated  requirements. For example, the Joint Staff, JIEDDO, the military services,  and the Special Operations Command have issued their own guidance  outlining activities involved in processing and meeting their specific  urgent needs. Through comparative analysis of policies issued by the Joint  Staff, each military service, JIEDDO, and the Special Operations Command  for managing the various urgent needs processes, we identified that the  policies often varied. Moreover, we found that Joint Staff, Navy, and Air  Force policies do not define roles and responsibilities for some activities  involved, as shown in table 5.", "As indicated in table 5, some policies include each of the activities  involved in the processing and fulfillment of urgent needs. However,  Special Operations Command, Joint Staff, Navy, and Air Force policies do  not include guidance on all the activities included in the process. For  example, we determined the following:    Joint Staff policy did not address how to provide feedback on urgent  needs that are not validated. Officials from one combatant command  expressed frustration that they received no feedback as to why joint  urgent operational needs they submitted were not validated and lacked  adequate insight to understand the decision process. However, other  policies addressed this issue. For example, Navy guidance stated that  urgent needs that were not validated would be returned to the requester  with rationale as to why or with recommendations on how to revise the  request, or both.", "The Joint Staff, Navy, and Air Force policies did not define roles and  responsibilities involved in the decision to transition, transfer, or  terminate the capability solution provided. Furthermore, Special  Operations Command, Joint Staff, and Navy policies did not address how  validated requirements would be tracked as a capability solution was  being developed.", "Also, DOD\u2019s urgent needs policies varied for transitioning or transferring  capabilities. For example:  It is JIEDDO\u2019s policy to decide within 2 years whether to transition or  transfer the capability over to a service or agency or to terminate it.", "The Special Operations Command determines at the 1-year mark  whether the capability is still needed in-theater, and if so, defines out- year funding requirements and how the funding will be obtained.", "While the Army has a process in place for transitioning urgent needs, it  is applicable only to those urgent needs that are nominated to go  through the Army\u2019s Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition  process. However, this process identifies and approves only certain  capabilities that have been nominated for sustainment, rather than  tracking all capabilities fielded for the Army\u2019s urgent needs.", "During our review, numerous officials stated the need for overarching,  uniform guidance to all entities involved in urgent needs processes. Senior  officials we spoke with stated that the department needs to provide more  comprehensive management and oversight over all of its urgent needs.  Additionally, combatant command, Joint Staff, and service officials stated  a need for policies to be explicit regarding the necessary activities that  must be addressed within the urgent needs process. For example, officials  at one combatant command stated that when submitting an urgent need  through the joint urgent operational needs process, they lacked insight  into the validation process and metrics used by the Joint Staff, as well as  guidance on how joint urgent operational needs are evaluated across the  combatant commands. An official at a different combatant command  emphasized the importance of defining which requests truly qualify as an  urgent need, and noted that the Joint Staff\u2019s requirements process lacks a  method to verify that requirements are properly defined. Moreover, Joint  Staff officials discussed the importance of defining a joint urgent  operational need, as well as criteria for what qualifies as an urgent need in  their guidance that is currently undergoing revisions. Army officials  noted that inconsistency exists regarding rapid acquisition guidance  between the Joint Staff, Army, and Air Force policies. And finally, Air  Force officials stated that urgent needs policy should include guidance on  which steps within the acquisition process should and can be waived,  deferred, or tailored in order to rapidly acquire capabilities, which would  allow acquisition personnel to more quickly address urgent needs.  Because DOD does not have baseline DOD-wide guidance that applies to  urgent operational needs processes across the department clearly defining  the roles and responsibilities of how urgent needs should be assessed,  processed, and managed\u2014including activities such as tracking the status  of a validated requirement\u2014the department continues to maintain a  fragmented approach to managing its urgent needs processes.

As indicated in figure 1 below, funding is spread unevenly  among many urgent needs entities because the entities have different roles  in the fulfillment of urgent needs. In addition, some entities like JIEDDO  and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office have access to special funds  for the fulfillment of urgent needs, while others rely on different sources  such as funding through the annual budget process or the reprogramming  or transfer of funds from other DOD programs and activities.", "Of the $76.9 billion in urgent needs funds represented in figure 1, $67.1  billion or 87.2 percent has been assigned to OSD entities, $9.5 billion or  12.4 percent to Army entities, $259 million or less than 1 percent to Navy  entities, and $33.0 million or less than 1 tenth of 1 percent to Air Force  entities.

DOD and service officials cited two impediments to full visibility:  the lack of a comprehensive tracking system to manage and oversee all  urgent needs identified by the warfighter and a lack of clearly defined  roles. Specifically, DOD and the services have disparate ways of tracking  urgent needs; some have formal databases to input information while  others use more informal methods such as e-mailing to solicit feedback.  For example, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and each of the military services  utilize electronic databases to track capability solutions as they move  through the urgent needs process. However, more than a third of the  entities involved in the process did not collect or provide the necessary  information for the joint or service-based systems to track those solutions.  Rather, there was confusion over whose role it was to collect and input  data into these tracking systems. For example, one program office that  develops urgent needs solutions uses a metric of operational readiness  levels to track the effectiveness of its solutions. However, the program  office does not provide these data to the joint or services\u2019 electronic  databases. Rather, program office officials stated they believed it was the  responsibility of the combatant command, Joint Staff, or service offices  that maintain the databases to maintain this information. However,  officials from the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, which maintains the joint  database, stated they obtain data from the other individual databases  based on what the DOD components input.", "DOD and military service officials stated the need for improvements to  tracking urgent needs. For example, some senior DOD officials stated that  they would like senior acquisition executives and other oversight officials  to review every 4 to 6 weeks how joint and service urgent needs are  progressing. Combatant command officials stated that while they have  visibility into the database for tracking joint urgent operational needs, they  do not have the same visibility into the services\u2019 databases. Specifically,  officials at one combatant command, who stated they have zero visibility  into the urgent needs being addressed by the services, cited the value in  having a global database of all service and joint urgent needs as they  develop and transition, transfer, or terminate fielded solutions.  Additionally, Army officials recognized the need for improved visibility.  Specifically the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army issued a memorandum in  April 2010 to develop a rapid acquisition / rapid equipping common  operating picture and collaboration tool as a means to increase efficiency  and transparency of Army urgent need processes. Stakeholders include  various Army entities as well as numerous other entities involved in the  process. Without full visibility into all of its urgent needs, the department,  military services, and combatant commands risk the potential for overlap  or duplication in developing capabilities to respond to urgent needs.

In April 2010, we recommended that DOD  develop an established, formal feedback mechanism or channel for the  military services to provide feedback to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint  Rapid Acquisition Cell on how well fielded solutions met urgent needs.  The department concurred with the recommendation and stated that it  would develop new DOD policy and that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would  update the Chairman\u2019s instruction to establish requirements for oversight  and management of the fulfillment of urgent needs. The majority of DOD  urgent needs entities we surveyed reported that they do not collect all the  data needed to determine how well these solutions are performing. For  example, one entity reported that information on whether a deployed  solution was successful is largely anecdotal and there is no uniformity in  the way such data are collected and reported. Additionally, while the Air  Force uses its requirements database to track the progress of systems or  solutions under development, it has not formalized metrics to assess the  performance of deployed systems or solutions, or for reporting such  performance to senior leadership.", "In April 2010, we also recommended that DOD develop and implement  standards for accurately tracking and documenting key process milestones  such as funding, acquisition, fielding, and assessment, and for updating  data management systems to create activity reports to facilitate  management review and external oversight of the process.

However, our analysis found that the department lacked a  method or metric to track the status of a validated urgent requirement  across the services and DOD components, such as whether a requirement  currently in development could be applicable to another service.  Specifically, officials from one combatant command stated that they do  not have visibility into the urgent needs being addressed at the service  level, which could be beneficial to have so that the combatant command  would have awareness of capabilities being developed and could  communicate with that particular service if the combatant command saw  it as a solution to an urgent need.

For example, the Defense Science Board Task Force  found that DOD has done little to adopt urgent needs as a critical, ongoing  DOD institutional capability essential to addressing future threats, and it  twice provided recommendations to the department about potential  consolidations. Specifically, in July 2009, the task force identified a  number of critical actions to address the situation, including a dual  acquisition path that separates \u201crapid\u201d and \u201cdeliberate\u201d acquisitions as well  as the establishment of a new agency to implement this separation, called  the Rapid Acquisition and Fielding Agency.

Contrary to these recommendations, some DOD officials  whom we interviewed across the department expressed their concern with  the creation of a new agency since the Secretary of Defense publicly  questioned why it was \u201cnecessary to bypass existing institutions and  procedures to get the capabilities needed to protect U.S. troops and fight  ongoing wars.\u201d", "According to senior OSD officials, the department has conducted studies,  including a Lean Six Sigma study, to determine lessons learned from  several independent urgent needs processes that might be integrated into  the department\u2019s main acquisition process.

We  interviewed officials from the Defense Science Board Task Force to gain  an understanding of their methodology, their findings, and their  recommendations. We developed a 46-question data-collection instrument  to collect information from the urgent needs entities identified by the  Defense Science Board report to determine the entities\u2019 roles and the  extent of their involvement in the various activities of the urgent needs  processes. For example, for each entity, we collected general information  on the mission, role, and responsibility, organizational structure, and  impetus for creation; the roles and processes the entity employs with  respect to urgent needs; and specifically how the entity is involved in the  vetting, funding, tracking, and transitioning of urgent needs. Prior to  fielding the data-collection instrument, we tested it with two entities and  adjusted the questions and layout based on the feedback we received.  Moreover, in an effort to identify any additional urgent needs entities not  captured by the Defense Science Board Task Force or by us in our  background research, we employed a \u201csnowball\u201d sampling technique,  whereby we included our list of urgent needs entities and asked each  entity (1) if it was aware of any others that are involved in the response  and fulfillment of urgent operational needs and (2) if it interfaces with any  other organizations or programs with regards to managing the urgent  operational needs process. We then contacted those entities that the  respondents had identified to better understand the population of urgent  needs related entities. After analyzing data provided as well as interviews  with DOD, military service, selected combatant command, and entity  officials, we judgmentally selected the entities included in our analysis to  exclude entities that did not meet our definition of an urgent needs  organization. For example, we did not include the department\u2019s  Commander\u2019s Emergency Response Program after reviewing its mission  and purpose. After the urgent needs entities responded to the data- collection instruments, we created a database and analyzed the variables  to gain an understanding of the mission, roles, and responsibilities, as well  as the organizational structure, and impetus for creation of the entity, and  the roles and processes the entity employs with respect to urgent needs.  On the basis of this data as well as our analyses of DOD\u2019s urgent needs  policies and guidance, the Defense Science Board Task Force report, and  other relevant documents, we identified six broad urgent needs activities  involved after the submission of an urgent needs statement: validation,  facilitation, sourcing, execution, tracking, and transition, transfer, or  termination. We then analyzed the data obtained through the data- collection instrument and other documentation to identify the prevalence  of fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in response to urgent needs  between and among the entities and within DOD more generally. In order  to present the cost analysis for each urgent needs entity in consistent  terms, all cost data in this report are in fiscal year 2010 dollars.

Likewise, we analyzed  forthcoming DOD policies, including the department\u2019s Directive-Type  Memorandum 10-002, which seeks to establish policy, assign  responsibilities, and outline procedures for the resolution of joint urgent  operational needs. We conducted comparative analysis of the policies to  identify the differences between the varying policies to identify the extent  of any fragmentation. We interviewed relevant DOD officials, including  senior defense officials within the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, including the Rapid  Fielding Directorate, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation to gain an understanding of the  totality of the department\u2019s efforts to satisfy urgent warfighter  requirements as well as on the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness  of the capability solutions developed to address urgent needs. Likewise,  we interviewed officials from the Joint Staff, selected combatant  commands, and each military service, including acquisition and Program  Management / Program Executive Officials to further our understanding of  how urgent needs are fulfilled; how the processes are managed and  overseen; and what improvements, if any, are warranted. In addition, we  interviewed officials at each entity we identified to gain an understanding  of their mission, role, and responsibilities, how data on their joint or  service-specific fulfillment of urgent needs is tracked and reported to  senior level officials, and what improvements, if any, are warranted.", "To determine the extent to which DOD comprehensively evaluated its  urgent needs entities and processes and identified potential for  consolidations, we contacted senior defense officials within the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation, selected combatant commands, and the military services to  identify and obtain any studies, reports, or analysis conducted by the  department on its fulfillment of urgent needs. Using this information,  together with analysis of prior reports and studies and the responses from  our data-collection instrument, we developed several options that DOD  may wish to consider, including a variety of consolidation options for the  entities and processes responsible for responding to urgent operational  needs. We tested and analyzed these options in terms of their potential  capacity to gain increased efficiencies in the visibility, coordination,  management, and oversight of the department\u2019s urgent needs process as  well as to reduce duplication, overlap, and fragmentation, if any.", "We visited or contacted the following offices during our review:  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Task Force, Washington,  D.C.", "Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, Washington, D.C.
