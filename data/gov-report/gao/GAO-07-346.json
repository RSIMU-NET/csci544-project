One such effort involves CBP stationing U.S. personnel overseas to evaluate the authenticity of the travel documents of certain high-risk passengers prior to boarding U.S.-bound flights. Under this pilot program, called the Immigration Advisory Program (IAP), CBP officers personally interview some passengers deemed to be high-risk and evaluate the authenticity and completeness of these passengers' travel documents. IAP officers also provide technical assistance and training to air carrier staff on the identification of improperly documented passengers destined for the United States. The IAP has been tested at several foreign airports and CBP is negotiating with other countries to expand it elsewhere and to make certain IAP sites permanent. Successful implementation of the IAP rests, in part, on CBP clearly defining the goals and objectives of the program through the development of a strategic plan. A second aviation passenger prescreening effort designed to strengthen the passenger prescreening process is intended to align international passenger prescreening with a similar program (currently under development) for prescreening passengers on domestic flights. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA)--a separate agency within DHS--is developing a domestic passenger prescreening program called Secure Flight. If CBP's international prescreening program and TSA's Secure Flight program are not effectively aligned once Secure Flight becomes operational, this could result in separate implementation requirements for air carriers and increased costs for both air carriers and the government. CBP and TSA officials stated that they are taking steps to coordinate their prescreening efforts, but they have not yet made all key policy decisions. In addition to these efforts to strengthen certain international aviation passenger prescreening procedures, one other issue requires consideration in the context of these efforts. This issue involves DHS providing the traveling public with assurances of privacy protection as required by federal privacy law. Federal privacy law requires agencies to inform the public about how the government uses their personal information. Although CBP officials have stated that they have taken and are continuing to take steps to comply with these requirements, the current prescreening process allows passenger information to be used in multiple prescreening procedures and transferred among various CBP prescreening systems in ways that are not fully explained in CBP's privacy disclosures. If CBP does not issue all appropriate disclosures, the traveling public will not be fully aware of how their personal information is being used during the passenger prescreening process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During 2005, a number of passengers that the U.S. government identified  as a security risk were identified onboard international flights traveling to  or from the United States.

The identity matching step is conducted by both  air carriers and the U.S. government. Federal requirements state that air  carriers must transmit APIS data to CBP no later than 15 minutes before  flight departure for international flights originating in the United States  and no later than 15 minutes after flight departure for international flights  bound for the United States. In addition to these data, CBP occasionally  uses commercial data or data from other government databases during  this process to help confirm a passenger\u2019s identity.", "A second prescreening activity, separate from identity matching, involves  using risk assessment tools to analyze passenger data to assess the  security risk that a passenger might pose. This constitutes an effort to  identify high-risk passengers that may not be on the No Fly or Selectee  Lists. Specifically, CBP uses an automated system, called the Automated  Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P), that uses available passenger data to  apply a set of CBP-generated targeting \u201crules\u201d that CBP has determined  are associated with increased passenger risk.

The No Fly and Selectee Lists are extracted from  the TSC\u2019s TSDB, the consolidated federal government terrorist watch list  (which contains the names of known or suspected terrorists). Persons on  the No Fly List are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation and are therefore  to be precluded from boarding an aircraft traveling to, from, or within the  United States.

This program, called  the IAP, is a pilot program that began in 2004 and was designed to  identify and target potential high-risk passengers. Under the IAP pilot,  CBP has assigned trained officers to foreign airports where they  personally interview pre-identified high-risk passengers, conduct  behavioral assessments, and evaluate the authenticity of travel documents  prior to the passenger\u2019s departure to the United States.

These data can then be instantly accessed and analyzed at headquarters so  that the information can be used to make changes to improve all of the  country\u2019s ALO locations. Another ALO program utilizes PNR data to  identify trends in document fraud, allowing its ALO network to quickly  transmit alert information into its passenger screening system so that  identified passengers can be screened further at check in prior to boarding  an aircraft.

It is important for CBP\u2019s  documentation to describe all of the steps of the prescreening process  because the interrelationship of various steps of the process allows data to  be transferred and used in ways that have not been fully disclosed.", "CBP\u2019s international prescreening process involves a wide range of  procedures and data sources that CBP utilizes to determine passenger risk  levels. According to a CBP official, to help make these prescreening  decisions, CBP collects personal data from multiple sources (including  passengers and government databases), and uses the data for several  purposes, including identity matching against the government watch list,  risk targeting, and passenger document validation. According to CBP, its  officers also use commercial data, to a limited degree, to assist them in  confirming a passenger\u2019s identity when needed. CBP\u2019s public disclosures  about APIS and ATS do not describe all of the data inputs or the extent to  which the data are combined and used in making prescreening decisions.", "As shown in Figure 4, CBP\u2019s passenger prescreening involves more data  inputs and uses of data than are described in CBP\u2019s current privacy  disclosures.", "CBP has stated that its public reporting on its use of APIS data complies  with the Privacy Act through references to previously published Privacy  Act notices about systems used during the prescreening process. However,  these references are not sufficient because they do not fully disclose  CBP\u2019s use of personal information during the prescreening process.  Specifically, CBP stated that because APIS is a system within the Treasury  Enforcement Communications System, it is described in the TECS system  of records notice, which was published in October 2001. CBP also  referenced a 2003 system of records notice for the DHS Arrival and  Departure Information System (ADIS), which interfaces with TECS, but  which CBP officials stated separately is not used by CBP in the passenger  prescreening process. However, neither of these notices specifically  describes CBP\u2019s passenger prescreening or the use of APIS or PNR data.", "Although CBP has stated that its previous privacy disclosures sufficiently  complied with federal privacy law, on November 2, 2006, DHS published a  Privacy Act system of records notice for ATS. In addition, on November  22, 2006, DHS published a privacy impact assessment for ATS. Both of  these documents refer to the ATS-P system used in CBP\u2019s aviation  passenger prescreening process. These disclosures \u2014released after CBP  received an earlier version of this report\u2014provide much more detailed  information on ATS-P as compared with prior privacy disclosures.  Nevertheless, CBP has still not published a system of records notice or a  privacy impact assessment that comprehensively describes the entire  prescreening process. For example, although CBP has published a privacy  impact assessment for APIS and ATS, neither disclosure describes the  combined use of APIS and PNR data in passenger prescreening decision- making. The disclosures also do not describe that during the prescreening  process CBP officers are able to access personal data obtained from  commercial providers.", "Because CBP\u2019s development and operation of its international passenger  prescreening process has not been accompanied by the publication of  Privacy Act notices or E-Government Act privacy impact assessments that  fully describe the use of personal data and the steps taken to protect  privacy, the public may not be aware of the different ways that their  information is being used or protected, as required by law. Although  maintaining that their prior privacy disclosures were fully compliant with  federal privacy law, CBP stated in May 2006, and DHS reiterated in its  official comments to this report in January 2007, that CBP plans to revise  the APIS privacy impact assessment and issue a system of records notice  for APIS. However, no deadline has been given for when these steps will  be completed.

One key security measure is  the prescreening of passengers on international flights\u2014an important step  to ensure that high-risk passengers do not board international flights  traveling to or from the United States. Another important effort involves  ensuring that international and domestic prescreening programs are fully  aligned to maximize their effectiveness and cost efficiency for the  government, airline industry and passengers.  In conjunction with  conducting these important prescreening activities, DHS must also be  vigilant about ensuring that it is in full compliance with public privacy  requirements.", "CBP is currently taking various and important steps to strengthen the  international aviation passenger prescreening process. CBP\u2019s recent  publication of a proposed rule for changing the procedures and timing for  conducting passenger identity matching is an important step. Another  important effort to strengthen the international aviation passenger  prescreening process is aligning the process with TSA\u2019s new domestic  prescreening program. Efforts to significantly expand the IAP may also  strengthen the prescreening process, although CBP will need to ensure  that sufficient data are collected to allow for appropriate risk assessments  and evaluations.", "While CBP recognizes and is taking steps to address many of the  challenges it faces in implementing its various planned prescreening  programs, there are three areas, in particular, that require further planning  and monitoring. These areas include:    More fully incorporating risk management principles in the IAP  pilot. CBP is not benefiting from all of the information that could be  learned from the pilot program and remains at risk of expanding the  program or making IAP sites permanent without establishing a clear  vision of what the program is intended to accomplish and how its  success will be evaluated and measured. Without completing a  strategic plan for the IAP, the program may not realize its full potential  security benefits and could require substantial revisions after  implementation.", "Aligning international and domestic passenger prescreening  programs. If these two prescreening efforts are not effectively  coordinated with each other, air carriers and other stakeholders could  be unnecessarily inconvenienced and experience potentially avoidable  costs. The U.S. government could incur avoidable costs as well, if the  programs are not properly coordinated and aligned. So far, CBP and  TSA have taken some steps to coordinate their efforts\u2014for example,  they have announced their intention to develop a single portal for  prescreening passengers on domestic and international flights.  However, CBP and TSA have not yet made all of the key decisions  necessary to align the two processes nor have they completed a  timetable for completing this process.", "Attaining full compliance with privacy laws.

DHS generally concurred with the three report recommendations and  provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.  DOJ also provided technical comments, which we incorporated where  appropriate.", "Regarding the actions DHS reported taking to address the  recommendations, DHS stated that it has completed an IAP Strategic Plan  and that the plan has been sent for Departmental review. DHS provided a  copy of the draft IAP Strategic Plan to GAO. While DHS stated that the  draft strategic plan outlines the measures that CBP intends to use to  assess the IAP\u2019s performance, it is not yet clear from the draft strategic  plan how challenges as well as successes of the program will be measured  at each IAP site. This appears to be the case since all of the performance  measures outlined in the draft strategic plan are likely to improve  following the deployment of IAP officers, without addressing program  impediments. DHS also noted that CBP is developing system  enhancements that will permit simple input, extraction, and analysis of  empirical data necessary for baseline and current data. We are encouraged  by these efforts and believe that they will help CBP to better evaluate the  effectiveness of this pilot program. Moreover, given CBP\u2019s intention to   transition this pilot program into a permanent one and expand the  program to additional locations, it is important that IAP officers and those  managing the IAP have the sufficient data necessary to make sound  decisions.", "Regarding the recommendation that steps be taken to more fully align  CBP\u2019s international passenger prescreening program with TSA\u2019s domestic  passenger prescreening program, DHS stated that its Screening  Coordination Office has directed CBP and TSA to align these programs.   DHS further stated that CBP has been working with TSA to align  procedures and systems and functional requirements, and that both CBP  and TSA will work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  harmonize data requirements and present a single face to the travel  industry. DHS also noted that CBP recognizes that air carriers have  invested significant resources to reprogram systems to comply with CBP\u2019s  regulations, and that CBP will continue to work to allow for the  submission of various passenger data through one transmission process.   Given the potential costs to air carriers and the government of having  prescreening procedures and requirements that are not aligned, we  encourage DHS to complete these efforts and make associated policy  decisions in a timely manner.", "Regarding the recommendation that the public be fully informed of the  possible uses of its personal information and that all required public data  privacy disclosures are completed to adequately address each element of  the international passenger prescreening process, DHS responded with  several statements. CBP stated in its comments on the draft report that it  is and has been in compliance with both the Privacy Act regarding System  of Records Notices (SORNs) and section 208 of the E-Government Act of  2002 regarding Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs). CBP bases its  compliance with the Privacy Act on the 2001 publication of a SORN for the  Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS). To the extent  that all uses of personal information in CBP international passenger  prescreening can be associated with the statements made in that notice,  we would agree that CBP is in compliance with the law. That notice,  however, states that TECS contains \u201cvery possible type of information  from a variety of Federal, state, and local sources, which contribute to  effective law enforcement.\u201d This statement does not identify the categories  of records maintained in the system, as required by the Act,   let alone APIS and ATS, which CBP now describes as separate systems. It  also does not disclose that the system includes personal information  collected directly from individuals (i.e., passport data) and indirectly  through air carriers (i.e., PNR data). The TECS SORN does not \u201cfacilitate  the exercise of the rights of individuals\u201d under the Act, as required by  OMB\u2019s Privacy Act guidance. While OMB guidance states that agencies  are granted considerable discretion in preparing SORNS, the guidance  stresses the importance of appropriately identifying the purpose(s) of a  system and ensuring that any associated notices have \u201cinformation value  to the public.\u201d  According to OMB, a major purpose of the Act is \u201cthe  publicizing of what those systems are and how they are used.\u201d The TECS  SORN has virtually no information value to the public and cannot be said  to meet the requirements of the Act.", "CBP also stated in its comments that no PIA is required for its  prescreening process because the March 2005 APIS PIA addressed  changes to APIS, and there have been no changes to ATS since the E- Government Act went into effect.  This is incorrect for at least two  reasons. First, CBP\u2019s handling of personal information was significantly  altered on the basis of its July 2004 agreement with the EU regarding  handling PNR data from flights between the US and EU member  countries. The DHS Privacy Office\u2019s September 2005 report on the  handling of EU PNR describes a number of changes made to CBP systems  and processes to better safeguard such data. These changes are not  addressed in any new or revised PIA or SORN. Second, the privacy  documents that CBP has published do not fully describe the use of  personal information in the CBP international passenger prescreening   process, even accepting CBP\u2019s statutory authority to limit public  disclosures under certain circumstances. Contrary to CBP\u2019s  characterization of CBP officers as merely conducting an \u201cact of physical  inspection,\u201d the CBP international passenger prescreening process  involves decisions made by CBP officers on the basis of information  obtained from multiple sources. As described in our report, CBP officers  can retrieve identity matching information conducted with APIS data,  identity matching and risk targeting information performed by ATS with  PNR and APIS data, as well as information from other government  databases. They can also access commercial data sources, although  reportedly on a limited basis for confirming passenger identities. Finally,  they can also enter information about individuals back into a number of  government systems. These multiple uses of information are not  described in any CBP privacy documents. Despite CBP\u2019s statement to the  contrary, there are no legal limitations to the Privacy Act or the E- Government Act that constrain the agency\u2019s ability to provide the public  with meaningful notice on the use and protection of personal  information. Furthermore, given that the handling of personal  information in the CBP prescreening process has been significantly  changed multiple times in the last several years, including changes to  address the EU PNR agreement and changes to the collection of passenger  manifest information via APIS, the separate publication of APIS and ATS  privacy documents satisfy the requirements of neither the Privacy Act nor  the E-Government Act.", "Upon its issuance, we will provide copies of this report to the Secretary of  the Department of Homeland Security, the Commissioner of Customs and  Border Protection, the Administrator of the Transportation Security  Administration, and interested congressional committees.", "If you have any questions about this report, please contact me at  BerrickC@gao.gov or (202) 512-3404.

More  specifically the report\u2019s content is limited to certain issues related to:  the implementation of the Immigration Advisory Program (IAP), a CBP  program that assesses risk levels for certain passengers in overseas  locations;     aligning international and domestic passenger prescreening programs;   ensuring that compliance with privacy laws is fully achieved with  respect to information collected to conduct international passenger  prescreening.", "Although the information provided in this report is more limited in scope,  the overall methodology used for our initial report is relevant to this report  as well because the information contained in this report was derived from  the initial sensitive report. We addressed the following objectives in our  initial November 2006 report:  the main factors affecting the international passenger prescreening  process, and the potential impact of these factors, and  the status of efforts to address these factors, and the issues, if any, that  could affect efforts to strengthen the international prescreening  process.", "To address our first objective from the November 2006 report\u2014the factors  that affect the international passenger prescreening process and their  potential impacts\u2014we interviewed officials from Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), including staff at CBP\u2019s National Targeting Center  (NTC); the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC); and the Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) to understand the current international  passenger prescreening process and the data that are used during this  process. We obtained and analyzed relevant documents from these  agencies including statistics from the Immigration Advisory Program pilot,  documentation on CBP\u2019s use of data systems to conduct international  passenger prescreening, and a CBP summary memorandum documenting  the agency\u2019s decision not to pursue the Advanced Passenger Prescreening  (APP) system that currently operates in other countries such as Australia  and New Zealand. To obtain a cross section of air carriers\u2019 views about the  process, we selected air carriers that fly large, medium, and small numbers  of passengers annually into the United States. For the purposes of this  review, we defined the transport of a large number of passengers as more  than 1 million passengers annually, we defined a medium number as  between 500,000 and 1 million passengers annually, and a small number as  less than 500,000 passengers annually. These criteria generally reflect the  distribution of the incoming passenger volume being flown into the United  States between 2000 and 2004 as shown in Department of Transportation  statistical reports. Using these criteria, we interviewed officials from seven  large air carriers, four medium air carriers, and two small air carriers, both  domestic and foreign, that conduct international flights into and out of the  United States to discuss the impact of current U.S. international passenger  prescreening requirements on their operations. We also spoke with  officials from two domestic air carrier and passenger travel associations  and three international air carrier associations to discuss the impact on  their members of current international passenger prescreening  requirements. We also reviewed documents from an international aviation  association that evaluated the potential impact on its membership of  CBP\u2019s proposed passenger prescreening reforms. To determine the  number of No Fly and improperly prescreened Selectee passengers who  traveled on flights to or from the United States during 2005, we obtained  and analyzed TSA security incident reports from January 1, 2005 to  December 31, 2005.", "To address our second objective from the November 2006 report\u2014 the  status of CBP\u2019s efforts to address these factors and the issues, if any, that  could affect efforts to strengthen the prescreening process\u2014we  interviewed officials from CBP and reviewed relevant documents. We also  interviewed officials from the seven large air carriers, three medium air  carriers, and two small air carriers, both domestic and foreign, that  conduct international flights into and out of the United States to obtain  their views on the potential impact of future U.S. international  prescreening requirements. We also spoke with officials from two  domestic air carrier and passenger travel associations, three international  air carrier associations, and a travel association that represent the  interests of air carriers and travelers to obtain their views on the potential  impact of future U.S. international prescreening requirements including  APIS- 60 and AQQ. We visited two Immigration Advisory Program (IAP)  pilot sites and met with the IAP teams to discuss the current status of the  program and observe the prescreening process at their respective  locations. We discussed potential benefits and challenges of the program  with the IAP teams. We also reviewed and assessed CBP\u2019s evaluations of  IAP pilot sites. Furthermore, we met with government officials from the  United Kingdom and Canada to learn details about their respective airline  liaison officer (ALO) programs and to obtain their views on how the IAP  pilot compares with their ALO programs. One foreign government  provided documents that summarize the functions of its ALO program. We  also met with foreign government officials in the Netherlands, Poland, the  United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand to discuss U.S. efforts to  strengthen international passenger prescreening and the potential impact  of these programs. Officials from Australia and New Zealand also provided  documents related to their respective APP prescreening systems. We met  with officials from the European Union to discuss the impact of U.S.  international prescreening requirements (including the advanced  transmission of passenger name record data) on air carriers originating  from Europe. Additionally, we interviewed and obtained documents from  private companies that facilitate the electronic transmission of passenger  data between air carriers and government agencies, including CBP, to  determine their role, if any, in future international aviation passenger  prescreening initiatives. To assess CBP\u2019s July 2006 Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking (NPRM), we obtained and analyzed documents associated  with the NPRM, including CBP\u2019s regulatory assessment for the rulemaking.  To assess whether CBP disclosed, as required by law, its use of passenger  information during the prescreening process, we reviewed CBP\u2019s  published privacy impact assessments and system of records notices. We  also met with CBP and DHS officials regarding their current and draft  privacy documents related to passenger prescreening. To determine the  extent to which CBP has utilized risk management principles to guide  decisions on passenger prescreening, we used a risk management  framework developed and tested by GAO over several years. The risk  management framework was developed by GAO after a review of  government and private sector documents on risk management and  interviews with recognized experts in risk management and terrorism  prevention. We used elements of the risk management framework as  criteria to analyze CBP\u2019s actions in developing and implementing its  existing international passenger prescreening process, as well as CBP\u2019s  proposed and planned actions to modify the international passenger  prescreening process.

For example,  the Canadian Migration Integrity Officers (MIO) program developed a  system that regularly collects data on improperly documented arrivals in  Canada and other suspect travelers and records this information in a Web  database to develop trend and other analyses. These data are also used to  measure the success of the Canadian MIO program. Canadian officials  stated that this web-based database allows Canada to immediately inform  air carriers of violations, has assisted in reducing the number of violations  and fines, and has allowed air carriers to take corrective action in a timely  manner. Similarly, officials from the United Kingdom ALO program stated  that they also collect statistics and intelligence to develop profiles and  trends on particular flights for use in their program. The New Zealand ALO  program utilizes passenger name record (PNR) data to identify the trends  of travelers utilizing fraudulent passports to travel to their country. New  Zealand officials stated that accessing and using PNR data in real time has  allowed their ALO network to immediately load alert or referral  information into its passenger-screening system so that identified  passengers can be screened further at check-in prior to boarding. New  Zealand officials also stated that they utilize data to conduct assessments  and intensive reviews of the highest risk countries and passengers, which  they then use to determine the location of airline liaison sites. Some New  Zealand ALO sites also have direct access to the immigration application  system, which allows their liaison officers to directly input alerts as  necessary. The New Zealand government is also currently considering  providing ALO officers with handheld computers to facilitate more  efficient communications. Australian officials stated that at several of their  ALO sites the liaison officers work under a particular air carrier versus  going through the typical approval process needed to establish an  overseas program, which may take a long time to complete. According to  these officials, this type of arrangement provides them with the advantage  of being able to quickly move liaison officers from location to location  when needed to keep up with trends in illegal passenger travel. Both the  United Kingdom and the Canadian ALO programs expanded gradually. A  United Kingdom ALO program official validated this approach by  suggesting that limited growth of ALO programs during the initial stages  allowed countries to fully learn from the pilot program before expanding  to other countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: APIS Quick Query (AQQ) and APIS Minus 60 Minutes (APIS-60)", "paragraphs": ["Appendix III: APIS Quic APIS Minus 60 Minutes (APIS-60)", "In July 2006, CBP released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would  require air carriers to transmit APIS data to CBP prior to the departure of  all international flights departing from or bound for the United States. The  notice of proposed rulemaking provided air carriers with two main options  for prescreening passengers on international flights prior to departure.  One option under the proposed rule would require air carriers to send  APIS data on all passengers to CBP 60 minutes before a flight\u2019s departure.  The other option would allow air carriers to transmit APIS data on a  passenger-by-passenger basis, up to 15 minutes prior to a flight\u2019s  departure.

CBP would provide this  response to the air carrier prior to the passenger boarding the aircraft. In  addition to satisfying requirements under the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act, both options would strengthen the prescreening  process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "First Prescreening Option: Transmitting APIS Data 60 Minutes Prior to Departure", "paragraphs": ["The first option under the proposed rule would require air carriers to  transmit APIS data to CBP for all passengers on a flight 60 minutes prior to  the flight\u2019s departure. This approach is known as APIS-60. The APIS-60  option will require an air carrier to transmit a manifest to CBP with APIS  information for all passengers on the flight 60 minutes before the flight  departs. This option gives CBP staff approximately 60 minutes before  flight departures to match the APIS information against the lists and notify  the carrier if any passengers should not be allowed to travel. Under this  option, a passenger would be issued a boarding pass, but if a \u201cnot cleared\u201d  response is later received from CBP, the air carrier would be responsible  for denying boarding, or for removing the passenger and his or her  baggage from the aircraft, if the passenger had already boarded the  aircraft. This option, according to CBP officials, is likely to be preferred by  smaller air carriers that are not dependent on having passengers transfer  from connecting flights (and therefore whose passengers would not likely  have difficulty checking in at least 60 minutes before flight departure).  According to CBP officials, these air carriers might prefer APIS-60 because  it would not require technical changes in how they transmit APIS data to  CBP, although it would require that carriers develop the technical means  to receive a screening response from CBP. In the fall of 2004, CBP initially  proposed APIS-60 as the sole approach for conducting international  prescreening. However, the International Air Transport Association  (IATA), the Air Transport Association of America (ATA), and individual  air carriers raised concerns about the economic impacts they believed  would be associated with implementing APIS-60 across the industry. For  example, they told CBP that network flight schedules would have to  change to expand the minimum connection times between flights because  all passengers would be required to check in at the airport at least 1 hour  in advance of the flight so that information could be collected and sent to  CBP on time. Air carriers that carry passengers arriving on connecting  flights, which are known to operate on \u201chub-and spoke\u201d networks, said  that they would be particularly affected because their passengers could  arrive on a variety of connecting flights from many other airports, and  some would not arrive 60 minutes in advance of their connecting flight,  making them ineligible to board their scheduled flights. In addition,  according to some air carriers, the trend in the air carrier industry of  moving toward self-service check-in by some passengers has shortened  the time between check-in and scheduled flight departure times, further  exacerbating the impact of this type of approach. In response to industry  concerns that the APIS-60 approach would create serious problems for  some carriers\u2019 operations, CBP offered a second option for air carriers to  consider adopting to conduct passenger prescreening in advance of flight  departures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Second Prescreening Option: Transmitting APIS Data as Each Passenger Checks In for a Flight", "paragraphs": ["The second option under the proposed rule would require air carriers to  send APIS data to CBP as each passenger checks in for a flight. CBP would  then complete its identity match against the No Fly and Selectee Lists and  send a response to the air carrier\u2014generally within 4 seconds\u2014identifying  that the passenger is either cleared or not-cleared for boarding. Since this  approach would utilize a nearly instantaneous data transmission between  air carriers and CBP, it is known as a real-time prescreening option. For  those passengers found to be eligible to board, the response message from  CBP would identify that the air carrier is permitted to issue a boarding  pass and receive checked-in luggage from the passenger. Known as APIS  Quick Query (AQQ), this approach would represent a significant change to  the current prescreening process in that CBP would complete its identity  matching for each passenger separately, instead of conducting identity  matching for all passengers on a flight at the same time.", "CBP officials believe that larger carriers with hub-and-spoke operations  are the most likely to choose the AQQ option, in part because larger  carriers are more likely to have the communications infrastructure needed  to develop and install the new interactive system. Some air carriers have  expressed the desirability of receiving a real-time cleared/not cleared  response from CBP earlier in the prescreening process such as what AQQ  would provide. This timing would allow them to know almost immediately  if an identified passenger represents a potential security risk.", "CBP officials are already in the process of developing the AQQ system.  Under this approach, the federal government would bear the costs  associated with the actual prescreening of passengers. However, air  carriers would be responsible for any changes needed to their internal  information technology systems and the transmission of APIS data. This  type of real-time interactive prescreening approach is currently in use in  several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Bahrain, through  a system called Advance Passenger Processing (APP). The APP system  was initially used by Australia\u2019s Customs Service and Department of  Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and was first  implemented in 1995.", "AQQ and APP are both real-time interactive concepts but are different  systems. CBP officials stated that they considered APP when determining  which prescreening options to pursue but, in an August 2005  memorandum, identified a number of reasons for not adopting it.  Nonetheless, the experience of these other countries with APP may be of  value to CBP as it continues to develop the AQQ program. For example,  Australian government officials told us that the successful deployment of  the APP program was dependent upon working closely with air carriers to  ensure system functionality upon implementation. This will be particularly  important with regard to the AQQ given that almost 200 air carriers fly  international routes into and out of the United States, assuming that a  number of these air carriers decide to participate in AQQ. Officials from  Australia and New Zealand said that they were willing to continue to share  relevant lessons learned as CBP works to develop its AQQ program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, key contributors to the report  include Mark Abraham, Charles Bausell, Dawn Hoff, David Hooper,  Michele Fejfar, James Madar, Jan Montgomery, Hugh Paquette, David  Plocher, Neetha Rao, Brian Sklar, and Stan Stenersen."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Related Products", "paragraphs": ["Aviation Security: Progress Made in Systematic Planning to Guide Key  Investment Decisions, but More Work Remains.
