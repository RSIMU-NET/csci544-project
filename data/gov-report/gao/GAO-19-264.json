However, these fatalities are likely underreported due to variability in state and local data collection. For example, police officers responding to a crash do not use a standard definition of an underride crash and states' crash report forms vary, with some not including a field for collecting underride data. Further, police officers receive limited information on how to identify and record underride crashes. As a result, NHTSA may not have accurate data to support efforts to reduce traffic fatalities.", "Underride guards are in varying stages of development, and gaps exist in inspection of rear guards in current use and in research efforts for side guards.", "NHTSA has proposed strengthening rear guard requirements for trailers (the rear unit of a tractor-trailer) and estimates about 95 percent of all newly manufactured trailers already meet the stronger requirements. Although tractor-trailers are inspected, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration annual inspection regulations do not require the rear guard to be inspected, so damaged guards that could fail in a crash may be on the roadways.", "Side underride guards are being developed, but stakeholders GAO interviewed identified challenges to their use, such as the stress on trailer frames due to the additional weight. NHTSA has not determined the effectiveness and cost of these guards, but manufacturers told GAO they are unlikely to move forward with development without such research.", "Based on a 2009 crash investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that NHTSA require front guards on tractors. NHTSA officials stated that the agency plans to complete research to respond to this recommendation in 2019. However, stakeholders generally stated that the bumper and lower frame of tractors typically used in the U.S. may mitigate the need for front guards for underride purposes.", "Regarding single-unit trucks , such as dump trucks, NTSB has recommended that NHTSA develop standards for underride guards for these trucks, but the agency has concluded these standards would not be cost-effective."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOT take steps to provide a standardized definition of underride crashes and data fields, share information with police departments on identifying underride crashes, establish annual inspection requirements for rear guards, and conduct additional research on side underride guards.

Due to the height difference between the vehicles, the car\u2019s safety  features are bypassed because the point of impact is not the front bumper  of the car. Without these safety features to absorb the force of the  collision, the passenger compartment can be crushed when it contacts  the truck, potentially resulting in death or severe head and neck injuries  for the occupants. To help prevent or mitigate these crashes, federal  regulations require that the rear end of the trailer have a guard meeting  specific crashworthiness standards. With these guards in place, the front  of the car will impact the guard instead of sliding under the trailer and the  car\u2019s safety features will engage to offer some protection to the car\u2019s  occupants. Rear guards of specific dimensions are also required for  single-unit trucks, but these guards are not required to be able to  withstand the force of a crash. There are no federal requirements for side  or front underride guards on any type of large truck in the United States.", "However, legislation aimed at, among other things, requiring the use of  side and front underride guards on all large trucks was introduced in the  House of Representatives and the Senate in December 2017.

This  report examines: (1) the data the Department of Transportation (DOT)  reports on truck underride crashes and (2) the development and use of  truck underride guard technologies in the United States.", "To address both objectives, we conducted a literature review to identify  studies regarding truck safety, in general, and underride guards, in  particular; we reviewed these studies and other documentation collected  from interviewees, as described below. We also interviewed a variety of  stakeholders familiar with topics related to underride crashes and guards,  including: officials from DOT\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA), as well as NHTSA\u2019s data validation and training  contractor; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA); the  National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and representatives from  the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). We interviewed seven  trailer manufacturers, nine trucking industry organizations, four  organizations representing tractor-trailer fleets, nine traffic safety groups,  and four organizations involved in transportation research. Additionally,  we interviewed officials of five state DOTs, five state police departments,  as well as two local police departments. In selecting the states and  localities, we considered various factors\u2014such as reported underride  crash fatalities and highway vehicle miles traveled\u2014to identify states that  were similar in highway traffic trends and large truck-related fatality rates,  but that collected underride crash data differently. The results of these  interviews are not generalizable to all states and localities; however, they  offer examples of the types of experiences state DOTs and state and  local police have with underride crashes and inspections. We also  interviewed officials from transportation agencies in Canada and the  European Union.", "For the first objective, we also analyzed DOT data on underride crashes  and fatalities from 2008 through 2017\u2014the 10 most recent years for  which these data were available\u2014and reviewed crash report forms from  all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We compared NHTSA\u2019s data  collection efforts to federal internal control standards related to use of  quality information. For the second objective, we reviewed NHTSA\u2019s and  FMCSA\u2019s regulations requiring rear guards, FMCSA\u2019s regulations on  commercial vehicle inspections, DOT\u2019s documentation on underride  guard technologies, and DOT\u2019s data on commercial vehicle inspections.  To assess the reliability of DOT\u2019s data on underride crashes and fatalities  and commercial vehicle inspections, we reviewed relevant documentation  and spoke with agency officials about the data\u2019s quality control  procedures. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report, specifically to provide a high-level overview of  underride crashes and fatalities, as well as commercial vehicle  inspections within recent years. However, we did identify potential  underreporting of underride crashes and fatalities, as discussed in this  report. We compared DOT\u2019s efforts to pertinent agency regulations on  commercial vehicle inspections, federal internal control standards related  to use of quality information, and a statement of federal principles on  regulatory planning and review.

The front and rear of passenger vehicles are designed to crumple in a  crash and absorb the main force of an impact, while sensors detect the  impact and activate safety features within the passenger compartment,  such as air bags and seatbelt pretensioners. However, the point of  impact in an underride crash could be the hood of the passenger vehicle  or\u2014more severely\u2014the windshield. Such impacts can result in  \u201cpassenger compartment intrusion\u201d by the large truck into the passenger  area of the smaller vehicle. This intrusion can kill passengers or leave  them with severe head and neck injuries. Underride guards on large  trucks essentially lower the profile of the truck\u2019s body to be more  compatible with that of a passenger vehicle. An underride guard designed  to withstand the force of a crash can prevent the car from sliding under  the truck and provide an effective point of impact that will activate the  car\u2019s safety features to protect the car\u2019s occupants. Figure 1 shows  images from a video depicting the difference in underride crashes with  and without passenger compartment intrusion on the rear of a tractor- trailer.", "Rear and side underride guards limit a passenger vehicle\u2019s ability to go  under those areas of a trailer in a crash (see fig. 2). Front guards\u2014 currently used on tractors in some other countries, such as European  Union countries\u2014can reduce the likelihood that a truck would ride over a  passenger vehicle in a crash, a situation sometimes referred to as  \u201coverride\u201d. In addition to saving lives and reducing serious injuries,  improving traffic safety\u2014including reducing underride crashes\u2014may  provide other benefits to society. Specifically, NHTSA has reported that  preventing such crashes may result in savings in police and crash  investigation resources and reduced property damage, among other  things. Federal requirements, in regulations issued by NHTSA and  FMCSA, exist for the installation of rear guards on most large trucks, but  there are no federal requirements for side or front guards.", "NHTSA\u2019s mission is to \u201csave lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic  costs due to road traffic crashes through education, research, safety  standards and enforcement activity.\u201d  As part of this mission, NHTSA  requires that rear guards be installed on most trailers. Federal regulations  requiring rear guards of specific dimensions date back to 1952, but the  most current regulations\u2014which set force and energy absorption  standards, in addition to dimensional requirements\u2014became effective in  1998. These crashworthy rear guards must be designed and tested to  protect occupants in a crash of up to 30 miles per hour.", "In December 2015, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking  (NPRM) that proposed to align U.S. regulations with stronger Canadian  rear guard standards. The Canadian standard includes a stronger  energy absorption requirement: 20,000 joules\u2014a measurement of  energy\u2014as compared to 5,650 joules in the U.S. NHTSA has not taken  action on this NPRM since it was proposed in December 2015. Single- unit trucks that are more than 30 inches above the ground are required to  meet the dimensional specifications for rear guards set in 1952 but are  not required to meet any force or energy absorption standards. NHTSA  introduced an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in July  2015 that considered requiring rear guards with strength and energy  absorption criteria for all newly built single-unit trucks. However, NHTSA  has since withdrawn the ANPRM, stating that\u2014based on the comments  received as well as analysis of the petitions\u2014the changes being  considered were not justified.", "Although there are no federal requirements for crashworthy side  underride guards, some crashworthy side guards are being developed.  For example, one aftermarket manufacturer has developed a side  underride guard that was crash-tested by IIHS and successfully  prevented underride crashes in tests at 35 and 40 miles per hour. Similar  looking technologies\u2014including aerodynamic side skirts and  pedestrian/cyclist side guards\u2014are installed on some trailers and single- unit trucks, but they are not meant to mitigate underride crashes (see fig.  3).", "FMCSA\u2019s primary mission is \u201cto reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities  involving large trucks and buses,\u201d and it does this, in part, through  developing safety regulations. These regulations include requirements for  rear guards for trailers consistent with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety  Standards and for single-unit trucks that are more than 30 inches above  the ground, as well as for multiple types of commercial vehicle  inspections that are performed by, for example, motor carriers and drivers  to ensure that commercial vehicles are safely operating. Table 1  describes the types of commercial vehicle inspections.", "For fatal crashes, including fatal underride crashes, data are collected by  law enforcement officials at the location of the crash, aggregated at the  state level, and then transferred to NHTSA\u2019s Fatality Analysis Reporting  System (FARS). FARS is a census of all fatal traffic crashes in the U.S.  When a fatal crash occurs, a state or local police officer typically  completes a crash report form unique to each state. These forms can  include a variety of data fields, such as the time of the crash, weather  conditions, and the number of killed or injured persons. In the case of an  underride crash, officers may indicate an underride crash occurred in a  specific field for recording this crash type or in a narrative field. FARS  analysts\u2014state employees who are trained by NHTSA\u2019s data validation  and training contractor to code state crash data for input into FARS\u2014in  each state receive and analyze the data in the crash report forms in order  to compile a record of the fatal crash. FARS analysts rely on the  information within the crash report form in order to enter accurate data.", "To encourage greater uniformity of crash data, NHTSA, FMCSA, and  other agencies and associations cooperatively developed the Model  Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC) in 1998. The MMUCC  guideline, currently in the fifth edition, identifies a minimum set of motor  vehicle crash data elements and their definitions that states should  consider collecting, but are not required to collect. The MMUCC is  updated about every 4 to 5 years. Prior to publication of each edition, an  expert panel from the relevant agencies and associations convenes to  review all proposed changes suggested by traffic safety stakeholders to  determine what will be included in the MMUCC.

Officials from four state DOTs we spoke to also stated that while  underride crashes are not common, the consequences\u2014fatalities or  serious injuries, including head or neck injuries\u2014are more likely to be  severe. An official from one state DOT noted that their agency did not  consider underride crashes to be a high priority issue. However, upon  further review of the state\u2019s underride crash data, this official stated that  while underride crashes may occur infrequently, they present a higher risk  of fatality than the official had previously realized. An official in another  state told us they do not regularly review underride crash data but, upon  analysis of the data, found that underride crashes constituted a larger  percentage than they anticipated\u201416 percent\u2014of all fatal large truck  crashes in the state in 2017.", "NHTSA\u2019s FARS data show that most of the reported underride crash  fatalities occurred when the crash impact was located at the rear or sides  of a trailer. From 2008 through 2017, approximately 45 percent (825 of  1836) of reported fatalities in underride crashes with a recorded point of  impact on the large truck occurred when the initial impact of the crash  was the rear of the trailer. About 32 percent (590 of 1836) of reported  underride crash fatalities were in crashes where the side of the trailer was  the point of initial impact. Approximately 21 percent (392 of 1836) of  reported underride crash fatalities were in crashes with the initial impact  at the front of the tractor. These 392 fatalities from crashes involving the  front of a tractor could be crashes in which the tractor impacted the rear  of a passenger vehicle but might also have occurred in a head-on  collision between the car and the tractor. The point of impact for underride  crash fatalities with passenger compartment intrusion\u2014the most severe  form of underride\u2014had similar distributions, with most reported fatalities  occurring when the initial point of impact was the rear or side of the  trailer.", "State and local police officials we interviewed said that the underride  crash fatality cases they are familiar with occurred in high speed  scenarios, often exceeding 55 miles per hour. For example, officials  representing a state police department described scenarios in which  passenger vehicles traveling at high speeds rear-ended tractor-trailers  stopped on the highway\u2019s shoulder or slowed for highway construction;  similar scenarios occurred when tractor trailers failed to slow for stopped  traffic and crashed into the rear of passenger vehicles. However, on  average, 62 percent of fatalities from underride crashes with passenger  compartment intrusion reported in 2008 through 2017 did not include a  reported speed. For example, for these fatalities in 2017, 72 percent had  speed coded in FARS as missing or not reported. A state and a local  police official told us that determining the speed of an underride crash can  be challenging due to the often severely damaged condition of the  passenger vehicle following an underride crash. Officials representing  state police said that they are better able to document whether or not  speeding was a factor in an underride crash, rather than an exact speed.", "IIHS representatives also acknowledged the difficulty in documenting the  speed involved in an underride crash, and further stated that this difficulty  brings into question the accuracy of the speed data that are recorded in  FARS for underride crashes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variability in the Data Collection Process Likely Leads to Underreporting", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed told us that underride crash fatalities are  likely underreported in FARS due to several factors, such as variability  across states in defining underride crashes, inconsistencies in state crash  reporting forms and documentation methods, and limited information  provided to state and local police on how to consistently identify and  record underride crash data. These factors could contribute to police  officers incorrectly and inconsistently documenting underride crash data  on the crash report form. As a result, FARS analysts may not have  sufficient information to properly categorize the crash as an underride,  ultimately affecting the number of underride crash fatalities identified in  FARS. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government notes  that management should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives. Underreporting of underride crashes would affect the quality  of NHTSA\u2019s data, thereby affecting the agency\u2019s ability to accurately  identify the magnitude of underride-related crashes and limiting its ability  to make informed decisions on rulemaking or other efforts that would help  the agency meet its mission to improve traffic safety.", "Other researchers and organizations have also commented on the quality  of NHTSA\u2019s underride crash data.

The MMUCC, which includes  definitions of various crash-related elements, does not include a definition  of an underride crash. Among officials from the five state police  departments we interviewed, underride crash definitions varied, even  within states. For example, in one state, an official from one local police  department said that a passenger vehicle would need to have over 50  percent of its hood underneath the trailer to constitute an underride crash,  while other officials within the state police used a broader definition  consistent with NHTSA\u2019s definition, i.e., a vehicle going underneath  another vehicle by any amount. A state police official and a local police  official we interviewed indicated that they would like a clearer definition of  the conditions that constitute an underride crash to help them better  identify these crashes. Further, representatives from NHTSA\u2019s data  validation and training contractor told us that when they have identified  anomalous patterns in underride crash data in FARS, the main reason for  these anomalies has been varying definitions of this crash type, as  reporting officers have many interpretations of what constitutes an  underride crash.

Some  manufacturers said that since trucking company operations may span the  border between Canada and the U.S., it was easier to build to a single  standard rather than manufacture trailers that comply with either the  Canadian requirements or the U.S. requirements. NHTSA is considering  strengthening the U.S. requirements for rear guards to align with the  Canadian rear guard standards. As part of the 2015 NPRM on  strengthening the U.S. requirements to the level of the Canadian  standards, NHTSA estimated that 93 percent of all newly manufactured  trailers in the U.S. are already equipped with a rear guard that meets the  Canadian standard. In July 2018, NHTSA officials told us that figure had  increased to 95 percent of all newly manufactured trailers, with the  remaining 5 percent from smaller manufacturers who may not wish to  incur the additional cost or weight of a Canadian-style rear guard.

Specifically, NHTSA\u2019s analysis found that the cost of a rear guard that  meets the Canadian standard was approximately $500 per trailer, which  was $229 more than a guard that complies with the existing U.S.  requirement. NHTSA\u2019s analysis also found that a Canadian-style rear  guard was heavier than its U.S. counterpart. The rear guard NHTSA  studied that complies with current U.S. regulations weighed 172 pounds,  whereas those meeting the Canadian standard weighed between 191 and  307 pounds. Regarding benefits, NHTSA estimated in 2015 that\u2014 accounting for the trailers that already meet the stronger standard\u2014 adopting the Canadian standard would prevent about one fatality and  three serious injuries per year. According to DOT, these estimates may  have since changed, as a higher percentage of trailers are now  manufactured to meet the Canadian standards. Comments on this NPRM  varied. Some comments were in support of the measure, citing the safety  benefits. Other comments noted that automated driver assistance  technology may offer better outcomes. Further, some comments called  for NHTSA to take additional steps to improve the safety capabilities of  rear guards, such as allowing fewer exemptions from compliance.

Because IIHS found that the weakest points for rear guards  are generally the outer edges furthest from the center of the guard, it  created a procedure to test the ability of rear guards to withstand crashes  at different overlap points, starting at the center of the guard and moving  closer to the endpoints. Specifically, this procedure involves three crash  tests using full width, 50-percent, and 30-percent overlap of the front of  the car with the rear guard, as depicted in figure 4. According to IIHS, as  of September 2018, all of the top eight trailer manufacturers operating in  the U.S. have successfully passed these tests.

These systems, though not federally- required, have been available and installed in some passenger vehicles  and tractors and are designed to detect objects or other vehicles in front  of the vehicle and automatically apply the brakes to avoid or lessen the  severity of an impact. According to NHTSA, twenty automakers  representing more than 99 percent of the U.S. automobile market have  agreed to make automatic braking systems a standard feature on newly- built passenger vehicles starting in 2022.

However, only certain roadside inspections\u2014which  are performed at random or if an officer suspects a problem\u2014specifically  require the rear guard to be inspected.

For example, there is currently one IIHS-crash-tested aftermarket  manufacturer of side underride guards in North America, which has sold  about 100 sets of side underride guards. According to the manufacturer,  the cost of the guards starts at about $2,500 per trailer, though the price  could decrease in the future as the manufacturing process becomes more  efficient and greater quantities are built and sold. These side underride  guards have been crash-tested by IIHS and successfully prevented  underride crashes in tests at 35 and 40 miles per hour. As a result, the  benefits of such guards might include a reduction in the number of  fatalities in underride crashes. The manufacturer estimated that more  widespread use of side underride guards would occur over the next 3 to 5  years. However, the manufacturer also said that more information on how  side underride guards might affect everyday operations is needed before  more widespread adoption by the industry. Additionally, some trailer  manufacturers told us that they are in the process of developing side  underride guards, but none are currently available for purchase. For  example, a representative from one trailer manufacturer developing its  own side underride guards estimated that it would be feasible to have  these guards designed, tested, and available for sale within the next 2  years. However, the representative said that the manufacturer is hesitant  to invest additional resources because of uncertainty about potential  future regulatory requirements. Specifically, the manufacturer does not  want to invest additional resources to develop a side underride guard that  might later have to be redesigned to meet federal requirements, if such  requirements were to be established and to differ from the manufacturer\u2019s  design specifications.", "Representatives from several trailer manufacturers, trucking industry  organizations, and police departments we spoke with cited challenges  with the use of side underride guards that would need to be addressed  prior to widespread adoption by the industry.

Representatives from two  trucking industry organizations we spoke with stated that the  additional weight from side underride guards may require carriers to  put more trailers on the roads to ship goods in order to stay under  federal maximum weight restrictions (generally 80,000 pounds).  Federal regulations allow for certain exemptions in the federal weight  limits, such as for auxiliary batteries. Some stakeholders also stated  that the additional weight from side underride guards would increase  fuel costs (assuming all else remains the same) and could put stress  on the trailer\u2019s frame, reducing its lifespan and potentially increasing  maintenance costs.", "Road clearance: Some stakeholders we interviewed\u2014including two  trucking industry organizations, a tractor-trailer fleet operator, and a  trailer manufacturer\u2014stated that side underride guards limit a trailer\u2019s  clearance from the ground, which could limit the geographic locations  that could be serviced by a trailer or\u2014if the guards drag along the  ground\u2014result in damage to the guards or even the trailer. Conditions  involving limited clearance could include traveling over raised railroad  crossings or navigating sloped loading docks.

Additionally, the rear axles of some trailers  can be adjusted to evenly distribute the weight of the trailer\u2019s cargo.  For example, trailer manufacturers told us that when the axle is  moved to the furthest rear position of the trailer, a fixed-length side  underride guard could leave a gap large enough for a car to still have  an underride crash. Further, some police officers we interviewed told  us that it could be challenging to perform roadside inspections of  trailers equipped with side underride guards because the guards  could limit access to the underside of the trailer.", "Representatives from three trucking industry organizations we spoke with  indicated that crash avoidance technologies may be more effective than  underride guards at minimizing underride crashes, including side  underride crashes. However, while these technologies have the potential  to mitigate crashes, it is unlikely that they will be available on a more  widespread scale in a time frame soon enough to render underride  guards unnecessary. While automatic braking systems for passenger  vehicles are to become a standard feature on newly built vehicles starting  in 2022, IIHS representatives told us that these systems are less effective  at detecting and mitigating side crashes than rear or frontal crashes.  Specifically, the representatives stated that automatic braking systems  would not be effective in situations where the passenger vehicle impacts  the side of a trailer at an oblique angle rather than at a perpendicular  angle. According to stakeholders we interviewed, it will take a  considerable amount of time for the passenger fleet to adopt automated  vehicle technologies, with some stating that there will be a mix of  automated and non-automated technologies on the nation\u2019s highways for  decades\u2014longer than the 3 to 5 years estimated by the side underride  guard manufacturer for more widespread use of these guards.", "NHTSA recently issued a study on the safety performance of certain  materials used for side underride guards.

A 2013 NHTSA study found that tractors with lower  bumper heights were less likely to be involved in an override crash than  those with higher bumper heights. Government officials from the  European Union told us that they did not see the need for conventional  tractors to have front guards, since the lower bumpers essentially function  as guards in frontal crashes. Officials from a state DOT, a state police  department, and a local police department all stated that they do not see  the need for front guards because the tractor is already so low to the  ground.", "Further, state and local officials we spoke with noted that the front  underride crashes they have seen often occurred at higher speeds, such as when a truck fails to stop for congested traffic or in a head-on collision  at higher speeds. In these cases, the speed combined with the much  greater weight of the truck could cause the truck to override the car (in the  first scenario) or the car to underride the tractor (in a head-on collision).  According to these officials, the force of the crash at those speeds\u2014 regardless of whether there was underride or override\u2014would very likely  be unsurvivable.", "Additionally, automatic braking systems in tractors and passenger  vehicles may further mitigate the need for front guards for underride or  override purposes. These technologies\u2014which, according to a tractor  manufacturer we interviewed, have been available and installed in some  tractors\u2014can potentially stop a tractor from, for example, overriding a  passenger vehicle by automatically applying brakes in situations where a  potential rear-end collision is detected. Representatives from a tractor  manufacturer told us that about 70 to 80 percent of all newly  manufactured tractors it produced are equipped with these braking  systems and estimated that more than 50 percent of newly built tractors  sold by all manufacturers in the U.S. include these systems.

Specifically, in 2010,  NTSB recommended that NHTSA, among other things, develop  performance standards for front guards and, after doing so, require all  newly manufactured trucks weighing more than 10,000 pounds to install  these front guards. NTSB issued these recommendations based on its  investigation of a June 2009 multi-car crash on an Oklahoma interstate, in  which the driver of a tractor trailer failed to slow down for traffic stopped  on the roadway. NTSB reported that the tractor-trailer\u2019s high impact  speed and structural incompatibility with the passenger vehicles  contributed to the severity of the crash. As of December 2018, NHTSA  had not implemented NTSB\u2019s recommendations. NHTSA reported to  NTSB in 2014 that it was in the process of conducting further examination  of crash data, but that efforts in developing standards for front guards are  a secondary priority to upgrading rear guard standards. NTSB stated that  NHTSA\u2019s response was disappointing and that it continues to believe that  NHTSA actions are needed to implement this recommendation.  Additionally, NTSB recommended in 2015 that NHTSA develop  performance standards and protocols for assessing forward collision  avoidance systems in commercial vehicles, which could also help to stop  a tractor from overriding a passenger vehicle. According to NTSB,  although NHTSA has performed some research on this technology, NTSB  has deemed NHTSA\u2019s responses as unacceptable.

Specifically, IIHS noted that NHTSA overestimated the additional  weight of the rear guards, thereby overestimating the cost by about 35 to  40 percent. IIHS also stated that due to concerns with the underlying  data, NHTSA underestimated the number of crashes into the rear of  single-unit trucks with passenger compartment intrusion. NHTSA officials  told us that they disagreed with IIHS\u2019s assessment and stated that the  data NHTSA used in the ANPRM were valid and appropriate.

FARS is a census of all fatal traffic crashes in the United  States that provides uniformly coded, national data on police-reported  fatalities. We analyzed these data to determine the reported number of  fatalities involving underride crashes. To assess the reliability of the  FARS data, we reviewed relevant documentation and spoke with agency  officials about the data\u2019s quality control procedures. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report,  specifically to provide a high-level overview of underride crash fatalities  within recent years. However, we did identify potential underreporting of  underride crashes and fatalities, as discussed in this report. We also  reviewed NHTSA\u2019s annual Traffic Safety Facts reports\u2014which use FARS  data\u2014to determine the annual number of traffic and large truck crash  fatalities from 2008 to 2017, the 10 most recent years for which these  data are available. We reviewed state crash report forms from all 50  states and the District of Columbia to understand the variability of  underride crash-related data elements and how such variability could  affect DOT\u2019s data collection and analysis efforts. We compared NHTSA\u2019s  data collection efforts to federal internal control standards related to use  of quality information.", "To describe the development and use of truck underride guard  technologies in the United States, we reviewed research and  documentation on underride guards. Primarily, we reviewed documents  relating to underride guards from NHTSA and FMCSA, as well as  information from traffic safety groups, trucking industry organizations,  research organizations, and selected foreign transportation agencies. We  reviewed NHTSA\u2019s regulations requiring rear guards, FMCSA\u2019s  regulations requiring commercial vehicle inspections, DOT\u2019s  documentation on underride guard technologies, and DOT data on  commercial vehicle inspections. To assess the reliability of DOT\u2019s  commercial vehicle inspection data, we reviewed relevant documentation  and spoke with agency officials about the data\u2019s quality control  procedures. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report, specifically to provide a high-level overview of  commercial vehicle inspections within recent years. We compared DOT\u2019s  efforts to pertinent agency regulations on commercial vehicle inspections,  federal internal control standards related to use of quality information, and  a statement of federal principles on regulatory planning and review. We  spoke with relevant non-governmental organizations to obtain their  perspectives on the perceived benefits and costs of rear, side, and front  underride guards, and the potential factors that may influence the benefits  and costs.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to March 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Organizations Contacted", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Susan Fleming, (202) 512-2834 or flemings@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Sara Vermillion (Assistant  Director); Daniel Paepke (Analyst in Charge); Carl Barden; Jessica Du;  Mary Edgerton; Timothy Guinane; David Hooper; Gina Hoover; Madhav  Panwar; Joshua Parr; Malika Rice; Oliver Richard; Matthew Rosenberg;  Pamela Snedden; and Michelle Weathers made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["A truck underride crash occurs when a car slides under a large truck, like a tractor-trailer.
