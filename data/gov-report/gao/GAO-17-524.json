Treasury has taken significant action over the past few years to  address control deficiencies in this area, including actions to improve  reporting of intragovernmental differences to federal entities and to work  actively with federal entities to encourage resolution of reported  differences. However, Treasury did not have sufficient procedures and  metrics for monitoring the federal government\u2019s year-to-year progress in  resolving intragovernmental differences at the federal entity level.", "When preparing the CFS, intragovernmental activity and balances  between federal entities should be in agreement and must be subtracted  out, or eliminated. If the two federal entities engaged in an  intragovernmental transaction do not both record the same  intragovernmental transaction in the same year and for the same amount,  the intragovernmental transactions will not be in agreement, resulting in  errors in the CFS. Federal entities are responsible for properly accounting  for and reporting their intragovernmental activity and balances in their  entity financial statements and for effectively implementing related  internal controls. This includes reconciling and resolving  intragovernmental differences at the transaction level with their trading  partners.", "To support this process, Treasury has established procedures for  identifying whether intragovernmental activity and balances reported to  Treasury by federal entities are properly reconciled and balanced. For  example, Treasury calculates intragovernmental differences by reciprocal  category and trading partner for each federal entity. Through these  calculations, Treasury has identified certain recurring issues, such as  significant differences related to specific entities, reciprocal categories,  and trading partners. Treasury provides quarterly scorecards to the  individual federal entities that are significant to the CFS to highlight  intragovernmental differences requiring these entities\u2019 attention.  Treasury also prepares a quarterly government-wide scorecard to  communicate the total differences on a government-wide basis. The  government-wide scorecard also identifies the 10 largest federal entity  contributors to the total government-wide difference.", "While Treasury\u2019s scorecard process and other initiatives focus on  identifying and communicating differences to federal entities, they do not  include procedures for monitoring the federal government\u2019s year-to-year  progress in resolving intragovernmental differences at the federal entity  level. For example, the entity-level scorecards do not include metrics that  could be used to gauge the federal government\u2019s year-to-year progress in  resolving intragovernmental differences at the entity level by reciprocal  category and trading partner. Although Treasury produces a government- wide scorecard, the chart included on the scorecard shows changes in  the total intragovernmental differences for recent quarters but does not  identify increases or decreases at the individual entity level by reciprocal  category and trading partner. While the total of intragovernmental  differences has declined in recent years as a result of the scorecard  process and other Treasury initiatives, we continued to note that amounts  reported by federal entities were not in agreement by hundreds of billions  of dollars for fiscal year 2016.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should (1) design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks, such as establishing and reviewing performance  measures and indicators, and (2) implement control activities, such as  documenting responsibilities through policies and procedures.

Auditors for entities significant to the CFS are  responsible for providing opinions on these entities\u2019 closing package  submissions to Treasury. Once federal entities have submitted data for  inclusion in the CFS, Treasury performs procedures to determine the  consistency of the submitted data to (1) federal entity audited financial  statements and (2) government-wide financial reporting standards.  Treasury also performs procedures to determine if adjustments are  needed to resolve certain unreconciled differences in intragovernmental  activity and balances. Through these processes, Treasury identified the  need for tens of billions of dollars of adjustments to federal entity- submitted data and recorded these adjustments to the CFS. Treasury  identified many of the adjustments needed as recurring because they  related to the same line items and federal entities as in prior years. The  adjustments were necessary often because of inaccurate or incomplete  information that federal entities submitted for the CFS. Though Treasury  had procedures for identifying adjustments needed to data that federal  entities submitted at fiscal year-end as well as procedures for reviewing  recurring intragovernmental adjustments, Treasury did not have a  sufficient process for reviewing recurring non-intragovernmental  adjustments. Specifically, Treasury did not have a process to work with  federal entities to correctly report non-intragovernmental information in  federal entities\u2019 closing packages prior to submission to Treasury, thereby  reducing or resolving the need for Treasury to make significant  adjustments to federal entity data. For adjustments related to  intragovernmental differences, we found that Treasury\u2019s procedures did  include steps for reviewing recurring intragovernmental adjustments and  for working with federal entities to reduce or resolve the need for these  intragovernmental adjustments.", "Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No. 4, Intended  Audience and Qualitative Characteristics for the Consolidated Financial  Report of the United States Government, states that the consolidated  financial report should be a general purpose report that is aggregated  from federal entity reports.

In accordance with the TFM,  significant component entities are required to submit their financial data to  Treasury using a closing package. A significant component entity\u2019s chief  financial officer must certify the accuracy of the data in the closing  package and have it audited. Because the closing package process  requires that significant component entities verify and validate the  information in their closing packages compared with their audited  department-level financial statements and receive audit opinions,  Treasury is provided a level of assurance that it is compiling the CFS with  reliable financial information. In addition, OMB Bulletin 15-02, Audit  Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, establishes requirements  for audits of federal financial statements, including audits of the closing  packages.
