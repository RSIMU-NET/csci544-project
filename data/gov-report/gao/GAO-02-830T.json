The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 made it illegal for employers to knowingly hire unauthorized aliens. IRCA requires employers to comply with an employment verification process intended to provide employers with a means to avoid hiring unauthorized aliens. The process requires newly hired employees to present documentation establishing their identity and eligibility to work. From a list of 27 acceptable documents, employees have the choice of presenting 1 document establishing both identity and eligibility to work (e.g., an INS permanent resident card) or 1 document establishing identity (e.g., a driver\u2019s license) and 1 establishing eligibility to work (e.g., a Social Security card). Generally, employers cannot require the employees to present a specific document. Employers are to review the document or documents that an employee presents and complete an Employment Eligibility Form, INS Form I-9. On the form, employers are to certify that they have reviewed the documents and that the documents appear genuine and relate to the individual. Employers are expected to judge whether the documents are obviously fraudulent.
