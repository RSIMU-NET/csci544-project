In some cases, Interior is authorized to collect royalties and fees for these uses. Over the years, GAO has reported on challenges facing Interior as it implements its programs. In addition to basic program management issues, Interior faces difficult choices in balancing its many responsibilities, and in improving the condition of the nation's natural resources and the department's infrastructure, in light of the federal deficit and long-term fiscal challenges facing the nation. This testimony highlights some of the major management challenges facing Interior today. It is based on prior GAO reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As GAO's previous work has shown, the Department of the Interior faces major management challenges in the following six areas: (1) Strengthening resource protection; (2) Strengthening the accountability of Indian and island community programs; (3) Improving federal land acquisition and management; (4) Reducing Interior's deferred maintenance backlog; (5) Ensuring the accurate collection of royalties; and (6) Enhancing other revenue collections and financial assurances. Interior has not yet developed a cohesive strategy to address wildland fire issues, as GAO recommended in 1999 and 2005. In addition, Interior faces challenges in managing oil and gas operations on federal lands, adapting to climate change, and resolving natural resource conflicts through collaborative management. Having a land base is important to Indian tribes. Concerns remain about delays in decisions about land that Interior will take into trust status. In addition, programs for seven island communities--four U.S. territories and three sovereign island nations--continue to have financial and program management deficiencies. As the steward of more than 500 million acres of federal land, land consolidation through sales and acquisitions and land management are important functions for the department. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act has had limited success and Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is unlikely to achieve its goals to protect certain migratory bird habitat and it is generally not managing a majority of its farmlands. While Interior has improved inventory and asset management systems, the dollar estimate of the deferred maintenance backlog has continued to grow. The 2008 estimate of between $13.2 billion and $19.4 billion is more than 60 percent higher than the 2003 estimate. The funds for Interior in the recently enacted stimulus package may reverse this trend. GAO and others have found many material weaknesses in their numerous evaluations of federal oil and gas management and revenue collection processes. These weaknesses place an unknown but significant proportion of royalties and other oil and gas revenues at risk and raise questions about whether Interior is collecting an appropriate amount of revenue for the rights to explore for, develop, and produce oil and gas from federal lands and waters. Additional revenues or financial assurances could be generated by (1) amending the General Mining Act of 1872 to collect federal royalties on gold, silver, copper, and other valuable minerals belonging to the United States, (2) requiring adequate financial assurances from hardrock mining operations to fully cover estimated reclamation costs, and (3) increasing the grazing fee for public lands managed by Interior's Bureau of Land"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss our work at the Department of  the Interior. As the stewards for more than 500 million acres of federal  land\u2014about one-fifth of the total U.S. landmass\u2014and over 1.8 billion acres  of the Outer Continental Shelf, Interior agencies are responsible for a wide  array of programs to ensure that our nation\u2019s natural resources are  adequately protected and that access to and use of those resources is  appropriately managed. Interior is to provide for the environmentally  sound production of oil, gas, minerals, and other resources found on the  nation\u2019s public lands; honor the nation\u2019s obligations to American Indians  and Alaska Natives; protect habitat to sustain fish and wildlife; help  manage water resources in western states; and provide scientific and  technical information to allow for sound decision-making about resources.  In recent years, Congress has appropriated over $10 billion annually to  meet these responsibilities. With these resources, Interior employs about  70,000 people in eight major agencies and bureaus at over 2,400 locations  around the country to carry out its mission. Interior\u2019s management of this  vast federal estate is largely characterized by the struggle to balance the  demand for greater use of its resources with the need to conserve and  protect them for the benefit of future generations.", "Our testimony today expands upon the issues raised in our 2009  Congressional and Presidential Transition Web site for the Department of  the Interior. Specifically, we will discuss management challenges in  six key areas: (1) resource protection, (2) Indian and island community  programs, which includes programs for four U.S. territories and three  sovereign island nations, (3) land acquisition and management,  (4) deferred maintenance, (5) royalties collection, and (6) other revenue  collections and financial assurances.

But concerns remain.  Interior also faces challenges in managing oil and gas operations on  federal lands, adapting to climate change, and resolving natural resource  conflicts through collaborative management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wildland Fire Management Challenges Persist", "paragraphs": ["The wildland fire problems facing our nation continue to grow. The  average annual acreage burned by wildland fires has increased by  approximately 70 percent since the 1990s, and appropriations for the  federal government\u2019s wildland fire management activities tripled from  about $1 billion in fiscal year 1999 to nearly $3 billion in fiscal year 2007.  As we have previously reported, a number of factors have contributed to  worsening fire seasons and increased firefighting expenditures, including  an accumulation of fuels resulting from past land management practices;  drought and other stresses, in part related to climate change; and an  increase in human development in or near wildlands. While Agriculture\u2019s  Forest Service receives the majority of fire management resources,  Interior agencies\u2014the National Park Service (NPS); the Bureau of Indian  Affairs (BIA); the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS); and, particularly,  the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)\u2014are key partners in responding  to the threats of wildland fire. Consequently, most of our work and  recommendations on wildland fire management address agencies in both  departments. Specifically, we have called on the agencies to    develop a cohesive strategy that identifies options and associated  funding to reduce potentially hazardous vegetation and address  wildland fire problems. In 1999, to address the problem of excess fuels  and their potential to increase the severity of wildland fires and the  cost of suppression efforts, we recommended that a cohesive strategy  be developed to identify the available long-term options for reducing  fuels and the associated funding requirements. Six years later, in 2005,  we reiterated the need for a cohesive strategy and broadened our  recommendation\u2019s focus to better address the interrelated nature of  fuel reduction efforts and wildland fire response. In January 2009,  agency officials told us they were working to create such a cohesive  strategy, although they could not provide an estimate of when it would  be completed.   establish clear goals and a strategy to help contain wildland fire  costs. In 2007, we reported that the agencies were taking a number of  steps intended to help contain wildland fire costs, but had not clearly  defined cost-containment goals or developed a strategy for achieving  those goals. Agency officials identified several documents that they  believed provide clearly defined goals and objectives that make up  Interior\u2019s strategy to contain costs. However, the documents lack the  clarity and specificity officials in the field need to help manage and  contain wildland fire costs. We therefore continue to believe that our  recommendations, if effectively implemented, would help the agencies  better manage their cost-containment efforts and improve their ability  to contain wildland fire costs.   continue to improve their processes for allocating fuel reduction  funds and selecting fuel reduction projects. Also in 2007, we identified  several shortcomings in the agencies\u2019 processes for allocating fuel  reduction funds to field units and selecting fuel reduction projects,  shortcomings that limited the agency\u2019s ability to ensure that funds are  directed where they will reduce risk most effectively. While Interior  has taken steps to improve its processes for allocating fuel reduction  funds and the information it uses in selecting fuel reduction projects,  we believe that Interior must continue these efforts so that it can more  effectively use its limited fuel reduction dollars. take steps to improve its use of a new interagency budgeting and  planning tool. In 2008, we reported on the Forest Service\u2019s and  Interior\u2019s development of a new planning tool known as fire program  analysis (FPA). FPA was intended, among other things, to allow the  agencies to analyze potential combinations of firefighting assets, and  potential strategies for reducing fuels and fighting fires so that they  could determine the most cost-effective mix of assets and strategies.  While recognizing that FPA represents a significant step forward and  shows promise in achieving certain of its objectives, we believe the  agencies\u2019 approach to FPA\u2019s development hampers it from meeting  other key objectives. We made a number of recommendations designed  to enhance FPA and the agencies\u2019 ability to use it, and Interior, in  conjunction with the Forest Service, has identified several steps it is  considering taking to do so. It is not yet clear how successful these  steps will be. Furthermore, the steps the agencies outlined do not  address all the shortcomings we identified. We continue to believe  agency improvements are essential if the full potential of FPA is to be  realized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing Oil and Gas Activities on Federal Lands", "paragraphs": ["The number of oil and gas operations that are permitted by BLM for access  to federal oil and gas resources has increased dramatically\u2014more than  quadrupling from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal years 2006 and 2007\u2014in part as  a result of the desire to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on foreign  sources of oil and gas. In June 2005, we reported that BLM has struggled to  deal with the increase in the permitting workload while also carrying out  its responsibility to mitigate the impacts of oil and gas development on  land that it manages. Overall, BLM officials told us that staff had to devote  increasing amounts of time to processing drilling permits, leaving less time  to ensuring the mitigation of the environmental impacts of oil and gas  development. While the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Appropriation Act of Fiscal Year 2008 required BLM to charge a $4,000  processing fee for drilling permits, the act provided that the appropriation  for permit processing would be reduced by the amount of fees received;  thus the fee did not provide any additional resources for BLM to increase  its monitoring and enforcement activities for oil and gas development.  In its fiscal year 2009 budget request, BLM requested authority to  (1) permanently implement a cost recovery fee for processing applications  for permits to drill, (2) set the cost recovery fee at $4,150 for fiscal year  2009, and (3) deposit the revenues generated from the cost recovery fee in  BLM\u2019s Service Charges, Deposits and Forfeitures Account. BLM estimated  the cost recovery fee would generate $34 million for fiscal year 2009.", "Within the energy and minerals budget for fiscal year 2009, BLM also  requested a net increase of $7.8 million for oil and gas activities.", "Just as we have had concerns about BLM\u2019s protection of environmental  resources from oil and gas activities, we have had concerns, as we  reported in 2003, that FWS\u2019s oversight of oil and gas operations on wildlife  refuge lands was not adequate. For example, we found that some refuge  managers took extensive measures to oversee operations and enforce  environmental standards, while others exercised little or no control. Such  disparities occurred for two primary reasons. First, FWS had not officially  determined its authority to require permits\u2014which would include  environmental conditions to protect refuge resources\u2014of all oil and gas  operations in refuges; we believe the agency has such authority. Second,  refuge managers lacked guidance, adequate staffing levels, and training to  properly oversee oil and gas activities. We also found that FWS was not  collecting complete and accurate information on damage to refuge lands  as a result of oil and gas operations and not identifying the steps needed to  address that damage. In June 2007, we reported that the FWS had  generally not taken sufficient actions to address five of the six  recommendations we had made in 2003 to improve FWS\u2019s management  and oversight of oil and gas activities on national wildlife refuges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adapting to the Effects of Climate Change on Public Lands", "paragraphs": ["A growing body of evidence shows that increasing concentrations of  greenhouse gases\u2014primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous  oxide\u2014in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere have resulted in a warmer global climate  system, among other changes.

These effects include (1) physical effects, such as droughts, floods, glacial  melting, and sea level rise; (2) biological effects, such as increases in  insect and disease infestations, shifts in species distribution, and changes  in the timing of natural events; and (3) economic and social effects,  such as adverse impacts on tourism, infrastructure, fishing, and other  resource uses.", "BLM, FWS, and NPS have not made climate change a priority, and the  agencies\u2019 strategic plans do not specifically address it.

Interior and the other agencies generally agreed  with our recommendation.", "The effects of a warmer climate have been clearly evident in Alaska. In  December 2003, we reported that coastal villages in Alaska are becoming  more susceptible to flooding and erosion in part because rising  temperatures cause protective shore ice to form later in the year, leaving  the villages vulnerable to fall storms. In addition, rising temperatures in  recent years have led to widespread thawing of the permafrost  (permanently frozen subsoil that is found in over approximately  80 percent of Alaska), causing serious damage. At that time, we found that  flooding and erosion affects 184 out of 213, or 86 percent, of Alaska Native  villages to some extent, and four villages in imminent danger planned to  relocate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resolving Natural Resource Conflicts Through Collaborative Management", "paragraphs": ["Interior\u2019s management of its vast federal estate is largely characterized by  the struggle to balance the demand for greater use of its resources with  the need to conserve and protect them for the benefit of future  generations. In February 2008, we reported that conflicts over the use of  our nation\u2019s natural resources, along with increased ecological problems,  has led land managers to seek cooperative means to resolve natural  resource conflicts and problems. Collaborative resource management is  one such approach that communities began using in the 1980s and 1990s.", "In 2004, an executive order on cooperative conservation encouraged such  efforts. Experts generally view collaborative resource management\u2014 involving public and private stakeholders in natural resource decisions\u2014 as an effective approach for managing natural resources. The benefits that  result from using collaborative resource management include less conflict  and litigation and improved natural resource conditions, according to  experts. Many experts also noted that there are limitations to the  approach, such as the time and resources it takes to bring people together  to work on a problem and reach a decision.

The economic challenges stem from dependence on a few key  industries, scarce natural resources, small domestic markets, limited  infrastructure, shortages of skilled labor, and reliance on federal grants to  fund basic services. In addition, efforts to meet formidable fiscal  challenges and build strong economies are hindered by financial reporting  that does not provide timely and complete information to management  and oversight officials for decision making.

As a result, large volumes of oil and natural gas are exempt from royalties,  which significantly reduces the amount of royalty revenues that the federal  government can collect. At least $1 billion in royalties has already been  lost because of this failure to include price thresholds. We developed a  number of scenarios that showed that forgone royalties from leases issued  between 1996 and 2000 under the act could be as high as $53 billion.  However, there is much uncertainty in this scenario as a result of the  inherent difficulties in estimating future production, ongoing litigation  over MMS\u2019s authority to set price thresholds for some leases, and widely  fluctuating oil and gas prices. Other authorities for granting royalty relief  may also affect future royalty revenues.

In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates relief for leases  issued in the Gulf of Mexico during the 5 years following the act\u2019s passage,  provides some relief for some gas wells that would not have previously  qualified for royalty relief, and addresses relief in certain areas of Alaska  where there currently is little or no production."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Enhancing Other Revenue Collections and Financial Assurances", "paragraphs": ["Additional revenues or financial assurances could be generated through  hardrock mining operations by amending the General Mining Act of 1872  so that the federal government could collect federal royalties on minerals  extracted from U.S. mineral rights and by requiring adequate financial  assurances from hardrock mining operations to fully cover estimated  reclamation costs. Additional revenues could also be generated by  increasing the grazing fee for public lands managed by Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Land Management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Additional Revenue or Financial Assurances Could be Generated Through Hardrock Mining Operations", "paragraphs": ["The General Mining Act of 1872 helped open the West by allowing  individuals to obtain exclusive rights to mine billions of dollars worth of  hardrock minerals from federal lands without having to pay a federal  royalty. In July 2008 we reported that the 12 western states, including  Alaska, assess multiple types of royalties on mining operations. States  may use similar names for the royalties they assess, but these can vary  widely in their forms and rates. Unlike the federal government, these  states charge royalties that allow them to share in the proceeds from  hardrock minerals extracted from state-owned lands, as well as levy taxes  that function like royalties, on private, state, and federal lands.", "Under BLM regulations, hardrock mining operators who extract gold,  silver, copper, and other valuable mineral deposits from land belonging to  the United States are required to provide financial assurances, before they  begin exploration or mining, to guarantee that the costs to reclaim land  disturbed by their operations are paid. However, we reported in June 2005  that BLM did not have a process for ensuring that adequate assurances  were in place. When operators with insufficient financial assurances fail  to reclaim BLM land disturbed by hardrock mining operations, BLM is left  with public land that poses risks to the environment and public health and  safety, and requires millions of federal dollars to reclaim.", "In March 2008, we found that the financial assurances required by BLM  were not adequate to fully cover estimated reclamation costs. According  to BLM, mine operators had provided financial assurances valued at  approximately $982 million to guarantee reclamation costs for  1,463 hardrock operations on BLM land. BLM also estimated that  52 mining operations had financial assurances that amounted to about  $28 million less than needed to fully cover estimated reclamation costs.  However, we found that the financial assurances for these 52 operations  were in fact about $61 million less than needed to fully cover estimated  reclamation costs. The $33 million difference between our estimated  shortfall and BLM\u2019s occurs because BLM calculated its shortfall by  comparing the total value of financial assurances in place with the total  estimated reclamation costs. This calculation approach has the effect of  offsetting the shortfalls in some operations with the financial assurances  of other operations. However, financial assurances that are greater than  the amount required for an operation cannot be transferred to another  operation that has inadequate financial assurances. BLM officials agreed  that it would be valuable to report the dollar value of the difference  between financial assurances in place and required for those operations  where financial assurances are inadequate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Revenue Could be Generated Through an Adjustment to BLM Grazing Fees", "paragraphs": ["Ten federal agencies manage grazing on over 22 million acres, with BLM  and the Forest Service managing the vast majority of this activity. In total,  federal grazing revenue amounted to about $21 million in fiscal year 2004,  although grazing fees differ by agency. For example, in 2004, BLM and the  Forest Service charged $1.43 per animal unit month, while other federal  agencies charged between $0.29 and $112 per animal unit month. We  reported in 2005 that while BLM and the Forest Service charged generally  much lower fees than other federal agencies and private entities, these  fees reflect legislative and executive branch policies to support local  economies and ranching communities. Specifically, BLM fees are set by a  formula that expired in 1985, but was extended indefinitely by executive  order in 1986. This formula takes into account a rancher\u2019s ability to pay  and, therefore, the purpose is not primarily to recover the agencies\u2019 costs  or capture the fair market value of forage. Instead, the formula is designed  to set a fee that helps support ranchers and the western livestock industry.  Other federal agencies employ market-based approaches to setting grazing  fees.", "Using this formula, BLM collected about $12 million in receipts in fiscal  year 2004, while its costs for implementing its grazing program, including  range improvement activities, were about $58 million. Were BLM to  implement approaches used by other agencies to set grazing fees, it could  help to close the gap between expenditures and receipts and more closely  align its fees with market prices. Instead, for 2007, 2008, and 2009, the  grazing fee was set at $1.35 per animal unit month, the lowest level  allowable under the executive order. We recognize, however, that the  purpose and size of BLM\u2019s grazing fee are ultimately for Congress to  decide.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our prepared statement.
