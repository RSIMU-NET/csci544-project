To help prevent improper payments, CMS has implemented national MUEs, which limit the amount of a service that is paid when billed by a provider for a beneficiary on the same day.

This report examines the extent to which CMS has (1) paid for services that exceeded the unpublished MUE limits and (2) examined billing from providers that exceeded unpublished MUE limits. GAO analyzed Medicare claims related to these limits in 2011, and interviewed CMS officials and selected contractors in states with high improper payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Less than 0.1 percent of payments Medicare made in 2011 were for amounts of services that exceeded certain unpublished limits for excess billing and where the claims did not include information from the providers to indicate why the additional services were medically necessary. These limits are set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)--an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--as a means to avoid potentially improper payments. To implement these limits, CMS established automated controls in its payment systems called Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE). These MUEs compare the number of certain services billed against limits for the amount of services likely to be provided under normal medical practice to a beneficiary by the same provider on the same day--for example, no more than one of the same operation on each eye. GAO analysis of 2011 claims data found approximately $14 million out of a total of $23.9 billion in Medicare payments for services that exceeded unpublished MUE limits and where the claims did not include information from the providers to indicate why the additional services were medically necessary. As GAO has previously reported, claims could exceed the limits because the MUEs are not set up as per-day limits that assess all services billed by a provider for a single beneficiary on the same day. CMS plans to begin implementing MUEs for some services as per-day limits for services where it would be impossible to exceed the limits for anatomical or other reasons. Medicare contractors that pay claims may develop local edits, which can set more restrictive limits for some services than the national unpublished MUE limits. GAO's analysis of claims data applying a few of these more restrictive local limits showed that by applying them instead of the relevant national MUE limits, CMS could have lowered payments by an additional $7.8 million. However, CMS is not evaluating these local edits to determine if these lower limits might be more appropriate. To the extent that these and other local edits are not evaluated more systematically, CMS may be missing an opportunity to achieve savings by revising some national MUEs to correspond with more restrictive local limits.", "CMS and its contractors did not have a system in place for examining claims to determine the extent to which providers may be exceeding unpublished MUE limits and whether payments for such services were proper. CMS officials and contractors told us that they examine aberrant billing patterns at a provider level, that is, across all services billed by the provider, but not specifically for services with unpublished MUE limits. GAO found that payments that exceeded MUE limits were concentrated among certain providers and types of specialties, in certain states, and for certain services. For example, the top 100 providers with payments that exceeded the MUE limits accounted for nearly 44 percent of total payments that exceeded the MUE limits, although they accounted for only about 1 percent of total payments for all services with unpublished MUEs. Moreover, about 26 percent of the top 100 providers included clinical laboratories and durable medical equipment providers, both of which have been identified in the past as having high potential for fraudulent billings. Because unpublished MUEs were developed for services and items that have been fraudulently or abusively billed in the past, without systematically examining billing information and claims from the top providers exceeding those limits CMS may be missing another opportunity to improve its program integrity efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS examine contractor edits to determine if any national unpublished MUE limits should be revised; and consider reviewing claims to identify providers that exceed the unpublished MUE limits, and determine whether their billing was proper.

Because of its  size, complexity, and susceptibility to improper payments, we have  designated Medicare as a high-risk program. The Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), has estimated improper Medicare fee-for- service (FFS) payments of $29.6 billion in fiscal year 2012. Over half   (52 percent) of these improper payments were for services under  Medicare Part B, although these services accounted for 29 percent of  total Medicare FFS payments. One internal control strategy that CMS  uses to prevent improper payments is the application of \u201cprepayment  edits\u201d\u2014automated checks in the electronic claims processing systems  that approve or deny claims on the basis of national Medicare coverage  and payment policies that apply to all beneficiaries. One type of these  national edits for Part B services is the \u201cMedically Unlikely Edit\u201d (MUE),  which sets limits on the maximum units of services that may be billed by a  provider for a beneficiary on a single date of service. For example, a  provider may bill for no more than five biopsies of soft tissue in the  forearm or wrist for a beneficiary on a given day. CMS allows additional  units in excess of the MUEs to be billed when providers believe the  services are clinically appropriate. In such cases, special codes, or  modifiers, may be included on the claim to indicate why the services were  clinically appropriate.", "Each MAC covers one or more specific geographical jurisdictions, each made up of one  or more states. in how the MUEs were operationalized, and recommended that CMS  implement MUEs that assess all quantities of services provided to the  same beneficiary by the same provider on the same day, allowing  providers to bill for additional units if they included modifiers that  explained the medical necessity of exceeding the limits.

This  report examines the extent to which CMS has (1) paid for services that  exceeded the unpublished MUE limits and (2) examined billing from  providers that exceeded unpublished MUE limits to determine if it was  proper.", "To examine the extent to which CMS has paid for services that exceeded  the unpublished MUE limits, we analyzed Medicare claims data and  interviewed five MACs. Specifically, we analyzed Medicare paid claims in  calendar year 2011 from CMS\u2019s Carrier Part B 100 percent Standard  Analytic File (which contains claims data about noninstitutional providers,  such as physicians and other practitioners), as well as their 100 percent  DME claims file. We obtained the unpublished MUE limits for calendar  year 2011 from CMS and analyzed the extent to which payments  exceeded the per-day MUE limits. About 1,800 of the 4,150 services with  unpublished MUEs were included in the Carrier Part B Standard Analytic  File and DME claims files, and these were the services we analyzed. We  excluded any services billed with modifiers that potentially explained the  reason for claiming additional units. We reviewed relevant  documentation describing how claims data are collected and processed,  and examined other research, including our prior reports, that have used  these data. We determined that the data we used were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our work. We also interviewed five Part A/B  and DME MACs in three states that CMS had identified as having high  improper billing and suspected fraud (California, Florida, and Texas).We requested local edits the MACs had developed for their jurisdictions  that, similar to the national unpublished MUEs, set limits on the number of  units of a service that could be billed by a physician for a beneficiary on  the same day. We selected 13 high-volume services where the local limits  were more restrictive than the national unpublished MUE limits. We  estimated the extent of potential savings if CMS were to implement these  local limits on a national basis in place of the unpublished MUE limits. We  consulted with the MACs and the MUE contractor on an ongoing basis to  ensure the validity of our results. Finally, we identified which internal  controls were significant for our engagement and then compared them to  the processes CMS uses to ensure adequate communication with, and  collection of information from, its contractors and adequate monitoring of  program activities.", "To examine the extent to which CMS examined billing from providers that  exceeded the unpublished MUE limits, we interviewed officials from CMS  and the five MACs.

In  addition to the Part A/B and DME MACs that process and pay claims,  CMS also employs other types of contractors to specifically address fraud  and improper payments. These include: Recovery Audit contractors (RA),  which review claims postpayment in four RA jurisdictions to identify  improper payments and Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC),  which review claims on a pre- and postpayment basis in seven ZPIC  jurisdictions to identify potential fraud.", "All of these contractors use data analysis to identify providers who bill  improperly, whether by mistake or intentionally, to help target their claims  review. CMS has expanded its Integrated Data Repository, which was set  up to integrate Medicare and Medicaid claims, beneficiary, provider, and  other data, and is currently populated with 5 years of historical Part A,  Part B, and Part D paid claims data. CMS\u2019s contractors can use these  data to analyze previously undetected indicators of aberrant billing activity  throughout the claims processing cycle. CMS intends to develop shared  data models and is pursuing data sharing and matching agreements with  other federal agencies to identify potential fraud, waste, and abuse  throughout federal health care programs. CMS has set expectations that  RAs and ZPICs will provide information on types of potentially  problematic claims to help the agency identify vulnerabilities.", "CMS has also recently developed a \u201cFraud Prevention System\u201d which  uses predictive modeling technology to screen all FFS claims before  payment is made. Claims are streamed through the Fraud Prevention  System prior to payment and analyzed on the basis of algorithms that  include other information, such as past billing, to identify patterns of  potentially fraudulent billing by providers. The billing is prioritized for risk  of fraud, with the highest-priority cases investigated by ZPICs. Prior to  applying predictive models to claims prepayment, CMS tests the  algorithms to try to ensure that resources are targeted to the highest-risk  claims or providers while payment of claims to legitimate providers  continues to occur without disruption."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Development and Implementation of MUEs", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with Medicare law, CMS sets national coverage and payment  policies regarding when and how services will be covered by Medicare,  as well as coding and billing requirements for claims.developed national payment policies related to MUEs to limit potentially   CMS has  improper and excess payments to providers for many services, especially  those that are prone to potential fraud or that result from billing errors. A  CMS MUE Workgroup, which includes staff from CMS and the MUE  contractor, is responsible for developing the national MUE limits, in  consultation with the medical community. MUE limits are developed as  per-day limits on the number of units of a given service or medical  product that can be provided by the same physician to the same  beneficiary. The limits are developed on the basis of coding conventions  defined in the American Medical Association\u2019s (AMA) Current Procedural  Terminology manual, national and local policies and edits, coding  guidelines developed by national societies, analysis of standard medical  and surgical practice, as well as an analysis of current provider billing  practices. Prior to their implementation, proposed MUE limits are released  for a review and comment period to the AMA, national medical/surgical  societies, and other national health care organizations. However,  unpublished MUEs are not released for comment. The MUE files are  updated quarterly and new limits may be added at these times.", "Although MUEs were developed as limits on the number of units of a  service a provider could bill for a beneficiary in a single day, as we  previously reported they are not implemented as such. Specifically, they  do not look at total units on all claims from one provider for the same  beneficiary across an entire day, and the limits may therefore be  exceeded. A claim can have multiple lines and providers may bill multiple  units of the same service for the same beneficiary on the same day on  multiple lines of a claim. In processing the claim, contractors\u2019 automated  systems only examine the number of units on each claim line. If the  number of units on the claim line exceeds the MUE limit, the entire claim  line is denied. However, as long as the units on a claim line are at or  below the MUE limit, they are paid. Thus, the automated claims- processing systems allow the MUE per-day limits to be exceeded for a  beneficiary if providers bill multiple units of the same service on multiple  claim lines. The systems also allow limits to be exceeded for a beneficiary  if a provider bills for multiple units of the same service performed on the  same day on different claims.
