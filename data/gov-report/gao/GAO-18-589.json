The schedules for all three projects are better constructed and more credible than previously reviewed project schedules. For example, the Bureau has improved the logic of the relationship between activities, and better ensured that all schedules are linked together in a master schedule so that their interactions can be better managed.", "However, the three selected schedules have some of the same weaknesses GAO identified in other Bureau schedules in 2009 and 2013. For example, none of the selected schedules contain information on resource needs and availability. GAO has reported that such information assists program offices in forecasting the likelihood that activities will be completed as scheduled. It can also help management compute total labor and equipment hours, calculate total project and per-period cost, resolve resource conflicts, and establish the reasonableness of the plan. If the schedule does not allow insight into current or projected allocation of resources, then the likelihood is significantly increased that the program may slip or need additional resources to complete on time.", "In GAO's 2009 review of the Bureau's schedule, GAO recommended that the Bureau include in the 2020 master schedule estimates of the resources, such as labor, materials, and overhead costs for each activity as the 2020 schedule was built. The Department of Commerce did not respond to the recommendation at that time. Then, regarding GAO's 2013 assessment of the Bureau's schedule, Bureau officials stated that they hoped to begin identifying the resources needed for each activity in their schedules by early 2014. However, as of May 2018, the Bureau had not taken these steps.

The Bureau said that it had no  disagreement with these recommendations, yet these recommendations  have not been implemented. With less than 2 years until Census Day, there is little time remaining for the Bureau to deal with any unexpected  problems that may arise. Accordingly, early recognition of potential delays  is essential, and remaining activities need to begin and end on schedule  and in the proper operational sequence.", "In response to your request, our objective was to determine the extent to  which the Bureau is using leading practices for scheduling key projects. In  order to meet this objective, we selected the following three projects for  review: 2018 End-to-End Census Test Address Canvassing, 2018 End-to- End Census Test Nonresponse Follow-up, and 2020 Census Geographic  Programs. These projects are critical to the Bureau\u2019s ability to build and  maintain an accurate address list, and help ensure that households  respond to the census. We selected these projects based on their high  cost, their significance to the 2020 Census, and that they were still in  progress.", "We compared the schedules for each of these projects to the leading  practices in our Schedule Assessment Guide.

In  February 2017, we added the 2020 Census to our High-Risk List because  operational and other issues including scheduling are threatening the  Bureau\u2019s ability to deliver a cost-effective enumeration. We reported on  concerns about the quality of the Bureau\u2019s schedule and cost  assessment, the Bureau\u2019s capacity to implement innovative census-taking  methods, and uncertainties surrounding critical information technology  systems. Underlying these issues are challenges in such essential  management functions as the Bureau\u2019s ability to  collect and use real-time indicators of schedule, cost, and  performance;  follow leading practices for scheduling, cost estimation, risk  management, and IT acquisition, development, testing, and security;  and  cost effectively deal with contingencies including, for example, fiscal  constraints, potential changes in design, and natural disasters that  could affect the enumeration.", "Reliable scheduling practices are essential for managing tradeoffs  between cost, schedule, and scope. Among other things, scheduling  allows program managers to decide between possible sequences of  activities, determine the flexibility of the schedule according to available  resources, predict the consequences of managerial action or inaction in  events, and allocate contingency plans to mitigate risk. Following  changes in a program, the schedule is used to forecast the effects of  delayed, deleted, and added effort, as well as possible avenues for time  and cost recovery.", "Scheduling is important because the cost of counting the nation\u2019s  population has been escalating with each decade. The 2010 Census was  the most expensive in U.S. history at about $12.3 billion, and was about  31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020  constant dollars). According to the Bureau, the total cost of the 2020  Census is now estimated to be approximately $15.6 billion dollars, more  than $3 billion higher than previously estimated by the Bureau.", "Moreover, as shown in figure 1, the average cost for counting a housing  unit increased from about $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010 (in 2020  constant dollars). At the same time, the return of census questionnaires  by mail (the primary mode of data collection) declined over this period  from 78 percent in 1970 to 63 percent in 2010. Declining mail response  rates have led to higher costs because the Bureau needs to send  temporary workers to each nonresponding household to obtain census  data.", "The schedules we reviewed for this report\u20142020 Census Geographic  Programs, 2018 End-to-End Test Address Canvassing, and 2018 End-to- End Census Test Nonresponse Follow-up\u2014relate to the key activities of  developing an accurate address list and following up with households that  did not mail back their census forms. The Bureau relies on a complete  and accurate address list to maximize the more cost-efficient self- response rate.", "The three projects we selected contribute to two of the Census Bureau\u2019s  largest field operations. The Bureau\u2019s Geographic Programs Operation  maintains the Bureau\u2019s master address file and mapping data used to  conduct the 2020 Census. The Bureau\u2019s Geographic Programs Operation  provides the most current address list to the Bureau\u2019s Address  Canvassing Operation, where Bureau staff make updates to the address  list via in-office and in-field procedures. These updates are processed on  an ongoing basis throughout the decade. The Bureau conducts its  Nonresponse Follow-up Operation after Census Day by having  enumerators go door-to-door to determine the housing unit status for  addresses that do not self-respond to the 2020 Census, and enumerate  households that are determined to be occupied."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Census Schedules Better Reflect Characteristics of a Reliable Schedule Compared to Prior Assessment, though Weaknesses Remain", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported in our Schedule Assessment Guide that a  reliable schedule can provide a road map for systematic execution of a  program, and the means by which to gauge progress, identify and  address potential problems, and promote accountability.

The schedule should  cover the scope of work to be performed so that the full picture is  available to managers.", "Well-constructed: Activities should be logically sequenced and critical  activities that would affect the timelines of the schedule should be  identified.", "Credible: All schedules should be linked to a complete master  schedule for managers to reference and analyzed for how risk  impacts the outcome of the schedule.", "Controlled: There should be a documented process for changes to the  schedule so that the integrity of the schedule is assured.", "For a schedule to be reliable, it must substantially or fully meet all criteria  for these four characteristics. These characteristics, their related leading  practices, and their criteria are described in more detail in appendix II.", "In 2013, we assessed the Bureau\u2019s 2020 Research and Testing and  Geographic Support System Initiative schedules using these criteria.  While the results exhibited some of the characteristics of a reliable  schedule, important weaknesses remained. Both schedules substantially  met one of the four characteristics (controlled) and minimally or partially  met the other three characteristics (comprehensive, well-constructed, and  credible).", "For this review, we assessed the 2018 End-to-End Census Test Address  Canvassing, 2018 End-to-End Census Test Nonresponse Follow-up, and  2020 Census Geographic Programs projects\u2019 schedules. We found that  overall the selected schedules better reflected two of the four  characteristics of a reliable schedule compared to our 2013 assessment  (see figure 2).", "Examples of the extent to which these characteristics were met are  provided below.

Additionally, the 2018  End-to-End Census Test Address Canvassing and the 2018 End-to-End  Census Test Nonresponse Follow-up project schedules contain clear start  and finish milestones, and map to the census program work breakdown  structure\u2014a detailed definition of the work necessary to accomplish a  program\u2019s objectives.", "This leading practice of capturing all activities was substantially met, not  fully met (see appendix III for a more detailed explanation), because while  for each project all activities and milestones are mapped to their work  breakdown structures by codes, there are no corresponding dictionaries  to define the work. The absence of such a dictionary could potentially  lead to confusion among staff in different census offices about the scope  of the work they are responsible for performing.", "Our schedule guide states that a work breakdown structure dictionary is a  valuable communication tool between systems engineers, program  management, and other stakeholders because it provides a clear picture  of what efforts have to be accomplished. Bureau officials stated that  although their 2020 Schedule Management Plan requires each project to  have a schedule work breakdown structure dictionary, as project  schedules are updated, they have not created these required dictionaries.  As an alternative, they noted that the 2020 Census Operational Plan  includes details and definitions of the projects.", "Additionally, none of the three schedules we assessed include  information about what levels of resources, such as labor and equipment,  are required to complete the planned work\u2014including this information is  called resource loading. The Bureau\u2019s 2020 Schedule Management Plan  states that it is the responsibility of a representative from a project team  and the schedule staff to assign resources to an individual project  schedule, and that defining and assigning resources should be done  following the testing phase of the 2020 Census Lifecycle.", "The Bureau is now in its implementation phase (see figure 3 below), so  according to its management plan, resource loading should have begun.  But it has not. For example, the 2018 End-to-End Census Test Address  Canvassing project schedule did not include any resource information on  the recruiting and hiring goals for the address canvassing field work.", "Instead, Bureau officials stated that they are estimating the cost of  activities using a software tool separate from the current schedule  management tool. They further stated that this Bureau-wide solution  includes all 2020 Decennial Census staff as Decennial funded resources.  However, the information in this separate tool has no effect on the  durations or forecasted start and finish dates of detailed activities within  individual projects. Furthermore, the separate tool does not always track  all activities at the lowest level in the schedule, so that Bureau managers  do not have reliable visibility with it on the efforts of the lowest level of  detailed activities.", "Resource loading is important for any agency, but is particularly important  for the Census Bureau, given its statutorily mandated deadlines. Missed  deadlines or schedule slippage can easily jeopardize the quality of the  2020 Census, and there is little room for error given that census data are  used to apportion the seats of the House of Representatives, redraw  congressional districts, and allocate billions of dollars each year in federal  financial assistance. In our schedule guide, we reported that including  resources such as labor, materials, and overhead costs can make a  schedule a more useful management tool.", "A resource-loaded schedule can help management with things such as  computing labor and equipment hours, calculating total project and per- period cost, resolving resource allocation conflicts, determining whether  all required resources will be available when they are needed, and  establishing the reasonableness of the plan. For example, information on  the resource needs of field operations in the 2018 End-to-End Census  Test would assist management in determining if the appropriate resource  allocations have been made for any given test activity. It would also aide  in forecasting the likelihood that those resources will be available to  complete the 2018 End-to-End Census Test Address Canvassing and  Nonresponse Follow-up activities as scheduled. If the schedule does not  allow insight into the current or projected allocation of resources for these  test activities, the Bureau\u2019s risk of key end-to-end test milestones slipping  increases significantly.", "In 2009, we reviewed the Bureau\u2019s schedule and recommended that the  Bureau include estimates of the resources in the 2020 integrated  schedule for each activity as the schedule was built. The Department of  Commerce did not respond to the recommendation at that time. In our  2013 assessment of the Bureau\u2019s schedule, Bureau officials stated that  they hoped to begin identifying the resources needed for each activity in  their schedules by early 2014.

In this  assessment, Bureau officials linked many of the activities clearly and in a  straightforward sequence in the schedule, which was not always the case  in prior assessments.", "This improvement is important because it helps staff identify next steps as  they progress through such things as acquiring and mobilizing the staff  needed to conduct the address canvassing and nonresponse follow-up  test field work, and helps managers identify the impact of changes in one  activity on subsequent activities. For example, the schedule lays out the  sequence of activities needed, such as developing training materials,  recruiting field staff, training staff and equipping them with the tools  needed to complete the test. Our assessment also concluded that two of  the three project schedules we assessed have valid critical paths, which  is the sequence of activities in the schedule that, according to their  current status, lead to the program\u2019s earliest completion date. A valid  critical path allows management to focus on activities that will lead to the  project\u2019s success.", "The 2020 Census Geographic Programs project schedule partially met  the well-constructed characteristic due to problems existing within the  schedule\u2019s sequencing logic. In particular, we found a large number of  unjustified date constraints and lags. In part because of these  sequencing issues, total float calculations\u2014that is, the amount of time a  predecessor activity can slip before its delay affects the program\u2019s  estimated finish date\u2014appear unreasonably high. Additionally, this  project schedule has activities on the critical path with long durations. For  example, the project schedule for Geographic Programs included several  long-duration activities on its critical path that relate to the Bureau\u2019s  collection of community boundary data\u2014information essential to  delineating geographic boundaries used in the tabulation of census data.  These critical long-duration activities make it difficult to measure time- critical progress on such activities in the near term.", "These issues with how the schedule is constructed can also cause  schedule users to lack confidence in the forecasted dates. Bureau  officials acknowledged that the 2020 Census Geographic Programs  project schedule had logic issues at the time because it was in the middle  of a revision. Bureau officials stated that the standard process is to  update the project schedule in an offline version and then assess the  quality and impacts of changes before acceptance.
