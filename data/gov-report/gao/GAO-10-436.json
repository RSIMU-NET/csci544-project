GAO's review of selected project information showed that the Army did reduce the estimated cost of some facility construction projects and shortened building timelines during fiscal years 2007 through 2009, but it did not meet its overall stated goals. For example, GAO found that the average building timeline for one key measurement (design start to ready for occupancy) was reduced by about 11 percent--an improvement, but less than the 30 percent goal. The Army discontinued the numerical goals in fiscal year 2010, and Army officials stated that, although the specific goals might not have been achieved, they believed that the Army's efforts were successful in dampening the escalation of Army facilities' costs and would continue to help ensure cost-effective and timely facilities in future years. The Army appears to have achieved some savings in selected construction projects by expanding the use of wood materials and modular construction methods for some of its facilities, but GAO found little quantitative data on whether the use of these materials and methods will result in savings over the long term compared to the traditional use of steel, concrete, and masonry materials and on-site building methods. Without long-term or life-cycle analyses that consider not only initial construction costs but also possible differences in facility service lives and annual operating and maintenance costs between the construction alternatives, it is not clear that the Army's expanded use of wood materials and modular building methods will achieve the Army's intended purpose of reduced facility costs over the long term. The Navy and the Air Force generally disagreed with the Army's view and believed that the use of wood materials and modular construction will result in facilities with shorter service lives and higher life-cycle costs. However, none of the services had the analyses to support its views. Without additional study and analysis, DOD will not know whether military construction program guidance needs to be changed to ensure that facilities are constructed with materials and methods that meet needs at the lowest cost over the long term. Conflicts between antiterrorism building standards and sustainable design goals exist, but military service officials stated that the conflicts are considered to be manageable. GAO's review of 90 Army, Navy, and Air Force military construction projects, approved during fiscal years 2007 through 2009, showed that although incorporating the standards and the goals in new facilities added to construction costs, 80 of the projects required no special steps or workarounds to meet both the standards and the goals. However, service officials noted that achieving higher levels of sustainability in future construction projects while still meeting the antiterrorism standards would further increase initial facility costs and create additional design challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Army has been faced with a significant challenge to meet the facility  needs associated with several recent initiatives, such as the transformation  of the Army\u2019s force structure, the permanent relocation of thousands of  overseas military personnel back to the United States, the implementation  of Base Realignment and Closure actions, and the planned increase in the  Army\u2019s active-duty end strength. Taken together, the Army estimated that  these initiatives would result in a threefold increase in the Army\u2019s military  construction program with appropriated funding increasing from about  $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2005 to a peak of about $10.7 billion in fiscal year  2009 before beginning to decrease back to more historical levels.", "The Army concluded that if it continued to use traditional military  construction acquisition and building practices then it could not  successfully meet the challenges associated with such a large increase in  the volume and costs of facility construction, as well as the need to  complete new required facilities in time to meet planned movements of  organizations and personnel. Thus, in 2006, the Army adopted a strategy,  known as military construction transformation, which included numerous  changes to its traditional practices that were designed to reduce facility  acquisition costs and construction timelines. Among the changes were the  development of standard designs for common facility types, the use of a  standardized format to obtain contractor bids for facility construction  projects, a transition from \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d to \u201cdesign-build\u201d project  delivery, and a change from including detailed, prescriptive construction  requirements in facility solicitations to the use of performance-based  criteria that focused on what the Army needed rather than on how to meet  the needs. Another change in the Army\u2019s strategy was the expanded use of  all types of construction materials and methods allowed by Department of  Defense (DOD) building guidance. This included greater use of wood  materials and modular building methods, as compared to the use of steel,  concrete, and masonry materials and on-site building methods  traditionally used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force for larger permanent  facilities, such as administrative buildings and barracks.", "In view of the expected results from the implementation of its new military  construction transformation strategy, the Army established goals to  reduce its military construction costs by 15 percent and facility  construction timelines by 30 percent beginning in fiscal year 2007.

The projects selected  represented a range of facility types and geographic locations and were in  the categories of facilities subject to the cost goal. We also determined  whether the Army met its building timeline reduction goal by comparing  actual building timelines for all completed projects before and after the  goals were established. In addition, we interviewed Army, Navy, and Air  Force officials and reviewed documentation, policies, and construction  guidance on the Army\u2019s expanded use of wood materials and modular  building methods; obtained information about how different building  materials and methods affect initial construction costs, long-term costs,  and durability of new military facilities; summarized studies from  construction industry groups on how different building materials affect  construction costs; visited five Army installations to review recent  construction projects and discuss with local officials the use of wood  materials and modular building methods; and met with developers of two  military privatized, unaccompanied personnel housing projects to discuss  the building materials and methods used in those projects. Further, we  reviewed applicable DOD policies, guidance, and goals related to  incorporating antiterrorism construction standards and sustainable design  goals in new military facilities; interviewed military service officials about  how antiterrorism standards and sustainable design goals affect  construction costs and how potential conflicts between the standards and  goals are addressed; and followed up with project planners on a non- probability sample of 90 Army, Navy, and Air Force military construction  projects from fiscal years 2007 through 2009 to obtain details on any  conflicts encountered when incorporating the standards and goals in the  projects. We selected projects from a list of all Army, Navy, and Air Force  military construction projects approved during fiscal years 2007 through  2009 to represent a range of facility types and geographic locations and  included 10 Army, 10 Navy, and 10 Air Force projects approved in each of  the 3 years.

However, we also found that  questions remained concerning the durability of wood-frame barracks and  the ability of wood-frame barracks to meet all antiterrorism force  protection requirements. We recommended that engineering studies be  undertaken to resolve these questions. DOD concurred with our  recommendation and subsequently the Army determined that wood-frame  barracks could be built in a manner that met all antiterrorism construction  standards.

The Army\u2019s decision  to expand its consideration and use wood materials and modular  construction for some permanent facilities was primarily based on the  Army\u2019s desire to reduce military construction costs and building timelines  in view of the significant increase in the Army\u2019s construction requirements  beginning in fiscal year 2006. According to Army officials, the Army  believed that the increased use of wood framing and modular construction  would reduce initial construction costs and building timelines for new  facilities, result in facilities that met the Army\u2019s needs, and also result in  lower facility life-cycle costs. However, the Army did not have substantial  quantitative information or analyses to support its view on lower life-cycle  costs. For example, according to Army officials, the Army had performed  only two analyses that compared the life-cycle costs of permanent  facilities built with alternative construction materials and building  methods. One analysis compared the life-cycle cost of a barracks built  with wood materials with the life-cycle costs of a similar barracks built  with steel, concrete, and masonry. Although this analysis estimated that  the barracks constructed with wood would have lower life-cycle costs, the  analysis was not based on actual costs. Instead, the analysis used cost  estimates which might or might not provide a reliable prediction of actual  costs over the long term. In addition, our review of the analysis found  other flaws and data errors, such as understating the square footage of one  of the projects by 39 percent, which affected the outcome of the analysis  and cast further doubt on the reliability of the analysis.

Senior officials with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  and the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment stated that  they believed that use of wood materials and modular methods instead of  steel, concrete, and masonry would result in facilities with shorter service  lives and higher, not lower, life-cycle costs. To illustrate, the officials  noted that features sometimes used in wood-frame construction could  result in higher maintenance costs. For example, a wood-frame building  finished with a shingle roof might have higher maintenance costs over the  long term compared to a building finished with a steel roof because the  shingles would have to be replaced periodically over the life of the  building. While their views differed with the Army, Navy and Air Force  officials stated that they had little quantitative support for their views and  had performed no analyses that compared the long-term costs of facilities  built with wood materials versus steel, concrete, and masonry materials.", "During our visits to private organizations that represented the interests of  wood, modular building, and concrete and masonry industries, we found  various views and opinions on the long-term merits and economic benefits  from the use of alternative construction materials and building methods.", "However, we did not find documented analyses comparing the actual life- cycle costs of facilities constructed with alternative materials and  methods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wood-Frame Construction Can Result in Lower Initial Construction Costs", "paragraphs": ["To gain some insight into the economic merits of the Army\u2019s increased use  of wood materials and modular construction, we reviewed available  information related to initial facility construction costs depending on the  materials and methods used to construct new buildings. We found  evidence that the use of wood-frame construction can result in lower  initial building costs. For example, we found that the Army apparently had  achieved construction cost savings by using wood-frame construction in  several barracks projects that were initially designed to be built with steel,  concrete, and masonry. To illustrate, according to Army officials, a fiscal  year 2006 project at Fort Carson to construct a barracks and company  operations facility was estimated to cost about $35 million based on actual  contract bids and the use of steel, concrete, and masonry construction.  After switching the barracks\u2019 design to wood-frame construction and  resoliciting the project, the officials stated that the project was  subsequently awarded for about $24 million, a savings of about                 $11 million, or 31 percent in estimated costs (see fig. 2).", "Similarly, a fiscal year 2001 barracks project at Fort Meade, Maryland,  called for the construction of eight three-story barracks buildings with a  total of 576 private sleeping rooms. On the basis of the project\u2019s initial  design using steel, concrete, and masonry, the Army estimated that the  project would cost about $48 million, which was more than the amount  approved for the project. In an effort to reduce the cost, the project was  redesigned to specify the use of wood materials and residential  construction practices. Subsequently, the project was constructed at a  cost of about $39 million, or about $9 million (19 percent) less than the  original estimated cost (see fig. 3).", "Sources outside of DOD also have noted that the use of wood-frame  construction can result in lower initial building costs. For example, an  August 2009 building valuation guide published by the International Code  Council reported that the use of residential building methods, including  wood-frame construction, for several types of facilities resulted in a 19  percent to 25 percent construction cost savings compared to the use of  commercial construction methods, including the use of steel, concrete,  and masonry materials. Also, a 2005 study collected information from  cities across the United States to develop a construction cost model to  accurately evaluate the relative construction costs of a multifamily  building constructed using five different construction materials.

For example, we reviewed the annual maintenance  costs associated with two wood-frame barracks projects constructed in  2003 and 2006 at Fort Meade and Fort Detrick, Maryland, respectively.  These facilities are the Army\u2019s initial two modern, permanent barracks  constructed with wood frame. During fiscal years 2007 and 2008, the  annual maintenance costs of the wood-frame barracks on a square-foot  basis was significantly less than the annual maintenance costs of other  barracks at each installation constructed with steel, concrete, and  masonry methods. However, the wood-frame barracks were newer by  several years compared to the concrete and masonry barracks, which  could account for the difference in maintenance costs. Still, local officials  responsible for barracks maintenance at each installation stated that  based on experience to date they believed that even in the long term the  annual maintenance costs of the wood-frame barracks would be no  greater than the annual maintenance costs of the installations\u2019 concrete  and masonry barracks.", "As another illustration, we visited two privatized housing projects for  unmarried servicemembers where service officials stated that private  developers were responsible for constructing, owning, operating, and  maintaining the housing for 50 years in one case and 46 years in the other.  During each visit, the developers stated that wood-frame construction was  being used because the developers believed that, based on their internal  long-term cost analyses, this type of construction would result in the most  economical project over the long term. For example, the Navy partnered  with a developer to build a pilot privatized housing project for  unaccompanied personnel in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. The project  includes the construction of 755 rooms in a six-story midrise building and  435 rooms in 87 separate housing units. The developer stated that the  midrise building used noncombustible materials, such as concrete, and the  87 separate housing units used wood-frame materials. The developer  stated that the type of construction used for each type of building was  based on the most cost-effective type of construction, considering life- cycle costs, to provide the lowest total cost over a 50-year period. Further,  the developer also stated that, because the exterior surfaces and interior  finishes for both the midrise building and separate housing units were very  similar, no difference in operation and maintenance costs was anticipated  with regard to the different types of construction (see fig. 4).", "In the other project visited, the Army had partnered with a developer to  build, own, and operate a privatized housing project for senior unmarried  servicemembers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for 46 years.

Army officials stated that because  missions, requirements, and standards change over time, facilities  constructed today will be outdated in 20 to 25 years and will require major  renovation or possibly conversion to other uses to meet needs in the far  outyears. Thus, Army officials stated that considering facility use beyond  25 years is not productive and facilities built with wood-frame materials  and modular building methods will meet the Army\u2019s needs even if they do  not last as long as facilities constructed with steel, concrete, and masonry.", "Officials at the Army installations we visited had various opinions on the  expected service life and durability of facilities constructed with wood  materials and modular building methods.

For  example, the planners of a fiscal year 2007 child development center at  Fort Lewis, Washington, reported that special steps or workarounds were  needed to simultaneously meet antiterrorism standards and sustainable  goals. According to the planners, both the child care program and  sustainable design goals encouraged large window areas on the exterior of  the building for daylighting and child-height window views on both the  building\u2019s exterior and interior. However, the antiterrorism standards and  recommendations encourage reduced window sizes with specific window  glazing techniques to minimize hazards from flying glass fragments and the  use of reflective glazing to prevent views of a building\u2019s interior.

Specifically, project planners reported that,  primarily because of the required standoff distances around new facilities,  18 (20 percent) of the 90 projects we reviewed resulted in additional land  use, community decentralization, or installation development sprawl. For  example, planners of a fiscal year 2008 instruction building at Fort  Huachuca, Arizona, reported that because of the antiterrorism standoff  distance standard, the building site was approximately 50 percent larger  than required if there were no standoff requirements.

To  obtain additional details on how the services were dealing with potential  conflicts between the standards and the goals, we followed up with the  project planners responsible for 90 military construction projects selected  from a non-probability sample of Army, Navy, and Air Force projects  approved during fiscal years 2007 through 2009. We selected projects for  review from a list of all Army, Navy, and Air Force military construction  projects approved during fiscal years 2007 through 2009. We also selected  projects to represent a range of facility types and geographic locations and  included 10 Army, 10 Navy, and 10 Air Force projects approved in each of  the three fiscal years\u2014for a total of 30 projects approved in each fiscal  year. During the follow up, we asked the project planners whether the  projects required any special steps or workarounds to meet both  antiterrorism standards and sustainable design goals and whether the  projects resulted in additional land use, community decentralization, or  installation development sprawl. We did not independently verify the  information provided by the project planners. In addition, to obtain  additional details on the costs of incorporating antiterrorism standards  and sustainable design features in new facilities, we reviewed information  contained in the project justification of each of the 90 projects. The  justifications included the estimated cost to incorporate antiterrorism  standards in the project and, for fiscal year 2009 projects, the justifications  also included the estimated cost to incorporate sustainable design goals.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2009 to February 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The  guidance adopted the 2006 International Building Code, with some  modifications and exceptions, as the building code for DOD. The  International Building Code defines allowable types of construction based  on factors such as the size, configuration, and planned facility use and  categorizes planned buildings into five construction types. The  construction type classifications are based on the fire-resistive capabilities  of the predominant materials used in the construction progressing from  type I, the most fire-resistive, to type V, the least fire-resistive. More  specifically, types I and II construction incorporate materials such as steel,  concrete, and masonry which, in accordance with applicable testing  standards, are classified as noncombustible. Types III and V construction  incorporate the use of any material permitted by the code to include  combustible materials such as wood products and plastics. Type IV  construction is related to the use of heavy timber. Table 4 illustrates the  materials that are allowed to be used in the building elements\u2014i.e., the  structural frame, bearing walls, nonbearing walls, floor, and roof\u2014of a  facility built according to each type of construction.", "In each of the construction types, the intended level of fire protection is  achieved by assembling building elements to achieve fire-resistance  ratings established by the International Building Code. In a type I steel- frame building, for example, spray-applied fire-resistive material can be  used to enable the structural frame to achieve the 3-hour fire-resistance  rating required by the code, and in a type V wood-frame building, covering  exposed wood with drywall allows the affected building elements to  achieve the 1-hour fire-resistance rating required by the code. In addition  to the fire protection provided by the assembly of building elements, the  code establishes requirements for use of automatic fire sprinkler systems  based on factors to include the planned use and size of a facility and the  planned number of occupants.", "The International Building Code also serves to limit building size based on  the level of fire protection provided by its construction. Because type I  construction is the most fire-resistive of the construction types, the code  places minimal limits on the dimensions of type I buildings. To account for  the comparatively lower level of fire protection provided by type II  through type V construction types, the code establishes limits on building  dimensions. For example, a type V barracks building that is protected with  an automatic sprinkler system is limited under the code to a maximum  height of 4 stories, or 60 feet, with each story having maximum floor area  of 36,000 square feet.", "DOD has traditionally built permanent buildings using on-site construction  where materials are delivered to the construction site and the materials  are then assembled into a finished facility. However, as part of its military  construction transformation strategy, the Army has allowed, among other  alternative construction techniques, the use of modular construction. In  this method of construction, building sections are fabricated off-site in a  factory environment, transported to the construction site, and then  connected to other building sections to assemble the facility. Although  some on-site construction is normally needed to complete the facility, the  Modular Building Institute reports that in a typical modular construction  project between 80 and 95 percent of the total construction is completed  at an off-site factory. Because the off-site construction can proceed under  controlled conditions at the same time that on-site foundation and other  work is being completed, modular construction projects can potentially be  completed with less material waste and in less time compared to projects  built with on-site construction methods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: DOD\u2019s Antiterrorism Construction Standards", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s minimum antiterrorism construction standards are contained in  DOD\u2019s Unified Facilities Criteria 4-010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism  Standards for Buildings. The standards include 22 mandatory standards  and 17 recommended, but not required, measures designed to mitigate  antiterrorism vulnerabilities and terrorist threats in inhabited buildings.  Mandatory standards 1 through 5 are considered site planning standards.  These standards note that operational, logistic, and security requirements  must be integrated into the overall design of buildings, equipment,  landscaping, parking, roads, and other features and that the most cost- effective solution for mitigating explosive effects on buildings is to keep  explosives as far as possible from the buildings. Standards 6 through 9 are  considered structural design standards. These standards require that  additional structural measures be incorporated into building designs to  ensure that buildings do not experience progressive collapse or otherwise  experience disproportionate damage even if required standoff distances  can be achieved. Standards 10 through 15 are considered architectural  design standards. These standards cover many aspects of building layout  that must be incorporated into designs to improve overall protection of  personnel inside buildings. Standards 16 through 22 are considered  electrical and mechanical design standards. These standards address  limiting damage to critical infrastructure; protecting building occupants  against chemical, biological, and radiological threats; and notifying  building occupants of threats or hazards. Concerning the 17 recommended  measures, DOD states that incorporating these measures can enhance site  security and building occupants\u2019 safety with little increase in cost and  should be considered for all new and existing inhabited buildings.

Created in 1998, the rating system  represents the Council\u2019s effort to provide a nationally accepted benchmark  for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green  buildings. The system also provides for a certification program for new  construction projects by identifying a set of prerequisites and credits  categorized under several environmental categories. The prerequisites are  required tasks in order to be considered for a certification. The credits are  tasks, steps, or measures that could be incorporated into a construction  project and include a variable number of points\u2014some based on  performance levels and some based on addressing distinct measures  related to an overarching sustainable concept. The United States Green  Building Council can award a specific certification level to a new building  depending on the total number of points achieved in the design and  construction of the building. The certification levels for new construction  and renovation projects under the 2009 rating system include: certified (40  to 49 points), silver (50 to 59 points), gold (60 to 79 points), and platinum  (80 points and above). For fiscal year 2009, DOD set a goal that at least 70  percent of DOD\u2019s new buildings would be silver-level certifiable. However,  each of the military services set a goal that beginning in fiscal year 2009 all  new major military construction buildings would be designed and  constructed to be silver-level certifiable.", "Table 6 below shows by category the prerequisites, credits, and available  points under the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s Leadership in Energy and  Environmental Design Green Building Rating System."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Terry Dorn, Director; Michael  Armes, Assistant Director; Laura Durland, Assistant Director; Grace  Coleman; George Depaoli; Tobin McMurdie; Jeanett Reid; and Gary  Phillips made significant contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Federal Energy Management: Agencies are Taking Steps to Meet High- Performance Federal Building Requirements, but Face Challenges and  Need to Clarify Roles and Responsibilities.
