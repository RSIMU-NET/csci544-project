The quantum computing group, co-chaired by officials from 4 agencies, and the synthetic biology group, led by the National Science Foundation, have taken initial steps to implement some leading practices GAO identified that can enhance and sustain interagency collaboration. For example, both groups agreed to coordinate their research, and participating agencies documented agreement with the quantum computing group's purpose through a charter. However, the groups have not fully implemented other practices, such as agreeing on roles and responsibilities and identifying common outcomes, that could help ensure they effectively marshal agencies' efforts to maintain U.S. competitiveness in quantum computing and synthetic biology.", "Experts identified considerations for maintaining U.S. competitiveness through transformational technological advances.

In fiscal year 2017, the  federal government obligated nearly $70 billion for research, according to  the National Science Foundation (NSF). While some research leads to  incremental changes in a scientific field, other research can yield  disruptive or transformational advances. These advances are  transformational because they result in new technologies or significantly  enhanced capabilities in existing technologies.", "The United States is considered a world leader in many science and  technology areas, but other countries, such as China, are also making  considerable investments in research. Increased competition from these  countries has led some experts and others to express concern that the  United States may be losing its competitive advantage. In January 2018,  NSF\u2019s National Science Board reported that the United States\u2019 overall  global share of research and development spending is declining relative  to other countries. Moreover, other reports indicate that the United  States is losing ground in certain technologies, such as intense ultrafast  lasers, which may have applications in manufacturing, medicine, and  national security.", "Since 2007, a series of laws has built on prior federal efforts to invest in  innovation through research and development and to improve the United  States\u2019 competitiveness. In 2007, the America Creating Opportunities to  Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science  Act (COMPETES 2007) established the Advanced Research Projects  Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) in the Department of Energy (DOE) to  overcome long-term and high-risk technological barriers in the  development of energy technologies. It also, among other things,  authorized programs in the Department of Education and NSF to train  teachers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. In  2011, the COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 reauthorized parts of  COMPETES 2007, established several new programs, and authorized  additional funding for STEM education. In 2017, the American Innovation  and Competitiveness Act of 2017 reauthorized some parts of the  COMPETES acts. The three acts also provided direction to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), whose responsibilities include  coordinating federal research programs, advising the President on  scientific and technological considerations with regard to federal budgets,  and advising the President of scientific and technological considerations  involved in areas of national concern.", "However, continued concerns related to the federal debt and federal  budget deficits are forcing difficult decisions about how much the federal  government should spend on research, as well as what types of research  it should fund. These concerns overlie a long-standing debate about the  federal government\u2019s role in supporting science and technology research  and which roles should be left to the private sector, academia, or other  nonfederal entities. We have reported that the government often funds  research at the early stages of technology development, whereas industry  typically supports the final stages of technology development. As a  result, U.S. innovators may find it difficult to obtain public funding or  private investment during the middle stages of innovation. We have also  reported that substantial amounts of funding or investment are needed to  support technology maturation through the middle stages of innovation  and that high costs can be a barrier to technology commercialization,  especially for small and medium-sized U.S. enterprises. Long-standing  disagreements among stakeholders about the appropriateness of the  federal government taking an active role in supporting technological  advances with ambiguous applications has led to the creation, and  sometimes the dissolution, of programs such as the Advanced  Technology Program and the Technology Innovation Program. These two  programs were established to help U.S. businesses and organizations  support, promote, and accelerate innovation through high-risk, high- reward research in areas of critical national need. Different perspectives  on the appropriate federal role may have also led to the proposals in the  President\u2019s Budget for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to eliminate ARPA-E.", "You asked us to examine federal and nonfederal support for research that  could accelerate innovation and advance U.S. competitiveness.

We selected these two areas based on several factors,  including that they (1) represent enabling or platform technologies, (2) are  supported by a mix of federal agencies and nonfederal entities, and (3)  represent areas of congressional interest in which we have not recently  conducted work. For the purposes of our report, we defined quantum  computing as computing in which bits of data are manipulated by using  the behavior of atoms, molecules, or other quantum systems, with the  potential to carry out extremely complicated calculations for specific  problems that can outperform conventional supercomputers. We defined  synthetic biology as the intersection of biology and engineering that  focuses on the modification or creation of novel biological systems for  useful purposes.", "To describe federal agencies\u2019 and nonfederal entities\u2019 support for  research that could lead to transformational technological advances in  quantum computing or synthetic biology, we focused on federal and  nonfederal efforts in fiscal year 2016 through the second quarter of fiscal  year 2018. We reviewed agency documentation, relevant literature, and  our prior work related to federal research efforts. We also interviewed  officials from federal agencies that support quantum computing or  synthetic biology research, as well as subject matter experts in the areas  of quantum computing, synthetic biology, or federal research more  broadly from industry, academia, nonprofit organizations, and  professional associations. We included 10 agencies in our review:  Department of Commerce, Department of Defense (DOD), Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), DOE, Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NSF, Office of the  Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA). We did not seek to develop comprehensive  information on federal agencies\u2019 and nonfederal entities\u2019 efforts to support  research in quantum computing and synthetic biology. As a result, federal  agencies and nonfederal entities could have efforts in these two areas  that we do not discuss in our report.", "To examine federal agencies\u2019 coordination on quantum computing and  synthetic biology research, we identified coordination efforts that took  place in fiscal year 2016 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018  during our review of agency documentation and interviews with federal  officials, including OSTP officials. We then compared these efforts with  selected leading practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration.  We selected six of the eight leading practices based on their relevance to  the operations of the interagency coordination efforts we identified. In  this report, and in our past work, we define collaboration as any joint  activity that is intended to produce more public value than could be  produced when organizations act alone.", "To provide experts\u2019 views on considerations for maintaining U.S.  competitiveness through transformational technological advances, we  convened a meeting of 19 experts in October 2017, with the assistance of  the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The  experts included current and former federal officials and subject matter  experts from industry, academia, nonprofit organizations, and  professional associations. About half of the experts were subject matter  experts in quantum computing or synthetic biology, while the other half  were experts with broader perspectives on the role of federal and  nonfederal entities in supporting research for transformational  technological advances.

Innovation, and  the research driving it, is inherently risky because the likelihood that  research can be translated into a product or service and the ultimate  value of that product or service are unknown. Because of this risk and the  long time frames sometimes associated with technology development,  there can be a gap in funding and investment support that makes it  challenging to translate research into commercialized products or  services. While government and universities often support early-stage  research and industry tends to support later stages of development, there  may be a gap during the middle stages of innovation during which  innovators may have difficulty finding financial support, as illustrated in  figure 1 (see app. III for a printable version).", "The linear, or pipeline, model of innovation presents innovation as a  succession of outputs that transfer to the next level as inputs. The starting  point in the pipeline model is basic research. Knowledge created through  basic research transitions to the next stage of applied research then to  development and, finally, commercialization. Under this model, innovation  takes place in distinct and sequential phases.", "Critics of the pipeline model have noted that innovation is actually cyclical  because the development of knowledge involves feedback and interaction  at these different stages of the cycle. Alternative innovation models  include the following:", "Extended pipeline model. Under this model certain research and development organizations support the entire technology development process, from basic research to initial commercialization. Unlike the pipeline model, in which the government\u2019s support is disconnected from the rest of the innovation ecosystem, under the extended pipeline model the government\u2019s role is deeply connected to the rest of the system. Under this model, federal entities such as DOD support the evolution of technologies, including electronics, computing, and the internet, across all stages of innovation.", "Induced innovation model. Innovation that follows this model is more industry-led because the parties involved have a market niche that the research needs to meet. Research under this model is more likely to lead to incremental advances because it is conducted in response to market demand.", "Manufacturing-led model. Under this model, innovation is pursued with the main objective of manufacturing. This model describes innovations in production technologies, processes, and products that emerge from the manufacturing process. The production process is supplemented by applied research and development. It is typically industry-led but may have strong government support, particularly in countries such as Germany, Japan and China whose economies are organized around this model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Role in Supporting Research", "paragraphs": ["While the different innovation models receive various levels of federal  support, examining the organization of federal agencies in support of  innovation is complex because of the decentralized nature of the federal  research system. More than 25 federal agencies support intramural or  extramural research, and these agencies may play different roles in  supporting research that may lead to potentially transformational  technologies. For example, NSF supports basic research that is in  keeping with its mission of promoting the progress of science; advancing  the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and securing the national  defense. DOD supports research in line with its mission to provide the  military forces needed to deter war and to protect the United States\u2019  security, while DOE supports research in line with its mission to ensure  America\u2019s security and prosperity by addressing its energy,  environmental, and nuclear challenges. Commerce\u2019s National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) supports research in measurement  science, standards, and technology, in keeping with its mission to  promote innovation and industrial competitiveness. Other agencies\u2014such  as EPA, and HHS\u2019s Food and Drug Administration\u2014support research in  their capacity as regulatory agencies.", "Federal support for research is not only decentralized but also changes  over time. Factors such as international conflict, budgetary pressures,  and globalization may contribute to shifts in U.S. science and technology  policy. In times of war, federal support for research has increased in  part because of the view that America\u2019s military survival might depend on  science and technology leadership. Budgetary pressures also affect the  federal role in research when such pressures lead to reductions in federal  funding for research. Globalization and the associated integration of the  world economy may also affect federal science and technology policy.  While the United States invests far more resources in research and  development than any other country, its rank in research and  development intensity has slowly fallen in recent years.", "Researchers have said that, in addition to globalization, domestic  changes\u2014such as the structure of U.S. companies\u2014present new  challenges to commercializing new products and services. For example,  in the last few decades, the amount of research produced by industrial  laboratories has declined. Further, U.S. companies, particularly small and  midsized firms, devote fewer resources to train employees compared to  firms from the 1980s. In recognition of the need for a more skilled  workforce to enhance U.S. competitiveness, the federal government has  increasingly shifted attention to preparing students for careers in STEM  fields.", "The federal role also changes in response to differing policy views. One  policy perspective maintains that the federal role should be to support  innovation across the economy. This policy approach has underpinned  innovation and economic growth since at least the end of World War II.  As we reported previously, another perspective is that the federal role  should be to support individual sectors. Critics of the latter perspective  argue that the government should not \u201cpick winners and losers\u201d in  commercial contexts because it is unlikely that the government will have  sufficient information or foresight about an individual firm\u2019s or a particular  technology\u2019s growth potential to select it for special subsidy. This view  advocates allocating resources through market mechanisms because  such mechanisms are anticipated to result in U.S. investments that are  most efficient and best suited to the comparative advantages of the  United States. However, the federal government has supported  individual sectors from research and development through  implementation, most often because of the government\u2019s own needs in  areas deemed important for national security (e.g., aerospace and  defense). In addition, findings of economic market failures have justified  other interventions, such as for research, development, and  demonstrations in various sectors, including agriculture and energy, and  recently, advanced production technologies.", "The federal government has partnered with nonfederal entities to  translate research into commercialized products to foster economic  growth. For example, DOD, through programs such as the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), has partnered with  nonfederal entities to support both early-stage research and later-stage  production. Some of these partnerships have led to development of  transformational technologies. For example, in the 1970s DOD supported  development of a communications network to facilitate information  sharing, which is considered the foundation of the modern internet.", "DOD also funded research in the 1950s on speech recognition and  artificial intelligence that commercial companies leveraged in the 1990s  and 2000s to develop technologies such as the Speech Interpretation and  Recognition Interface, the iPhone assistant. NIST research, such as its  critical technical evaluations of speech recognition technologies dating  back to the 1980s, also contributed to the development of Speech  Interpretation and Recognition Interface, according to NIST officials.  Alongside DOE, HHS and NSF, DOD has funded research that led to  technologies used to make the first iPod and later the iPhone (see fig.  2).

These bits may be created using, for  example, specific voltage or current levels in a circuit, and there is a limit  as to how quickly transistors in classical computers can manipulate these  bits to conduct calculations or how many circuit components can be  included on a computer chip. While classical computers rely on bits,  quantum computers rely on quantum bits (\u201cqubits\u201d). Unlike bits, qubits  can be in combinations of both a 1 and a 0 at the same time due to  quantum superposition. Phenomena such as quantum superposition and  quantum entanglement (the ability of two particles to have correlated  information, even at a distance) make quantum computers more powerful  than even today\u2019s most advanced classical supercomputers for solving  some complex problems. This ability to exist in combinations of both  states simultaneously allows for the efficient implementation of certain  algorithms, resulting in the ability to solve certain types of problems  significantly faster than classical computers.", "To date, a universal quantum computer is not commercially available.  As of 2017, quantum computers contain at most 50 qubits and can  perform some small calculations more slowly than classical computers.  Among the challenges to building a quantum computer are developing  software and hardware. Quantum hardware allows the computer to  manipulate qubits by completely isolating quantum processors from  outside forces. Quantum computing hardware is at the laboratory  prototype stage and is progressing steadily, according to a 2016 federal  report. Hardware development efforts include the creation of logical  qubits, which use error correction techniques to actively mitigate errors,  thus stabilizing the quantum state of the qubit even in the presence of  external factors (i.e., noise). Quantum information is extremely fragile and  requires special techniques and equipment, such as extreme  refrigeration, to maintain the qubit. Other challenges include creating  qubits of high quality, packaging them together in a scalable form so they  can perform complex calculations in a controllable way, and limiting the  errors that can result from heat and electromagnetic radiation. Addressing  these challenges may require developing new materials. Stakeholders  still consider developing a universal quantum computer a long-term goal.  When available, these computers could provide new computational  methods and powerful new tools for researchers.

Experts described the National Nanotechnology Initiative as a key example of a federal government strategic effort. The National Nanotechnology Initiative began in 2000 and is an interagency effort to bring together the nanotechnology-related activities of 28 federal agencies in an effort to enhance understanding and control of nanoscale material. The National Nanotechnology Initiative maintains a strategic plan describing the initiative\u2019s vision and goals and the strategies to achieve these goals.

Roadmaps, according to experts, represent detailed plans to guide  progress toward a technology goal. Federal agencies, industry, or  others may lead roadmapping efforts, according to experts.  Additionally, one expert stated that roadmaps can help accelerate  technology development. Another expert noted that for some fields,  such as quantum computing and synthetic biology, a technology  development strategy is needed in addition to a research and  development strategy because the former outlines how a technology  would move forward beyond the research and development phase.", "Across both of these aspects of a strategic approach, experts  emphasized the importance of a sustained commitment of resources to  support technology development. One expert also emphasized the  importance of setting tough performance objectives without specifying  how innovators will solve a problem. Experts acknowledged that  developing shared national strategies is challenging in the United States,  in part because of the decentralized nature of research support across  multiple federal agencies. However, experts also cited as strengths of  the federal research system the ability of federal agencies to support  multiple approaches to developing transformational technologies in  accordance with their missions and the ability to evolve and try new  approaches.", "Experts identified several indicators of when developing a strategic  approach might be important to support U.S. competitiveness through  transformational technological advances in a particular area. Specifically:", "Convergence of advances across different technology areas.", "Experts described how transformational technologies often occur as a result of different technologies that have advanced incrementally over time. One expert noted the development of the Global Positioning System as an example of a technology that required the convergence of advances in computing power, satellite technology, geospatial imaging, and timekeeping. Because of the strength and role of the federal government in convening and fostering engagement among non-traditional collaborators on interdisciplinary issues, experts identified technology convergence as a potential indicator of the need to take a strategic approach.", "Progress from discovery to real-world application. Experts described how progress from discovery in an area of science to the appearance of niche applications for a technology can be an indicator of the need to take a strategic approach. According to one expert, one challenge in technology development is how to push the technology forward as quickly as possible to develop it into something useful. Experts explained that by taking a strategic approach that extends beyond early-stage research, the federal government can support the development of potentially transformational technologies.", "Existence of barriers to technology development. Experts identified several barriers to the development of transformational technologies that could indicate the need to take a strategic approach to developing a technology. Examples of barriers experts identified included high capital costs for research, prototyping, demonstration, or other aspects of a technology development life cycle; regulatory barriers; lack of consensus on standards; and technology measurement challenges, such as limitations in the availability of tools with which to measure products or processes. Experts described multiple ways in which the federal government can play an important  role in addressing such barriers through helping efforts to de-risk  technologies, establishing or revising regulations, supporting  standards development, and developing measurement tools.", "Increasing involvement across multiple stakeholders or competitors. Experts described aspects of how increasing involvement across multiple stakeholders in a particular technology area can indicate the need to take a strategic approach to developing a transformational technology. For example, when multiple federal agencies are working in a technology area or industrial participants increase involvement in a particular technology, experts said such involvement could signal that a strategic approach is needed to work across boundaries and engage the research community in a coordinated way. Similarly, according to one expert, increasing international competition in a technology area could serve as an indicator of the need for the federal government to exercise leadership through a strategic approach to organize domestic public and private efforts in order for the United States to remain competitive.", "Need for sustained, long-term investment in areas of national interest. Experts identified the need for sustained, long-term investment in areas of national interest as a potential indicator of the need for a strategic approach to transformational technologies. Experts described how the short-term cycles of many federal programs and disincentives for the private sector to sustain long-term investments can present challenges to developing transformational technologies, which one expert noted can take years or even decades to develop. Experts also cited a need for a strategic approach to advancing a technology when it has the potential to be transformational and presents enormous societal benefits.", "In the areas of quantum computing and synthetic biology, experts cited a  need to develop a strategic approach to maintain U.S. competitiveness.  Within the area of quantum computing, experts cited all of the indicators  identified above in stating that U.S. competiveness in quantum computing  could benefit from a national strategy. For example, experts described the  need to foster interdisciplinary engagement across the fields of physics,  engineering, and computer science to support convergence of advances  in these areas to further quantum computing technology. Experts also  indicated that real-world applications are beginning to become apparent  in the area of quantum computing. However, they noted that significant  barriers to development exist and discussed a need for sustained long- term investment in this area, which has significant implications for  national security, and according to one expert, economic  competitiveness. Moreover, experts expressed concern over the  significant and increasing international competition from China, the  European Union, and other countries. One expert noted that given the  security implications of quantum computing technology, the United States  needs to find a way to counter the significant investment that China is  making. Stakeholders and one agency official we interviewed cited similar  concerns, such as the European Union\u2019s plans to launch a flagship  initiative on quantum technology, which includes quantum computing;  therefore, the United States needs a national quantum computing  strategy, the experts said.", "Similarly, with regard to synthetic biology, experts cited several of the  indicators described above in stating that the United States could benefit  from a strategic approach to maintain competitiveness. For example,  experts discussed barriers to technology development, including a lack of  measurement tools and regulatory barriers. According to one expert,  before the 2017 update to the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation  of Biotechnology, the system was last updated in 1992. The expert said  that it was not yet clear if the updated framework would help advance  synthetic biology research. Experts also noted the need to engage across  multiple stakeholders in this area; in particular, one expert noted the need  for leadership to advance a dialogue about how synthetic biology could  help address issues of national concern. Experts described significant  foreign competition in synthetic biology. One expert said that there are  more than 40 countries that have a unified strategy for synthetic  biology. While one expert stated that NSF has initiated a synthetic  biology roadmapping effort, a few experts stated that the United States  does not have a similar unified synthetic biology strategy. One expert  said that in the absence of such a strategy, the United States faces  economic and physical security risks.

For  example, according to one expert, in 2015, 2 years after the BRAIN  initiative was launched, the White House convened a meeting that  brought together industry partners, academic researchers, and  government scientists to share information and discuss research plans.  This expert highlighted the importance of communication among  representatives of organizations that would not normally work together,  and how these conversations about where they saw research going over  the next 5 years led to greater understanding and collaboration to support  the research under this initiative.", "Experts identified three key reasons for sharing information to facilitate  transformational technological advances in supporting U.S.  competitiveness:", "Convergence of different disciplines. Experts generally agreed that information sharing can facilitate an interdisciplinary approach to study a problem, which they said is important to the nation\u2019s ability to conduct research for transformational technological advances. The federal government\u2019s ability to convene groups, according to one expert, is particularly important for interdisciplinary areas of study because it can help bring stakeholders together to discuss how research could help address an area of national need. Another expert explained that agencies\u2019 research is increasingly interdisciplinary, which increases the importance of coordinating across agencies.Agency officials and stakeholders we interviewed also discussed the importance of sharing information across fields of study. One stakeholder said that without government funding for interdisciplinary efforts in quantum computing, it will be challenging to solve problems, such as creating some of the computer programming needed to operate a quantum computer, that need to be solved in order to make quantum computing viable.", "Overcoming barriers to innovation. Experts discussed how information sharing can facilitate the identification of barriers to innovation and help overcome them. For example, one expert noted the importance of information sharing in trying to address the challenges the U.S. semiconductor industry faced in the 1980s. The expert emphasized the recognition that individual companies could not address the barriers to innovation on their own and that they needed information sharing, such as cross-licensing of intellectual property and communication about roadmapping to overcome barriers that they faced. Another expert explained that information sharing across federal agencies led to the identification of the U.S.  biotechnology regulatory system as a significant barrier to innovation  and that, based on this, the Coordinated Framework for the  Regulation of Biotechnology was updated. This expert further said  that information sharing is the first step in coordination\u2014by sharing  information, agencies can determine where there might be  overlapping research efforts or gaps in ongoing research.", "Leveraging international research. Experts explained that bringing technologies to the United States that were developed elsewhere is not something that has been central to U.S. science and technology policy, but they stressed that the United States needs to consider how to take advantage of research that other countries are conducting and effectively utilize that information to maintain U.S. competitiveness. For example, one expert described the importance of the iGEM competition as an opportunity for information exchange among researchers from around the world who are working in synthetic biology-related fields. In describing this example, the expert noted that most bioengineers will not be U.S.-based and that, to remain competitive in synthetic biology, the United States needs to better understand discoveries being made by researchers from around the world.", "Experts said that while information sharing is important, there are  tradeoffs, particularly with regard to sharing and protecting pre- competitive intellectual property. The experts said that the benefits of  sharing pre-competitive intellectual property include the opportunity to  speed innovation by allowing multiple researchers to work with the  intellectual property concurrently and by preventing foreign competitors  from restricting use of the intellectual property through obtaining a patent.  Economically valuable knowledge can spread through publicly and freely  available records such as scientific publications and open source  software. Such knowledge can be used repeatedly, can quickly spread to  users outside the institutions where it was created, and can lead to the  creation of new products. For example, one expert stated that, as of   October 2017, a quantum computer we described earlier in this report  had been available over the Internet for public use for about a year and  had 50,000 users. Having a larger number of users working with this  resource could lead to more rapid discovery of ways in which a quantum  computer might be used than if it had not been shared. The expert said  that because this technology exists, it should be developed as quickly as  possible to determine what its first useful application will be and to find  the first problem that only a quantum computer can solve. Doing so, the  expert said, would create opportunities in which a U.S. company could  profit from the technology while also developing it. In addition, information  sharing was cited as instrumental to the success of the Human Genome  Project, according to NIH officials we interviewed, because the project  made the genome\u2019s sequencing available as a resource for researchers  to use.", "A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand around  the outline of a person.  The Human Genome Project, which formally  began in 1990, was a 13-year international  collaborative research project coordinated by  the Department of Energy and the National  Institutes of Health. The Human Genome  Project\u2019s goals were to (1) identify all the  genes in human DNA, (2) determine the  chemical base pair sequences of human  DNA, (3) store this information in databases,  (4) improve data analysis tools, (5) conduct technology transfer, and (6) address the ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise from the project. The full sequence of the human genome was completed and published in April 2003. Through its policy of open data release, the  Human Genome Project facilitated the  research of others. The Human Genome  Project also anticipated and promoted  commercializing genomic resources and  applications by establishing an infrastructure  and supporting private-sector technology  development. Consequently, the project led  to new tools to support biological research.  Further, the data and technologies generated  by the project and related research present a  broad array of commercial opportunities  across many areas of the economy. These  include more individualized diagnostics,  prognostics, drugs, and other therapies as  well as hardier, more nutritious, and healthier  crops and animals, among other applications.", "At the same time, experts said that while information sharing is important,  there are risks, such as foreign commercialization of U.S. intellectual  property. Experts noted that the world is increasingly competing with the  United States in research for transformational technological advances.  One expert cautioned that while information sharing is important for  transformational technologies, it must be done carefully so that other  companies do not exploit a technology or it is not leaked to a foreign  competitor. Similarly, one stakeholder said that while information sharing  is beneficial at the early stages of technology development, a balanced  approach to information sharing\u2014an approach that allows for trade  secrets and that guards some research results\u2014is needed once a  technology is no longer in the early stages of development.", "In light of these tradeoffs, experts emphasized the importance of ensuring  that intellectual property protections support U.S. competitiveness;  however, they also described challenges with how intellectual property is  managed in the United States. For example, experts said it can be  challenging to bring industry and academic researchers into partnerships  that support transformational technological advances. Experts explained  that some collaborators are willing to openly share their intellectual  property, while other experts noted that some collaborators may be less  inclined to do so because they view intellectual property as a profitable  commodity. Additionally, one expert cited differences between potential  industry and academic collaborators\u2019 knowledge of, and attention paid to,  developing technologies into commercial products as a potential barrier.  One expert said that foreign countries generally allow university- developed intellectual property to be owned and licensed by the inventors  or third-party companies (instead of the university). This can create a  foundation for a startup company or make it easier to get the interest of  companies who would like to acquire a university-based technology or  process. The expert noted that in one circumstance, this has given an  advantage to a foreign university in recruiting top researchers, helping it  to become a leader in quantum computing. However, another expert  stated that most major research universities have moved to a model of  developing partnerships with firms, especially startups, which has minimal  upfront licensing costs, and shared gains over time if the project is  successful\u2014according to that expert, such universities typically share  research intellectual property rights with faculty inventors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Focusing on Technology Development and Commercialization", "paragraphs": ["Focusing on technology development and commercialization is another  policy consideration that experts identified for maintaining U.S.  competitiveness through transformational technological advances.

However, while experts said  federal agencies\u2019 ability to support new discoveries is a strength, they  explained that the United States is losing the ability to commercialize  technologies that are invented here. For example, according to one  expert, while the technology might soon be available to build small (100  qubit) quantum computers, the United States does not have the  necessary enterprise in place to manufacture those systems. Experts  stated that it may take decades or more from the time research is funded  until it is commercialized. During this intervening period, significant  investment is needed to support the innovation cycle in terms of research  in the design, building, and testing of new product prototypes and  production processes.", "Experts described an increasing reliance, over time, on venture capital  funding to support investments in the innovation cycle. They said that  while this is generally working well in some areas such as software and  biotechnology, venture capital investors have become less willing to  support other technologies that require higher levels of capital investment,  longer-term returns, and greater risk. For example, one expert stated that  while the U.S. venture capital system spends $70 billion annually on  technology commercialization activities, in 2015, the expert estimated that  5 percent of venture capital funding went to hard technologies. Multiple  reports in recent years have documented the challenges associated with  how the innovation cycle is supported in the United States and its  implications for the domestic commercialization and production of new  technologies. For example, in a 2012 report, the National Research  Council stated that discoveries and inventions originating from research  conducted at U.S. universities, corporations, and national laboratories no  longer naturally led to products that are commercialized and  manufactured within the United States. According to this report,  manufacturing is important in developing new products because in many  high-technology industries, design cannot easily be separated from  manufacturing, and a lack of sustained investment in research and  infrastructure threatens to damage the U.S. innovation ecosystem,  economy, and security.", "To address this issue, experts discussed a need to provide longer-term  federal financial assistance to better support technology development  across multiple stages of innovation. Experts stated that federal agencies  often support research on short-term funding cycles (e.g., 3 years or less)  that may not be conducive to the long-term support sometimes needed to  effectively de-risk potentially transformational technologies. A 2017  National Academies report cited short-term funding as one factor that has  resulted in U.S. science losing its flexibility and nimbleness, elements that  feed new discovery. Additionally, experts said that federal agencies\u2019  support may not extend to the later stages of technology development but  providing longer-term support for research is an important part of the  federal government\u2019s role in advancing transformational technologies. For  example, one expert said that long-term federal support facilitates  creating a research infrastructure that can support a technology\u2019s  development.", "Experts cited several examples of how federal agencies\u2019 programs  provide different models for supporting technology development across  multiple stages of innovation.", "Advanced Technology Program.

One expert described the Manufacturing USA institutes as an important federal effort to support emerging technologies across multiple stages of innovation. Another expert explained that in order to continue to capture the economic benefits of the innovation system, the United States needs to embed the knowledge for technology production locally within the country.

Experts identified the systems engineering training  needed to build a quantum computer as one such area of interdisciplinary  training. For example, one expert said engineers are usually unfamiliar  with the quantum mechanics used in a quantum computer and this is  challenging since knowledge of both disciplines\u2014quantum mechanics  and engineering\u2014is necessary to develop the technology. Also, not many  quantum computing researchers are trained in the fields of computer  science or engineering, according to stakeholders and agency officials we  interviewed. A few experts said that because universities are not training  the researchers needed in some interdisciplinary areas, there are not  enough researchers in those areas available for industry to hire.", "Experts, other stakeholders and agency officials we interviewed, as well  as some recent reports, identified several factors that may contribute to a  disconnect between academic training and industry needs. For example,  experts explained that universities appear to operate on the assumption  that industry, not universities, must teach students the practical skills  needed to be productive members of an engineering team.  Additionally, according to a 2012 report by the National Research  Council, job markets and careers for doctoral scientists and engineers  have shifted since 1990 so that more than 50 percent of new doctorates  work outside of academia, but there are few incentives to motivate  graduate programs to align doctoral education with evolving employment  activities. According to one expert, graduate education is largely  supported by federally funded research awards to universities which tend  to support basic research, not applied research or development. This  expert further stated that as a result, graduate students are not taught  later stage applied work relevant to industry because that has not been  what federal research has historically funded. According to a different  2012 National Research Council report, cultural barriers often separate  industry from academia and are reinforced by organizational incentives\u2014 universities have traditionally emphasized the need to publish research,  not commercialize it. Further, one expert, a stakeholder, and an agency  official we interviewed said that universities generally were not hiring  faculty who focus on quantum computing as part of their computer  science and engineering departments. The expert attributed this to limited  funding available to support those research programs. According to this  expert, the financial assistance federal research programs provide can  send an important signal to universities that can lead to evolving  academic programs and hiring in interdisciplinary fields. A 2016 MIT  report made similar observations and said that many universities remain  siloed along departmental lines and need resources and structures that  allow for team teaching\u2014two people from different research areas co- teaching a course\u2014or research in which students from different  disciplines could be paired to answer a research question. However, in  synthetic biology, one expert noted that some universities have started  entirely new Departments of Bioengineering because aspects of synthetic  biology contribute to the development of an independent, distinctive, and  complementary type of engineering.

Countries such as Canada,  China, and Singapore are attracting talented researchers to their  universities and research institutes by offering high salaries and the  opportunity to run well-funded programs, according to a National  Research Council report. For example, according to a few experts,  China started the Thousand Talents Program in 2008 to get talented  researchers to return to China. The Thousand Talents Program\u2019s goal  is to bring top talent trained overseas to China on a full- or part-time  basis. One expert gave the example of a university president resigning  from a U.S. university because he believed the possibilities for research  were greater in Asia. According to one expert, the nation\u2019s ability to recruit  and retain researchers may be at risk because the United States is not  working to retain and incentivize talent. According to that expert, this puts  the nation at risk of missing out on the next global transformational  technological advance.", "According to some experts, one challenge to retaining talent in the United  States is that limited job opportunities are available to young researchers  trained in certain areas. It is important to create conditions for young  researchers to find employment in research and development, according  to one expert, so that they can contribute to these areas. Creating the  right incentive structure for people to produce transformational  technologies in the United States is important, according to another  expert, because when technologies are produced in the United States,  the skills needed to produce them become embedded in that community.  We have previously reported that too much location of skilled  manufacturing jobs abroad can, in general, put the United States at a  disadvantage in terms of its ability to design new products, according to  participants in a 2013 forum on nanomanufacturing. Similarly, in a 2012  report, the National Research Council stated that manufacturing is  integral to new product development, and production lines are linked to  an iterative innovation chain that includes research and development,  product refinement, and full-scale production. In many high-technology  industries, design cannot be easily separated from manufacturing, and  talent availability is the most important factor for deciding where to place  a production facility. In some cases, according to this 2012 report,  companies are choosing to produce abroad because of concerns related  to the capacity of the U. S. supply chain, technical skills of U.S. workers,  and the investment climate for high-volume manufacturing. Also  according to this report, as a result of these factors, the United States is  finding it increasingly difficult to capture the economic value generated by  public and private investments in research and development."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal support for research in areas such as quantum computing and  synthetic biology can help promote U.S. competitiveness in the global  economy. For example, advances in quantum computing have the  potential to lead to transformational advances in national security  technologies or technology areas that rely heavily on simulation, such as  pharmaceuticals and materials science for advanced manufacturing.  Research in synthetic biology could help achieve significant advances in  health care, energy, and other sectors. When agencies collaborate on  their research efforts, they can produce more public value than when they  act alone. Moreover, collaboration through mechanisms such as  interagency groups can help address complex issues, such as those  remaining to be resolved in quantum computing and synthetic biology.  Collaboration can also mitigate challenges associated with fragmentation  of efforts across multiple agencies, as well as potential overlap and  duplication.", "NSTC and federal agencies have taken steps, building on earlier efforts,  to coordinate their activities in the areas of quantum computing and  synthetic biology. Specifically, both the new QIS Subcommittee and the  new synthetic biology working group have taken initial steps to implement  certain leading practices that can enhance and sustain collaborative  efforts. For example, both have taken steps toward agreeing on roles and  responsibilities. These steps could help address problems identified in  previous interagency coordination efforts. However, both the  subcommittee and working group are recently established and have had  limited time to fully implement the leading practices that we describe in  this report.
