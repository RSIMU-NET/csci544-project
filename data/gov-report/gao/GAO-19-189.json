The purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope's mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. NASA found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in April 2018. The new cost estimate of $9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor's workforce on board longer than expected.", "Before the project enters its final phase of integration and test, it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments. As part of this review, the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis\u2014an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments\u2014but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so. Such analysis would provide NASA officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources, especially in light of the project's recent cost and schedule growth.", "NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, and identified the JWST project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes. Examples of recent changes include increasing on-site presence at the contractor facility and conducting comprehensive audits of design processes.

To determine the considerations that NASA took into account when  updating the JWST project\u2019s cost and schedule commitments, we  analyzed the JWST project\u2019s proposed changes to its 2011 rebaseline.  We compared the project\u2019s prior cost and schedule baseline to the  project\u2019s new cost and schedule estimates to determine what changes  were made, including changes to workforce projections. In addition, we  compared the process the project used to update cost and schedule  estimates with NASA guidance and policies on updating cost and  schedule estimates and best practices identified in GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide. We discussed the project\u2019s cost and  schedule estimates from the 2018 replan with NASA, Northrop Grumman  Aerospace Systems (Northrop Grumman), and the James Webb Space  Telescope Independent Review Board (IRB) and interviewed officials  within the Office of the Chief Financial Officer on relevant NASA  guidance.", "To assess the extent to which technical challenges and integration risks  are affecting the execution of the JWST project, we reviewed project and  contractor schedule documentation to identify the progress made and any  challenges faced since our last report in February 2018. We examined  monthly project status reports to management to monitor schedule  reserve levels and usage, identify potential risks and technical challenges  that may affect the project\u2019s schedule, and gain insights on the project\u2019s  progress. We interviewed project officials at Goddard Space Flight Center  and contractor officials from Northrop Grumman and the Association of  Universities for Research in Astronomy\u2019s Space Telescope Science  Institute concerning the challenges that have affected schedule, and the  project\u2019s and contractor\u2019s plans to address these challenges. We also  discussed what benefits exist, if any, of conducting cost and schedule risk  analyses during integration and test with government and industry cost  and schedule experts. Further, we attended two project reviews, where  project and program officials briefed NASA headquarters officials on the  current status of the project. We examined project risks from monthly risk  registers to understand the likelihood of occurrence, the potential effect  on cost and schedule, and the steps the project plans to take to mitigate  the risks. We also requested updates on the status of project risks and  top issues that affected technical challenges the project was working to  mitigate during the course of our review. We also obtained information on  the status of project software and challenges from independent NASA  reviewers with NASA\u2019s Independent Verification and Validation program.", "Finally, to assess the extent to which NASA has taken steps to improve  oversight and performance of the JWST project, we reviewed  documentation on changes that NASA made to contractor oversight and  project oversight activities between April and November 2018. We also  reviewed the May 2018 IRB final report. We discussed these changes  and the implementation of related IRB recommendations with Goddard  Space Flight Center and NASA headquarters project officials; Northrop  Grumman and Space Telescope Science Institute contractor officials; IRB  members; and Defense Contract Management Agency officials who are  responsible for providing oversight of software and quality assurance  processes at the Northrop Grumman facility on behalf of NASA. In  addition, we reviewed project and Northrop Grumman documentation that  described or tracked changes to oversight and implementation of IRB  recommendations.

These  award fee periods are inclusive of the time period in which NASA first  started identifying that additional schedule slips would be likely. We  compared the findings and recommendations of a 2010 independent  review report to the 2018 independent review report to determine whether  there were similar findings or recommendations.

JWST is being designed for a 5-year mission to find  the first stars, study planets in other solar systems to search for the  building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe, and trace the evolution of  galaxies from their beginning to their current formation. JWST is intended  to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers\u2014or 1 million  miles\u2014from the Earth. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is  expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble  Space Telescope. JWST\u2019s science instruments are designed to observe  very faint infrared sources and therefore are required to operate at  extremely cold temperatures. To help keep these instruments cold, a  multi-layered tennis court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect  the mirrors and instruments from the sun\u2019s heat.", "The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory  segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. When complete,  the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical  Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM),  and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The  hardware configuration referred to as OTIS was created when the Optical  Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module were  integrated. Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy and  control various components of the telescope, and to collect and transmit  data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are  being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international  partner efforts. See figure 1 for the elements and major subsystems of  JWST and appendix 1 for more details, including a description of the  elements, major subsystems, and JWST\u2019s instruments.", "For the majority of work remaining, the JWST project is relying on two  contractors: Northrop Grumman and the Association of Universities for  Research in Astronomy\u2019s Space Telescope Science Institute. Northrop  Grumman plays the largest role, developing the sunshield, the Optical  Telescope Element, the spacecraft, and the Mid-Infrared Instrument\u2019s  cryocooler, in addition to integrating and testing the observatory. Space  Telescope Science Institute\u2019s role includes soliciting and evaluating  research proposals from the scientific community, and receiving and  storing the scientific data collected, both of which are services that it  currently provides for the Hubble Space Telescope. Additionally, the  Institute is developing the ground system that manages and controls the  telescope\u2019s observations and will operate the observatory on behalf of  NASA. JWST will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket, provided by the  European Space Agency.", "JWST depends on 22 deployment events\u2014more than a typical science  mission\u2014to prepare the observatory for normal operations on orbit. For  example, the sunshield and primary mirror are designed to fold and stow  for launch and deploy once in space. Due to its large size, it is nearly  impossible to perform deployment tests of the fully assembled  observatory, so the verification of deployment elements is accomplished  by a combination of lower level component tests in flight-simulated  environments; ambient deployment tests for assembly, element, and  observatory levels; and detailed analysis and simulations at various levels  of assembly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Schedule and Cost Reserves for NASA Projects", "paragraphs": ["We have previously found that complex development efforts like JWST  face numerous risks and unforeseen technical challenges, which can  often become apparent during integration and testing.

Each  JWST element and major subsystem has been allocated schedule  reserve. When an element or major subsystem exhausts schedule  reserve, it may begin to affect schedule reserve on other elements or  major subsystems whose progress is dependent on prior work being  finished for its activities to proceed.", "Cost reserves are additional funds within the project manager\u2019s budget  that can be used to address unanticipated issues for any element or  major subsystem, and are used to mitigate issues during the development  of a project. For example, cost reserves can be used to buy additional  materials to replace a component or, if a project needs to preserve  schedule reserve, reserves can be used to accelerate work by adding  shifts to expedite manufacturing. NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center\u2014 the NASA center with responsibility for managing JWST\u2014has issued  procedures that establish the requirements for cost and schedule  reserves. In addition to cost reserves held by the project manager,  management reserves are funds held by the contractors that allow them  to manage program risks and to address unanticipated cost increases  throughout development.

Award fee contracts provide contractors the  opportunity to obtain monetary incentives for performance in designated  areas identified in the award fee plan. Award fees may be used when key  elements of performance cannot be defined objectively, and, as such,  require the project officials\u2019 judgment to assess contractor performance.  For JWST\u2019s contract with Northrop Grumman, these areas include cost,  schedule, technical, and business management and are established in  the contracts\u2019 performance evaluation plans.", "In December 2013, the JWST program and the contractor agreed to  replace a $56 million on-orbit incentive\u2014incentives based on successful  performance in space\u2014with award fees. The award fees are to  incentivize cost and schedule performance during development. This  shift increased the available award fee for the entire contract to almost a  quarter of a billion dollars. According to officials, restructuring the  incentives gave NASA more flexibility to incentivize the contractor to  prioritize the cost and schedule performance over exceeding technical  requirements. In December 2014, we found that NASA award fee letters  of award fee periods from February 2013 to March 2014 indicated that the  contractor had been responsive to interim award fee period criteria  provided by NASA and that contractor officials confirmed that they pay  close attention to this guidance in prioritizing their work.

Before 2011, early technical and management challenges, contractor  performance issues, low levels of cost reserves, and poorly phased  funding caused the JWST program to delay work. As a result, the  program experienced schedule overruns, including launch delays, and  cost growth. The JWST program underwent a replan in September  2011, and a rebaseline in November of that same year, and Congress  placed an $8 billion cap on the formulation and development costs for the  project. On the basis of the replan, NASA rebaselined JWST with a life- cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion, which included additional money for  operations and a planned launch in October 2018.", "Congress also required that NASA treat any cost increase above the cap  according to procedures established for projects that exceed their  development cost estimates by at least 30 percent. This process is known  as a rebaseline. Congress must authorize continuation of the JWST  program if formulation and development costs increase over the $8 billion  cost cap.", "In June 2018, after a series of launch delay announcements due to  technical and workmanship issues identified during spacecraft element  integration, NASA notified Congress that it had again revised the JWST  program\u2019s cost and schedule estimates. NASA estimated that it now  required $828 million in additional resources and 29 more months to  complete beyond those estimates agreed to in the 2011 rebaseline. As of  November 2018, NASA had funding to continue to execute the program  and was waiting to see if Congress would authorize the program\u2019s  continuation and appropriate funds for the program in fiscal year 2019.  Figure 2 shows the project\u2019s history of changes to its cost or schedule  and key findings from two external independent review teams and our  prior work.", "As discussed above, various technical and workmanship errors drove  some of the more recent delays. Examples of some of the workmanship  issues we found in the past include:  In October 2015, the project reported that a piece of flight hardware  for the sunshield\u2019s mid-boom assembly was irreparably damaged  during vacuum sealing in preparation for shipping. The damaged  piece had to be remanufactured, which consumed 3 weeks of  schedule reserve.", "In April 2017, a contractor technician applied too much voltage and  irreparably damaged the spacecraft\u2019s pressure transducers,  components of the propulsion system that help monitor spacecraft fuel  levels. The transducers had to be replaced and reattached in a  complicated welding process. At the same time, Northrop Grumman  also addressed several challenges with integrating sunshield  hardware. These issues combined took up another 1.25 months of  schedule reserve.", "In May 2017, some of the valves in the spacecraft propulsion system\u2019s  thruster modules were leaking beyond permissible levels. Northrop  Grumman determined that the most likely cause was the use of an  improper cleaning solution, and the thruster modules were returned to  the vendor for investigation and refurbishment. Reattaching the  refurbished modules was expected to be complete by February 2018,  but was delayed by one month when a technician applied too much  voltage to one of the components in a recently refurbished thruster  module. NASA and Northrop Grumman reported that resolving the  thruster module issue resulted in a 2-month delay to the project\u2019s  overall schedule.", "In October 2017, when conducting folding and deployment exercises  on the sunshield, Northrop Grumman discovered several tears in the  sunshield membrane layers. According to program officials, a  workmanship error contributed to the tears. The tears resulted in  another 2-month delay to the project\u2019s overall schedule.", "In addition, some first-time efforts took longer than planned. For example,  in fall 2017, the project determined that it would need to use up to 3  months of schedule reserve based upon lessons learned from the  contractor\u2019s initial sunshield folding operation. This first deployment, or  unfolding, took 30 days longer than planned. The sunshield has since  undergone another deployment, and will be deployed twice more before  launch.", "The IRB took into account these technical and workmanship errors, as  well as other considerations, when it analyzed the project\u2019s organizational  and technical issues.

The membrane cover  assembly shown in figure 3 is used to cover the sunshield membrane  when in the stowed position to provide thermal protection during launch.", "After the anomaly occurred, the project halted spacecraft element testing,  investigated the anomaly, and found that the fasteners had come loose  due to a design change made to prevent the fasteners from damaging the  sunshield membrane. The design change caused the nuts to not lock  properly. According to project officials, due to the design of the membrane  cover assembly, the project was not able to conduct flight-like, stand- alone testing on the cover prior to spacecraft element testing. As a result,  the project did not discover the design issue until the hardware came  loose while installed on the spacecraft element. The project determined  that the repairs would take approximately 5.5 months.", "The project\u2019s replan also reflected schedule reserves above the level  required by Goddard Space Flight Center policy, which would have been  approximately 5 months at that time.

In reviewing the  project\u2019s schedule, the IRB found that the project had robust scheduling  practices for ensuring that the schedule represented a complete and  dynamic network of tasks that could respond automatically to changes.", "This schedule also passed a standard health check with minimal errors  indicating that it was well constructed. However, the IRB noted that this  schedule does not account for certain types of unknown risks to the  program such as integration and test errors which can take many months  to resolve, or the potential need to remove a science instrument from the  observatory, which can have about a 1 year impact. As a result, the  program could experience additional delays if a risk of this magnitude is  realized.", "Cost: The project\u2019s new $9.7 billion life-cycle cost estimate is principally  driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor\u2019s  workforce to complete integration and test longer than expected.  Specifically, the project determined that almost all of the hardware had  been delivered and the remaining cost was predominantly the cost for the  workforce necessary to complete and test the observatory.", "For the past 3 years, we have reported that Northrop Grumman\u2019s ability to  decrease its workforce was central to JWST\u2019s capacity to meet its long- term cost commitments. However, Northrop Grumman\u2019s actual  workforce continued to exceed its projections. This was because it  needed to maintain higher workforce levels due to technical challenges,  including problems with spacecraft and sunshield integration and test. It  also needed to keep specialized engineers available when needed during  final assembly and test activities.", "In developing the cost estimate supporting the 2018 replan, the project  used a Northrop Grumman workforce profile that is higher than previous  projections because Northrop Grumman now plans to maintain personnel  longer during integration and test. According to project officials, the  planned reduction of Northrop Grumman\u2019s workforce is now more gradual  and conservative than the prior plan. For example, the Northrop  Grumman workforce will not start to significantly decline until the  observatory ships to the launch site, which is expected to occur in August  2020. As shown in Figure 5, the JWST workforce assembling the  observatory declines and the government and contractor workforce  necessary to manage and operate the observatory remains after the  internal launch readiness date of November 2020.", "As seen in the above figure, the Space Telescope Science Institute  workforce, the contractor responsible for operating JWST, will remain  generally flat between fiscal years 2021 to 2026 when it operates the  observatory. The NASA civil service and support contractor will remain  relatively flat through November 2020 launch date and then decline.

The associate administrator did not require the project to conduct an  updated Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) analysis for this  replan. A JCL is an integrated analysis of a project\u2019s cost, schedule, risk,  and uncertainty whose result indicates the probability of a project\u2019s  success of meeting cost and schedule targets. NASA policy states that a  JCL should be recalculated and approved as a part of the rebaselining  approval process, but it is not required. In its replan decision memo,  NASA\u2019s associate administrator explained that he did not require the  project to update the JCL because project costs are almost entirely  related to the workforce and most of the remaining planned activities will  be performed generally in sequence. Therefore, according to NASA\u2019s  associate administrator, the total cost would be driven almost entirely by  the schedule because the workforce levels will remain the same through  delivery of the observatory.

Our prior work has shown that  integration and testing is the phase in which problems are most likely to  be found and schedules tend to slip.

As a result, it will continue to become more difficult  for the project to avoid schedule delays by mitigating issues in parallel.", "As of November 2018, the project is about a week behind its replanned  schedule because repairs on the membrane cover assembly took longer  than planned. Completing the membrane cover assembly repairs and  returning the spacecraft to vibration testing was a key event for the  project to demonstrate that it could execute to its new schedule. When  the project developed its 2018 replanned schedule, it had planned to  complete the membrane cover assembly repairs and reinstall the  assembly onto the sunshield and restart spacecraft element integration  and test activities by November 6, 2018. The project allocated 4 weeks of  schedule reserves specifically for these repairs. However, the membrane  cover repairs proved more difficult than anticipated. For example, the  program had to address unanticipated technical challenges on the  membrane cover assemblies, including repairing tears and pin holes in  the covers discovered after the covers were removed. The project also  had to allot time to install bumpers, which are kapton tubes, to the  assembly to protect the composite material on a sunshield structure  during launch. The project identified the need to add the bumpers during  subassembly vibration testing.", "As a result, as of November 2018, the project had used about 4.5 weeks  of schedule reserves to cover delays associated with these activities. The  use of reserves beyond what the project had planned for the repairs  pushed the restart of spacecraft element integration and test activities out  about a week to November 14, 2018. Figure 6 compares the project\u2019s  initial membrane cover assembly schedule in June 2018 to the actual  schedule in November 2018.", "While the project repaired the membrane cover assembly, it also used  this time to conduct risk mitigation activities on OTIS. For example, the  project worked to mitigate a design issue on the frill connections. The frill  is composed of a single layer of blankets placed around the outside of the  primary mirror used to block stray light (see figure 7).", "A combination of modeling and inspections revealed that most of the frill  sections did not have as much slack as expected at the near-absolute  zero cryogenic temperatures of space. This caused shrinkage that put  stress on the edges of the outer ring of mirrors, which could affect the  stability of the optical mirror and image quality. The project loosened  these outer connections by adding a ring to the connecting points. As of  November 2018, project officials said they were in the process of verifying  the fix through inspections.", "Examples of technical issues and risks that the project continues to face  during the remaining phases of integration and test include:", "The project is working to mitigate a design issue on the sunshield  membrane tensioning system\u2014which helps deploy the sunshield and  maintain its correct shape. In our February 2018 report, we found that  Northrop Grumman was planning to modify the design of the  membrane tensioning system after one of the sunshield\u2019s six  membrane tensioning systems experienced a snag when conducting  folding and deployment exercises on the sunshield in October 2017.  The project and Northrop Grumman determined that a design  modification was necessary to fully mitigate the issue, which includes  modifying clips used to progressively release the cable tension and  adding guards to control the excess cable.", "The project identified a concern that the depressurization of trapped  air in the folded sunshield membrane when the fairing separates to  release the JWST observatory may overly stress the membrane  material. The project is working with Arianespace\u2014the company  responsible for operating JWST\u2019s launch vehicle\u2014and experts at the  Kennedy Space Center to resolve this concern. Officials estimated  that a design solution would be in place in mid-2019. However, if the  project determines that it needs to reinforce the membrane covers to  survive excessive residual pressure as it works on this design  solution, a multi-month schedule delay could occur.", "As of November 2018, the project has mitigated 21 of its 47 hardware  and software risks to acceptable levels, and reviews these risks  monthly for any changes that might affect the continued acceptability  of the risk. Five of these 21 risks are related to the project\u2019s more  than 300 potential single point failures\u2014several of which are related  to the deployment of the sunshield. The project is actively working to  mitigate the remaining 26 risks to acceptable levels or closure prior to  launching.", "The project also has several first-time and challenging integration and test  activities remaining. For example, the project must integrate OTIS and the  completed spacecraft element and test the full observatory in the final  integration phase, which includes another set of challenging  environmental tests. See figure 8 for an image of OTIS and the spacecraft  element prior to being integrated.", "As previously discussed, the project also has two remaining deployments  of the sunshield, and prior deployments have taken longer than planned.  To help mitigate the risks associated with the deployments, the project  added additional time for deployments in the 2018 replanned schedule  based on lessons learned from prior deployments. The two remaining  deployments are to occur after spacecraft element integration and test  and again after observatory integration and test.", "The JWST project office is required to evaluate whether the project can  complete development within its revised cost and schedule commitments  at its next major review\u2014the system integration review\u2014planned for  August 2019. This review is to occur after the project has completed two  major tasks\u2014OTIS and spacecraft element integration and test. The  review is to evaluate whether the project (1) is ready to enter observatory  integration and test, and (2) can complete remaining project development  with acceptable risk and within its cost and schedule constraints. NASA  guidance does not require projects to conduct a JCL at this review.  However, project officials said that they plan to conduct another schedule  risk analysis in the future. They do not intend to complete a new JCL for  the same reasons they did not complete one for the 2018 replan\u2014 because costs are almost entirely related to the workforce and can be  derived from a schedule that takes into account known risk.", "While not required, conducting a JCL prior to the system integration  review would inform NASA about the probability of meeting both its cost  and schedule commitments. If the project proceeds with its plan to  conduct only a schedule risk analysis, NASA would be provided only with  an updated probability of meeting its schedule commitments. Our cost  estimating best practices recommend that cost estimates should be  updated to reflect changes to a program or kept current as it moves  through milestones and as new risks emerge. In addition, government  and industry cost and schedule experts we spoke with noted that  integration and testing is a critical time for a project when problems can  develop. These experts told us that completing a JCL is a best practice  for analyzing major risks at the most uncertain part of project execution.  Conducting a JCL at system integration review\u2014a review that occurs  during the riskiest phase of development, the integration and test phase\u2014 would allow the project to update its assumptions of risk and uncertainty  based on its experiences in OTIS and spacecraft element integration and  test. The project could then determine how those updated assumptions  affect overall cost and schedule for the JWST project.", "As noted above, the project has many risks to mitigate, technical  challenges to overcome, and challenging test events to complete, which  could affect the project\u2019s schedule and risk posture. Further, the project  has an established history of significant cost growth and schedule delays.  In its June 2018 letter notifying an appropriate congressional committee  of its updated cost and schedule commitments, NASA acknowledged that  recent cost growth for the project will likely impact other science missions.  Conducting a JCL at system integration review would provide NASA and  Congress with critical information for making informed resource decisions  on the JWST project and its affordability within NASA\u2019s portfolio of  projects more broadly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Is Augmenting Oversight of Contractor and Project Performance, and Identified the JWST Project Manager as Responsible for Sustaining Changes", "paragraphs": ["NASA has taken steps to augment oversight of the contractor and project  following the discovery of the embedded design flaws and workmanship  errors that contributed to the project\u2019s most recent schedule delays and  cost increases. See table 1 for examples of changes NASA has made to  contractor and project oversight\u2014some of which NASA self-identified and  others that were in response to IRB recommendations. The IRB made 31  recommendations that ranged from improving employee morale to  improving security during transporting JWST to its launch site.", "NASA has also used award fees to try to incentivize Northrop Grumman  to improve its performance. In a July 2018 hearing on the JWST program  before the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee,  Administrator Bridenstine stated that NASA had reduced the available  award fee through commissioning by $28 million out of a total of about  $60 million. Northrop Grumman also did not earn its full award fee in the  two most recent periods of performance that NASA assessed.", "For the performance period of April 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017,  Northrop Grumman earned approximately 56 percent of the available  award fee. Reasons that NASA cited for its evaluation of award fees  in this period included workmanship errors on the propulsion system,  schedule delays, as well as issues with schedule execution,  management, and quality control.", "For the period of October 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, Northrop  Grumman earned none of the available award fee. Northrop  Grumman\u2019s overall score was driven by an \u201cunacceptable\u201d rating in  schedule and cost due to delays and in anticipation of exceeding the  project\u2019s $8 billion cost cap. Northrop Grumman received an  \u201cexcellent\u201d rating under the technical category, but the evaluation  noted ongoing issues with quality controls, which resulted in delays.  For example, the process steps for applying voltage to the  spacecraft\u2019s pressure transducers were not clear enough, which  resulted in technician error and irreparable damage to the hardware.", "According to Northrop Grumman officials, the contractor has started to  take action to try to improve its quality assurance processes. Officials  described actions that ranged from rewriting hardware integration and test  procedures to starting efforts to change aspects of the company\u2019s culture  that contributed to quality control issues. For example, in July 2018,  Northrop Grumman initiated a JWST mission assurance culture change  campaign to increase focus on product quality and process compliance.  This effort includes having inspectors affirm by signature that they have  personally inspected, verified, and confirmed that all aspects of an activity  meet quality standards. According to the form instructions, if the inspector  is uncertain on compliance or if instructions are unclear, workers are to  halt work, investigate and assess the situation, and request help to  resolve the situation. Project and Northrop Grumman officials provided an  example of these changes working. During a manual deployment of a  radiator panel, a Northrop Grumman employee discovered that a flap  used as thermal protection for a radiator was installed incorrectly and  reported the error. Northrop Grumman technicians found that this flap had  been swapped with another flap in the process of moving them to be  installed and corrected the problem before work proceeded.", "Further, NASA and Northrop Grumman are conducting audits to try to  minimize the risk of failures during the remaining phases of integration  and test. These audits are conducted on items that have not been fully  tested, are in workmanship-sensitive areas, or have had a late design  change. The first phase of the audit was completed in September 2018  and found no major design issues or hardware rework required. The  project plans to audit other areas through at least spring 2019, but will  add audits if needed.", "The JWST oversight structure includes a number of positions that could  be responsible for ensuring that the recent augmentations to contractor  and project oversight are sustained through launch (see table 2).", "In response to our review, NASA officials clarified that the project  manager has sole responsibility for ensuring that these improvements are  sustained through launch. Further, these officials stated that the project  office is responsible for monitoring these changes at the project level and  at Northrop Grumman. The project manager\u2019s continued focus on these  efforts will be important because:", "The project is implementing a wide span of improvement efforts,  ranging from more on-site coverage at the contractor facility to cultural  improvements, which will now need to be sustained for an additional  29 months.", "The project has had recurring issues with effective internal and  external communication as well as defining key management and  oversight responsibilities, both of which are important to sustaining  oversight. For example, the Independent Comprehensive Review  Panel identified communication problems\u2014between the JWST project  and Science Mission Directorate management as well as between  NASA and Northrop Grumman\u2014and that the project\u2019s governance  structure lacked clear lines of authority and accountability. In  December 2012, we found the JWST project had taken several steps  to improve communication\u2014such as instituting meetings that include  various levels of NASA, contractor, and subcontractor management\u2014 but the IRB\u2019s findings in 2018 indicate that communication and  governance issues have resurfaced in some areas. For example,  the IRB found that communication with key stakeholders including the  science community, Congress, and NASA leadership, has been  variable and at times inconsistent.", "The project may encounter new schedule pressures as it proceeds  through integration and test. A senior NASA official with expertise in  workmanship issues told us that schedule pressure is a key reason for  increased quality problems on projects. For example, this official said  that companies tend to give experts leniency to operate without the  burden of quality assurance paperwork when schedule pressures  arise, which can lead to workmanship errors. While JWST project  officials told us they do not view this as applicable to their project, the  perspective regarding potential schedule pressures and workmanship  is important to keep focus on given the magnitude of technical  challenges and delays the project has faced.", "We will continue to monitor the project\u2019s efforts at maintaining these  oversight augmentations in future reviews, given that less than a year has  passed since the project began implementing many of them. Moreover,  the project may find that some actions will be required of officials outside  the project, particularly since the communication problems identified by  the IRB may well extend to headquarters\u2019 interaction with stakeholders  from the science community, industry, and the Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["JWST is one of NASA\u2019s most expensive and complex science projects,  and NASA has invested considerable time and resources on it.

However, the project did not complete a JCL analysis as  part of its second replan. Between now and its system integration review  planned for August 2019, the JWST program will have to continue to  address technical challenges and mitigate risks. Conducting a JCL would  better inform decision makers on the status of the project as they  determine whether the project can complete remaining project  development with acceptable risk and within its cost and schedule  constraints.
