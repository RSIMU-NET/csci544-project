All but 2 hotels responded.", "In accordance with other federal employment surveys and with our 2009  and 2010 questionnaires, our 2013 employer questionnaire asked for  wage data for the pay period containing June 12 of 2011, 2012, and  2013. The questionnaire asked separately for data regarding workers  paid an hourly wage and workers paid an annual salary. The  questionnaire also included detailed questions about employers\u2019 past and  possible future actions, and about the extent to which employers  attributed these actions to past and future minimum wage increases. (The  questionnaire is reproduced in app. V.)", "Before sending the 2009 questionnaire to employers in 2009, we  pretested it over the phone with three employers in the CNMI and two in  American Samoa to make sure that the questions were clear and  comprehensive, the data were readily obtainable, and the questionnaire  did not place an undue burden on employers. While we eliminated some  questions in our 2010 and 2013 questionnaires, revisions to remaining  questions were minor and did not require additional pretesting.", "We administered the questionnaire between September 2013 and  December 2013. Employers received the questionnaire by e-mail in an  attached form that they could return electronically after marking  checkboxes or entering responses in open-answer boxes. We conducted  nonresponse follow-up while in the CNMI. We also contacted  nonrespondents by e-mail and phone. In addition, we contacted  respondents to clarify responses and request any missing data.", "Because of the lack of data on the entire workforce, it is difficult to  precisely state the percentage of the workforce that our questionnaire  represents. In 2013, all three of the American Samoa employers that  received our questionnaire provided responses, resulting in a response  rate of 100 percent. Based on American Samoa tax data, our  respondents represented, in 2012, about 14 percent of the total  workforce. Based on CNMI tax data, our respondents represented, in  2012, about 7 percent of the total workforce.", "In reporting the percentages for questionnaire responses in the CNMI, we  weighted each percentage to reflect the proportion of workers employed  by the responding employers relative to all workers employed by all  questionnaire respondents. As a result, the responses of larger  employers affect our findings more than those of smaller employers. In  addition to asking a direct question about number of employees, the  questionnaire asked respondents to complete a separate table listing the  number of employees at each wage or salary level. Separate tables were  required for hourly wage and salaried workers. To apply the weights, we  multiplied the number of employees by the employer response, then  divided that number by the total number of employees in the sample. For  example, if three of five employers attributed an action to the minimum  wage to a moderate extent, the unweighted response would be 60  percent. However, if those three employers represented 300 of 400  employees, the weighted response that we report would be 75 percent.  Among CNMI employer responses, two hotels accounted for almost half  of workers employed by questionnaire respondents, so those hotels\u2019  responses substantially affected our questionnaire results.", "For our analyses of the effect of minimum wage increases, we obtained  information from our questionnaire on employment and earnings for both  hourly wage and salaried workers during the pay periods that included  June 12, 2011, 2012, and 2013. We analyzed these responses in  conjunction with data we collected from the same employers for previous  reports regarding the pay periods that included June 12, 2007, 2008,  2009, and 2010. For hourly wage workers, respondents were asked to  provide the number of employees paid at each wage rate. For salaried  workers, respondents were asked the number of full-time and part-time  workers paid at each salary level. Hourly wage workers represented  about 98 percent of American Samoan cannery workers and 90 percent  of CNMI hotel workers. To determine the number of workers affected by  each minimum wage increase, we assumed that all workers employed by  questionnaire respondents were legally required to receive the minimum  wage. If some are not covered or are exempt, the minimum wage  increases would affect fewer workers. We did not independently verify  that the wage and other information provided to us were correct. After  recording the questionnaire data, we verified all keypunched records by  comparing them with the corresponding questionnaires and corrected the  errors we found.", "The questionnaire responses cannot be used to make inferences about  all employers and workers in the CNMI and American Samoa, or about all  employers and workers in the CNMI hotel industry. First, because the lists  of employers that received the questionnaire included only those in the  American Samoa tuna canning and CNMI hotel industries (with more than  50 employees), the lists were not representative of all employers or of all  employers in the CNMI hotel industry. Second, some nonresponse bias  may exist in some of the questionnaire responses, since characteristics of  questionnaire respondents may differ from those of nonrespondents and  nonrecipients in ways that affect the responses (e.g., if those that employ  a larger number of workers would have provided different responses than  those that employ a smaller number). Last, it is possible that some  employers\u2019 views of the minimum wage increases may have influenced  their responses.", "To study CNMI hotel minimum wage and payroll costs in relation to  operating costs, we analyzed data provided by CNMI hotel questionnaire  respondents on 2012 annual payroll before deductions for taxes and  benefits, Social Security and Medicare contributions under the Federal  Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), payments for employee benefits, and  other operating expenses. For this and other analyses in this report, we  excluded nonwage labor costs due to the minimum wage increases, such  as increases in employer payroll tax contributions under FICA. In 2011,  for example, employers contributed the equivalent of 6.2 percent of  employee wages to Social Security and 1.45 percent to Medicare, up to  $106,800 in employee wages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employment and Earnings Data", "paragraphs": ["To report on overall employment and earnings, we relied on local  government data.

For the CNMI, this data source and use is the  same as in the two prior GAO reviews of minimum wage changes. To  calculate mean wages in the CNMI, we divided the total sum of earnings  by the number of workers with non-zero wages.", "In the case of American Samoa, we used a combination of local  government data and business responses to GAO\u2019s questionnaire to  report on employment and earnings. The American Samoa Office of  Taxation provided tax data with the number of workers employed by each  employer from 2007 to 2012, and the total sum of earnings over the year.  However, the American Samoa tax data excluded cannery employees in  some years. To address this gap, we added counts of cannery workers  from our questionnaire. The American Samoa tax data has a count of  persons employed during the tax year by the employer. The cannery  employment figure, from GAO\u2019s questionnaire, is a count of employees at  the canneries as of a specific pay period in June of the given year. To  calculate mean wages for the American Samoa tax data, we divided the  total sum of earnings by the number of workers across all employers. To  calculate the mean wages for cannery workers, we assumed that all  cannery workers earned the minimum wage and worked full-time over the  year. To calculate the overall mean wage for American Samoa, we  averaged these estimates, weighting by the number of workers in each  category.", "The initial data provided by the Office of Taxation had a number of gaps,  such as missing numbers of employees or wages for several employers.  At our request, the Office of Taxation researched and provided updated  data that was far more complete, but lacked employee counts for some  employers in 2007 and 2010. We used the reported number of employees  in the adjacent year or years to estimate these missing values. In 2007,  the American Samoa tax data were missing the number of employees for  39 of the 408 employers. We were able to estimate the number of  employees in 2007 for 34 of these 39 by using their reported number of  employees in other years. This estimation added 391 employees to the  2007 total. Similarly, in 2010, we added 499 employees to the total by  interpolating the 2010 number of employees for the American Samoa  Community College from the reported number of employees in 2009 and  2011. The data in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 did not require estimation  of such missing values.", "In addition to the tax data, we obtained SSA data (as of November 15,  2013) on the employment and earnings of individual taxpayers in  American Samoa to update our analysis of data for the previous report.  While the SSA data cover all types of workers in American Samoa, three  large groups of people in the CNMI were not required to report earnings  to SSA and thus were excluded from the SSA data\u2014CNMI government  workers and immigrant workers from the Philippines and Korea. In 2012,  these three groups represented approximately 40 percent of all CNMI  workers, according to CNMI government tax data. We have chosen not to  report the CNMI SSA data due to these coverage gaps.", "To perform the analysis of SSA data, we first identified American Samoa  workers by using the recorded territory or state code for the worker.  However, we determined that, in 2011 and 2012, this method resulted in  implausibly large counts. After consultation with SSA officials, we found  that data entry issues had resulted in a number of extra entries with the  American Samoa state code of \u201cAS.\u201d For example, some entries for  addresses in Texas had entered the last two letters of the state, \u201cAS\u201d in  the state field. Consequently, we additionally checked the American  Samoa data to exclude those entries that, though they had an American  Samoa state code, had a city or zip code that did not match American  Samoa. We performed an additional inspection of the records that had  blank city and zip code fields and concluded that the vast majority of  persons with an \u201cAS\u201d state code but missing city and zip code entries had  characteristically Samoan names. We therefore also included those  records that had an \u201cAS\u201d state code and a blank city and zip code field.  These additional checks reduced the count for 2011 and 2012 and also  slightly reduced the reported count based on SSA data in earlier years.  SSA officials attributed these data errors in 2011 and 2012 to intermittent  data entry errors by employers and data submitters.", "We compared our counts of employees based on American Samoa tax  data and GAO questionnaire responses to employment counts based on  SSA data. In addition, we compared these series to employment counts  in the American Samoa Statistical Yearbook (based on a combination of  government sources for public sector employers and business license  applications for private sector employers). There are some differences  between the data. For example, a person (as counted in the Social  Security data) could have multiple positions (as counted in the other  sources). As table 3 shows, all three employment counts fell from 2007 to  2012 and also had roughly comparable changes from 2007 to 2009\u2014 years covered by our previous report on the minimum wage in American  Samoa. However, the trend in the Social Security data was much larger in  magnitude overall from 2007 to 2012. Specifically, the drop in  employment from 2007 to 2012 was approximately 41 percent based on  SSA data but about 11 percent based on combined American Samoa tax  and GAO questionnaire data and 13 percent in the Statistical Yearbook.", "The smaller drop was more in keeping with the Bureau of Economic  Analysis\u2019s calculation of a flat or slightly declining real GDP in those  years.", "We could not determine an explanation for the divergence among the  data sources. Because the drop was larger when persons were counted,  some of the difference could reflect the loss of cannery workers, who may  have been less likely than other workers to hold multiple positions.  However, there were also cases where the year-to-year changes differed.  For example, from 2011-2012, both the Social Security and the Statistical  yearbook show decreases of about 16 percent and 18 percent,  respectively, but the figure based on American Samoa tax and GAO  questionnaire data remained largely unchanged. We determined that the  data from the American Samoa Office of Taxation were more reliable than  SSA data for our purpose of describing employment and earning trends in  more recent years.", "Because the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collects CPI data on the U.S.  50 states but not on American Samoa or the CNMI, we relied on other  sources of data to compare changes in earnings or wage rates to  changes in prices.

The government of American Samoa stated that it is very concerned  that GAO\u2019s findings are derived from a narrow spectrum of information  sources and, as a result, yield misleading statements and findings not  supported by available data. As noted in the report, U.S. territories are  not included in some federal data collection that is routinely done for  the 50 U.S. states. We have carefully reviewed the available data  from the American Samoa Office of Taxation and have worked with  the office to review and verify its data. As a result of our review, the  office has also reviewed its data for completeness and accuracy. We  believe that the use of these data is appropriate for determining the  changes in employment and earnings in American Samoa over time.  We recognize that different data series can provide different specific  numbers because of their varied methodologies or coverage;  therefore we have reported other data series to provide full disclosure,  and have included a discussion of potential reasons for the  differences. Because we reviewed and discussed the alternate data  sources, and included our analysis of the GAO questionnaire and  interviews with multiple stakeholders in American Samoa, we do not  believe that we are presenting a misleading picture of the impact of  minimum wage increases in American Samoa.", "With the exception of the County Business Patterns data, each of the  data sources included in Attachment C of the American Samoa letter  was included in our report\u2019s Appendix I as part of our discussion of the  different data sources and was included in the draft report. County  Business Patterns data have limitations in their coverage for American  Samoa. For example, County Business Patterns data do not include  most government employees. Government employees were  approximately 29 percent of total employment in American Samoa in  2012 according to the data from the American Samoa Office of  Taxation. In addition, the County Business Patterns data are currently  available for only 2008 to 2011 and are not available for 2007 or 2012.  The other series we report are available for 2007 through 2012. The  American Samoa government has used the 2007 Economic Census  to substitute for the missing County Business Patterns data for 2007,  but these data have a different basis. For example, according to  Census Bureau officials, the Economic Census includes FICA and  non-FICA workers, while County Business Patterns data include only  FICA workers. In addition, the 2012 data the American Samoa  government presents assume that there was no change in private  sector employment from 2011 to 2012.  3.  The American Samoa government stated that our report does not  capture the severity of employment decreases since 2007 and the  government presents an estimation of the 2012 unemployment rate by  the American Samoa Department of Commerce stating that the  unemployment rate in 2012 was 18 percent, up from 12 percent in  2011. We have added unemployment rates to the report that were  calculated based on the 2010 decennial census to the report, for  reference. The 2012 unemployment rates calculated by American  Samoa are based on an extrapolation of 2000 and 2010 census data,  and American Samoa Statistical Yearbook data, and therefore do not  include actual data from 2012. Therefore, the American Samoa  government\u2019s 2012 unemployment calculation may not capture  changes in the actual labor force during this period, which would  affect the unemployment rate. For example, in their responses to our  questionnaire, cannery employers reported a 6 percent increase in  hourly employment from 2011 to 2012. Additionally, if some portion of  the unemployed individuals leaves American Samoa, the  unemployment rate would be less than that estimated by the  American Samoa government.  4.  The American Samoa government comments that more emphasis  should be placed on the multiplier effect of percentage changes in  GOP, however small, to employment. Each of the three data series  we present in Appendix I covers employment in all sectors, therefore  any change in employment and wages that occurred as a result of the  2009 cannery closure would also be captured in data we present. We  agree that it is likely that a major closure such as that of the cannery  in 2009 will have larger effects on the economy.   5.  The American Samoa government presents employment data labeled  as from the American Samoa Government Office of Taxation. The  Office of Taxation data presented by the American Samoa  government are from our draft report and are a combination of data  from that office and from our questionnaire of cannery employers. As  a result of data reviews by the American Samoa Office of Taxation  and GAO during the report comment period, we made corrections to  American Samoa employment and wage data for 2007-2009 that  revised these employment data slightly downward for those years in  the final report.  6.  The American Samoa government presents employment data from  the SSA. We prepared these data as part of an analysis of SSA data  undertaken specifically for this report. As Appendix I of our report  notes, the SSA data had data entry errors for 2011 and 2012 that  resulted in implausibly large counts. While we took steps to account  for these errors, we determined that the data from the American  Samoa Office of Taxation were more reliable than SSA data for our  purpose of describing employment and earning trends in those years.  7.  The American Samoa government presents employment data labeled  as being from the U.S. Department of Commerce County Business  Patterns. However, the County Business Patterns data from 2007 are  U.S. Economic Census data, which have a different basis for the  count than the County Business Patterns data. In addition, the 2012  data presented by the American Samoa government assume no  change in private sector employment between 2011 and 2012.  However, there is likely to have been a change in total employment  between those years. For example, in their responses to our  questionnaire, cannery employers reported a 6 percent increase in  hourly employment from 2011 to 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Government of the CNMI", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["David Gootnick, (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Emil Friberg, Assistant Director;  Ashley Alley; Benjamin Bolitzer; Karen Deans; Jon Fremont; Jill Lacey;  Michael Simon; Vanessa Taylor; and Eddie Uyekawa made key  contributions to this report.
