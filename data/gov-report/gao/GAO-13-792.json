This report evaluates the extent to which (1) DOD's methodology reflects the full cost to the taxpayer, and (2) DOD's components incorporated the business rules in the memorandum and successor instruction into workforce mix decisions. GAO compared DOD's cost methodology to guidance from other government entities and interviewed officials from components applying the methodology, as well as other appropriate DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has improved its methodology for estimating and comparing the full cost to the taxpayer of work performed by military and civilian personnel and contractor support, but the methodology continues to have certain limitations. Best practices state that cost estimating rules should include a common set of standards that minimize conflicts in definitions, but DOD's methodology does not provide guidance for certain costs. For instance, its estimate of service training costs divides total training funding by the number of servicemembers. Using this method yields an average training cost of $6,490 per servicemember in the Army for fiscal year 2012. However, Army data show that training for a general aviation officer can be as high as $93,600 a year, while the training for an enlisted infantryman can be as low as about $4,600 a year. DOD's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office has not provided more specific direction on training costs, although some officials have requested it. Additionally, CAPE officials told GAO they did not include Reserve and National Guard personnel in the methodology because usually these personnel are used on a short-term basis. However, a portion of these personnel do serve in a full-time capacity. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board has noted that a cost methodology should include any resources directly or indirectly used to perform work, and DOD relies on Reserve and National Guard personnel, for example, to provide airlift capabilities in support of military operations. Further, CAPE has not yet evaluated certain retirement-related cost elements. A portion of these cost elements may not be appropriate to include because they are not attributable to current military and civilian personnel. Without more specific direction in these areas, it will be more difficult for DOD to have reasonable assurance that its cost estimates and comparisons reflect the full and most accurate cost to the taxpayer of work performed by its various workforces.", "DOD components GAO examined generally have incorporated business rules contained in the memorandum and successor instruction into their workforce mix decisions, although DOD officials said opportunities to use the rules have been limited due to budgetary factors and few new or expanded missions. Moreover, implementation challenges exist. Some officials raised questions about the extent to which other officials throughout DOD are aware of a requirement to use the methodology for decisions other than in-sourcing. Further, CAPE recently completed a DOD-wide software tool for implementing its instruction, but at the time of GAO's review, some DOD components had developed their own tools. CAPE officials told GAO that the components' use of its DOD-wide tool will not be required, enforced, or monitored, and that CAPE has not reviewed the components' tools. Best practices state that to be reliable, cost estimates should be derived using a process that produces results that are accurate and can be traced, replicated, and updated. Assessing these tools would enable CAPE to identify the advantages and disadvantages of allowing multiple tools and provide reasonable assurance that cost estimates are reliable. Further, the instruction directs users to a General Services Administration (GSA) website for determining contractor support costs. GAO has reported on limitations of GSA's website such as its reporting of data that do not reflect post-competition prices. Without reliable data sources, DOD components may not be using the most suitable data needed to produce credible cost estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOD develop further guidance on certain cost elements, such as training; develop business rules for estimating Reserve and National Guard costs; evaluate inclusion or non-inclusion of cost elements related to retirement; assess cost models being used across the department; and reassess sources for contractor data.

Augmenting that  workforce, the department relies on about 710,000 contractor full-time  equivalent personnel.

To facilitate this awareness, the  DTM provided and the instruction provides business rules for DOD  officials to estimate the full costs of the defense workforce and contracted  support for tasks supporting planning, defense acquisition, and force  structure. According to the instruction, the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) and all DOD components are required to use these  business rules when performing an economic analysis to support  workforce decisions, such as determining the workforce mix of new or  expanding mission requirements that are not inherently governmental or  exempt from private-sector performance, and in-sourcing.", "Table 1  shows how the DOD components can generally use the business rules  established in DTM 09-007 and in DOD Instruction 7041.04 to estimate  and compare personnel costs and to support workforce mix decisions.", "DOD Instruction 7041.04 does not require DOD\u2019s components to make  workforce decisions based on cost alone, but it does require the  components to consider cost in the decision making process when the  function in question is not required by law, regulation, or policy to be  performed by a certain workforce (e.g., inherently governmental or  military essential functions) and other workforce factors are equal. In  other cases, the cost of using personnel to perform work may not be part  of the decision making process.

The defense  agencies we met with said they had not created tools to implement the  business rules, and officials from these agencies said they would use the  DOD-wide tool when it was made available to them.", "According to the instruction, the business rules provide a consistent  approach for all DOD components to estimate the cost of personnel.  Accordingly, the instruction provides a list of potential cost factors  associated with personnel that should be considered in the decision- making process even when personnel costs are not the only factor.  Officials in CAPE stated, however, that they have not reviewed the  services\u2019 tools to ensure they are in compliance with the business rules  and do not plan to review them. An assessment of these various tools  would enable CAPE to identify the advantages and disadvantages of  allowing multiple cost estimation tools.

For example, the instruction directs the user to begin with the  negotiated price of an existing contract, which DOD and military  department officials told us is their preferred option. If an existing contract  is not available, those officials attempt to find another contract that is  similar to the contactor support for which costs are being estimated. To  facilitate this, most of the services, agencies, and offices we met with  maintain their own database of historical contractor data.", "If an existing contract is not available, the instruction directs the user to  either a General Services Administration (GSA) website or the Army\u2019s  online database for contract management and reporting to obtain  contractor support costs for services. We have previously highlighted  limitations with GSA\u2019s data, however, such as the fact that contractors\u2019 published rates on the website do not reflect post-competition prices.The GSA website allows users to search for services, and then identifies  a list of contractors that provide the service along with their rates. The  listed rates, however, may be negotiated with the contractor. Further,  DOD officials we spoke to during this review said that GSA\u2019s website  does not provide targeted data, such as actual contractor rates by  function or geographic location. For example, officials with one command  we spoke to noted their use of a contractor who possesses unique  specialized nuclear weapons related knowledge. According to those  officials, GSA\u2019s website does not contain available data for unique  positions like these. In addition, officials said that GSA\u2019s website provides  too large a range of rates for them to develop realistic estimates. Best  practices from GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide state that a  basic characteristic of credible cost estimates is having multiple sources  of suitable, relevant, and available data.", "In July 2013, when the DOD Instruction replacing DTM 09-007 was  issued, the Army\u2019s Contractor Manpower Reporting Application was  added as an additional source for contractor data. The Contractor  Manpower Reporting Application is an online database that automates  the Army\u2019s contract management and reporting process for contract  management personnel by allowing users to view contract information,  track contract data, and view various reports based on contract data in  the application. The Contractor Manpower Reporting Application business  process captures information on funding source, contracting vehicle,  organization supported, mission and function performed, labor hours, and  labor costs for contracted efforts, among other things. Currently the  application collects data for the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy on the  number of contractor employees by using direct labor hours and  associated cost data. However, DOD is still developing its department- wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application system and we  previously found that a number of factors limit the accuracy and  completeness of inventory data.unaware of some of the limitations with the contractor support data  sources provided in the instruction. In the absence of data sources that  are consistent with established practices for developing cost estimates,  DOD components may be using data that do not lead to credible  contractor cost estimates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With a total workforce of about 3 million individuals, as well as an  estimated 710,000 contractor full time equivalents, DOD\u2019s investment in  personnel to accomplish its missions constitutes a substantial financial  commitment. In those cases where the department can choose what  workforce it wants to utilize to accomplish tasks, it is crucial that it have  an accurate method for comparing the costs of its civilian, military, and  contractor personnel. DOD has taken important steps to achieve this goal  since our 2008 report on military to civilian conversions for health care  personnel, including the development of DTM 09-007 and its successor  Instruction 7041.04. The department\u2019s current direction for estimating and  comparing the cost of its available workforces, however, could be  improved. For instance, users currently find it difficult to develop  estimates of particular costs such as overhead, advertising and recruiting,  and training, and the services have not received guidance on developing  estimates for Reserve and National Guard personnel. Further, as we  have noted, there is some disagreement within the department about the  inclusion of certain retirement costs in current workforce cost estimates.  More comprehensive guidance in these areas could improve the  components\u2019 ability to make accurate cost comparisons between  workforces.", "Similarly, the department currently lacks assurance that workforce cost  estimates and comparisons are consistent across the department, but by  evaluating the different cost estimation tools currently being used by the  components, it could decide on the best course to ensure consistency  and accuracy. Also, current and accurate data on contractor support  costs is critical for the department in making workforce decisions, but due  to limitations in some of the data DOD has identified for making contractor  support cost estimates, components may be relying on data sources that  do not produce intended results. While federal agencies always must  make consistent and cost-effective choices in managing their resources,  this is especially true given the ongoing fiscal challenges that have  imposed budgetary constraints across the federal government and are  likely to continue for some time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve DOD\u2019s estimates and comparisons of the full cost of its  military, civilian, and contractor workforces, we are making the following  five recommendations to the Secretary of Defense.", "To improve DOD\u2019s methodology for estimating and comparing the full  cost of its various workforces, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation  office to take the following three actions:", "Further develop guidance for cost elements that users have identified  as challenging to calculate, such as general and administrative,  overhead, advertising and recruiting, and training;", "Develop business rules for estimating the full cost of National Guard  and Reserve personnel; and  In coordination with the department\u2019s Office of the Actuary and  appropriate federal actuarial offices, reevaluate the inclusion and  quantification of pension, retiree health care costs, and other relevant  costs of an actuarial nature and make revisions as appropriate.", "To facilitate consistent workforce cost estimates and comparisons, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation to assess the advantages and  disadvantages of allowing the continued use of different cost estimation  tools across the department or directing department-wide application of  one tool, and revise its guidance in accordance with the findings of its  analysis.", "To improve DOD\u2019s ability to estimate contractor support costs, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation, consistent with established  practices for developing credible cost estimates, to research the data  sources it is currently using and reassess its contractor support data  sources for use when determining contractor support costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with our  findings that it must make cost-effective decisions in structuring and  shaping its workforce of military personnel, government civilians, and  contracted support.

In commenting on our report, DOD stated that  it will continue to review the methodology for calculating these cost  elements and issue clarifying guidance where necessary or appropriate.  DOD also stated that it is part of an inter-agency effort that is developing  government-wide cost comparisons and that, if or when government-wide  cost comparison guidance is published, DOD will adjust its own guidance  accordingly.

In its comments, DOD stated that it is assessing the potential  need for reserve manpower costing models, as well as the identification  of questions that reserve costing policies and models would be used to  address. Once it has gained a more thorough understanding of the  questions to be addressed by reserve cost estimates, it will begin work on  guidance as necessary, and development of reserve component costing  models if appropriate.

We acknowledge, as DOD stated in comments on  our report, that the department is open to assessing the advantages and  disadvantages of allowing the continued use of alternate cost estimation  tools among the various components, and, if necessary, will revise its  guidance based on this assessment. However, in order to satisfy the  intent of this recommendation, DOD needs to take action to fully address  this recommendation. Doing so will facilitate more consistent workforce  cost estimates and comparisons when DOD\u2019s components use the  department\u2019s methodology for estimating and comparing the cost of their  workforces.", "Finally, DOD concurred with our recommendation to research the data  sources it is currently using and reassess its contractor support data  sources for use when determining contractor support costs.

We also reviewed  pertinent DOD and service-specific policies and guidance related to  workforce mix and economic analysis. In addition, we interviewed  knowledgeable officials within the offices of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness), the Director of Cost Assessment  and Program Evaluation, DOD\u2019s Office of the Actuary, and the military  services. We also met with the Office of Management and Budget and  other experts and other interested parties we selected based on their  work on issues related to the DTM.

Therefore, the Marine Corps was excluded from our  selection criteria and we did not select any Marine Corps commands as  part of our non-probability sample. Once the data for the other  components was compiled, we rank ordered the commands within each  of the military departments and the defense agencies from largest to  smallest based on civilian personnel counts. For each of the military  departments and defense agencies, we divided the rank ordered list of  commands and agencies into three groups: large, medium, and small. We  considered commands and agencies with 10,000 or more full-time civilian  employees as large, commands and agencies with at least 1,000 but less  than 10,000 full-time civilian employees as medium; and commands and  agencies with less than 1,000 full-time civilian employees as small. We  generated a selection number based on the total number of commands  and agencies and counted down the rank ordered list of commands and  agencies to identify those commands and agencies that we would meet  with. This method resulted in one selected command, office, or agency  from each of the categories of large, medium, and small. In addition to  discussing with each of these entities their implementation of the  business rules identified in DTM 09-007, we requested the number of  times they used the business rules to inform workforce decisions (e.g., in- sourcing, workforce conversions, and new or expanded missions) from  January 2010 when the DTM was issued to June 2013. We did not  independently validate the number of uses of the business rules reported  to us by each of the entities or the cost estimates used to inform the  workforce decisions.
