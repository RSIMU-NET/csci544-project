However, 11 agencies reported that they did not have plans to meet their goals. Further, 16 agencies reported that, as of August 2018, they had met, or planned to meet, their cost savings targets, for a total of $2.36 billion in cost savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. This is about $0.38 billion less than OMB's DCOI savings goal of $2.7 billion. This shortfall is the result of 5 agencies reporting less in planned cost savings and avoidances in their DCOI strategic plans, as compared to their savings targets established for them by OMB. Three agencies did not have a cost savings target and did not report any achieved savings.", "In addition, the 24 agencies reported limited progress against OMB's five data center optimization targets for server utilization and automated monitoring, energy metering, power usage effectiveness, facility utilization, and virtualization. As of August 2018, the agencies reported that 3 had met three targets, 9 had met one target, and 10 met none of the targets. Two agencies did not have a basis to report on progress as they do not own any data centers. Further, as of August 2018, 20 agencies did not plan to meet all of OMB's fiscal year 2018 optimization goals. Specifically, only 2 agencies reported plans to meet all applicable targets; 6 reported that they did not plan to meet any of the targets (see figure).", "We selected 6 agencies that had demonstrated success towards meeting their DCOI goals and those agencies reported a number of key practices that contributed to their efforts. The officials noted the importance of, among other things, obtaining executive leadership support for consolidation and optimization activities, employing an organization-wide communications plan, and focusing on data center closures. The officials also cited the use of past experience and lessons learned to inform improvements to future consolidation plans and processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 36 recommendations to 22 agencies to improve performance against established DCOI goals.

In  October 2010, OMB also clarified the definition of a data center and noted  that, for the purposes of FDCCI, a data center was to be defined as any  room used for the purpose of processing or storing data that is larger than  500 square feet and meets stringent availability requirements. Under this  definition, OMB reported that agencies had identified 2,094 data centers  as of July 2010.", "However, in 2011, the Federal CIO expanded the definition to include a  facility of any size and OMB published its revised definition in March  2012. Based on the revised definition, OMB estimated that there were a  total of 3,133 federal data centers in December 2011.

However, most agencies continue to report mixed progress  against those targets. Although agencies have taken action to close about  half of the data centers in their combined inventories, 11 agencies did not  plan to meet all of their closure targets.", "Further, the data center closures were expected to drive cost savings and  avoidances and, to the agencies\u2019 credit, the closures have led to more  than $2.37 billion in planned and achieved cost savings and avoidances  from fiscal years 2016 through 2018. However, five agencies did not plan  to meet their cost savings targets. Until agencies consolidate the data  centers required to meet their targets, as well as identify and report the  associated cost savings, they will be challenged to realize expected  efficiencies and the full benefits of DCOI will not be fully realized.", "Similarly, although OMB first established optimization metrics in May  2014, agencies continue to report only limited progress against the  current performance targets. While two agencies do not have a basis to  report any progress as they do not own any data centers, only two  agencies reported that they planned to achieve all of DCOI\u2019s fiscal year  2018 optimization targets. Ensuring the optimized performance of data  centers is a key component to meeting OMB\u2019s DCOI-wide savings goal  and the 20 agencies that did not have plans to meet their targets call into  question whether DCOI will realize its full potential savings.", "Although many agencies have struggled to meet their individual DCOI  targets, other agencies have successfully met OMB\u2019s goals for data  center closures, savings, and optimization. Six such agencies that we  identified reported on the importance of gathering leadership support,  effective communication, and alignment with the core tenets of DCOI.

For the cost  savings area, we identified two departments and two small agencies  reporting the highest cost savings DCOI to date, as of August 2017. From  those, we selected one department (Commerce) and one small agency  (the General Services Administration) to provide balance relative to  agency size. For effective practices related to optimization performance,  we reviewed agencies\u2019 reported optimization performance as of August  2017 and selected the two highest-performing agencies in this area (the  Social Security Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency),  since they were the only two agencies reporting that they met more than  half of OMB\u2019s optimization targets. Selecting these agencies was  designed to provide anecdotal information that could assist agencies  struggling with DCOI implementation. The examples they provided are  not findings nor should they be taken to be representative of all the  agencies participating in DCOI.", "We asked each selected agency to identify practices that they found  effective in implementing DCOI at their agency and in meeting OMB\u2019s  established targets in each of the areas, not just the area for which they  were selected. We also solicited examples that demonstrated how those  practices helped agency implementation or the benefits from  implementing DCOI. Additionally, we considered information and  examples that these agencies provided as part of our work to identify  FITARA best practices. We analyzed the responses to determine the  practices and reported those that were identified by at least two agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to April 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XII: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIII: Comments from the Environmental Protection Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIV: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XV: Comments from the National Science Foundation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVI: Comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVII: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, individuals making contributions  to this report included Dave Powner (director), Dave Hinchman (assistant  director), Justin Booth (analyst-in-charge), Alexander Bennett, Chris  Businsky, Nancy Glover, and Jonathan Wall."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Federal agencies operate thousands of data centers and since 2010 have been required to close unneeded facilities and improve the performance of the remaining centers.
