Since 1990, DOE's management of major contracts and projects, including those executed by NNSA, has been on GAO's list of areas at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.

There are no federal government-wide standards specifically addressing program management. However, federal internal control standards include principles that are relevant to key roles such as program managers, and the Project Management Institute (PMI) has established a standard on program management that is generally recognized as a leading practice for most programs. Specifically, internal control standards state that management should assign responsibilities, delegate authority, and establish expectations of competence for key roles such as program managers. According to leading practices, organizations develop program plans, capture and understand stakeholder needs, and establish processes for maintaining program management oversight, among other activities. DOE has not established a department-wide program management policy, and NNSA cancelled its program management policy in 2013 without establishing a new one. A policy incorporating key internal control standards and leading program management practices may help ensure that DOE and NNSA program offices are better able to achieve their missions, goals, and objectives. For example, in a 2016 report examining NNSA's plans to build a plutonium analysis facility, GAO found that the agency had not clarified whether the project would satisfy the mission needs of other NNSA and DOE programs. NNSA might have been better able to clarify this project's mission needs if DOE and NNSA had been operating under a DOE-wide program management policy incorporating leading practices. DOE and NNSA officials said that they recognize the importance of establishing a program management policy, but DOE has not taken steps to do so.", "DOE and NNSA have not established training programs for program managers. According to federal internal control standards, management should train key staff to enable them to develop competencies appropriate for key roles, which would include program managers. In addition, according to PMI, a successful program manager exhibits certain core competences, such as leveraging a strong working knowledge of the principles and process of both program and project management. NNSA's cancelled program management policy also required the agency to develop standardized training materials for program managers and track the training requirements for each program manager position. However, according to DOE officials, the department has not developed a training program for program managers. In contrast, DOE has developed a training program for project managers and established an office responsible for managing this program and certifying the qualifications of DOE and NNSA project managers. NNSA officials said that they were unsure if NNSA had ever developed training materials for program managers and that the agency does not track the training requirements for its program manager positions. Of the 15 NNSA program managers GAO interviewed, only five individuals stated that they had received training related to program management.

(PMI), a program  manager interacts with project managers to provide support and guidance  on individual  projects but also must take a broad view of program  objectives and organizational culture and processes. More broadly,  program management helps ensure that a group of related projects,  subprograms, and program activities are managed in a coordinated way  to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.

However, these efforts are focused primarily on project  management, not program management. For example, as we found in  November 2014, DOE\u2019s cost estimating guidance and requirements do  not apply to programs (including programs with project-like  characteristics).

According to PMI\u2019s standard, which describes  leading program management practices, the work associated with  program management is characterized by the following five areas of  activity.", "Program strategy alignment\u2014identifying opportunities and benefits  to achieve the organization\u2019s strategic objectives through program  implementation.", "Program benefits management\u2014defining, creating, maximizing,  delivering, and sustaining the benefits provided by the program.", "Program stakeholder engagement\u2014capturing and understanding  stakeholder needs, desires, and expectations and analyzing the  impact of the program on stakeholders, gaining and maintaining  stakeholder support, managing stakeholder communications, and  mitigating/channeling stakeholder resistance.", "Program governance\u2014establishing processes and procedures for  maintaining program management oversight and decision making  support for applicable policies and practices throughout the course of  the program.", "Program life cycle management\u2014managing all the program  activities related to program definition, program benefits delivery, and  program closure.", "Each of the five areas encompasses a number of different practices. For  example, developing a program plan is an important component of  program strategy alignment. According to PMI\u2019s standard, the program  plan formally expresses the organization\u2019s concept, vision, mission, and  benefits expected to be produced by the program.

For  example, according to PMI\u2019s standard, essential program management  responsibilities are linked to project management responsibilities and  include identifying and controlling interdependencies between projects,  addressing escalated issues among the projects that comprise the  program, and tracking the contribution of each project and the non-project  work to the consolidated program benefits. In addition, according to a  2015 report by a panel of the National Academy of Public Administration,  effective program management depends on effective project  management, which itself depends on a cadre of professionals including  not only project managers, but also an array of technical specialties and  disciplines within the project and program management profession, such  as requirements development, cost and schedule estimation, and risk  management."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE and NNSA Have Not Established Policies Addressing Internal Control Standards or Leading Practices Related to Program Management", "paragraphs": ["DOE has not established a department-wide policy addressing internal  control standards or leading practices related to program management,  and NNSA canceled its program management policy in 2013.

In addition, on  the basis of our review of DOE directives, we were unable to identify any  policies directly addressing internal control standards related to assigning  responsibilities, authority, or expectations of competence to program  managers, or addressing leading program management practices.  However, we identified a 2005 DOE order that, while not establishing a  DOE-wide policy on program management, directed NNSA to manage its  programs in accordance with NNSA\u2019s own program management policy.  Specifically, NNSA had established its policy for conducting program  management activities in 2004. The policy defined \u201cprogram\u201d as a group  of ongoing activities and related projects conducted with a defined set of  resources and managed in a coordinated way to achieve mission  objectives and obtain benefits not available from managing them  individually.  It stated that NNSA viewed programs as falling across a  spectrum that ranged from operational programs (such as surveillance of  the nuclear weapons stockpile) at one end to major capital acquisition  projects at the other end. The policy stated that the diversity of NNSA\u2019s  programs demanded a tailored application of program management  principles to accommodate the requirements of each program. NNSA\u2019s  policy required that program management responsibilities and authorities  be defined in writing and that program managers meet certain  expectations of competence, such as demonstrating a practical  understanding of key NNSA and organizational business and  management practices.", "NNSA\u2019s policy, however, provided only general guidelines for conducting  program management activities and stated that NNSA\u2019s deputy and  associate administrator offices were responsible for determining how to  apply program management principles within their organizations.", "Accordingly, DP and DNN issued their own program management  policies in 2005. Among other things, the policies described each  office\u2019s framework for managing its programs, roles and responsibilities of  program managers and other members of the program management  team, and expectations of competence for program managers. For  example, DNN\u2019s policy described 10 program management functions,  such as developing and validating requirements and developing program  plans. In particular, according to DNN\u2019s policy, each assistant deputy  administrator in DNN was to develop a program management plan that  would establish and clearly document operational policies, procedures,  guidelines, and processes; describe the programmatic work already  accomplished; and describe the work to be accomplished over the life of  the program. In addition, program managers were responsible for  preparing a program execution plan on an annual basis to provide  detailed guidance to program staff for implementing the coming fiscal  year\u2019s work scope. DNN\u2019s policy also described 29 specific  responsibilities of program managers, as well as qualification and training  requirements for them.", "NNSA cancelled its agency-wide program management policy in 2013 but  did not establish a new policy that addresses key internal control  standards or leading practices related to program management.  According to NNSA officials and documentation, NNSA canceled its  policy at the request of DP, which had updated its own 2005 program  management policy and found the 2004 NNSA policy to be outdated.  However, NNSA officials told us that they did not know why NNSA did not  revise its 2004 policy or address the impact of its cancellation on NNSA\u2019s  program offices. NNSA officials noted that other NNSA-wide polices exist  related to planning, work authorization, and contractor oversight, and that  these policies address elements of program management, such as  requiring programs to develop annual implementation plans. However,  these policies do not comprehensively address key internal control  standards, such as assigning responsibility, delegating authority, and  establishing expectations of competence, or leading program  management practices, such as strategy alignment and developing  program plans.", "Without a department-wide policy on program management, NNSA\u2019s  program offices may not be managing their programs in accordance with  internal control standards or leading practices related to program  management. For example, DNN officials told us that they do not  currently have a program management policy, as their organization\u2019s  2005 policy became outdated and fell out of use around 2010. They said  that they expect to establish a new program management policy by the  end of 2016 but did not provide us with a draft copy to review. As a result,  it is unclear what principles and practices DNN currently follows in  managing its programs. In contrast, DP has revised its program  management policy multiple times since issuing its original policy in 2005.  DP\u2019s most recent policy, issued in January 2016, defines the term  \u201cprogram,\u201d establishes four categories of program management and  execution requirements for these categories, and defines the activities  that program managers must perform to meet those requirements, among  other things. However, DP\u2019s policy does not fully address internal control  standards related to program management.

In addition, in a 2014 DOE report reviewing NNSA\u2019s plans  to build a multi-billion-dollar facility for uranium manufacturing at its Oak  Ridge site in Tennessee, DOE\u2019s review team recommended that NNSA  create an overarching uranium mission strategy and a position within DP  (referred to by NNSA as the Uranium Program Manager) to take  ownership of NNSA\u2019s overall uranium mission. NNSA might have been  better able to clarify the mission needs associated with these projects if  NNSA and DOE programs had been operating under a department-wide  policy that incorporated (1) leading practices, such as capturing and  understanding stakeholder needs and expectations and other activities  associated with program stakeholder engagement, and (2) internal control  principles related to assigning responsibilities and delegating authority to  key roles such as program managers.", "DOE and NNSA officials told us that they recognize the importance of  establishing a program management policy.
