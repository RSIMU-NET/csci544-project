This statement is based on a GAO report issued in June 2018 on CBP's recruiting, hiring, and retention efforts along with updates as of February 2019 on actions CBP has taken to address GAO's prior recommendation. For the previous report, GAO analyzed CBP data on recruitment efforts, hiring process steps, and retention rates; examined strategies related to these activities; and interviewed CBP officials and union groups. GAO also reviewed information on CBP actions to implement GAO's prior recommendation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In June 2018, GAO reported that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) increased its emphasis on recruitment by establishing a central recruitment office in 2016 and increasing its participation in recruitment events, among other things. As a result, the number of applications it received for law enforcement positions across its operational components\u2014the Office of Field Operations, U.S. Border Patrol, and Air and Marine Operations\u2014more than tripled from fiscal years (FY) 2013 through 2017. Also, in November 2017, CBP hired a contractor to more effectively target potential applicants and better utilize data to enhance CBP's recruitment and hiring efforts. However, at the time of GAO's June 2018 report, it was too early to gauge whether the contractor would be effective in helping CBP to achieve its goal to recruit and hire more law enforcement officers.", "CBP improved its hiring process as demonstrated by two key metrics\u2014reducing its time-to-hire and increasing the percentage of applicants that are hired. As shown in the table, CBP's time-to-hire decreased from FY 2015 through 2017. CBP officials stated that these improvements, paired with increases in applications, have resulted in more hires. However, the hiring process remains lengthy. For example, in FY 2017, CBP officer applications took more than 300 days, on average, to process. Certain factors contributed to the lengthy time-to-hire, including process steps that can be challenging and time-consuming for applicants to complete\u2014such as the polygraph exam\u2014as well as CBP's reliance on applicants to promptly complete certain aspects of the process\u2014such as submitting their background investigation form.", "CBP enhanced its efforts to address retention challenges. However, staffing levels for law enforcement positions consistently remained below target levels. For example, CBP ended FY 2017 more than 1,100 CBP officers below its target staffing level. CBP officials cited employees' inability to relocate to more desirable locations as the primary retention challenge. CBP offered some relocation opportunities to law enforcement personnel and has pursued the use of financial incentives and other payments to supplement salaries, especially for those staffed to remote or hard-to-fill locations. However, retaining law enforcement officers in hard-to-fill locations continues to be challenging for CBP. GAO reported that CBP could be better positioned to understand its retention challenges and take appropriate action to address them by implementing a formal process for capturing information on all departing employees. In response, CBP officials reported taking steps to implement a CBP-wide exit survey and plan to analyze the results of the survey quarterly, beginning April 2019."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommended in its June 2018 report that CBP systematically collect and analyze data on departing law enforcement officers and use this information to inform retention efforts. DHS concurred, and CBP has actions planned or underway to address this recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on U.S. Customs and  Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) efforts to recruit, hire, and retain law  enforcement personnel. CBP is responsible for, among other things,  securing U.S. borders to prevent acts of terrorism and stopping the  unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband across  U.S. borders. To carry out these objectives, CBP employs nearly 45,000  law enforcement personnel across its three operational components\u2014the  Office of Field Operations (OFO), U.S. Border Patrol ((Border Patrol), and  Air and Marine Operations (AMO)\u2014at and between U.S. ports of entry, in  the U.S. air and maritime environment, and at certain overseas locations.  However, in recent years, CBP has not been able to attain its statutorily- established minimum staffing levels for its Border Patrol agent positions  or its staffing goals for other law enforcement officer positions, citing high  attrition rates in some locations, a protracted hiring process, and  competition from other federal, state, and local law enforcement  agencies. Additionally, Executive Order 13767, issued in January 2017,  called for CBP to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, subject to  available appropriations. Consistent with this directive, Border Patrol is  aiming to attain a staffing level of 26,370 Border Patrol agents (5,000  agents above the fiscal year 2016 statutorily-established level). As of  early February 2019, Border Patrol had 19,443 agents onboard, which is  6,927 agents below the target level, according to CBP.", "In June 2018, we reported on the extent to which CBP has developed and  implemented an approach to recruit qualified law enforcement officers,  revised its hiring process and made efforts to more efficiently hire law  enforcement applicants, and developed and implemented an approach to  retain law enforcement officers. This statement summarizes information  from that report, as well as actions CBP has taken, as of February 2019,  to address our recommendation from the report that CBP systematically  collect and analyze data on departing law enforcement officers and use  this information to inform retention efforts. To conduct the work for our  June 2018 report, we analyzed CBP data on recruitment efforts, hiring  process steps, and retention rates and retention incentives; reviewed  documentation on CBP recruitment, hiring, and retention strategies; and  interviewed officials from CBP and each of the three operational  components. We also interviewed officials from the National Border Patrol  Council union and National Treasury Employees Union\u2014which represent  CBP officers. For this statement, we also reviewed the November 2017  contract CBP awarded to Accenture Federal Services, LLC, to help meet  the staffing requirements outlined in Executive Order 13767 and  interviewed CBP officials responsible for managing the contract. More  detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology is  contained in our June 2018 report. We also reviewed information on CBP  actions to implement our prior recommendation. The work upon which  this statement is based was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

Specifically, CBP\u2019s recruitment budget  allocated by the centralized recruting office almost doubled, from  approximately $6.4 million in fiscal year 2015 to more than $12.7 million  in fiscal year 2017. CBP also more than tripled the total number of  recruitment events it participated in, from 905 events in fiscal year 2015 to  roughly 3,000 in both fiscal years 2016 and 2017. In addition, we reported  that CBP had increased its use of recruitment incentives for OFO  specifically from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 to help staff hard-to-fill  locations. A recruitment incentive may be paid to a newly-appointed  employee if an agency determines that a position is likely to be difficult to  fill in the absence of such an incentive. From fiscal years 2015 through  2017, OFO increased the number of recruitment incentives it paid to CBP  officers from nine incentives in two locations at a total cost of about  $77,600 to 446 incentives across 18 locations at a cost of approximately  $4.3 million. AMO and Border Patrol did not use recruitment incentives  from fiscal years 2015 through 2017.", "As a result of its efforts, CBP also experienced an increase in the number  of applications it received for law enforcement officer positions across all  three operational components from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. For  example, with the exception of fiscal year 2014, applications for Border  Patrol agent positions increased every year, from roughly 27,000  applications in fiscal year 2013 to more than 91,000 applications in fiscal  year 2017. Further, during the same period, applications for CBP officer  positions increased from approximately 22,500 to more than 85,000, and  applications for AMO\u2019s law enforcement officer positions increased from  about 2,000 to more than 5,800."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP\u2019s Hiring Process Has Improved, but the Process Remains Lengthy", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in June 2018, CBP\u2019s law enforcement applicants undergo  a lengthy and rigorous hiring process that includes nearly a dozen steps,  including a background investigation, medical examination, physical  fitness test, and polygraph examination. Several of these steps can be  done concurrently\u2014for example, CBP can begin the background  investigation while the candidate completes the physical fitness test and  medical examination process steps. Figure 1 depicts the hiring process  for Border Patrol agent and CBP officer positions.", "From fiscal years 2015 through 2017, CBP generally improved its  performance in two key metrics to assess the efficiency and effectiveness  of its hiring process for law enforcement officer positions. Specifically,  CBP reduced its time-to-hire (the average number of days that elapsed  between the closing date of a job announcement and an applicant\u2019s entry- on-duty date) and increased the percentage of applicants that are hired.  With regard to the time-to-hire metric, as shown in table 1, CBP\u2019s time-to- hire decreased from fiscal years 2015 through 2017.", "With regard to the percentage of applicants that are hired, CBP\u2019s overall  applicant pass rate metric calculates the estimated percentage of  applicants who successfully complete the hiring process and enter on  duty. CBP data indicate that overall applicant pass rates more than  doubled for CBP officer and Border Patrol agent positions from fiscal  years 2016 through 2017. CBP officials told us that higher overall  applicant pass rates paired with recent increases in the number of  applications received by the agency are starting to result in an increase in  the number of law enforcement officers hired, as applicants complete  CBP\u2019s hiring process and officially enter on duty. As we reported in June  2018, CBP data indicated that more law enforcement officers entered on  duty in the first half of fiscal year 2018 than entered on duty in the first  half of fiscal year 2017. Specifically, the total number of CBP officers and  Border Patrol agents that entered on duty in the first half of fiscal year  2018 increased by roughly 50 percent and 83 percent, respectively, when  compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Further, the total  number of AMO law enforcement officers that entered on duty in the first  half of fiscal year 2018 more than doubled from the same period of fiscal  year 2017.", "As we reported in June 2018, CBP has made efforts to improve its hiring  process by revising certain aspects of the process, among other things.  According to agency officials, these efforts to streamline and improve  CBP\u2019s overall hiring process have collectively resulted in the decreased  time-to-hire and increased overall applicant pass rates discussed above.  For example, in March 2017, CBP was granted the authority to waive the  polygraph examination for veterans who meet certain criteria, including  those who hold a current, active Top-Secret/Sensitive-Compartmented- Information clearance. Also, in April 2017, CBP received approval from  the Office of Personnel Management to use direct-hire authority for law  enforcement positions, which allows CBP to expedite the typical hiring  process by eliminating competitive rating and ranking procedures and  veterans\u2019 preference. As of March 31, 2018, 77 CBP officers and 107  Border Patrol agents had entered on duty through this authority.", "CBP has also made revisions to specific steps in its hiring process,  including the application, entrance examination, and polygraph  examination, among others. For example, in fiscal year 2016, CBP  reordered its hiring process to place the entrance examination as the first  step directly after an applicant submitted an application. Prior to this  change, CBP conducted qualification reviews on applicants to ensure  they met position requirements before inviting them to take the entrance  exam. According to CBP officials, this updated process provided  applicants with the opportunity to obtain a realistic preview of the job they  were applying for earlier in the hiring process. These officials explained  that this helps to ensure that only those applicants who are committed to  completing the hiring process and entering on duty at CBP continue  through the hiring pipeline, which may help to address high applicant  discontinue rates (e.g., roughly half of all eligible applicants in fiscal year  2015 did not take the exam). According to CBP officials, this revision also  created efficiencies as the agency no longer has to spend time and resources on completing qualification reviews for applicants who either  did not show up to take the exam or failed the exam itself.", "CBP has also made several changes to its polygraph examination  process step, which has consistently had the lowest pass rate of any step  in its hiring process. For example, among other things, CBP has  increased the number of polygraph examiners available to administer the  test, according to agency officials, and was piloting a new type of  polygraph exam. According to CBP officials, the new examination focuses  on identifying serious crimes and is sufficiently rigorous to ensure that  only qualified applicants are able to pass. Preliminary data from CBP\u2019s  pilot show that this new exam has demonstrated higher pass rates when  compared with CBP\u2019s traditional polygraph exam while also taking less  time, on average, per test to complete. At the time of our review, it was  too early to tell if these efforts will result in improvements to the polygraph  examination step. Available CBP data indicate mixed results. Specifically,  while the average duration to complete this step decreased for all law  enforcement officer positions from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, pass  rates also declined slightly over this same period. For example, for Border  Patrol agents, the pass rate declined from 28 to 26 percent, while for CBP  officers, it declined from 32 to 25 percent.", "While CBP had reduced its time-to-hire and made efforts to improve its  hiring process for law enforcement officers, CBP officials noted that the  hiring process remained lengthy, which directly affected the agency\u2019s  ability to recruit and hire for law enforcement positions. CBP officials also  stated that their ability to further improve CBP\u2019s time-to-hire and increase  law enforcement hires was affected by hiring process steps that can be  challenging and time-consuming for applicants to complete, as well as  CBP\u2019s reliance on applicants to promptly complete certain aspects of the  process. In fiscal year 2017, it took an average of 274 days for Border  Patrol agent applicants and 318 days for CBP officer applicants to  complete all hiring steps and enter on duty. According to a leading  practice in hiring we identified for such positions, agencies should ensure  that the hiring process is not protracted or onerous for applicants.  According to CBP officials, the agency\u2019s multi-step hiring process for its  law enforcement officer positions was intentionally rigorous and involves  extensive applicant screening to ensure that only qualified candidates  meet the technical, physical, and suitability requirements for employment  at CBP. Even so, CBP officials across several components told us that  the agency\u2019s time-to-hire was too long and directly affected the  component\u2019s ability to recruit and hire for law enforcement positions. For  example, OFO officials told us that the longer the hiring process takes to  complete, the more likely it was that an applicant will drop out. Further,  qualified applicants may also decide to apply for employment at a  competing law enforcement agency that may have a less rigorous  process than CBP\u2019s, according to CBP officials.", "One factor that affects CBP\u2019s ability to efficiently process and onboard  law enforcement officers are specific hiring process steps that are time- consuming and challenging for candidates to complete. For example,  CBP officials cited the polygraph examination as a significant bottleneck  within CBP\u2019s hiring process. In addition to having the lowest pass rate of  any step in CBP\u2019s process, the polygraph examination also took CBP  officer and Border Patrol agent applicants, on average, the longest  amount of time to complete in fiscal year 2017\u201474 days and 94 days,  respectively. Further, CBP officials told us that these already lengthy time  frames may increase further because of the growing number of applicants  for CBP\u2019s law enforcement positions. In addition, on average, it took CBP  law enforcement officer applicants across all three components 55 days  or more to complete the medical examination and more than 60 days to  complete the background investigation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CBP\u2019s Accenture Contract Is Intended to Further Enhance CBP\u2019s Recruitment and Hiring Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In November 2017, CBP hired a contractor\u2014Accenture Federal Services,  LLC\u2014to help the agency recruit and hire the 5,000 Border Patrol agents  called for in Executive Order 13767, as well as an additional 2,000 CBP  officers and 500 AMO personnel. Specifically, at the time of our June  2018 report, the contract had a total potential period of 5 years at a not- to-exceed value of $297 million. The contract included a base year and  four 1-year option periods, which CBP may exercise at its discretion for a  total potential period of 5 years. Under this performance-based contract,  Accenture is responsible for enhancing CBP\u2019s recruitment efforts and  managing the hiring process for those applicants it recruits.", "We reported that the Accenture contract is intended to enhance CBP\u2019s  recruitment efforts by improving its marketing strategy and utilizing new  ways to capture and analyze data to better inform recruitment efforts,  according to CBP officials. To meet target staffing levels, CBP expected  that the contractor would augment CBP\u2019s current hiring infrastructure  while pursuing new and innovative hiring initiatives. Specifically, the  contractor is responsible for implementing the same hiring process steps  and ensuring that all applicants recruited by Accenture meet CBP\u2019s  standards. CBP officials also told us that Accenture has the flexibility to  pursue novel hiring tactics and pilot initiatives that CBP may not have  considered or been able to undertake. For example, Accenture plans to  pilot innovative ways to reduce the time-to-hire, including by streamlining  steps in the hiring process, which could help to improve CBP\u2019s overall  process and generate increased hires for law enforcement positions. At  the time of our June 2018 report, some key issues were still being  negotiated between CBP and the contractor. For example, while CBP  officials told us that the main metric used to assess Accenture\u2019s  effectiveness will be the total number of hires the contractor produces,  they were still working to finalize other key metrics for evaluating the  contractor\u2019s effectiveness as well as an oversight plan to ensure the  contractor operates according to agency requirements. As a result, we  reported that it was too early to determine whether these initiatives would  help increase the number and quality of applicants for CBP\u2019s law  enforcement officer positions. We also reported that it was too early to  evaluate whether the contractor would be able to efficiently and effectively  provide the surge hiring capacity CBP needs to achieve its staffing goals."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Enhanced Its Retention Efforts, but Does Not Systematically Collect and Analyze Data on Departing Law Enforcement Personnel", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Retaining Law Enforcement Officers in Hard-to-Fill Locations Has Been Challenging for CBP", "paragraphs": ["In June 2018, we reported that CBP\u2019s annual rates of attrition were  relatively low, but CBP faced challenges retaining law enforcement  officers in hard-to-fill locations. From fiscal years 2013 through 2017,  OFO\u2019s annual attrition rates for the CBP officer position were consistent  at about 3 percent, while rates for Border Patrol agent and AMO\u2019s Marine  Interdiction Agent positions were below 5 percent in 4 out of the 5 fiscal  years we reviewed. When we compared CBP\u2019s annual attrition rates for  these positions to those of other selected law enforcement agencies, we  found that CBP\u2019s attrition rates were similar to U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) annual attrition rates for its law  enforcement positions and generally lower than those of the Secret  Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Annual attrition rates for  AMO\u2019s aviation positions were higher, ranging from 5.0 percent to 9.2  percent for the Air Interdiction Agent position and 7.8 percent to 11.1  percent for the Aviation Enforcement Agent position. Even so, fiscal years  2015 through 2017, attrition rates for these positions have generally  remained lower than those of the Secret Service and the Bureau of  Prisons.", "In addition, from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, CBP\u2019s ability to hire  more law enforcement officers than it lost varied across positions.  Specifically, CBP consistently hired more CBP officers and Aviation  Enforcement Agents than it lost. Further, while CBP generally maintained  its staffing levels for Marine Interdiction Agents, the agency consistently  lost more Border Patrol agents and Air Interdiction Agents than it hired.  Even so, onboard staffing levels for all five of CBP\u2019s law enforcement  officer positions have consistently remained below authorized staffing  levels.", "CBP has acknowledged that improving its retention of qualified law  enforcement personnel is critical in addressing staffing shortfalls, but CBP  officials identified difficulties in retaining key law enforcement staff as a  result of geographically-remote and hard-to-fill duty locations. CBP  officials across all three operational components cited location\u2014and  specifically employees\u2019 inability to relocate to posts in more desirable  locations\u2014as a primary challenge facing the agency in retaining qualified  personnel.", "Border Patrol officials explained that duty stations in certain remote  locations present retention challenges due to quality-of-life factors. For  example, the officials told us that agents may not want to live with their  families in an area without a hospital, with low-performing schools, or with  relatively long commutes from their homes to their duty station. Border  Patrol\u2019s difficulty in retaining law enforcement staff in such locations is  exacerbated by competition with other federal, state, and local law  enforcement organizations for qualified personnel. According to Border  Patrol officials, other agencies are often able to offer more desirable duty  locations\u2014such as major cities\u2014and, in some cases, higher  compensation.", "CBP data indicate that Border Patrol agents consistently leave the  component for employment with other law enforcement agencies,  including OFO as well as other DHS components such as ICE. For  example, while retirements accounted for more than half of annual CBP  officer losses from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, they accounted for  less than a quarter of annual Border Patrol agent losses, indicating that  the majority of these agents are not retiring but are generally leaving to  pursue other employment. Further, according to CBP data, the number of  Border Patrol agents departing for employment at other federal agencies  increased steadily, from 75 agents in fiscal year 2013 to 348 agents in  fiscal year 2017\u2014or nearly 40 percent of all Border Patrol agent losses in  that fiscal year. Border Patrol officials told us, for example, that working a  standard day shift at ICE in a controlled indoor environment located in a  major metropolitan area for similar or even lower salaries presents an  attractive career alternative for Border Patrol agents who often work night  shifts in extreme weather in geographically remote locations. The  President of the National Border Patrol Council also cited this challenge,  stating that unless Border Patrol agents have a strong incentive to remain  in remote, undesirable locations\u2014such as higher compensation when  compared with other law enforcement agencies\u2014they are likely to leave  the agency for similar positions located in more desirable locations.", "While OFO officials told us the component did not face an across-the- board challenge in retaining CBP officers, they have had difficulty  retaining officers in certain hard-to-fill locations that may be  geographically remote or unattractive for families, such as Nogales,  Arizona, and San Ysidro, California. As a result, CBP officer staffing  levels in these locations have consistently remained below authorized  targets.", "AMO has also had difficulty retaining its law enforcement personnel\u2014and  particularly its Air Interdiction Agent staff\u2014in hard-to-fill locations, such as  Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, and Laredo, Texas. However, given the unique  qualifications and competencies required for the Air Interdiction Agent  position, AMO does not compete with other law enforcement  organizations. Instead, AMO officials told us they compete with the  commercial airline industry for qualified pilots. Specifically, they stated  that this competition is exacerbated by a nationwide shortage of pilots. In  addition, AMO officials explained that there is a perception among  applicants that commercial airlines are able to offer pilots more desirable  locations and higher compensation. However, they told us that AMO  generally provided pilots with higher starting salaries than many regional  airlines as well as most career options available to helicopter pilots."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Taken Steps to Address Retention Challenges", "paragraphs": ["All three CBP operational components have taken steps to retain qualified  law enforcement personnel by offering opportunities for employees to  relocate to more desirable locations and pursuing the use of financial  incentives, special salary rates, and other payments and allowances.", "Relocation opportunities. Border Patrol, OFO, and AMO have formal  programs that provide law enforcement officers with opportunities to  relocate. For example, in fiscal year 2017, Border Patrol implemented its  Operational Mobility Program and received initial funding to relocate  about 500 Border Patrol agents to new locations based on the  component\u2019s staffing needs. According to Border Patrol officials, retaining  current employees is a top focus for leadership at the component and this  program provides Border Patrol agents with opportunities for a paid  relocation to a more desirable location at a lower cost to CBP than an  official permanent change of station transfer. As of April 2018, Border  Patrol officials told us that 322 Border Patrol agents had accepted  reassignment opportunities through the program and the component  hoped to continue receiving funding to provide these opportunities.", "Financial Incentives and Other Payments and Allowances. CBP\u2019s  three operational components have also taken steps to supplement  employees\u2019 salaries through the use of human capital flexibilities\u2014such  as retention and relocation incentives and special salary rates\u2014as well as  other payments and allowances. CBP\u2019s goal in pursuing these human  capital flexibilities is to retain current employees\u2014especially in remote or  hard-to-fill locations\u2014who are likely to internally relocate within CBP to  more desirable duty locations or depart the agency for similar positions at  other law enforcement organizations or commercial airlines.", "However, we found that from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, CBP\u2019s use  of such financial incentives and other payments was limited, as the  agency paid a total of four retention incentives and 13 relocation  incentives, and implemented one special salary rate for all positions  during this 5-year period. From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, Border  Patrol did not offer retention incentives to agents and paid two relocation  incentives to transfer Border Patrol agents to Artesia, New Mexico, and  Washington, D.C., at a cost of roughly $78,000. However, in fiscal year  2018, Border Patrol increased its use of relocation incentives to facilitate  the transfer of agents to duty stations along the southwest border that are  less desirable due to the remoteness of the location and lack of basic  amenities and infrastructure. Specifically, as of April 2018, 67 Border  Patrol agents had received such incentives to relocate to duty stations in  Ajo, Arizona; Calexico, California; and Big Bend, Texas; among others.", "While Border Patrol did not offer retention incentives during our review  period, it submitted a formal request to CBP leadership in February 2018  for a 10 percent across-the-board retention incentive for all Border Patrol  agents at the GS-13 level and below, which represents the majority of the  component\u2019s frontline workforce. According to Border Patrol  documentation, these incentives, if implemented, could help reduce  Border Patrol\u2019s attrition rate\u2014which has consistently outpaced its hiring  rate\u2014by helping retain agents who may have otherwise left Border Patrol  for similar positions in OFO, ICE, or other law enforcement agencies.  According to CBP officials, as of April 2018, CBP leadership was  evaluating Border Patrol\u2019s group retention incentive request, including the  costs associated with implementing this 10 percent across-the-board  incentive. In addition, as the incentive would benefit Border Patrol agents  in all of the component\u2019s duty locations, the extent to which this effort  would be effective in targeting agent attrition in the remote locations that  represent CBP\u2019s largest staffing challenges remains to be seen. Border  Patrol approved the 10 percent retention incentive and is awaiting funding  for implementation, according to officials.", "From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, OFO paid a total of four retention  incentives at a cost of $149,000 to retain CBP officers in Tucson, Arizona;  Detroit, Michigan; Carbury, North Dakota; and Laredo, Texas. Further,  OFO paid seven relocation incentives at a cost of approximately  $160,000 to relocate personnel to the hard-to-fill ports of Alcan and  Nome, Alaska; Coburn Grove, Maine; and Detroit, Michigan. One OFO  official told us OFO did not regularly use these incentives because its  relatively low annual attrition rates make it difficult to propose a  persuasive business case to CBP leadership that such incentives are  necessary. Further, another OFO official explained that OFO\u2019s strategy is  focused on using recruitment incentives to staff hard-to-fill locations with  new employees.", "From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, AMO did not offer retention  incentives to law enforcement personnel and paid a total of four relocation  incentives to transfer three Air Interdiction Agents and one Marine  Interdiction Agent to Puerto Rico at a cost of approximately $84,000.

Taking steps to ensure  that the agency\u2019s operational components are systematically collecting  and analyzing complete and accurate information on all departing law  enforcement officers\u2014including the factors that influenced their decision  to separate\u2014would better position CBP to understand its retention  challenges and take appropriate action to address them. We  recommended that CBP should ensure that its operational components  systematically collect and analyze data on departing law enforcement  officers and use this information to inform retention efforts. CBP agreed  with the recommendation. CBP officials reported in February 2019 that  they developed and implemented a CBP-wide exit survey in August 2018  and have taken steps to promote the survey and encourage exiting CBP  employees to fill it out. The officials also noted that they plan to analyze  the survey results on a quarterly basis starting in April 2019. These  actions, if fully implemented, should address the intent of our  recommendation.", "Chairwoman Torres Small, Ranking Member Crenshaw, and Members of  the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
