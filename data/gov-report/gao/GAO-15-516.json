With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.", "This report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.", "GAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["More than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.", "In 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.", "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.", "Research suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the federal government has provided funding for various  federal programs designed to provide assistance to people who are  unable to meet their basic needs. Many of these programs offer various  forms of assistance such as cash aid, food, shelter, and health care for  those who have limited means or are vulnerable or disadvantaged in  other ways, such as at-risk children or youth or older individuals in need  of home support services. Other programs are designed to help low- income people move toward self-sufficiency through education, training,  and employment services. From 2007 through 2014, federal spending for  some of the larger low-income programs increased by about 60 percent,  according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in part due to the  recent economic downturn and its aftermath.", "Each year, the Census Bureau (Census) publishes the official (or federal)  poverty measure\u2014developed in the early 1960s\u2014which is often used as  a basis for describing people\u2019s level of financial need. For some low- income programs, it is the starting point for determining financial eligibility  for assistance. For the past 4 years, Census has also published the  Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which it recently developed with  support from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor.  This measure takes into account more information on people\u2019s resources  and living expenses than the official measure.", "Given fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the increased  demands placed on low-income assistance programs, we were asked to  examine current federal low-income programs and provide descriptive  information on the recipients of low-income programs, including on their  incomes as a percentage of poverty. Compared with the official poverty  measure, the SPM provides more information on people\u2019s economic well- being, such as by taking into account assistance from more federal low- income programs.", "Our report examines the following questions:  1.  What federal programs (including tax expenditures) are targeted to  low-income individuals?  2.  What are the number and selected household characteristics of  people in poverty based on the SPM?  3.  What are the number, incomes (as a percent of the SPM), and  household characteristics of people receiving benefits from selected  programs?  4.  What is known about how selected low-income programs affect  incentives to work?", "To address our first question, we identified federal programs, including  tax expenditures (that is, provisions of the federal tax code, such as  special credits or deductions that reduce a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability), that (1)  used a measure of low or limited income to determine eligibility, priority  for assistance, or to target resources; or (2) have target populations that  are disproportionately poor or have program purposes that presume that  participants will be low-income. We included programs that targeted  individuals, families, and communities. Due to their relatively small size,  we excluded programs totaling less than $100 million in federal  obligations or reduced tax revenue in fiscal year 2013. To compile this  list, we built upon a list maintained by the Congressional Research  Service (CRS), which also developed the selection criteria, by adding  relevant tax expenditures and asking relevant agencies to suggest  program additions or deletions consistent with the criteria. We then  collected information on each program, such as obligation amounts,  number of participants, types of services, and income eligibility  requirements, using a survey to the federal agencies that administer  these programs. To address our second question, we used Census\u2019  2013 (calendar year) Current Population Survey (CPS) data to examine  household incomes as a percentage of the SPM poverty threshold. We  categorized households into six mutually exclusive groups: those headed  by an elderly member, those headed by a member with a disability,  childless households, married households with children, cohabiting  households with children, and single parent households. To address our  third question, we described the recipients of eight selected programs,  including their incomes as a percentage of the SPM poverty threshold,  benefit amounts, and household types in 2012 (calendar year), the most  recent year available. We obtained this information from the Transfer  Income Model, version 3 (TRIM3), a microsimulation model that adjusts  for substantial underreporting of program participation in the CPS data  using information from each program on caseloads, benefit amounts,  eligibility rules and interactions with other programs. TRIM3 is developed  and maintained by staff at the Urban Institute with funding primarily from  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the  Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Programs we selected  were generally large federal low-income programs that serve a range of  basic needs and were available in TRIM3 data. These were: Additional  Child Tax Credit (ACTC); Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); housing  assistance; Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP);  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); Special  Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC);  Supplemental Security Income (SSI); and Temporary Assistance for  Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance. TRIM3 did not have 2012 data  on recipients of Medicaid, the largest low-income program. To assess  the reliability and appropriateness of the data we used, we interviewed  Census and Urban Institute experts on the relevant data, examined  Census and Urban Institute documentation, and reviewed the analytical  approach underlying the TRIM3 data. We determined that the data were  appropriate and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.  Additionally, when we present estimates from survey data, we also  present the applicable margins of error. To address our fourth question,  we conducted an economic literature review on whether receipt of  assistance from selected programs affects recipients\u2019 incentive to work.", "We conducted a literature search of relevant studies published within  recent years (2009 through 2014) and also reviewed some studies that  were published earlier. This literature review included peer-reviewed  journal articles, agency documents, and other research determined to be  methodologically rigorous and reliable. For more information on our scope  and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The various  programs we discuss were created at different times, to serve different  populations, and in response to different policy issues (see box on next  page). Programs also vary greatly in terms of how they are structured and  funded. In addition, programs are administered through a varying  combination of federal, state, and local agencies, and sometimes private  organizations. Some programs require state or local agencies to  contribute a share of nonfederal funds, while others are entirely federally- funded. Federal funding structures for low-income programs also vary.  For instance, programs may be funded through program authorization  acts (mandatory spending) or through appropriations acts (discretionary  spending). Spending for these programs may be indefinite (in that there is  no pre-determined ceiling and federal payments will be made for all  eligible recipients for eligible expenses) or definite (in that the law limits  the amount of federal spending). Tax expenditures\u2014such as tax credits,  deductions, or exclusions\u2014are generally measured as the estimated  reduction in tax revenue and are generally considered separately from  other federal spending, with the exception of some refundable tax credits  in which credit in excess of tax liability results in a cash refund.", "Examples of Low-Income Programs Established over Time  1930s- Great Depression and the New Deal: Major social insurance programs  (not discussed in this report) were created to protect workers against old age and  unemployment. Assisted housing programs, such as public housing, also started  during this time.   1960s- The War on Poverty: Various programs were created aimed at educating  low-income children, youth, and adults to help address the causes of poverty (e.g.,  Head Start, Job Corps, aid to help low-income students in elementary and  secondary schools). The Food Stamp Program (now known as the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)), which had been a pilot program, was made  permanent. Medicare (another social insurance program) and Medicaid were also  established.   1970s- Welfare reform proposed, EITC created: Due to rising caseloads of  recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), which provided  cash assistance to low-income families, reform was proposed, but did not occur.  However, major changes to other programs occurred. Aid to low-income  individuals who were aged, blind, or had a disability evolved into a federally-run  program: Supplemental Security Income. Section 8 rental housing assistance was  established, as was the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).   1980s- Tax reform and promotion of work: EITC and Medicaid were expanded.  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed federal income taxes for many of the  working poor, and the Family Support Act of 1988 was passed to encourage work  among AFDC recipients.  1990s- Decentralization and welfare reform: AFDC was replaced with  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a block grant to states that  emphasizes work and time-limited cash assistance and gives states wide  discretion on how to use TANF funds, including for various noncash services.  2000s- Great Recession, federal stimulus, healthcare reform: In response to  the recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded  federal spending for low-income aid, particularly for SNAP and Medicaid. The  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility (although  a Supreme Court decision subsequently made Medicaid expansion an option for  states) as well as established new refundable tax credits for lower-income  households to subsidize their purchase of private health insurance on health  insurance exchanges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poverty Measurement", "paragraphs": ["The official measure used today to provide information on how many  people are \u201cin poverty\u201d in the United States was developed in the 1960s,  based on the cost of food at that time. The official poverty thresholds\u2014 the income thresholds by which households are considered to be in  poverty depending on their size\u2014are updated annually by Census to  reflect current prices. HHS uses the official poverty thresholds to update  the \u201cfederal poverty guidelines\u201d each year, which are the basis for  determining financial eligibility or funding distribution for certain low- income programs.", "The official poverty measure has not changed substantially since it was  developed, and concerns about its inadequacies resulted in efforts to  develop a new measure starting in 1990. For instance, the threshold for  the official poverty measure (the income level that is used to determine  who is \u201cin poverty\u201d each year) is based on three times the cost of food  and does not take into account the cost of other basic necessities, such  as shelter and utilities. Additionally, in determining a household\u2019s income,  the official measure considers cash income, but does not include  additions to income based on the value of noncash assistance (e.g., food  assistance) or reductions based on other necessary living expenses (e.g.,  medical expenses or taxes paid). A panel on poverty was established by  the National Academy of Sciences and, later, an interagency technical  working group suggested ways a new poverty measure could address  some of these concerns. Based on these suggestions, Census, with  support from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, developed the SPM in 2010.", "Each year since, Census has released annual poverty statistics on the  SPM along with the official measure. The SPM did not replace the official  measure, which is still used for determining federal poverty guidelines  that could affect eligibility for some programs. Instead, the SPM is   primarily used as a research measure, designed to provide information on  economic need at the aggregate level, nationally or within subpopulations  or areas.", "The SPM differs from the official measure in various ways. In defining a  family unit that shares resources, in addition to related individuals, the  SPM household includes unrelated children cared for by the family (such  as foster care children) and cohabiting unmarried partners (see table  1).The SPM also defines the threshold of need differently from the official  measure.", "Also, in determining if a family has sufficient resources to meet necessary  living expenses, it looks more holistically at a family\u2019s resources and  expenses (see fig. 1).

In total,  these four programs comprised almost two-thirds (65 percent) of federal  low-income obligations in fiscal year 2013 or about $480 billion. For some  programs, states or other entities also contribute funding, which means  billions more in nonfederal funds are spent on such programs. For  example, state expenditures for Medicaid were $194 billion in fiscal year  2013, accounting for around 40 percent of total Medicaid expenditures.  For TANF, state expenditures totaled almost $15 billion in fiscal year  2013, accounting for about 47 percent of total expenditures for the  program.", "Social insurance programs, including Social Security Old-Age and  Survivors Insurance (Social Security) and Medicare, are not included in  the programs we reviewed because they are not targeted solely to those  with low-income. These programs are generally financed by  contributions from workers and employers, and eligibility for benefits is  determined, at least in part, on the basis of an individual\u2019s work history.  These programs are intended to more universally protect workers from  lost wages and related benefits due to retirement, disability, or a  temporary period of unemployment. Some of these programs are very  large.

These selected tax expenditures  directly or indirectly serve low-income people.

Programs may target multiple groups,  according to our survey. For example, the Child and Adult Care Food  Program supports the provision of free or reduced-priced meals and  snacks to low-income children and low-income chronically impaired and  elderly adults, who are in nonresidential group care settings, such as day  care homes or institutions. In addition, a number of low-income programs  target narrower population groups, based on agency survey responses,  such as veterans, disadvantaged youth, people who are homeless, Native  Americans, migrants, refugees, or rural communities. These tend to be  smaller programs in terms of dollars, according to our survey.

Additionally, a recent CRS report examined  spending amounts for the 10 largest low-income programs in fiscal year  2011 (the most recent available information at the time for analysis on  target groups). CRS reported that federal spending for these 10 in 2011  was $623 billion and accounted for over 80 percent of spending for low- income programs that year. According to CRS analysis, which estimated  spending across target groups primarily using program data, people with  disabilities received almost a third of this amount, or $208 billion (primarily  from Medicaid and SSI). Working families with children received the  next largest share, about $170 billion, with the refundable tax credits  accounting for a large portion. The elderly received $96 billion, with a  large contribution from Medicaid and the low-income Medicare subsidy for  prescription drugs.

For example, in general, individuals receiving SSI  in 2013 had to have monthly incomes no higher than $1,505 if their  countable income was only from wages, and $730 if their countable  income was not from wages. The two refundable tax credits are  based, in part, on earned income and adjusted gross income. For  example, in tax year 2013 working families with children that had  annual incomes below $37,870 to $51,567\u2014depending on filing  status and the number of dependent children\u2014may have been eligible  for the EITC.

One is the decision on whether or not to work, called the labor  force participation decision. The second, which applies to those who have  decided to work, is on the number of hours to work. For many people, the  decision on whether to work depends on the incomes available under  each alternative, including income or assistance from means-tested  benefits. The decision of how many hours to work may be influenced by  the extent to which an increase in earnings (through more hours worked  or a higher wage) is offset by higher taxes and reduced benefits. Whether  moving from not working to working or from fewer to more hours worked,  the combined effect of taxes and the reduction in means-tested benefits  as earnings increase is called the worker\u2019s effective marginal tax rate,  referred to as the marginal tax rate in this report.", "A Hypothetical Example of How Marginal  Tax Rates Can Reduce Benefits When  Earnings Increase   If a single parent with three children living in  Wisconsin in 2000 who was earning $6.25 an  hour received a raise to $9.25 an hour, based  on 2,000 hours of work a year, her earnings  would increase by $6,000. If she received  SNAP benefits, those benefits would be  reduced by $81 a month due to her earnings  increase. If she received housing assistance,  this assistance would be reduced by $177 a  month. She would also owe an extra $38 a  month in payroll taxes and if she worked full- time for the year, lose $1,848 (or $154 a  month) due to reduced EITC benefits. As a  result, out of her $500 a month raise, she  would keep $50--a nearly 90 percent marginal  tax rate on the earnings gain. If her earnings  continue to rise, her marginal tax rates will fall  greatly, as SNAP and EITC benefits will  phase out entirely. With no remaining benefits  to reduce, her marginal tax rate will depend  solely on income and payroll taxes. earnings, these programs\u2019 benefits made work more financially rewarding  (in terms of earnings plus benefits), in comparison to the benefits  available to those who do not work.

(The average marginal tax rate among states was about 50  percent.) That is, if the parent lived in Nevada, he or she would lose 27  cents of each dollar in increased earnings; if he or she lived in  Connecticut, the parent would actually have fewer total resources for  each dollar in increased earnings due to the loss of benefits.

Ideally, an analysis should consider all the programs  in which an individual participates. A 2011 review of research found that  the aggregate behavioral impact on people\u2019s incentive to work from  multiple means-tested programs was very small.

Hungerford and R. Thiess,  The Earned Income Tax Credit. studies we reviewed, though for some groups the effects may be large.  Changes in marginal tax rates associated with reduction in TANF benefits  based on increased earnings were found to have little effect on either  labor force participation or hours of work, according to studies we  reviewed. On the other hand, receipt of housing assistance may create  work disincentives, although available research is limited. One study  looking at the Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers program found that,  based on a sample of program participants and nonparticipants in  Chicago, the program had a negative effect on labor force participation  and earnings (possibly due to reduction in hours worked for some  recipients), but a positive effect on supporting incomes. In other words,  people may work more without a housing benefit but their overall incomes  are higher with the benefit. Another study of recipients in Wisconsin found  that housing vouchers had little effect on labor force participation and a  negative effect on earnings, which faded over time. Medicaid could also  create work disincentives, since a modest pay increase could result in a  total loss of benefits for those near the program\u2019s income threshold.However, other programs or policies could offset potential work  disincentives. For example, an increase in earnings in a new job may also  be accompanied by employer-provided group health insurance, and  children may lose eligibility for Medicaid but gain eligibility under CHIP.  As noted, we did not review the literature on work incentives related to  health insurance programs. In addition, although, we did not review the  literature on the effect of child care subsidies on work incentives for this  report, we have looked at this in prior work. Specifically, in a 2010 report,  we found that research has linked access to child care subsidies to  increases in the likelihood of low-income mothers\u2019 employment. In that  report, experts we consulted suggested that when child care prices  increase (such as when a parent loses a child care subsidy), mothers  may change their work hours or shift to lower-cost providers, for example,  rather than exiting the labor force altogether, although other research has  shown that child care problems contribute to job loss and returns to  welfare for low-wage workers.", "While high marginal tax rates occur, people may not respond to them for  various reasons. For instance, for a worker to change behavior, he or she  must be aware of the marginal tax rates and the income levels at which  they apply. However, these rates can be difficult for the lay person to  understand and calculate, especially when multiple programs and tax  provisions are involved. As discussed, high marginal tax rates are the  result of interactions among programs and the tax system and vary  greatly depending on the specific benefit or combination of benefits  received, individual situation, and state of residence. These interactions  are not transparent. Studies that have focused on interviews with low- income households indicate they often do not understand marginal tax  rates associated with increased earnings or how these may affect their  benefits. This may be particularly relevant with the EITC because of a  long time lag between a change in work and the receipt of the tax refund  at tax time. Additionally, a worker is not necessarily able to control the  number of hours he or she works in response to different marginal tax  rates, given constraints in work schedules or other factors such as child  care. Research indicates that low-wage workers have less discretion  and control over their work schedules than higher-wage workers, and that  this is particularly true for those working part-time or in temporary  positions.", "Further, reacting to high marginal tax rates that apply over narrow income  ranges would not necessarily make sense for a worker over the long  term. If a worker expects to have continual pay increases over his or her  lifetime he or she would not necessarily decide to reduce his or her work  hours because of high marginal tax rates that would attenuate as  earnings grew beyond the effective income range of those rates.", "Behavioral effects can be difficult to isolate from other factors, and not all  effects are observable. For example, not all labor supply behavior can be  found in data. A worker who knowingly faces a high marginal tax rate for  additional hours may seek earnings in the underground economy.  Additionally, program provisions are not the only factors that may affect  labor supply. The overall state of the labor market is central, in terms of  the availability of employment opportunities and pay.", "Research also shows that inherent policy trade-offs exist for means- tested benefit programs attempting to meet multiple objectives. Work  incentives and disincentives in means-tested benefit programs are  intrinsically linked. When benefits are available to those who work or  when benefits are tied to work (such as with the EITC), working becomes  more attractive as people\u2019s total incomes in benefits and earnings are  higher than they would be without work. However, benefits are reduced  and ultimately phased out as earnings rise, creating potential work  disincentives. To lessen the role of work disincentives and avoid abrupt  benefit cutoffs (known as cliff effects), benefits can be phased out more  slowly (i.e., resulting in lower marginal tax rates). Yet a slower phase-out  of benefits means increased program costs. Program costs could be  contained if benefits are reduced for those with the lowest income;  however, another common policy goal is to maintain adequate assistance  for the least fortunate. In short, research shows that to limit program  costs, it is necessary to either reduce benefits (by reducing the number of  people eligible or the benefit amount) or phase benefits out more rapidly.

Specifically, HUD noted  that readers may interpret information we presented on program  recipients\u2019 incomes as a percentage of the SPM as evidence that  programs are not targeting people in need, when, as we describe in the  report, these income levels include the value of certain federal, state, and  local assistance that a household receives, as well as account for various  household expenses. As we explain in the report, the SPM provides  information on a household\u2019s resources\u2014including assistance from  certain government programs\u2014to meet basic needs, and is not a  measure used to determine program eligibility. HUD also noted  differences in terms of recipient household types between our estimates  of housing assistance using TRIM3 and HUD\u2019s estimates using HUD  program data, due to the fact that TRIM3 estimates can include recipients  of housing assistance from other federal, state or local agencies. Based  on HUD\u2019s comments, we took steps to clarify the information we present  on our estimates of program recipients\u2019 incomes as a percentage of the  SPM and on our estimates of recipients of housing assistance using  TRIM3, and addressed other comments from HUD, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

To  address the objectives of this request, we used a variety of methods.  Specifically, we:  reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance;  and interviewed agency officials;  collected information on 82 federal low-income programs by surveying  13 federal agencies that administer these programs; analyzed 2013 data from Census Bureau\u2019s (Census) Current  Population Survey (CPS) to describe low-income households; analyzed 2012 data, the most recent available, from the Transfer  Income Model, version 3 (TRIM3) microsimulation model maintained  by the Urban Institute to describe recipients of eight large federal low- income programs; and  conducted an economic literature review on work incentives and  disincentives related to assistance from selected federal low-income  programs.", "We conducted our work between April 2014 and July 2015 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

This included  programs that targeted individuals, families, and communities. Due to  their small size, we excluded programs less than $100 million in federal  obligations or reduced tax revenue in fiscal year 2013. These criteria  were developed by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), which  has maintained a list of low-income programs for many years. To  identify programs in its current list, CRS officials told us that they took  various steps, including searching the Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance for relevant programs. We augmented CRS\u2019s list by asking  relevant agencies to suggest program additions or deletions consistent  with the criteria, consulting with CRS and program area experts within  GAO, and adding relevant tax expenditures. We consulted with internal  subject matter experts and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to  identify relevant tax expenditures. We included tax expenditures that base  an individual\u2019s eligibility on a measure of low or limited income, or that  indirectly benefit low-income individuals (for example, the Low-Income  Housing Tax Credit, which allows developers and owners of qualified low- income housing projects to claim a tax credit for construction or  rehabilitation costs). We excluded tax expenditures which indirectly  benefit low-income individuals based on income measures for a  geographic area. We also excluded tax expenditures for which the  average reduction in revenue for the past 5 years was less than $100  million.", "To collect program information, we sent a questionnaire (or survey) on  each program to the federal agencies responsible for administering it that  included questions on federal obligations, numbers served, the program  purpose, type of benefit or service, eligibility requirements, and other  topics. To ensure that questions were understandable and that we  collected the desired information, we pre-tested the survey with two  federal agencies, and asked a third agency to review it. We revised it  based on agencies\u2019 feedback. We sent the survey to agencies in  September 2014 and, ultimately, obtained a 100 percent response rate.  We did not independently verify the legal accuracy of the information  provided by the agencies, such as program purposes, eligibility  requirements, or benefits or services provided.", "Because this was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors. To  minimize other types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors, and to enhance data quality, we employed recognized survey  design practices in the development of the questionnaire and in the  collection, processing, and analysis of the survey data. For instance, as  previously mentioned, we pretested the questionnaire with federal officials  to minimize errors arising from differences in how questions might be  interpreted and to improve the likelihood that variation in responses  across agencies are attributable to substantive differences between  programs rather than aspects of the data collection process. We further  reviewed the survey to ensure the ordering of survey sections was  appropriate and that the questions within each section were clearly stated  and easy to comprehend. To reduce nonresponse, another source of  nonsampling error, we sent out e-mail reminder messages to encourage  officials to complete the survey. We reviewed the data for missing or  ambiguous responses and followed up with agency officials when  necessary to clarify their responses. In some cases, we also checked  other sources, such as the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Appendix,  Budget for the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2015, to confirm information  was generally consistent and reliable. On the basis of our application of  recognized survey design practices and follow-up procedures, we  determined that the data were of sufficient quality for our purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number and Household Characteristics of People in Poverty", "paragraphs": ["To answer our second question, we analyzed data from the Census\u2019  Current Population Survey (CPS) for 2013 (calendar year), the most  recent year available. Specifically, we used the public use and replicate  weight files from the March 2014 CPS Annual Social and Economic  Supplement, which covers 2013, to obtain demographic information about  respondents and their households and calculate standard errors of our  estimates. We merged this information with the Census\u2019 SPM  Research Data file for 2013, which contains microdata derived from the  CPS that allows users to calculate SPM rates. Because the CPS uses  a household-based data collection, its data do not include individuals  living outside of a household residence, such as homeless people or  those living in institutional group quarters (e.g., correctional facilities,  nursing homes). As many individuals in these groups may be low-income,  estimates of the size of the low-income population in this report are likely  to be undercounts of the low-income population in the United States.", "To determine the number of people in poverty according to the SPM, we  first calculated each household\u2019s income as a percent of the relevant  SPM poverty threshold. To define a household, we followed the Census  definition of an \u201cSPM Resource Unit,\u201d which includes related individuals  living together, plus unrelated children who are living with the family (such  as foster children) and any cohabitors (i.e., unmarried partners) and their  children. An SPM unit could consist of a single individual. Census defines  a household\u2019s SPM resources\u2014which we call its income\u2014to include its  cash income plus the value of certain noncash benefits minus estimated  expenses related to work, child support, taxes, and medical care. Each  household\u2019s SPM threshold represents the amount of income it should  have available to sufficiently pay for food, housing, clothing, and utilities,  plus 20 percent more for miscellaneous necessary expenses. The Bureau  of Labor Statistics derives SPM thresholds from actual expenditures on  these items averaged over the previous five years. Thresholds are set at  the amount that approximately two-thirds of households spent or  exceeded and vary by household size, homeownership, and geographic  location.", "To describe the number of people with household incomes above and  below the SPM poverty threshold, we categorized individuals into five  income groups based on their household\u2019s income as a percent of its  SPM threshold: household resources less than 50 percent of its SPM threshold; household resources from 50 percent to less than 100 percent of its household resources from 100 percent to less than 150 percent of its household resources from 150 percent to less than 200 percent of its household resources 200 percent of its SPM threshold or greater.", "The first two income groups are considered to be in poverty according to  the SPM, and the latter three groups are considered to be above the  poverty line.", "We calculated each individual\u2019s income group according to the official  poverty measure in a similar fashion, except that we used their family  income rather than their SPM unit income. Census\u2019 official poverty  statistics use the family\u2014defined as related individuals living together\u2014 as the unit of measurement and do not include children under the age of  15 who are living with nonrelatives, such as foster children. We also  followed Census procedures to define family income to include its cash  income only, and we used official poverty thresholds, which vary by size  of family and age of family members, but not by geographic location or  homeownership.", "For this analysis, we categorized households into six mutually-exclusive  types, as follows:", "Headed by elderly persons: Households (with or without children)  headed by a person who is 65 or over, regardless of whether he or  she has a disability.

The TRIM3 model simulates major  governmental tax, transfer, and health programs using data from the  CPS, which contains detailed information on the demographic  characteristics and economic circumstances of U.S. households,  including their benefits from many federal programs. However, CPS data  substantially underreports the receipt of these benefits. For example,  Urban Institute staff found that CPS data captured about 61 percent of  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits received in  2012 and about 57 percent of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  (SNAP) benefits, when comparing CPS data with program administrative  data (data collected by agencies used to administer the program).

We selected these programs because they are financially large  programs, meet basic needs through different types of assistance, and  vary in how benefits are administered. We focused on impact  evaluations conducted or sponsored by the respective agencies,  published in 2010 or later, that were related to participant outcomes  (excluding, for example, those related to program processes, operations,  or integrity). In addition to evaluations, we looked at other recent  research conducted or sponsored by the respective agencies that  provided information on program participants. For each program, we also  looked at performance measures, focusing on those related to participant  outcomes. In addition, we reviewed agency information available online  (e.g., evaluations, research, and annual performance reports) and  conducted semi-structured interviews with knowledgeable agency  officials. Federal administering agencies are: the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) for EITC, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) for Section 8 Vouchers, the Department of  Agriculture (USDA) for SNAP, Social Security Administration (SSA) for  SSI, and Department of Health of Human Services (HHS) for TANF."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["Four of the five agencies conducted or sponsored recent evaluations  related to participant outcomes for their respective selected programs.

Unlike the four spending  programs we examined, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) does  not conduct program evaluations related to program outcomes on the  EITC or any other tax expenditure. In our prior work, we have  recommended that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) set up a  performance evaluation framework for tax expenditures, which represent  a substantial federal commitment. However, Treasury staff are aware  of and contribute to the academic research on participant outcomes  related to the EITC, such as on work, poverty, and household income.", "Agencies administering Section 8 Vouchers, SNAP, SSI and TANF  generally did not evaluate their respective programs as a whole, with the  exception of USDA\u2019s evaluation of SNAP\u2019s effect on food security and  food spending. Instead, these agencies typically evaluated different  practices within the program, often experimenting with new and  innovative practices. For example, the SNAP Healthy Incentives Pilot  Evaluation was aimed at testing new types of financial incentives  designed to make fruits and vegetables more affordable for SNAP  participants. Another example is TANF\u2019s Pathways to Advance Career  Education evaluation, which is currently testing promising strategies for  increasing employment and self-sufficiency among low-income families.  Many evaluations across the four programs were also conducted to study  the effects of the program on particular sub-populations of participants.  For example, SSA\u2019s Youth Transition Demonstration tested strategies  designed to help youth with disabilities who were receiving SSI to  transition to economic self-sufficiency as adults, while USDA had  evaluations looking at food security among the elderly and working poor  populations.", "For each of the four programs, the agencies conducted evaluations for a  variety of reasons. Some of the programs\u2019 evaluations were required by  law. For example, HUD was required by law to conduct the Moving to  Opportunity for Fair Housing demonstration program evaluation, which  presented the long-term impacts of moving people, including Section 8  Voucher recipients, from high-poverty neighborhoods in large inner cities   Other evaluations we reviewed were  to lower-poverty neighborhoods.determined by the agencies, often in line with a larger evaluation plan or  strategy aimed at supporting certain agency goals, according to officials  from the HHS, USDA, and HUD. For example, USDA\u2019s evaluations on  education programs to promote healthier eating for low-income children,  women, and seniors was based on USDA\u2019s goals, according to officials.", "Officials told us findings from evaluations have helped inform program  design and administration at the federal and state level. For example,  based on findings from the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency  Evaluations, SSA officials said the agency changed the program\u2019s design  to incentivize service providers to serve disability beneficiaries who are  more difficult to employ. Agency officials told us they frequently share  findings and best practices with state agencies administering the  programs to inform their program or policy decisions. For example, USDA  officials stated that the SNAP Education and Evaluation studies have  helped several states develop their own SNAP education programs.  Agencies disseminated findings to administrators and other interested  parties through various channels, including research clearinghouses,  journals, conferences, and agency websites. Officials from these four  agencies told us that evaluation findings also helped them determine  financial decisions, such as resource allocation, or to provide support for  budget requests to Congress.", "Agencies faced a number of challenges with regards to their evaluation  efforts, including financial, methodological, and administrative limitations.  Agency officials informed us that large-scale, multi-year evaluations are  resource intensive, and limited or short-term funding can make it difficult  to perform these evaluations, particularly for program wide research.  Officials from USDA informed us that it is helpful when money is  designated by law for specific evaluations, as was the case with the  Healthy Incentives Pilot, which was designated funding in the Food,  Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill). According to  officials, methodological challenges can also limit their evaluation efforts.  For example, SNAP and SSI benefits generally must be provided to  eligible applicants, which makes it difficult to establish a control group.  Under TANF, states generally design and administer their own programs,  making it difficult to assess the program more broadly. Furthermore, HHS  officials informed us that state and local TANF administrators are not  required to participate in evaluations. Therefore, it can be difficult to  persuade them to participate because of the burden of additional work  and costs that evaluations may create for them. We recently found that  the structure of TANF can present challenges for HHS to conduct  evaluations and how this may leave TANF recipients without access to  promising approaches for employment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Related Research", "paragraphs": ["Agencies administering SNAP, SSI, TANF, and Section 8 Vouchers also  sponsored other recent research\u2014that were not impact evaluation  studies\u2014that informed their understanding of program participants,  including when participants receive benefits from other similar programs.
