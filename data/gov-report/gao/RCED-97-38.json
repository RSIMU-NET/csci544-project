The analyses are expected to conform to guidelines developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and EPA to implement executive orders requiring them. Generally, the guidelines describe the major components that should be contained in the analyses, such as a statement of the need for a regulation and a description and estimation of the benefits and costs for regulatory alternatives, including the results of sensitivity analyses to characterize the effects of uncertainties. The guidelines allow EPA considerable flexibility in preparing RIAs. Specifically, the guidelines stipulate that the scope and precision of analysis depend on the quality of underlying data, the scientific understanding of the problems to be addressed through regulation, resource constraints at EPA, and the specific requirements of the authorizing legislation. The guidelines also recommend that the scope and precision of the analysis should be proportionate to the importance and complexity of the issues being addressed.", "This report, which describes the results of our review of 23 RIAs supporting air quality regulations, is addressed to you because of your jurisdiction for the Clean Air Act. These RIAs were prepared by EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation and issued between November 1990, the effective date of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and December 1995. Specifically, our review focused on whether the RIAs clearly describe (1) key economic assumptions subject to uncertainty and the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions, (2) the extent to which benefits and costs were quantified for the proposed regulatory action, and (3) the extent to which alternative approaches were considered. This report also follows up on our previous recommendation that RIAs include executive summaries highlighting the analytical results important to decisionmakers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required EPA to issue a series of new or stricter regulations to address some of the more serious air pollution problems, including acid rain, toxic air pollutants, motor vehicle emissions, and stratospheric ozone depletion. In view of the estimated billions of dollars in annual costs to implement these and other requirements, the Congress required EPA to report on the benefits and costs of the agency\u2019s regulatory actions under the 1990 amendments, as well as under previous amendments to the act. Specifically, section 812 of the 1990 amendments required EPA to (1) conduct an analysis of the overall impacts of the Clean Air Act on public health, the economy, and the environment, (2) report on the estimated benefits and costs of the regulations implemented under clean air legislation enacted prior to 1990; and (3) biennially update its estimates of the benefits and costs of the Clean Air Act, beginning in November 1992. In May 1996, EPA drafted a report that examined the benefits and costs of the 1970 and 1977 amendments to the act. EPA is currently in the process of compiling its first prospective study evaluating the benefits and costs of the 1990 amendments.", "Section 812 also required GAO to report on the benefits and costs of the regulations issued to meet the requirements of the 1990 amendments. In a February 1994 report, we described the methodologies that EPA had used and the progress that the agency was making.", "In addition, since 1971 a series of executive orders and directives by OMB have required EPA and other federal agencies to consider the benefits and costs associated with individual regulations. In February 1981, President Reagan issued Executive Order 12291, which required federal agencies, including EPA, to prepare RIAs that identify the benefits, costs, and alternatives for all proposed and final major rules that the agencies issued. Subsequently, in September 1993, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 replacing Executive Order 12291 and directing federal agencies, including EPA, to assess benefits, costs, and alternatives for all economically significant regulatory actions.", "OMB and EPA have developed guidelines for conducting the benefit-cost analyses required by these executive orders. While describing the components to be included in these analyses, the guidance affords EPA\u2019s program offices considerable flexibility in preparing RIAs. Specifically, EPA\u2019s guidance stipulates that the level and precision of analyses in RIAs depend on the quality of the data, scientific understanding of the problem to be addressed through regulation, resource constraints, and the specific requirements of the authorizing legislation. This guidance also states that the amount of information and sophistication required in benefit-cost analyses depend on the importance and complexity of the issue being considered.", "The recently enacted Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 provides that before a rule can take effect, the agency preparing it must submit to GAO and make available to the Congress, among other things, a complete copy of any cost-benefit analysis of the rule. This act also provides for congressional review of major rules issued by federal agencies, including EPA, and the potential disapproval of such rules by the enactment of a joint resolution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent to Which Economic Assumptions Were Identified, Explained, and Subjected to Sensitivity Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Eight of the RIAs that we examined did not clearly identify the values assigned for key economic assumptions, such as the discount rate and value of human life, used to assess the economic viability of the regulations. Furthermore, we found that in the RIAs that identified key economic assumptions the rationale for the values used was not always explained. While EPA\u2019s guidance suggests that RIAs account for uncertainties in such values by conducting sensitivity analyses that show how benefit-cost estimates vary depending on what values are assumed, many RIAs used only a single value and did not always provide a clear explanation. Appendix I summarizes the results of our examination of the economic assumptions used in the 23 RIAs.", "Five of the 23 RIAs did not indicate whether the estimated future benefits and costs were discounted. The discount rate can have a significant effect on the estimated impact of an environmental regulation. For example, most environmental regulations impose immediate costs, while the benefits are realized in the future. In such a case, a lower discount rate has a more positive effect on future benefits, thus enhancing the regulation\u2019s perceived value. Conversely, using a higher discount rate makes benefits that occur in the future appear less valuable. Not clearly indicating the discount rate used in benefit-cost analyses makes it more difficult for decisionmakers to assess the desirability of a proposed regulation.", "EPA\u2019s guidelines recognize that there may be uncertainties about which discount rates should be used. Moreover, EPA\u2019s Director of the Office of Economy and Environment stated that there are uncertainties associated with choosing discount rates for conducting benefit-cost analyses. As a result, EPA\u2019s guidance suggests the use of sensitivity analyses to show how benefit and cost estimates are affected by different discount rates. Of the 18 RIAs that clearly identified the discount rates used, 5 showed the sensitivity of their estimates to different rates ranging from 2 to 10 percent. Thirteen of the RIAs used a single rate.", "Although 14 RIAs indicated that the reduction in mortality was an expected benefit, five did not indicate the value placed on a human life. Of the nine RIAs that indicated the value placed on a human life, eight included sensitivity analyses to indicate how their benefit estimates were affected by different values assumed for a life. Assigning a relatively high value for human life can have a significant positive effect on estimated benefits. However, for the nine RIAs that assumed a value for a human life, the ranges used were not always explained. For example, one RIA assumed a value of human life that ranged from $1.6 million to $8.5 million, and another, prepared in the same year, assumed a value of human life that ranged from $3 million to $12 million. In both instances, the RIAs did not provide a clear explanation of the rationale for the values that were used."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Views on Economic Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["Because of the agency\u2019s concern about the use of different values for key assumptions and the extent to which sensitivity analyses were used to account for uncertainties about the appropriate values for these assumptions, EPA recently formed an Economic Analysis Consistency Task Group under the direction of the Regulatory Policy Council to develop information on the causes of inconsistencies in the agency\u2019s RIAs. The Council is chaired by EPA\u2019s Deputy Administrator.", "In addition, EPA officials explained that the authorizing legislation for some environmental regulations is often a key determinant in the thoroughness of the agency\u2019s benefit-cost analyses. For example, they said that health-based national ambient air quality standards issued by the agency are not based on costs or other economic considerations. However, costs may be considered when developing and implementing control strategies for these standards. Although benefit-cost analyses are completed for these regulations, they do not directly impact the regulatory decision-making process. Therefore, the level of analysis and the number of alternatives analyzed could be more limited.", "Time constraints imposed by statutory and court-ordered deadlines and shortages of resources and staff also restrict EPA\u2019s ability to conduct comprehensive benefit-cost analyses. Given the limited resources and staff available for completing economic analyses, EPA officials stated that they assign a higher priority to benefit-cost analyses supporting regulations facing imminent deadlines, regulations expected to have greater economic impacts on society, and those for which the economic analysis has the highest potential to affect the regulatory alternative selected."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Extent to Which Benefits and Costs Were Quantified", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s and EPA\u2019s guidelines encourage EPA to quantify, to the extent feasible, all potential regulatory benefits and costs in monetary terms, but the guidance recognizes that assigning reliable monetary values to some benefits may be difficult, if not impossible. When benefits and costs cannot be described in monetary terms, the guidance recommends that RIAs include quantitative and qualitative information on the benefits and costs associated with the proposed regulations. The benefits mentioned in the guidance include reduced mortality, reduced morbidity, improved agricultural production, reduced damage to buildings and structures, improved recreational environments, improved aesthetics, and improvements in ecosystems.", "Our review of the 23 RIAs indicated that while all of them assigned dollar values to the costs of proposed regulations, 11 assigned dollar values to estimated benefits. EPA acknowledges that assigning monetary values to projected benefits is more difficult than assigning values to the costs of regulatory actions. According to EPA officials, the uncertainty of the science and inadequacy of other data often prevent the agency from estimating dollar benefits. For example, EPA\u2019s guidance recognizes that assigning a monetary value to reduced health risks, a potentially significant benefit, is difficult because of uncertainties about the precise relationship between different pollution levels and corresponding health effects and the appropriate monetary values to be assigned to reductions in mortality and reduced risks of individuals\u2019 experiencing serious illnesses. Estimating the monetary value of improvements in ecosystems, another potentially significant benefit, is even more complex.", "Although some RIAs did not assign dollar values to benefits, all 23 of the RIAs we examined contained other quantitative or qualitative information on the benefits of the proposed regulations. When benefits cannot be assigned dollar values, quantifying the benefits, such as a reduced incidence of deaths and illnesses, helps clarify the impact of proposed regulations. For example, an RIA for the National Recycling and Emissions Reduction Program\u2019s regulation estimated that 76,500 fewer cases of skin cancer and 1,400 fewer deaths from skin cancer would occur because of the regulation. Qualitative information is also helpful to decisionmakers because it gives them a more complete understanding of the overall benefits of regulations. Nineteen of the RIAs discussed qualitative benefits, such as increased crop yields, improvements in ecosystems, and reduced damage to buildings and other structures.", "Recognizing the difficulties associated with assigning dollar values to benefits, EPA\u2019s guidelines state that cost-effectiveness analyses can assist decisionmakers in comparing the desirability of various regulatory alternatives. We found that 20 of the RIAs we examined included the results of cost-effectiveness analyses, such as the cost per ton of reduced emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent to Which Alternative Approaches Were Considered", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s and EPA\u2019s guidelines require EPA to identify and discuss in RIAs the regulatory and nonregulatory alternatives for mitigating or eliminating the environmental problems being addressed and to provide the reasoning for selecting the proposed regulatory action over other alternatives. While EPA\u2019s guidance recommends that RIAs consider four major types of alternatives\u2014voluntary actions, market-oriented approaches, regulatory approaches within the scope of the authorizing legislation, and regulatory actions initiated through other legislative authority\u2014it states that the number and choice of alternatives to be selected for detailed benefit-cost analyses is a matter of judgment. While it was not always clear how many alternatives or what types of alternatives were considered, our examination of the 23 RIAs indicated that 6 of them compared a single alternative, which was the regulatory action being proposed, to the baseline, which was the situation likely to occur in the absence of the regulation\u2014the status quo. All other RIAs compared two or more alternatives to the baseline. Figure 1 shows the results of our examination of the number of alternatives that EPA considered in the 23 RIAs.", "A major goal of RIAs is to develop and organize information on benefits and costs to clarify trade-offs among alternatives. EPA\u2019s guidance states that RIAs should provide decisionmakers with a comprehensive assessment of the implications of alternatives. EPA officials acknowledged that it is not always clear in the RIAs which alternatives were actually analyzed. They stated that some alternatives are excluded before the benefit-cost analyses are performed because of noneconomic reasons, such as statutory language that precludes EPA from using certain approaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent to Which Executive Summaries Were Used", "paragraphs": ["In our 1984 report, we recommended that future RIAs prominently include executive summaries that (1) clearly recognize all benefits and costs, even those that cannot be quantified; (2) identify a range of values for benefits and costs subject to uncertainty, as well as the sources of uncertainty; and (3) compare all feasible alternatives. While 13 of the 23 RIAs that we examined included executive summaries, some of these RIAs only briefly discussed the types of information that we recommended they contain. For example, the executive summary for the RIA on the regulation for national emissions standards for coke ovens contained a limited discussion of the uncertainties underlying the analysis, and the executive summary for the RIA on the operating permits program\u2019s regulation included only two sentences on the three alternatives that EPA considered.", "In contrast, the executive summary for the RIA supporting the regulation on phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals presented a relatively thorough discussion of the results of the benefit-cost analysis. For example, it included a range of cost estimates, qualitative and quantitative benefit estimates, discussions of scientific and economic uncertainties, and estimated benefits and costs for baseline conditions and three alternatives. The prominent display of this type of information in the executive summary makes it easier for decisionmakers to locate the information they need without searching through hundreds of pages in the body of the RIAs.", "EPA officials acknowledged that some of the RIAs did not include executive summaries and agreed that executive summaries that include information such as descriptions of the difficulties in assigning dollar values to benefits, uncertainties of the data, and regulatory alternatives are useful.

However, many of the RIAs we reviewed did not clearly identify key economic assumptions, the rationale for using these assumptions, the degree of uncertainty associated with both the data and the assumptions used, or the alternatives considered.
