A U.S.-supported peace process began in 2001, and the country's first democratically elected president in 40 years was inaugurated in 2006. However, conflict in the country has continued. In enacting the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act of 2006 (the Act), Congress established 15 U.S. policy objectives that address humanitarian, social development, economic and natural resource management, governance, and security concerns in the DRC. The Act mandated that GAO review U.S. programs in the DRC that support these policy objectives. In this testimony, based on its December 2007 report, GAO identifies (1) U.S. programs and activities that support the Act's objectives, (2) major challenges hindering the accomplishment of the objectives. For its report, GAO obtained and analyzed program documents for seven U.S. agencies--the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor (DOL), State, and the Treasury and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). GAO also met with officials of these agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) active in the DRC."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, respectively, seven agencies allocated a total of about $217.9 million and $181.5 million for the DRC. About 70 percent of these funds supported the Act's humanitarian and social development objectives and about 30 percent supported its economic and natural resource management, governance, and security objectives. Agencies' programs and activities included, for example, USAID's provision of emergency supplies, food, and water and sanitation improvements to vulnerable populations; Treasury's provision of interim debt relief; and State's provision of training and other assistance for professionalizing members of the DRC's military. Several major, interrelated challenges--an unstable security environment, weak governance, mismanagement of natural resources, and lack of basic infrastructure--have impeded efforts to achieve the Act's policy objectives. For instance, weak and abusive DRC security forces have worsened humanitarian and social problems, forcing U.S. and NGO staff to curtail some efforts. At the same time, corruption and other governance problems have impeded efforts to reform the security sector and hold human rights violators accountable. Meanwhile, mismanagement of natural resources has fueled continued conflict and corruption, and a lack of basic infrastructure has hindered progress in humanitarian, developmental, and governance programs. The U.S. government has not established a process to assess overall progress toward the Act's policy objectives. As a result, it cannot be assured that it has allocated U.S. resources in the most effective manner. In its December 2007 report, GAO recommended that the Secretary of State work with the heads of the other agencies implementing programs in the DRC to develop a plan for systematically assessing the U.S. government's overall progress in achieving the Act's policy objectives. State agreed with GAO's recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on U.S. assistance in  the Democratic of the Congo (DRC).

With an area of more than  900,000 square miles, the DRC is roughly the size of the United States east  of the Mississippi River. Located in the center of Africa, the DRC borders  nine nations. Its abundant natural resources, which constitute its primary  export products, include 34 percent of the world\u2019s cobalt reserves, 10  percent of the world\u2019s copper reserves, and 64 percent of the world\u2019s  coltan reserves, as well as diamonds, gold, cassiterite, and other minerals.  Moreover, the DRC\u2019s rain forests provide 8 percent of the world\u2019s carbon.", "The DRC has had a turbulent history. In 1965, fewer than 5 years after the  nation achieved independence from Belgium, a military regime seized  control of the DRC and ruled, often brutally, for more than 3 decades. It  was toppled in 1997 by a coalition of internal groups and neighboring  countries to the east, including Rwanda and Uganda, after dissident  Rwandan groups began operating in the DRC. Subsequent efforts by a new  DRC government to secure the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan  troops prompted a second war in 1998 that eventually drew the armies of  three more African nations into the DRC. Beginning in 1999, a United  Nations (UN) peacekeeping force was deployed to the DRC. After a series  of U.S.-supported peace talks that began in 2001, the other nations  withdrew all or most of their troops and an interim government was  established. Elections held in 2006 with logistical support provided by UN  peacekeepers culminated in the December 6, 2006, inauguration of the  DRC\u2019s first democratically elected president in more than 40 years.  However, conflict in the DRC has continued. According to the  International Rescue Committee, from 1998 through 2007, 5.4 million  Congolese died as the direct or indirect consequence of conflict in the  country, with an estimated 2.1 million of those deaths since 2002.", "The DRC suffers from a wide range of problems, including acute poverty  and limited economic prospects. It is one of the poorest and least  developed countries in the world: the current life expectancy is 43 years,  in part because the DRC suffers from high rates of tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS,  and malaria. USAID reports that 2 of every 10 children born in the DRC die  before their fifth birthday and that the maternal death rate is the world\u2019s  highest. An international group of donor nations recently concluded that  the DRC\u2019s educational system is failing and that most rural children do not  attend school. In addition, wars and turmoil have reduced its economy to  dependence on subsistence agriculture and informal activities. The DRC\u2019s  prospects are also encumbered by an external debt load of around $8  billion, which is three times greater than the level of debt that the World  Bank and the IMF consider sustainable. Moreover, the DRC has not fully  qualified for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor  Country (HIPC) initiative.", "The DRC receives assistance from a number of donor nations and  organizations. During 2004 and 2005, the 10 largest donors to the DRC  were the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, the  European Commission, Japan, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United  States, France, Germany, the IMF, and the Netherlands.

These challenges include (1) an unstable security environment,  (2) weak governance and widespread corruption, (3) mismanagement of  natural resources, and (4) lack of basic infrastructure. Because these  challenges are interrelated, they negatively impact progress in multiple  areas.", "Unstable security environment. The DRC\u2019s weak and abusive  security forces have been unable to quell continuing militia activities in  the DRC\u2019s eastern regions, where security worsened during 2007. For  example, the UN reported that the DRC army is responsible for 40  percent of recently reported human rights violations\u2014including rapes,  mass killings of civilians, and summary executions\u2014and DRC police  and other security forces have killed and tortured civilians with total  impunity. State reported that government and other armed forces in  the DRC have committed a wide range of human rights abuses,  including forcing children into the security forces. Further, the DRC\u2019s  unstable security situation has worsened the DRC\u2019s humanitarian and  social problems and impeded efforts to address these problems. For  instance, U.S. agency officials reported that the conflict has forced  them to curtail some emergency assistance programs, and NGOs  implementing development and humanitarian assistance activities in  the DRC reported that the lack of security has resulted in attacks on  their staff or led them to suspend site visits and cancel and reschedule  work. In addition, the DRC\u2019s unstable security situation has negatively  affected the country\u2019s economic potential by discouraging investment,  which in turn could worsen security through renewed conflict.", "Weak governance and corruption. By many accounts, corruption in  the DRC is widespread. For example, Transparency International\u2019s  2007 Corruption Perceptions Index identifies the DRC as one of the  10th most corrupt countries in the world. Further, weak governance  and corruption in the DRC have hindered efforts to reform the security  sector and hold human rights violators accountable. For instance,  according to U.S. officials, the DRC lacks a government office with  clear authority on security issues, and efforts to reform the DRC\u2019s  police may be impeded by lack of support from corrupt DRC  institutions. According to NGO representatives, the lack of an effective  judiciary impedes efforts to hold human rights violators accountable  for their actions, which in turn promotes a \u201cculture of impunity.\u201d  Moreover, governance problems have hindered efforts to implement  economic reforms required for debt relief and promote economic  growth. For example, according to Treasury officials and IMF  documents, the government\u2019s lack of commitment to meet certain  requirements has jeopardized the DRC\u2019s ability to receive some interim  debt relief, qualify for full debt relief, and improve the country\u2019s overall  economic prospects. Finally, the judiciary\u2019s ineffective enforcement of  commercial contracts in the DRC has likely discouraged private sector  investment and hence economic growth. The World Bank rated the  DRC\u2019s enforcement of contracts as among the weakest in the world,  such that a company might need to expend roughly 150 percent of a  typical contract\u2019s value to ensure enforcement through court  proceedings.", "Mismanagement of natural resources. Governance and capacity  challenges in the DRC have limited the ability of international donors,  NGOs, and the DRC government to improve natural resource  management. For example, the Kimberley Process Certification  Scheme has criticized the DRC for weak internal controls, customs  capacity, and ability to track diamonds extracted by large number of  self-employed miners. According to U.S. and NGO officials, the DRC  also conducted a national mining contract review without publishing  its terms of reference or all of the contracts or clearly defining the role  of civil society representatives. Further, mismanagement of the DRC\u2019s  natural resources has fueled continued conflict and corruption.", "According to U.S. officials, international donors, and NGOs, the DRC\u2019s  abundant natural resources fuel conflict between neighboring  countries\u2019 militias and armed domestic factions and foster corruption  among government officials.", "Lack of basic infrastructure. The DRC lacks many key elements of  basic infrastructure, such as buildings, equipment, and transportation.  For example, according to a recent study by 17 donor nations, no roads  link 9 of the DRC\u2019s 10 provincial capitals to the national capital and no  roads link the DRC\u2019s northern and southern regions or its eastern and  western regions. International observers have reported that the DRC\u2019s  educational and penal infrastructures are dilapidated, and an  international group of donor nations stated that the DRC\u2019s  electrification, communications, and supplies of clean water have  major deficiencies. Moreover, the DRC\u2019s lack of basic infrastructure  has hindered progress in humanitarian, developmental, and governance  programs. According to U.S. officials, the lack of an adequate in- country transportation system increases the time required to get  supplies to those in need and, according to U.S. and NGO officials,  increases the expense or difficulty associated with their programs.  International donors and organizations said that the lack of  infrastructure has made economic development impossible in many  areas and may stifle the potential for economic growth and private  sector activity in most DRC provinces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Efforts to Assess Overall Progress toward Achieving the Act\u2019s Policy Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Although U.S. agencies monitor their efforts in the DRC, the U.S.  government has not established a process to assess overall progress  toward achieving the Act\u2019s policy objectives in the DRC.

Under  DFA\u2019s guidance, State and USAID have begun to develop a joint planning  and budgeting process that, according to State officials, may eventually  assess all U.S. foreign assistance. However, as of February 2008, the Office  of the DFA had not completed its DRC operations plan for fiscal year 2007,  which ended on September 30, 2007.", "To focus attention on issues affecting the Great Lakes region of central  Africa, which encompasses the DRC, the National Security Council  established an interagency working group, comprising officials from DOD,  State, and USAID. The group\u2019s mission is to establish a coordinated  approach, policies, and actions to address issues, such as security, in the  DRC and other countries in the region. However, according to NSC and  State officials, the group has not developed systematic tools for assessing  the impact of all U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to achieve the Act\u2019s objectives.
