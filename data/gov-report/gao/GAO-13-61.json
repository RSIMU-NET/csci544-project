In about half the states, OSHA sets and enforces compliance with safety and health standards. The remaining states set and enforce their own standards under OSHA-approved plans. In fiscal year 2010, OSHA strengthened its monitoring of staterun programs following a dozen worker deaths in one of those states. Questions have since been raised about how closely OSHA monitors its own enforcement efforts. GAO examined 1) how OSHA's monitoring of its own and state enforcement efforts compares, and 2) recent steps OSHA has taken to evaluate the effectiveness of federal and state enforcement efforts. GAO reviewed OSHA's monitoring policies and procedures and relevant federal laws and regulations; analyzed federal and state audits; visited three OSHA regional offices; and interviewed OSHA officials and other experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provides more frequent monitoring and more consistent guidance for its federal enforcement activities than for state enforcement activities. More specifically, OSHA regional officials review performance reports on federal activities at least every other week but review reports on state-run program activities quarterly. In addition, OSHA's guidance for audits of its regional and area offices is more consistent than the guidance for its audits of state-run programs. Guidance for audits of its offices requires that regional offices conduct a comprehensive audit with on-site review of inspection case files at least once every 4 years and other audits focused on more specific activities in all other years. In contrast, guidance for regional office audits of state-run programs changes from year to year and does not include a regular schedule for comprehensive audits with on-site case file reviews. While the frequency of OSHA's monitoring of state-run programs is necessarily different because of the independent enforcement authority of participating states, OSHA's lack of consistent guidance for audits of these state-run programs may allow enforcement deficiencies to go undetected, increasing the risk of worker injuries, illnesses, or death. In addition, there is little participation by OSHA's national office in comprehensive audits of its regional offices despite a 2010 directive to do so. As a result, OSHA cannot ensure that the results of regional audits are impartial.", "OSHA is taking steps to better assess the effectiveness of both its federal enforcement efforts and of state enforcement efforts, but it is often not clear how these steps will help OSHA demonstrate what efforts result in better outcomes for workers, such as reduced worker injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. For example, OSHA recently revised some of the measures it uses to assess staterun programs by adding acceptable ranges of performance. However, the revised measures still largely focus on outputs--such as the average number of violations per inspection--rather than outcomes. OSHA is also conducting studies to examine the results of specific enforcement activities, including one designed, in part, to evaluate the effect of OSHA providing additional educational support to employers. While tracking progress in meeting performance goals-- such as the annual number of conducted inspections--is useful, the lack of focus on outcomes makes it difficult for OSHA to determine which specific enforcement activities are most effective or to convince states to implement changes designed to improve outcomes. For example, only two state-run programs raised their penalty amounts in fiscal year 2011 as recommended by OSHA; state-run program representatives stated that OSHA lacked evidence to show that higher penalties are more effective in deterring future employer violations. OSHA also does not use data already in hand to assess the effectiveness of federal and state enforcement efforts. For example, OSHA does not use data from its annual audits of its regional and area offices or of state-run programs to inform its planning or share information across regions. Additionally, OSHA annually collects data on activities conducted under emphasis programs that focus on national safety and health issues, but it does not evaluate these data to determine whether these programs are responsible for desired outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OSHA standardize guidance for its audit practices, include outcomes in its assessments of its enforcement initiatives, better use data from its audits, and ensure national office participation in audits.

Regional officials generally monitor their area offices\u2019 progress  toward meeting goals by also reviewing inspection activity reports  submitted weekly by each area office, and through meetings, typically by  phone, with area office managers held at least every other week to review  the data. Inspection activity reports provide information on, among other  things, the number and type of inspections completed, violations found,  and penalties assessed. Some regions also hold in-person meetings a  few times a year with all area office managers to review their progress.  These reports and meetings are the primary ways officials keep track of  each region\u2019s progress toward meeting its goals. For example, in fiscal  year 2012, 7 out of 10 OSHA regional offices met or exceeded their  annual goal for conducting inspections (see fig. 3).", "To monitor state enforcement efforts, OSHA regional and area officials  also review performance reports and meet with state officials to monitor  their progress toward meeting their inspection and other goals, but they  do so less frequently for state-run programs than for federal enforcement  efforts. OSHA regional and area offices work directly with states to set  inspection goals, taking into account staffing and funding levels in each  state. Regional officials told us that some state-run programs face funding  challenges. For example, Hawaii recently reported problems in carrying  out its program due to lack of state staffing resources and funds. States  generally have primary responsibility for monitoring the performance of  their state-run programs, subject to oversight by OSHA. States are  afforded flexibility in setting their own goals as long as they report their  activities across a range of performance measures, such as the  percentage of programmed inspections that find certain types of  violations, and the average number of violations per inspection. Regional  and area officials also meet quarterly with state managers to review  states\u2019 performance, whereas regional officials meet with area officials at  least once every other week to review their performance. For state-run  programs, regional officials look for outliers or significant variations from  the national averages or a state\u2019s own performance goals.variations are found, OSHA\u2019s regional officials and state-run program  officials discuss how the state will address them. For example, state-run  program officials could work with OSHA regional officials to develop a  corrective action plan that specifies steps the state will take to improve its  program.", "During these quarterly meetings with the states, OSHA regional and area  officials review several types of reports that compare a state\u2019s progress  with federal and national data on multiple measures for the same period.  The State Indicator Report tracks the percentage of state-run program  inspections completed by type and compares them to the percentage of  federal inspections, typically by quarter. The State Activity Mandated  Measures report tracks a state\u2019s performance across various measures,  such as the amount of time it takes a state to begin an inspection after  receiving a complaint about a safety or health hazard, and the percentage  of programmed inspections conducted by the state for which serious,  willful, or repeat violations are found. In addition, OSHA officials review  aggregate data on inspections, violations, and penalties as a part of their  annual audits of states. OSHA\u2019s regional offices have transitioned to a  new data system, the OSHA Information System, which officials said  should allow for more sophisticated data runs and evaluation of outputs.  State-run programs have not yet adopted the new system and are still  using the Integrated Management Information System, or compatible  systems, to report results to OSHA. OSHA offices now manually merge  data from the two systems to produce totals for their enforcement  activities.

Under OSHA\u2019s  Management Accountability Program (MAP), OSHA regional offices  conduct annual audits of their own offices and their area offices. These  audits are either comprehensive audits or focused audits of the office\u2019s  inspections and administrative functions. Comprehensive audits, which  are conducted at least once every 4 years, cover a full range of  enforcement and administrative topics. Focused audits, which are  conducted in the years between comprehensive audits, evaluate one or  more selected enforcement or administrative topics. The purpose of MAP  audits is to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of both OSHA\u2019s  regional and area offices\u2019 enforcement field activities in relation to  established policies and procedures and to identify best practices and  deficiencies in order to improve performance.

The  purpose of these audits is to assess the performance of states in meeting  their established goals and complying with statutory and regulatory  requirements, as well as identify areas of concern and excellence, among  other things. During these audits, regions evaluate state-run programs  using certain performance measures, such as the average number of  days it takes to begin an investigation after receiving a complaint. OSHA  officials may also examine case files or accompany inspectors to  worksites to verify that proper procedures are being followed. In  November 2009, after significant problems were identified in Nevada\u2019s  occupational safety and health program, OSHA strengthened its audits of  all state-run programs and called them Enhanced Federal Annual  Monitoring and Evaluation (EFAME) audits. OSHA\u2019s guidance for its fiscal  year 2009 EFAME audits required that OSHA conduct site visits to states  and inspect their case files. According to OSHA, prior to beginning the  EFAME audits, the agency generally did not include these elements in the  annual FAME audits, which may have limited its ability to identify and  address performance problems in some states. The EFAME audits  increased the requirements for OSHA\u2019s audits of states, aligning them  with some of its requirements for the comprehensive MAP audits it  performs, which require regular on-site case file reviews. However,  beginning in 2009, OSHA guidance on what must be included in audits of  state-run programs has changed each year. For fiscal year 2009, OSHA  established the EFAME audits. For fiscal year 2010, OSHA issued  guidance that required only a follow-up to the fiscal year 2009 reviews. In  2011, OSHA issued guidance that required EFAME audits with on-site  case file reviews, and which included a special emphasis on the  whistleblower protection program. Yet, OSHA\u2019s guidance does not  include a timetable for conducting future EFAME audits of state-run  programs. Not having consistent guidance on audits of state-run  programs and no set schedule for when OSHA will conduct these more  comprehensive audits can make it difficult for officials in state-run  programs to prepare for these audits, and limits OSHA\u2019s ability to identify  problem areas and help states address them.", "Regional officials told us EFAME audits have value in detecting problems  in the administration of state-run programs that might not otherwise be  identified. They have also resulted in multiple corrective actions for each  state. Indeed, officials in one regional office said the region has seen  improvements in states as these corrective actions have been  implemented, such as improved case file documentation. Officials from  OSHSPA, the organization that represents states with state-run  programs, stated that the 2009 EFAME audits contained a number of  recommendations that were useful, although they said the summaries in  some reports did not clearly represent the audit findings and did not  include the positive aspects of the state-run programs. OSHA national  officials said they plan to conduct EFAME audits every other year, with  follow-up audits in intervening years; however, they have not developed a  formal written plan to implement this new schedule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSHA Is Taking Steps to Better Assess Effectiveness but Does Not Focus on Outcomes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OSHA Has Several Initiatives to Assess Effectiveness, but Few Focus on Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["OSHA recently developed several initiatives to better assess the  effectiveness of state and federal enforcement efforts.

With respect to state enforcement efforts,  OSHA created a task force comprised of federal and state  representatives to revise state-run program performance measures, and  in the summer of 2012 held a stakeholder meeting and solicited public  comment on 15 revised measures\u2014which took effect October 1, 2012.  The task force was created, in large part, in response to a March 2011  report by Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General that shows OSHA had not  developed a method of determining whether state programs are at least  as effective as federal programs, as required by the OSH Act.board chairman of OSHSPA said OSHA has inadequate guidance for  what is needed to meet this requirement and added that, in OSHSPA\u2019s  view, OSHA often wrongly interprets it to mean that states\u2019 measures,  trends, and policies must be identical to those of federal OSHA. Some of  the revised performance measures developed by the task force are  modifications of measures used previously and several add a range of  acceptable state performance. For example, the measure for the average  number of violations found per inspection formerly assessed a state\u2019s  performance against a national average calculated across 3 years. The   The  revised measure compares the state\u2019s average to a range of 20 percent  plus or minus from the national average.

For  example, one national OSHA official who oversees state-run programs  said that if a state\u2019s performance is outside the range it does not  necessarily mean its performance is unacceptable, but prompts the  reviewer to do additional work to find out why that particular mark was  missed. However, the revised measures remain largely refinements of  indicators previously used to track activities conducted (outputs), not  effectiveness (outcomes). They mostly focus on outputs such as average  penalty, average number of violations per inspection, and average  number of days to issue citations. It is unclear how adding a 20 to 25  percent plus-or-minus range to targets for each of these enforcement  activities will help OSHA officials determine whether a state\u2019s program is  at least as effective as the federal program because neither the state\u2019s  range nor the federal number is linked to effectiveness\u2014improving  employer compliance and reducing worker fatalities, injuries, and  illnesses.

For  example, in 2010, the average penalty for serious violations levied by  OSHA was approximately $1,000, and the average penalty for these  violations in state-run programs was frequently lower\u2014in three states, it  was less than $500. According to the Assistant Secretary, these amounts  were far too low to exert a credible effect in deterring employer violations.  There were also wide discrepancies from state to state in penalty  amounts, which one state-run program manager said raises substantial  concerns about equal expectations of employers and protection for  workers across states. To address these concerns, OSHA increased its  penalties in October 2010, and recommended that states match these  increases. This increase more than doubled the average OSHA penalty  by fiscal year 2012, to $2,154. Officers at OSHSPA opposed the higher  penalties, saying OSHA had failed to provide empirical studies to show  increased penalties were effective in deterring employer violations. They  also said that state-run programs could achieve greater compliance with  safety and health standards by increasing the likelihood of an inspection.  Only two states\u2014Nevada and Wyoming\u2014increased their penalty  amounts in response to OSHA\u2019s recommendation, according to a national  OSHA official.

OSHA recently developed initiatives to better assess the  effectiveness of federal and state enforcement activities, but few include  the evaluative components needed to assist the agency in examining  effectiveness. Also, national OSHA collects some relevant information  through audits of its own offices and state-run programs, but it does not  annually analyze that information to identify systemic problems and  improvements. In addition, despite a 2010 directive calling for greater  participation of the OSHA national office in regional office comprehensive  audits, there is still minimal participation by the national office in these  audits. Without the independent perspective of the national office, OSHA  cannot assure that results of regional office audits of themselves are  impartial and reasonable. Further, OSHA has not provided consistent  guidance for conducting state EFAME audits that include on-site case file  reviews similar to comprehensive MAP audits. Lack of such guidance  may allow enforcement deficiencies to go undetected, increasing the risk  of worker injuries, illnesses, and death. Enhancing monitoring of  enforcement activities and determining which efforts work best must be a  sustained priority if OSHA is to achieve the best results and succeed in its  mission to protect U.S. workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve OSHA\u2019s assessments of its effectiveness and its  monitoring of federal and state enforcement efforts, we recommend that  the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary of Labor for  Occupational Safety and Health to:  1.  consistently incorporate outcomes in its assessments of enforcement  2.  annually analyze the results of its MAP and FAME audits to identify  and address systemic problems and leading practices;  3.  ensure that OSHA national staff participate in regional office  comprehensive audits to enhance independence in accordance with  OSHA\u2019s MAP 2010 directive; and  4.  provide consistent guidance for scheduling state EFAME audits to  ensure that they are conducted on a regular basis and include  mandatory on-site case file reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Labor for review and  comment. We received written comments from OSHA, which are  reproduced in their entirety in appendix II.", "OSHA agreed with the essence of our recommendations and stated that it  would carefully consider them. However, OSHA raised some concerns  about them. For recommendation 1, OSHA expressed concern that it may  overemphasize the significance of outcome measurements in determining  the effectiveness of state safety and health programs. OSHA pointed out  that it currently uses other measures in conjunction with outcome  measures to evaluate effectiveness. We agree that using other measures  to evaluate state-run programs is useful but note that OSHA has not  linked them to its assessments of effectiveness. We continue to believe  that OSHA\u2019s assessments would benefit from further analysis of the  results, or outcomes, of both state and federal enforcement activities. We  revised our report to clarify that we do not think OSHA should stop  measuring activities. For recommendations 2 and 3, OSHA stated that it  has taken several steps to improve its analysis of audits and enhance  resources assigned to the program. For recommendation 4, OSHA stated  that it updates guidance for FAME reviews each year and is updating the  State Plan Policies and Procedures Manual to include these revisions and  guidance for on-site case file reviews. While we agree with OSHA that  providing annual guidance to focus audits on areas of concern is valid,  OSHA has not yet provided formal guidance for how often enhanced  audits of state-run programs (EFAMEs) with on-site case file reviews will  be conducted. We revised the wording of our recommendation to refer  specifically to the scheduling of these EFAMEs. Finally, OSHA noted that  our draft report did not adequately acknowledge the state-plan states\u2019  distinct role in directly and closely overseeing their own performance. We  added further acknowledgement of the states\u2019 authority in this area to our  report.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, the Secretary of Labor, and other interested  parties.

We also reviewed  relevant federal laws and regulations. We analyzed audits of OSHA  regional and area offices, which assess their activities in relation to OSHA  policies and procedures and identify best practices and deficiencies in  performance, such as in targeting and scheduling inspections; conducting  fatality investigations; case file documentation; and outreach to  employers, workers, and other stakeholders. We also analyzed OSHA\u2019s  audits of state-run programs, which assess each state\u2019s progress toward  meeting its individual performance goals and compliance with statutory  and regulatory requirements. To further evaluate OSHA\u2019s audit  processes, we compared these processes to criteria for independent  review in GAO\u2019s Government Auditing Standards.", "GAO, Government Auditing Standards, 2011 Revision,  GAO-12-331G, Sections 3.02 and  3.04 (Washington, D.C.: December 2011). inspections: Virginia (a large number of inspections), Indiana (a medium  number), and Wyoming (a small number). In Region 8, we interviewed  Denver regional office officials with direct oversight responsibility for  Wyoming because there is no area office in that state. To obtain a  national perspective, we conducted semi-structured phone interviews with  the remaining seven regional office administrators or their managers  about how they monitor and oversee enforcement efforts and each  office\u2019s processes for overseeing the OSHA offices and state-run  programs in its region. From each region, we collected key documents,  including recent audit reports on regional and area offices, interim and  annual reviews of states, inspection tracking reports and interim tracking  of other key measures, and logs of complaints about state-run programs.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed the heads of  directorates in OSHA\u2019s national office about their roles in monitoring  enforcement and in planning for greater effectiveness, including the  directorates responsible for state-run programs, overall enforcement,  strategic planning, and evaluation. To obtain information from outside  parties about OSHA\u2019s oversight of federal and state enforcement, we  interviewed Labor officials who work with OSHA on its performance  planning and research agenda; officers of the Occupational Safety and  Health State Plan Association (OSHSPA), which represents the interests  of states with state-run programs; and officials at the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 National Institute for Occupational Safety  and Health (NIOSH), which conducts research, experiments, and  demonstrations relating to occupational safety and health. In addition, we  interviewed selected academic experts and stakeholders about Labor and  OSHA performance. We identified these academic experts and  stakeholders through a literature search, as well as from  recommendations of other academic experts versed in OSHA and worker  protection issues and the recommendations of OSHA and NIOSH  officials. Finally, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations,  including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA); and the  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. We reviewed OSHA\u2019s use of performance goals and measures in accordance with criteria in Office of  Management and Budget Circular A-11, Labor\u2019s current 5-year strategic  plan, and other agency plans for performance. We also reviewed  previous GAO reports and NIOSH\u2019s 2004-2008 evaluation of its own  effectiveness.", "We assessed the reliability of data we used from the OSHA Integrated  Management Information System and OSHA Information System by (1)  reviewing existing information about the data and the systems that  produced them, (2) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the  data, and (3) reviewing these data for obvious inconsistency errors. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this  report.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 through  January 2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
