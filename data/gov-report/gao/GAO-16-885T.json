Agencies have been challenged to fully and effectively establish and implement information security programs. They need to enhance capabilities to identify cyber threats, implement sustainable processes for securely configuring their computer assets, patch vulnerable systems and replace unsupported software, ensure comprehensive testing and evaluation of their security on a regular basis, and strengthen oversight of IT contractors.", "Improve capabilities for detecting, responding to, and mitigating cyber incidents. Even with strong security, organizations can continue to be victimized by attacks exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities. To address this, DHS needs to expand the capabilities and adoption of its intrusion detection and prevention system, and agencies need to improve their practices for responding to cyber incidents and data breaches.", "Expand cyber workforce and training efforts.

GAO is an independent agency in the legislative branch of the federal  government. Our mission is to help Congress improve the performance  and accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the  American people. In other words, we examine how taxpayer dollars are  spent and advise lawmakers and agency heads on ways to make  government work better. In my position, I am responsible for leading  audits and studies of the security of federal information systems and  cyber critical infrastructure and the privacy of personally identifiable  information. My statement today is based on our previously published  work addressing federal cybersecurity efforts.", "As computer technology has advanced, federal agencies have become  dependent on computerized information systems and electronic data to  carry out operations and to process, maintain, and report essential  information. The security of these systems and data is vital to public  confidence and the nation\u2019s safety, prosperity, and well-being. Virtually all  federal operations are supported by computer systems and electronic  data, and agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out  their missions and account for their resources without these information  assets. Hence, ineffective controls can result in significant risk to a broad  array of government operations and assets. For example:", "Resources, such as payments and collections, could be lost or stolen.", "Computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes,  including launching attacks on others.", "Sensitive information, such as intellectual property and national  security data, and personally identifiable information, such as  taxpayer data, Social Security records, and medical records, could be  inappropriately added to, deleted, read, copied, disclosed, or modified  for purposes such as espionage, identity theft, or other types of crime.", "Critical operations, such as those supporting national defense and  emergency services, could be disrupted.", "Data could be modified or destroyed for purposes of fraud or  disruption.", "Entity missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents that  result in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct operations  and fulfill their responsibilities.", "Federal information systems and networks are inherently at risk. They are  highly complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often  geographically dispersed. This complexity increases the difficulty in  identifying, managing, and protecting the myriad of operating systems,  applications, and devices comprising the systems and networks.  Compounding the risk, systems used by federal agencies are often  riddled with security vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown. For  example, the national vulnerability database maintained by the Mitre  Corporation has identified 78,907 publicly known cybersecurity  vulnerabilities and exposures as of September 15, 2016, with more being  added each day. Federal systems and networks are also often  interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks,  including the Internet, thereby increasing the number of avenues of attack  and expanding their attack surface.", "In addition, cyber threats and incidents to systems supporting the federal  government are increasing. These threats come from a variety of sources  and vary in terms of the types and capabilities of the actors, their  willingness to act, and their motives. For example, advanced persistent  threats\u2014where adversaries possess sophisticated levels of expertise and  significant resources to pursue their objectives\u2014pose increasing risks.  Further underscoring this risk are increases in incidents that could  threaten national security and public health and safety, or lead to  inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of  sensitive information. Such incidents may be unintentional, such as a  service disruption due to equipment failure or natural event, or intentional,  where for example, a hacker attacks a computer network or system.", "The number of information security incidents reported by federal agencies  to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (U.S. CERT) has  continued to increase\u2014from 5,503 in fiscal year 2006 to 77,183 in fiscal  year 2015, an increase of 1,303 percent (see fig. 1 below).", "Since 1997, we have designated federal information security as a  government-wide high-risk area, and in 2003 expanded this area to  include computerized systems supporting the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure. Most recently, in the February 2015 update to our high-risk  list, we further expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of  personally identifiable information (PII) collected, maintained, and shared  by both federal and nonfederal entities.", "Over the last several years, we have made about 2,500  recommendations to agencies aimed at improving their implementation of  information security controls. These recommendations identify actions for  agencies to take in protecting their information and systems. For  example, we have made recommendations for agencies to correct  weaknesses in controls intended to prevent, limit, and detect  unauthorized access to computer resources, such as controls for  protecting system boundaries, identifying and authenticating users,  authorizing users to access systems, encrypting sensitive data, and  auditing and monitoring activity on their systems. We have also made  recommendations for agencies to implement their information security  programs and protect the privacy of PII held on their systems. However,  many agencies continue to have weaknesses in implementing these  controls, in part because many of these recommendations remain  unimplemented. As of September 16, 2016, about 1,000 of our  information security\u2013related recommendations have not been  implemented."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Law and Policy Establish a Framework for Protecting Federal Systems and Information", "paragraphs": ["Several federal laws and policies\u2014predominantly the Federal Information  Security Modernization Act of 2014 and its predecessor, the Federal  Information Security Management Act of 2002 (both referred to as  FISMA)\u2014provide a framework for protecting federal information and IT  assets.", "The purpose of both laws is to provide a comprehensive framework for  ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over  information resources that support federal operations and assets.

Since  2003, OMB has issued policies and guidance to agencies on many  information security issues, including providing annual instructions to  agencies and inspectors general for reporting on the effectiveness of  agency security programs. More recently, OMB issued the  Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal  Civilian Government in October 2015, which aims to strengthen  federal civilian cybersecurity by (1) identifying and protecting high- value information and assets, (2) detecting and responding to cyber  incidents in a timely manner, (3) recovering rapidly from incidents  when they occur and accelerating the adoption of lessons learned, (4)  recruiting and retaining a highly qualified cybersecurity workforce, and  (5) efficiently acquiring and deploying existing and emerging  technology. OMB also recently updated its Circular A-130 on  managing federal information resources to address protecting and  managing federal information resources and on managing PII.", "The head of each federal agency has overall responsibility for  providing appropriate information security protections for the agency\u2019s  information and information systems, including those collected,  maintained, operated or used by others on the agency\u2019s behalf. In  addition, the head of each agency is required to ensure that senior  agency officials provide information security for the information and  systems supporting the operations and assets under their control, and  the agency chief information officer (CIO) is delegated the authority to  ensure compliance with the law\u2019s requirements. The assignment of  information security responsibilities to senior agency officials is  noteworthy because it reinforces the concept that information security  is a business function as well as an IT function.", "Each agency is also required to develop, document, and implement an  agency-wide information security program that involves an ongoing cycle  of activity including (1) assessing risks, (2) developing and implementing  risk-based policies and procedures for cost-effectively reducing  information security risk to an acceptable level, (3) providing awareness  training to personnel and specialized training to those with significant  security responsibilities, (4) testing and evaluating effectiveness of  security controls, (5) remedying known weaknesses, and (6) detecting,  reporting, and responding to security incidents.", "As discussed later, our work has shown that agencies have not fully or  effectively implemented these programs and activities on a consistent  basis.", "FISMA requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) to develop information security standards and guidelines for  agencies. To this end, NIST has developed and published federal  information processing standards that require agencies to categorize  their information and information systems according to the impact or  magnitude of harm that could result if they are compromised and  specify minimum security requirements for federal information and  information systems. NIST has also issued numerous special  publications that provide detailed guidelines to agencies for securing  their information and information systems.", "In 2014, FISMA established the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) oversight responsibilities, including (1) assisting OMB with  oversight and monitoring of agencies\u2019 information security programs,  (2) operating the federal information security incident center, and (3)  providing agencies with operational and technical assistance.", "Other cybersecurity-related laws were recently enacted, which include the  following:", "The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 codifies the role of  DHS\u2019s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration  Center as the federal civilian interface for sharing information about  cybersecurity risks, incidents, analysis, and warnings for federal and  non-federal entities, including owners and operators of systems  supporting critical infrastructure.", "The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, among other things,  authorizes NIST to facilitate and support the development of voluntary  standards to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure and, in  coordination with OMB, to develop and encourage a strategy for the  adoption of cloud computing services by the federal government.", "The Cybersecurity Act of 2015, among other things, sets forth  authority for enhancing the sharing of cybersecurity-related  information among federal and non-federal entities, gives DHS\u2019s  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center  responsibility for implementing these mechanisms, requires DHS to  make intrusion and detection capabilities available to any federal  agency, and calls for agencies to assess their cyber-related  workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Action Is Needed to Address Ongoing Cybersecurity Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Our work has identified the need for improvements in the federal  government\u2019s approach to cybersecurity. While the administration and  agencies have acted to improve the protections over their information and  information systems, additional actions are needed.", "Federal agencies need to effectively implement risk-based entity- wide information security programs consistently over time. Since  FISMA was enacted in 2002, agencies have been challenged to fully and  effectively develop, document, and implement agency-wide programs to  secure the information and information systems that support the  operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or  managed by another agency or contractor. For example, in fiscal year  2015, 19 of the 24 major federal agencies covered by the Chief Financial  Officers Act of 1990 reported that information security control  deficiencies were either a material weakness or significant deficiency in  internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, inspectors general at  22 of the 24 agencies cited information security as a major management  challenge for their agency. The following actions will assist agencies in  implementing their information security programs.", "Enhance capabilities to effectively identify cyber threats to agency  systems and information. A key activity for assessing cybersecurity  risk and selecting appropriate mitigating controls is the identification of  cyber threats to computer networks, systems, and information. In  2016, we reported on several factors that agencies identified as  impairing their ability to identify these threats to a great or moderate  extent. The impairments included an inability to recruit and retain  personnel with the appropriate skills, rapidly changing threats,  continuous changes in technology, and a lack of government-wide  information-sharing mechanisms. Addressing these impairments will  enhance the ability of agencies to identify the threats to their systems  and information and be in a better position to select and implement  appropriate countermeasures.", "Implement sustainable processes for securely configuring operating  systems, applications, workstations, servers, and network devices.  We routinely determine that agencies do not enable key information  security capabilities of their operating systems, applications,  workstations, servers, and network devices. Agencies were not  always aware of the insecure settings that introduced risk to the  computing environment. Establishing strong configuration standards  and implementing sustainable processes for monitoring and enabling  configuration settings will strengthen the security posture of federal  agencies.", "Patch vulnerable systems and replace unsupported software. Federal  agencies consistently fail to apply critical security patches in a timely  manner on their systems, sometimes years after the patch is  available. We also consistently identify instances where agencies use  software that is no longer supported by their vendors. These  shortcomings often place agency systems and information at  significant risk of compromise since many successful cyberattacks  exploit known vulnerabilities associated with software products. Using  vendor-supported and patched software will help to reduce this risk.", "Develop comprehensive security test and evaluation procedures and  conduct examinations on a regular and recurring basis. The  information security assessments performed for agency systems were  sometimes based on interviews and document reviews, limited in  scope, and did not identify many of the security vulnerabilities that our  examinations identified. Conducting in-depth security evaluations that  examine the effectiveness of security processes and technical  controls is essential for effectively identifying system vulnerabilities  that place agency systems and information at risk.", "Strengthen oversight of contractors providing IT services. As  demonstrated by the Office of Personnel Management data breach of  2015, cyber attackers can sometimes gain entr\u00e9e to agency systems  and information through the agency\u2019s contractors or business  partners. Accordingly, agencies need to ensure that their contractors  and partners are adequately protecting the agency\u2019s information and  systems. In August 2014, we reported that five of six selected  agencies were inconsistent in overseeing the execution and review of  security assessments that were intended to determine the  effectiveness of contractor implementation of security controls,  resulting in security lapses. In 2016, agency chief information  security officers (CISO) we surveyed reported that they were  challenged to a large or moderate extent in overseeing their IT  contractors and receiving security data from the contractors, thereby  diminishing the CISOs\u2019 ability to assess how well agency information  maintained by the contractors is protected. Effectively overseeing  and reviewing the security controls implemented by contractors and  other parties is essential to ensuring that the organization\u2019s  information is properly safeguarded.", "The federal government needs to improve its cyber incident  detection, response, and mitigation capabilities. Even agencies or  organizations with strong security can fall victim to information security  incidents due to previously unknown vulnerabilities that are exploited by  attackers to intrude into an agency\u2019s information systems. Accordingly,  agencies need to have effective mechanisms for detecting, responding to,  and recovering from such incidents. The following actions will assist the  federal government in building its capabilities for detecting, responding to,  and recovering from security incidents.", "DHS needs to expand capabilities, improve planning, and support  wider adoption of its government-wide intrusion detection and  prevention system. In January 2016, we reported that DHS\u2019s National  Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) had limited capabilities for  detecting and preventing intrusions, conducting analytics, and sharing  information. In addition, adoption of these capabilities at federal  agencies was limited. Expanding NCPS\u2019s capabilities for detecting  and preventing malicious traffic, defining requirements for future  capabilities, and developing network routing guidance would increase  assurance of the system\u2019s effectiveness in detecting and preventing  computer intrusions and support wider adoption by agencies.", "Improve cyber incident response practices at federal agencies. In  April 2014 we reported that 24 major federal agencies did not  consistently demonstrate that they had effectively responded to cyber  incidents. For example, agencies did not determine the impact of  incidents or take actions to prevent their recurrence. By developing  complete policies, plans, and procedures for responding to incidents  and effectively overseeing response activities, agencies will have  increased assurance that they will effectively respond to cyber  incidents.", "Update federal guidance on reporting data breaches and develop  consistent responses to breaches of personally identifiable  information (PII). As we reported in December 2013, eight selected  agencies did not consistently implement policies and procedures for  responding to breaches of PII. For example, none of the agencies  documented the evaluation of incidents and lessons learned. In  addition, OMB\u2019s guidance to agencies to report each PII-related  incident\u2014even those with inherently low risk to the individuals  affected\u2014within 1 hour of discovery may cause agencies to expend  resources to meet reporting requirements that provide little value and  divert time and attention from responding to breaches. Updating  guidance and consistently implementing breach response practices  will improve the effectiveness of government-wide and agency-level  data breach response programs.", "The federal government needs to expand its cyber workforce  planning and training efforts. Ensuring that the government has a  sufficient number of cybersecurity professionals with the right skills and  that its overall workforce is aware of information security responsibilities  remains an ongoing challenge. These actions can help meet this  challenge:", "Enhance efforts for recruiting and retaining a qualified cybersecurity  workforce. This has been a long-standing dilemma for the federal  government. In 2012, agency chief information officers and experts  we surveyed cited weaknesses in education, awareness, and  workforce planning as a root cause in hindering improvements in the  nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture. Several experts also noted that the  cybersecurity workforce was inadequate, both in numbers and  training. They cited challenges such as the lack of role-based  qualification standards and difficulties in retaining cyber professionals.  In 2016, agency CISOs we surveyed reported that difficulties related  to having sufficient staff; recruiting, hiring, and retaining security  personnel; and ensuring security personnel have appropriate skills  and expertise pose challenges to their abilities to carry out their  responsibilities effectively.", "Improve cybersecurity workforce planning activities at federal  agencies. In November 2011, we reported that only five of eight  selected agencies had developed workforce plans that addressed  cybersecurity. Further, agencies reported challenges with filling  cybersecurity positions, and only three of the eight had a department- wide training program for their cybersecurity workforce.", "In summary, federal law and policy set forth a framework for addressing  cybersecurity risks to federal systems. However, implementation of this  framework has been inconsistent, and additional action is needed to  address ongoing challenges. Specifically, agencies need to address  control deficiencies and fully implement organization-wide information  security programs, cyber incident response and mitigation efforts need to  be improved across the government, and establishing and maintaining a  qualified cybersecurity workforce needs to be a priority.", "Chairman Donilon, Vice Chair Palmisano, and distinguished members of  the Commission, this concludes my prepared statement.
