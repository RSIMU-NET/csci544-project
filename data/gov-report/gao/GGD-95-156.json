In addition, violations of tax laws often accompany laundering schemes that conceal the existence of an illegal source of income. Money laundering is also a factor in many cases of tax fraud involving income from a legitimate source.", "Although the process of money laundering has been broken down into a number of steps, it is generally agreed by law enforcement and regulatory officials that the point at which criminals are most vulnerable to detection is \u201cplacement.\u201d Placement is the concealing of illicit proceeds by converting the cash to another medium that is more convenient or less suspicious for purposes of exchange, such as property, cashier\u2019s checks, or money orders; or depositing the funds into a financial institution account for subsequent disbursement.", "Because of the problems associated with converting and concealing large amounts of cash, placement is perhaps the most difficult part of money laundering and is currently the primary focus of U.S. law enforcement, legislative, and regulatory efforts to attack money laundering."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Efforts to Combat Money Laundering Center on Reports of Large Cash Transactions", "paragraphs": ["Federal efforts to detect large cash deposits were significantly enhanced with the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970.

Chief among these is a policy commonly referred to as \u201cknow your customer.\u201d Among other things, the policy calls for financial institutions to verify the identity of individuals and businesses that are account holders and to be familiar enough with their banking practices so that transactions that are outside the norm can be readily identified. Officials from the Department of the Treasury and the American Bankers Association told us that most, if not all, financial institutions have implemented a know your customer policy and treat any transaction not typically associated with an account as suspicious. Moreover, guidance from regulatory agencies generally encourages institutions to use the policy in this manner.", "Although suspicious activity generally depends upon the customer, certain types of transactions are suspicious in and of themselves. A common type of suspicious transaction is structuring. Structuring occurs when a person conducts currency transactions in amounts of $10,000 or less for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.", "In September 1992 the Association of Reserve City Bankers (now known as the Bankers Roundtable) published the results of a survey of suspicious transaction reporting by the nation\u2019s major banking institutions. The report included more than 200 profiles of suspicious transactions that had been reported by 60 of the nation\u2019s largest banking institutions. The majority of the transactions that were reported as suspicious (85 percent) involved structuring. The report found that the most common method of structuring involved cash deposits but also included check cashing, cash withdrawals, and the purchase of monetary instruments.", "Other transactions that were reported as suspicious included customers changing the dollar amount of the transaction or cancelling the transaction when informed of the reporting requirement, unusually large purchases of money orders and cashier\u2019s checks, unusually large cash deposits, and wire transfers of funds to a foreign country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation Has Facilitated Suspicious Transaction Reporting by Financial Institutions", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Treasury has identified 8 countries in addition to the United States that, as of July 1993, require the reporting of currency transactions that exceed a specified amount.

In the United States, financial institutions have been encouraged for some time to report suspicious account activity that might be indicative of criminal activity. However, certain provisions in the Right to Financial Privacy Act (P.L. 95-630) of 1978 generated questions in the banking community about the type of customer information that could be disclosed in reporting a suspicious transaction, as well as concerns of potential liability for such disclosure. Subsequent legislation addressed these issues by, among other things, providing certain protections against civil liability for institutions reporting suspicious transactions.", "The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-570) amended the Right to Financial Privacy Act to explicitly define the specific types of account information that financial institutions could disclose without customer permission, subpoena, summons, or search warrant. The intent was to strike a balance between the privacy rights of customers while allowing financial institutions to give government investigators enough information about the nature of possible violations in order for such investigators to determine whether there was a basis to proceed with a summons, subpoena, or search warrant for additional information. The 1986 amendments also established a limited \u201cgood faith\u201d defense whereby financial institutions and their employees, when making a disclosure of certain specified information, would be shielded from civil liability to the customer for such disclosure or for any failure to notify the customer of such disclosure.", "Despite this provision, many banks were concerned that they might still be liable under the Right to Financial Privacy Act for disclosures made on a voluntary basis. Nothing in the statutory language required a financial institution to initiate a disclosure to a government agency of a suspected transaction, and some questioned whether the government would intervene on their behalf should a civil action be initiated against them.", "This situation was remedied, to some extent, by the promulgation of regulations by the Comptroller of the Currency and other federal agencies charged with the responsibility to monitor U.S. financial institutions. Comptroller of the Currency Regulation 12 C.F.R. Section 21.11 and corresponding regulations issued by the other bank regulatory agencies now require financial institutions to report suspected money laundering.", "Nonetheless, there was still concern over the possibility of civil suits because of reporting suspicious transactions.

In our opinion, the variance in the rates is an indication that the reports could be receiving different amounts of emphasis among the districts. Table 3.1 shows the rates for all of the CID district offices.", "CID officials told us that the majority of CID district offices share suspicious transaction reports with the Examination function in IRS. Under these procedures, if CID does not initiate a criminal investigation on a report, the information will be passed on to tax examiners to use in identifying tax fraud.

Under the program, authorized personnel in each state would be able to access the data through computer terminals linked to the Center. As of November 1994, 47 states as well as the District of Columbia had entered into agreements with the Department of the Treasury to participate in Project Gateway, and a total of 40 states had already begun operations.

In addition to receiving copies of all CTRs filed, Georgia requires financial institutions to telefax copies of those CTRs marked suspicious to the state banking department. Although Nebraska does not have the capability to process CTRs filed on magnetic media, the state police receive copies from financial institutions of those filed on paper and review them for those marked suspicious.

As previously discussed, financial institutions use the forms to report several types of criminal activity, including suspected money laundering and/or attempts to evade currency reporting requirements. Under current procedures, the institution filing the CRF is also responsible for sending copies of the form to a number of regulatory and law enforcement agencies. The purpose for consolidating the forms and designating a single recipient was to ease the reporting burden on the financial institutions and to place responsibility for ensuring correct dissemination of the reports with the government rather than with the reporting institution.", "In August 1991 the six regulatory agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that authorized FinCEN to design, develop, implement, and maintain a computerized database containing the standardized CRFs.
