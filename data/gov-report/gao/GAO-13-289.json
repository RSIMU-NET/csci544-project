During the civil war between 1975 and 1990, both  Syrian and Israeli forces occupied the country. In the midst of the civil war  and Israel\u2019s continued occupation of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah  emerged in Lebanon as a powerful Islamic militant group. Throughout the  1990s, Hezbollah, funded by Iran and designated by the United States  and Israel as a terrorist organization, pursued its military campaign  against Israeli forces occupying Lebanon while also participating in  Lebanon\u2019s political system. In 2000, Israeli forces withdrew from southern  Lebanon. In 2005, with pressure from the international community, Syrian  forces withdrew from Lebanon following the assassination of Lebanon\u2019s  prime minister. The subsequent parliamentary elections that year resulted  in a member of Hezbollah holding a cabinet position for the first time. In  the summer of 2006, Hezbollah and Israel entered into a month-long  conflict that ended with the adoption of United Nations Security Council  Resolution 1701 by both the Israeli and Lebanese governments.

Following the Syrian withdrawal in 2005 and the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah  war, the United States increased its security assistance to Lebanon. The  United States provided assistance to the LAF, which is generally  responsible for providing border security, counterterrorism, and national  defense, and to the ISF, or police force, which is generally responsible for  maintaining law and order in Lebanon. The fiscal year 2006  appropriations marked the first time since 1984 that U.S. agencies  allocated Foreign Military Financing grants to help modernize and equip  the LAF.

In addition,  officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut stated that State and DOD are  struggling to develop specific, measurable performance indicators and  still have a long way to go. DOD officials stated that developing metrics to  measure the results of security assistance programs in Lebanon is  difficult. The officials stated that some indicators may be subjective and  difficult to quantify\u2014for example, U.S. influence in building relationships  or the willingness of the LAF to fight. Furthermore, they said that it is  difficult to quantify what would have happened in the absence of U.S.  assistance.", "Because the agencies do not have specific, measurable, and outcome- oriented performance indicators, U.S. officials have cited anecdotal  evidence that they believe demonstrates the effectiveness of U.S.  security assistance programs in Lebanon. For example, some officials  have cited the LAF\u2019s success in taking control of a Palestinian refugee  camp from Al-Qaeda-inspired militants as an indication of the impact of  the assistance. The United States provided ammunition and other  supplies to assist the LAF during the 3-month engagement. As other  indications of effectiveness, U.S. officials also mentioned the LAF\u2019s  actions in arresting members of a Shiite clan involved in kidnappings, the  professionalism demonstrated by LAF Special Forces units in training  exercises, and increases in drug seizures. However, the use of only  positive anecdotal evidence does not provide sufficient context and scope  to help officials judge the effectiveness of these programs.", "State and DOD officials described agency efforts to improve performance  measurement. For example, the Bureau of International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement Affairs is shifting from reporting output measures, such  as numbers of students trained, to outcome measures, according to  bureau officials. The bureau plans to collect more accurate performance  metrics that focus on measuring the impact of the INCLE police training  program in Lebanon. The bureau also plans to consider such factors as  the quality of the officers and the extent to which women are integrated  into the ISF, according to bureau officials. Moreover, the Bureau of  International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs is working with the  ISF to improve the performance indicators in the ISF\u2019s strategic plan,  according to officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. The current plan  includes some output measures, such as number of traffic stops made by  police. Embassy officials also stated that they are working with the LAF to  develop a military cooperation plan that will include performance  measures. In addition, according to DOD Central Command officials,  efforts are under way to develop a new framework for its annual  assessments of the LAF that will include improved performance  measures.

U.S. security assistance for Lebanon has  presented certain risks because of the influence wielded by the militant  group Hezbollah, which is now a member of the Lebanese government.  Ensuring that U.S. security assistance for Lebanon is effective in  achieving U.S. strategic goals is now more important than ever\u2014to help  Lebanon resist the influence of Iran, which funds Hezbollah, and to  withstand the potential spillover of conflict in Syria.", "Program evaluation and performance measurement are key management  tools to ensure that U.S. security assistance is effective in achieving U.S.  strategic goals. However, the U.S government has evaluated the  effectiveness of only one security assistance program in Lebanon, a  program to which it allocated about 14 percent of the nearly $1 billion in  security assistance allocations since 2007. Neither State nor DOD has  completed plans or time frames to evaluate the remaining six ongoing  U.S. security assistance programs in Lebanon. Without evaluations of all  of its security assistance programs in Lebanon, the U.S. government  cannot show that the programs have been effective in achieving their  specific objectives or that they constitute the best mix of security  assistance for Lebanon to support U.S. strategic goals for the country.  Moreover, because State and DOD currently measure program  effectiveness using performance indicators that are not specific,  measurable, and outcome-oriented, program measurement cannot  facilitate evaluations.

State said that Lebanon is  a good example of a security assistance program that involves complex  program goals and therefore requires a carefully designed evaluation  framework.  State noted, however, that the qualitative versus quantitative  nature of security assistance makes formal evaluation of such programs a  unique challenge. State said that, short of formal program evaluation  relative to Lebanon, it relies on feedback from other sources, such as  periodic Joint Capabilities Reviews involving the LAF and the U.S.  government; Mission Resource Requests from the U.S. Embassy in  Beirut; and capability assessments from the U.S. Central Command.  We  agree that these reviews may provide useful input but are limited because  they are not linked to specific security assistance programs and do not  substitute for formal evaluations, which State agreed would improve its  ability to determine the effectiveness of U.S. security assistance.", "In its written comments, DOD stated that it would coordinate with State to  evaluate the effectiveness of Lebanon\u2019s security forces with clear metrics  that can be evaluated and communicated back to Congress.  DOD also  agreed to improve assessment and evaluation metrics established to  measure the results of assistance provided under Section 1206 and  Section 1207 authority. DOD commented that the draft report did not  consider current DOD evaluating programs that utilize key baseline  documents, such as the Joint Capabilities Review. The draft report,  however, acknowledged that DOD assesses the capabilities of the LAF in  other types of assessments but stated that, while these are useful, they  do not provide the program-specific evaluation that is needed to ensure  that U.S. security assistance is effective in achieving U.S. strategic goals.  DOD's 2012 implementation guidance for assessing Section 1206  programs also recognizes this limitation of other types of assessments.  This guidance states that DOD must be able to demonstrate the return on  investment that Section 1206 training and equipment provide to DOD and  to the U.S. government, and that the assessments are a means for DOD  leadership to determine which types of programs are more successful  and which partner nations make demonstrable progress toward the  objectives of the Section 1206 programs.", "DOD also stated that, in the future, it requests that GAO extend it the  courtesy of a formal out brief prior to releasing the draft report to the  Congress.
