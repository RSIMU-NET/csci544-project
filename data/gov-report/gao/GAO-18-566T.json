Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed.", "Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities.", "IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions.", "Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed.", "Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open.", "Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems.

Over half of the agencies reported  that they had either already met, or planned to meet, all of their OMB- assigned goals by the deadline. This would result in the closure of 7,221  of the 12,062 centers that agencies reported in August 2017. However, 4  agencies reported that they do not have plans to meet all of their  assigned goals and 2 agencies are working with OMB to establish revised  targets. With regard to agencies\u2019 progress in achieving cost savings, 24  agencies reported $3.9 billion in cost savings through 2018.", "The 24 agencies also reported limited progress against OMB\u2019s five data  center optimization targets for server utilization and automated  monitoring, energy metering, power usage effectiveness, facility  utilization, and virtualization. As of August 2017, 1 agency reported that it  had met four targets, 1 agency reported that it had met three targets, 6  agencies reported having met either one or two targets, and 14 agencies  reported meeting none of the targets.", "Further, as of August 2017, most agencies were not planning to meet  OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2018 optimization targets. Specifically, 4 agencies  reported plans to meet all of their applicable targets by the end of fiscal  year 2018; 14 agencies reported plans to meet some of the targets; and 4  reported that they did not plan to meet any targets.

Federal agencies  engage in thousands of software licensing agreements annually. The  objective of software license management is to manage, control, and  protect an organization\u2019s software assets. Effective management of these  licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses, which can result in  unused software, as well as too few licenses, which can result in  noncompliance with license terms and cause the imposition of additional  fees.", "As part of its PortfolioStat initiative, OMB has developed policy that  addresses software licenses. This policy requires agencies to conduct an  annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce  commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software  licenses.", "In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of software  licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve  significant savings government-wide. Of the 24 selected agencies we  reviewed, only 2 had comprehensive policies that included the  establishment of clear roles and central oversight authority for managing  enterprise software license agreements, among other things. Of the  remaining 22 agencies, 18 had policies that were not comprehensive, and  4 had not developed any policies.", "Further, we found that only 2 of the 24 selected agencies had established  comprehensive software license inventories, a leading practice that would  help them to adequately manage their software licenses. The inadequate implementation of this and other leading practices in software license  management was partially due to weaknesses in agencies\u2019 policies. As a  result, we concluded that agencies\u2019 oversight of software license  spending was limited or lacking, thus potentially leading to missed  savings. However, the potential savings could be significant considering  that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major federal agency reported saving  approximately $181 million by consolidating its enterprise license  agreements, even when its oversight process was ad hoc.", "Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue a directive to help guide  agencies in managing software licenses. We also made 135  recommendations to the 24 agencies to improve their policies and  practices for managing licenses. Among other things, we recommended  that the agencies regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory  of software licenses and analyze the inventory to identify opportunities to  reduce costs and better inform investment decision making.", "Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments.

Such a program includes risk  assessments; the development and implementation of policies and  procedures to cost-effectively reduce risks; plans for providing adequate  information security for networks, facilities, and systems; security  awareness and specialized training; the testing and evaluation of the  effectiveness of controls; the planning, implementation, evaluation, and  documentation of remedial actions to address information security  deficiencies; procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to  security incidents; and plans and procedures to ensure continuity of  operations.", "Since 2010, we have made 2,733 recommendations to agencies aimed at  improving the security of federal systems and information.

Most agencies have taken steps to  execute key IT management and cybersecurity initiatives, including  implementing CIO responsibilities, requiring CIO review of IT acquisitions,  realizing data center consolidation cost savings, managing software  assets, and complying with FISMA  requirements. The agencies have also  continued to address the recommendations that we have made over the  past several years.
