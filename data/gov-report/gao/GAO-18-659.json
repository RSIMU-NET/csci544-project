The process begins with a taxpayer filing an appeal with the IRS examination or collection unit proposing the compliance action and ends with a decision from the Office of Appeals (Appeals).", "Appeals must have staff with expertise in all areas of tax law to review taxpayer appeals. However, its staffing levels declined by nearly 40 percent from 2,172 in fiscal year 2010 to 1,345 in fiscal year 2017. Appeals anticipates a continued risk of losing subject matter expertise given that about one-third of its workforce was eligible for retirement at the end of last fiscal year.", "Appeals monitors the number of days to resolve taxpayer appeals of examination, collection, and other tax disputes. However, IRS does not monitor the timeliness of transfers of all incoming appeal requests. GAO analysis showed that the time to transfer appeal requests from compliance units varied depending on the type of case (see table below).", "Collections workstreams \u2014taxpayer appeals where IRS (1) filed a notice of federal tax lien or proposed a levy (collection due process) or (2) rejected an offer to settle a tax liability for less than owed (offer in compromise).", "The Internal Revenue Manual (IRM), IRS's primary source of instructions to staff, requires transfer to Appeals within 45 days for the largest collection workstream. With manager approval, collection staff may have an additional 45 days to work with the taxpayer.

Accordingly, more than 20 percent of examination appeals closed in fiscal years 2014 to 2017 took more than 120 days to be transferred to Appeals. Delays in transferring appeals can result in increased interest costs for taxpayers.", "Although Appeals maintains data on total appeal resolution time\u2014from IRS receipt to Appeals' decision\u2014such information is not readily transparent to IRS compliance units or the public. GAO analysis of IRS data found that, for fiscal years 2014 to 2017, about 15 percent of all appeal cases closed within 90 days (see figure below). About 85 percent of all cases were resolved within one year of when the taxpayer requested an appeal. Total resolution times differed by case type. However, without easily accessible information on resolution times, taxpayers are not well informed on what to expect when requesting an appeal.", "Although Appeals has customer a service standard and conducts a customer satisfaction survey, its standard and related performance results are not readily available to the public. Under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) and Executive Orders, the Department of the Treasury is responsible for customer service performance. Appeals conducts outreach to the tax practitioner community but does not regularly solicit input before policy changes.

We also reviewed the IRS website and IRS  documents and publications that describe the appeal process and  indicate how taxpayers are to file an appeal. We interviewed senior  Appeals managers to understand how Appeals operates and how cases  are processed when Appeals receives them. To understand the initial IRS  receipt of taxpayer appeals, we interviewed IRS examination and  collection officials in the Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) and  Wage and Investment (W&I) business operating divisions. These two IRS  divisions accounted for 97 percent of appeal cases closed in fiscal year  2017. We interviewed Appeals administrative processing staff who  receive and route cases in Appeals as well as customer service staff who  handle taxpayer inquiries about the status of their appeals. We also  analyzed data from the Appeals Centralized Database System (ACDS)  for 346,038 appeals cases closed in fiscal year 2014 (the oldest complete  year available) through fiscal year 2017 (the last complete fiscal year  available at the time of our analysis). We used the data to calculate the  percentage of taxpayers who had a representative with them through the  process and to determine the percentage of cases that had a conference  with appeals, including those with an in-person conference. We also  conducted observational visits to Appeals locations in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania and Atlanta, Georgia to interview a non-generalizable group of Appeals frontline supervisors and staff who handle a diversity of  appeals cases to better understand how appeals cases are assigned to  staff, as well as the case review process. We selected these locations  because they allowed us to interview Appeals frontline staff who work a  wide variety of taxpayer appeals across all seven Appeals work  categories.", "To describe the staffing levels and assess the extent to which Appeals  conducts workforce planning in a time of declining resources, we obtained  and analyzed staffing information and reviewed the IRM section that  explains the Appeals human capital programs and the IRS Strategic  Workforce Planning Team. We interviewed Appeals and IRS human  capital staff to better understand how they conduct workforce planning  and reviewed documentation about the IRS Strategic Workforce Planning  team\u2019s activities and timeframes. We then compared Appeals workforce  planning activities to our key principles of effective workforce planning.  We also reviewed a hiring tool Appeals uses to project case inventory  based on historical case data and current staffing levels to determine  workforce needs and interviewed Appeals managers about strategies and  policies for maintaining staff skills.", "To assess how IRS monitors and manages the time to receive and  resolve taxpayer appeals cases, we reviewed IRS documents, including  IRM sections, IRS procedures, and quarterly Appeals performance  reports and monthly reports to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.  We compared the controls identified to federal standards for internal  control. We interviewed IRS officials responsible for managing Appeals\u2019  review process as well as SB/SE and W&I officials managing initial  appeals receipt for those compliance units. We reviewed the measures  IRS uses to describe timeframes to resolve appeals, which quantify case  review time in average days. Overall averages can be a broad measure  and may be affected by outliers. Finally, we analyzed data from the ACDS  for 346,038 appeals cases closed in fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year  2017. We calculated and compared average appeal case resolution time  for different types of cases. For purposes of this review, we determined  that the ACDS data used in our analysis were reliable. Our data reliability  assessment included reviewing relevant documentation, interviewing  knowledgeable IRS officials, and reviewing the data to identify obvious  errors or outliers.", "To evaluate the extent to which Appeals has and communicates customer  service standards and assesses taxpayer satisfaction with the appeal  process, we identified federal standards for customer service under the  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), as well as customer  service-related Executive Orders, Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) guidance, and internal control standards and compared IRS  Appeals actions to those standards.

We drew on results from the surveys and  focus groups to describe factors that affect Appeals customer satisfaction.  We interviewed Appeals managers and staff who handle cases to  understand their views on factors that affect taxpayer satisfaction and  understand how Appeals communicates service standards and measures  customer satisfaction. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with  13 external stakeholders from law and accounting organizations who  have represented a mix of higher- and lower-income individuals as well  as corporations and other businesses to understand their experiences  with the appeal process.

IRS also offers a  collection appeals program for a broader range of collection issues, such  as when IRS rejects or terminates an installment agreement to pay taxes  owed. In contrast, for examination decisions, the tax code does not  provide statutory rights to administrative appeals. In certain  circumstances, IRS will designate an examination issue for litigation and  not offer access to the administrative appeal process. In other  circumstances, IRS may decide not to refer cases docketed in the U.S.  Tax Court to Appeals for settlement if it determines doing so will be in the  best interest of sound tax administration. For example, IRS may decide  not to refer a docketed case to Appeals in cases (1) involving a significant  issue common to other cases in litigation for which it is important that the  IRS maintain a consistent position or (2) related to a case over which the  Department of Justice has jurisdiction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appeal Workstreams", "paragraphs": ["Appeals\u2019 workload is organized into seven workstreams based on  similarities in case characteristics.

First, the Appeals employee  sends a letter to the taxpayer with information about the appeal process  and schedules a meeting. The letter details what additional material is  needed, if any, and explains that a determination will be made on the  information provided if there is no further contact from the taxpayer.

Most conferences  are held by telephone which can be a quick and efficient means for  taxpayers to resolve their issues. Appeals campus locations conduct  telephone conferences because these locations currently are not  configured to accommodate in-person conferences. Appeals may be able  to resolve some taxpayer appeals with mail correspondence only. For  perspective, about 10 percent of appeal cases that were closed and also  had a conference from fiscal year 2014 through 2017 did so only by  correspondence, and the penalty workstream accounted for nearly   two-thirds of those appeal cases.", "Appeals also holds in-person conferences, usually at an Appeals office.  Alternatively, under its conference policy as of August 2018, Appeals staff  can meet taxpayers in a mutually convenient location when the taxpayer,  representative, or business is beyond a certain distance from an Appeals  office. In-person conferences may be used, among other things, for  reviews involving substantial books and records, judging the credibility of  witnesses, or accommodating with a taxpayer with a special need, such  as disability or hearing impairment. Based on our analysis of ACDS data  for appeal cases closed, about 6 percent of appeal cases that were  closed from fiscal year 2014 through 2017 had an in-person conference,  although this varied significantly by workstream. About half of the large  case examination appeals closed over the period had in-person  conferences, whereas about 3 percent of appeal cases closed in the  collection due process, innocent spouse, and penalty workstreams had  in-person conferences.", "As of August 2018, Appeals had revised its policy on in-person  conferences twice since October 2016. Prior to that, campus appeal  cases were transferred to a field office when taxpayers requested a face- to-face conference. For fiscal year 2017, Appeals limited in-person  conferences to appeal cases meeting specific criteria, such as involving  those with substantial books and records to review or where the taxpayer  has special needs that can only be accommodated with an in-person  conference. Appeals managers had final approval on granting taxpayer  requests for in-person conferences. In October 2017, Appeals further  revised its policy stating it would attempt to schedule in-person  conferences requested by taxpayers for field appeal cases at a time and  location reasonably convenient for both the taxpayer and Appeals.  Appeals stated it was intending to strike the right balance between  making in-person conferences available to taxpayers and ensuring the  process is efficient and workable for Appeals.", "Appeals also offers virtual technology interaction to potentially allow more  taxpayers, especially those in remote locations, to have an option other  than a phone conference. Using IRS virtual service delivery capacity,  Appeals staff at campus locations can conduct virtual conferences with  taxpayers who schedule to use video terminals at some taxpayer  assistance centers. In August 2017, Appeals began piloting web-based  virtual conferences.", "If taxpayers provide Appeals with new information or evidence, or raise a  new issue that requires additional investigation or analysis, Appeals will  return the case to the originating compliance unit for further review.

Appeals has a tool that draws on  historical ACDS case data to project the number of Appeals staff needed  to review the numbers and types of case receipts expected from IRS  compliance units. From fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2017,  Appeals requested and received approval to hire 292 employees. In  November 2017, IRS changed its policy to allow business units funded  from IRS\u2019s enforcement budget, including Appeals, to manage their own  staff levels in certain instances provided they do not exceed their fiscal  year staff limits.

An agency  must then develop strategies tailored to address staffing and skills gaps in  its workforce, including how to acquire, develop, and retain staff to meet  its goals. We have previously reported that mission-critical skills gaps  within the federal workforce pose a high risk to the nation and that  individual agencies must take steps to address skills gaps. We have  also reported on the need to close government-wide mission critical skills  gaps and to develop strategies to help agencies meet their missions in an  era of highly constrained resources.", "Agencies that do not conduct a critical skills gap analysis risk significant  negative effects. We have previously reported that in a time of declining  resources, it is important for top management to take actions that ensure  the agency maintains capacity\u2014including its workforce\u2014in order to  achieve its mission.

High retirement  eligibility rates underscore the importance for Appeals to be positioned to  identify any gaps in the skills of its workforce. Conducting a skills gap  analysis specific to Appeals mission needs is a key step towards  developing a strategy to help ensure Appeals will retain the necessary tax  expertise to review appeals cases across multiple workstreams.", "Time spent by IRS compliance units on initial review of taxpayer appeals  of IRS collection and examination actions can represent a significant  portion of the total appeal resolution time. For appeal cases closed in  fiscal year 2017, approximately 4 percent of collection appeals cases and  nearly one quarter of examination appeal requests took more than   120 days to be transferred from IRS to Appeals. Delays in transferring  requests to Appeals affect prompt resolution for the taxpayer and IRS.  Additional monitoring of collection transfer time requirements together  with establishing transfer time guidelines and procedures for examination  appeal review could improve appeal review timeliness and overall  taxpayer experience.", "Appeals maintains data on the time taken to transfer appeals and  monitors the progress and time to resolve appeals within its diverse  workstreams. Sharing these performance data within IRS could shed light  on actual transfer times and aid compliance units in improving and  establishing related controls to ensure more timely transfer. Increasing  the transparency of total case resolution time with more detailed  information by Appeals workstream would improve taxpayers\u2019  understanding about what to expect when choosing to request an appeal.", "Improving the taxpayer experience with the appeals process also  depends on clarity on customer service standards and related  performance results. Under GPRAMA and Executive Orders, Treasury is  responsible for customer service performance. Publicly stating what  service taxpayers should expect and from whom sets the stage for a  customer-focused appeals process where taxpayers can feel their story is  heard. This also helps fulfill Treasury\u2019s customer service responsibility.  Appeals has demonstrated its willingness to analyze customer  satisfaction feedback. IRS and Appeals share goals to work with  stakeholders, and Appeals has acted to address practitioner reactions to  operational changes underway. Developing a mechanism to leverage  public input on future policy and procedure proposals would better  position Appeals to bolster customer service and effectively implement  changes to improve the taxpayer experience."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to IRS and two  recommendations to the Department of the Treasury.", "The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct the Chief of  Appeals, in coordination with the IRS Human Capital Office, to conduct a  skills gap analysis specific to Appeals mission needs and develop a  strategy for mitigating any identified gaps.

This could include publishing average total resolution times by  workstream on an Office of Appeals web page as well as including total  expected times in the Appeals welcome letter.
