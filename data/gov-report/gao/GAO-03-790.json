NYSE will only arbitrate discrimination cases when parties involved agree to arbitrate after the dispute occurs. NASD will arbitrate employment discrimination cases based on agreements entered into between employees and firms before or after a dispute occurs. NASD has instituted additional requirements, however, for these cases, such as requiring that arbitrators not be affiliated with the securities industry. In addition, those chairing hearings for employment discrimination cases must hold a law degree, have 10 years of legal experience, have substantial familiarity with employment laws, and must not have primarily represented employers or employees in the last 5 years. To qualify to hear cases, NASD and NYSE require that arbitrators have at least 5 years of work experience, supply two letters of recommendation, and complete training in basic arbitration procedures. Arbitrators must also provide information on their complete employment history, including any affiliation with the securities industry, as well as information on whether they have any regulatory or criminal history. Neither organization independently verifies the qualifications for applicants not associated with the securities industry. In addition NASD and NYSE have standard procedures for ensuring that arbitrators selected to hear cases do not have conflicts and for evaluating arbitrator performance. However, evaluations of arbitrators by staff, parties in disputes and other arbitrators on cases are not always completed. Officials at NASD and NYSE noted that if they receive no information about an arbitrator's performance on a case, they assume that the arbitrator's performance was adequate. Over the last 10 years, 261 (17 percent) of the 1,546 employment disputes arbitrated at NASD or NYSE included a discrimination claim. Discrimination cases differed from cases with disputes that did not involve discrimination in the following ways: (1) discrimination cases required more hearing sessions; (2) employees won discrimination cases less often than cases not involving discrimination claims; and (3) in cases that employees won, the monetary award in discrimination cases was generally larger than in cases not involving discrimination. SEC periodically inspects NASD and NYSE arbitration programs. On the basis of its inspections, SEC has recommended improvements. In its most recent inspections of NASD and NYSE, SEC made various recommendations concerning procedures for ensuring that arbitrators are qualified. In addition, SEC recommended that one or both improve procedures for recording information on arbitrator performance in a central database and for disqualifying arbitrators who are poor performers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Most employment disputes in the securities industry must be arbitrated\u2014 resolved by a neutral third party\u2014because mandatory arbitration of such  disputes is often a condition for employment in the securities industry.

Their decisions can have serious  consequences for an employee\u2019s career or livelihood since employee cases  can involve such issues as salary, performance evaluations, and alleged  discrimination. To resolve disputes filed by employees, the securities firms  rely on the arbitration programs run by self-regulatory organizations  (SRO), which regulate the firms in the securities industry that are their  members. Two SROs, NASD and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),  run the largest arbitration programs.

In addition,  we analyzed existing rules and procedure manuals governing NASD and  NYSE. To determine how employees fared in securities arbitration, we  analyzed data on 10 years of arbitration cases filed by employees at NASD  or NYSE in which arbitrators had issued decisions (referred to as awards).  Specifically, we calculated the rates reflecting the extent to which  employees won awards, how much employees were compensated in  awards, and various factors that could influence arbitration outcomes.  Finally, to review SEC\u2019s oversight activities, we reviewed a random sample  of complaint letters SEC received concerning arbitration and its inspection  reports for NYSE and NASD over the last 10 years, concentrating on issues  concerning arbitrator qualifications and arbitrator performance.

Arbitration was used to settle disputes over employee  contracts, and in 1991 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an age  discrimination claim brought forth by a securities industry employee could  be subject to mandatory arbitration. Subsequent court decisions  permitted the use of mandatory arbitration for resolving other  employment discrimination disputes, including sexual harassment.", "Proponents of mandatory arbitration believe it is an efficient, cost- effective way to resolve conflicts between employers and their employees.  Opponents of mandatory arbitration believe that it puts employees at a  disadvantage. They argue that discovery, the process by which parties  exchange documents and other information relevant to their case, is  limited, hearings take place outside of public scrutiny, and arbitrators  favor employers, who are more likely to be \u201crepeat users\u201d than employees.", "SROs include NYSE that operates and regulates its market, as well as  NASD, a private-sector provider of financial regulatory and dispute  resolution services. Their responsibilities include overseeing the  arbitration of claims brought in the securities industry by customers,  firms, and employees as required by the Securities and Exchange Act of  1934 (the Exchange Act). In 2000, NASD established a separate subsidiary  to administer its arbitration program. The subsidiary is headquartered in  Washington, D.C., and New York City, but also maintains staff in five  regional offices. NYSE administers fewer arbitration cases than NASD and  its arbitration program, which is administered by its Department of  Arbitration in New York, is much smaller. NASD\u2019s subsidiary operates with  a staff of about 200 while NYSE maintains a staff of approximately 18. In  addition, NASD currently has approximately 7,000 arbitrators on its roster,  while NYSE has 1,905.", "Arbitrators play a key role in resolving disputes brought forth in the  securities industry and their performance has a direct bearing on the  fairness of a hearing. Like judges, they oversee the administration of  proceedings, including determining the number of hearing sessions a case  requires and what evidence can be admitted. Unlike judges, arbitrators  are not required to base their decisions on legal precedent or to provide  any reasoning for their decisions. In addition, their decisions\u2014unlike  those rendered in court\u2014can only be appealed on limited grounds.", "SEC is responsible for regulating securities market participants, including  SROs such as NASD and NYSE. In addition to overseeing SROs through its  inspections, SEC approves the rules they use to administer their  arbitration programs to ensure they comply with the Exchange Act and  other securities laws and rules. When SROs propose new rules or change  existing rules, they are required to file them with SEC for approval. SEC  then provides interested parties an opportunity to comment on proposed  rules or rule changes.

In the 1990s, as discrimination claims filed at NASD rose, some  Members of Congress challenged the use of mandatory arbitration for  discrimination disputes. In 1997, the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC), which is responsible for enforcing the nation\u2019s  employment discrimination laws, published a policy statement opposing  the use of mandatory arbitration agreements for these disputes.  Opposition to mandatory arbitration for these claims stemmed from  concerns that arbitration eliminated the role the courts played in deterring  discrimination and protecting employees. In addition, others believed that  many arbitrators were unfamiliar with antidiscrimination laws and,  therefore, could not provide a fair hearing on these claims.", "NASD and NYSE took different approaches in changing their rules to  address these concerns. NYSE followed EEOC\u2019s recommendation and only  arbitrates discrimination claims when all parties agree to arbitration after  the dispute occurs. NASD, on the other hand, no longer requires that  employees arbitrate employment discrimination disputes, but will arbitrate  these disputes, based on agreements employees have made before or after  the dispute occurs. The net result is that NASD will administer arbitration  cases that include discrimination claims if the parties have entered into an  agreement to do so. This includes policies employees sign as a condition  of employment.", "According to NASD, in conjunction with this rule change, they assembled  a working group to consider recommendations contained in a document  known as \u201cA Due Process Protocol for Mediation and Arbitration of  Statutory Disputes Arising out of the Employment Relationship.\u201d This Due  Process Protocol was developed in 1995 by a committee of representatives  from a range of organizations, to provide arbitration procedures for  statutory employment claims. Following NASD\u2019s review of this protocol  NASD introduced additional requirements for these types of claims.  Changes ranged from setting qualifications for arbitrators who chair  arbitrator panels to specifying how arbitrators documented their  decisions.", "The arbitrator chairing a discrimination case at NASD must hold a law  degree, have 10 years of legal experience, have substantial familiarity with  employment law, and must not have primarily represented employers or  employees in the last 5 years. In addition to special chair qualifications,  all the arbitrators who hear cases with discrimination claims must also be  classified as \u201cpublic\u201d\u2014that is, individuals who are not affiliated with the  securities industry either professionally or through their family  relationships. For employment discrimination claims of $100,000 or less, a  single public arbitrator is appointed, and for claims greater than this  amount a panel of three public arbitrators is selected.", "In disputes subject to arbitration that arise out of the employment or  termination of employment of an associated person, and that relate  exclusively to disputes involving employment contracts, promissory notes  or receipt of commissions, a single \u201cnonpublic\u201d arbitrator\u2014that is  someone who is affiliated with the securities industry\u2014can only hear  nondiscrimination claims of $50,000 or less. In similar cases with claims of  $50,000 or more, a panel composed of three nonpublic arbitrators is  appointed. Currently, arbitrator chairs in cases without discrimination  claims need the same qualifications as any arbitrator. At NYSE, all  employment disputes, at the option of the employee, are entitled to a panel  of three arbitrators, and a majority of the arbitrators cannot be from the  industry unless the employee requests it.", "NASD rules, adopted in 2000, also made two changes to procedures  concerning arbitrator decisions in cases with employment discrimination  claims. First, the rules specifically state that arbitrators can award  \u201creasonable\u201d attorney\u2019s fees for discrimination claims. This change also  creates an incentive for attorneys to take discrimination cases because it  provides greater assurance that they will be compensated for their work if  they are successful. Second, NASD\u2019s rule change requires arbitrators to  document the disposition of discrimination claims, something not required  for the other claims. While this rule still does not require arbitrators to  explain their decisions, it requires arbitrators to specify for the parties  how they ruled on any statutory discrimination claim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Both SROs Have Similar Qualifications for Arbitrators and Neither Verify the Qualifications of All Applicants", "paragraphs": ["Both SROs require that all applicants for the arbitrator roster provide  information on their affiliation with the securities industry, have 5 years of  work experience, supply two letters of recommendation, and complete  training in basic arbitration procedures. Recommendation letters must  include particular information about the person writing the letter, the  prospective arbitrator, and an attestation as to the character and fitness of  the nominee. NASD also requires that applicants take a multiple choice  examination and receive a passing score of at least 80 percent. (See fig.1.)  After receiving arbitrator applications from applicants who work or  worked in the securities industry, the SROs check the Central Registration  Depository (CRD), a computerized database that contains the educational,  work, and disciplinary history for current and former securities registered  persons. Therefore, the CRD only covers arbitrators classified as  nonpublic. Currently, information from arbitrator applicants not employed  in the securities industry is not checked by the SROs, but NASD is  proposing a rule change that would require the verification of background  information on all new arbitrators.", "NASD reported that verifying the background information on all new  arbitrators would enhance the reputation of its arbitration program. If SEC  approves its rule change, NASD will use an independent firm to conduct  the background checks and will pass the cost of this process\u2014expected to  be between $60 and $85\u2014onto the applicant.

Once  they pass the examination and evaluation by the trainer, they are included  on the NASD arbitrator roster. At NYSE, on the other hand, once an  application is reviewed and approved by staff, the applicant is considered  able to arbitrate any case once he or she participates in one training  course on arbitration procedures and conduct issues.", "Ongoing training at both SROs is limited. NYSE requires that arbitrators  continue to attend at least one training course every 4 years.

Prior to  1998, NASD staff selected arbitrators based on the issues in the case and  the expertise the arbitrators held. In 1996, a NASD task force, organized to  review the securities arbitration process, reported that claimants and their  representatives were concerned that staff could be biased in selecting  arbitrators. To address this concern, NASD changed how arbitrators were  selected. Since 1998, NASD has allowed both parties involved in a dispute  to choose the arbitrators, which limited NASD staff involvement in the  selection process. NASD provides parties with a computer-generated list  of up to 15 arbitrators with profiles for each arbitrator. An arbitrator\u2019s  profile includes a paragraph on the arbitrator\u2019s background, a summary of  the arbitrator\u2019s education and work history, the arbitrator\u2019s experience,  the arbitrator\u2019s disclosure and conflict information, and a list of all the  publicly available award decisions that the arbitrator has rendered. Each  party may peremptorily strike any arbitrator from the list, then ranks the  arbitrators who remain by order of preference. If the parties do not  mutually agree on an acceptable number of arbitrators after striking and  ranking, the list is extended by the computer and the parties are assigned  the next available arbitrator(s) on the computerized roster. While this  process reduces the potential for staff bias, some arbitrators have raised  concerns that a computer-generated list may not contain arbitrators with  substantial experience.", "In 2000, NYSE also began giving parties three options for selecting  arbitrators: (1) choosing randomly from a list drawn from all available  arbitrators; (2) choosing from a list the staff compiles; or (3) having NYSE  staff attorneys select, the only procedure used prior to 2000. If all parties  cannot agree on one of these options, staff attorneys determine who will  arbitrate. According to NYSE, staff selection has remained the most  common method for selecting arbitrators, with parties using it for about   85 percent of the cases. Since this method is the default if parties cannot  agree, it is not possible to determine how often this method was actually  chosen by parties, or used as the default.", "At both NASD and NYSE, arbitrators selected to serve on cases are asked  to review the case and determine if they have any possible conflicts of  interest. In addition, arbitrators must update their profile, which includes  information on their employment history and affiliation with the securities  industry. Both NYSE and NASD will remove arbitrators from their roster if  they misstate or fail to disclose information concerning conflicts of  interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Both SROs Have Procedures to Track Arbitrator Performance, Although Many Arbitrators May Not Be Evaluated", "paragraphs": ["Each SRO has developed three types of evaluations for arbitrators:   (1) party evaluations, completed by either party or their attorneys;   (2) peer evaluations, completed by other arbitrators who hear the case;  and (3) staff evaluations. Both SROs summarize evaluation results and  input them into a centralized arbitrator database. According to NASD  officials, staff are required to summarize and input only negative  comments on an arbitrator, although SEC staff noted that in practice it  also often sees positive comments from NASD staff recorded in the files.  NYSE officials, on the other hand, reported recording a complete summary  of the evaluations. NASD conducts quarterly audits in which they check to  see if staff members are consistently entering information in the  centralized database and documenting actions taken concerning any  evaluations. In addition, the audits review how complaint letters have  been recorded, reviewed, and resolved.", "Both SROs reported that it has been difficult for them to get parties to  return evaluations. Yet, NYSE reported that response rates have  increased since it began requiring that arbitrator chairs encourage parties  to complete the evaluations and reiterate that the evaluations are  confidential and will not affect the case outcome. NYSE said that peers are  very responsive with evaluations. NYSE said it requires that staff observe  new arbitrators for their first hearing at NYSE and said it sought to  evaluate all arbitrators, who serve on a case that goes to a hearing, at least  once a year. Although NYSE said that it had fulfilled this requirement in  2002, NYSE could not provide data on evaluations showing that arbitrators  had been observed. NASD could not report how often staff evaluate  arbitrators. Officials from both SROs said that if no information is received  about an arbitrator on a case, they assume the arbitrator performed  adequately.", "To gain a better understanding of how often arbitrators were evaluated,  we reviewed the records of 124 out of the 494 arbitrators at NASD who  had heard discrimination claims and/or other employment claims between  January 2001 and June of 2002. On the basis of this sample, we estimate  that about 45 percent of arbitrators who heard cases during this time had  received some type of evaluation and of those only about 2 percent  received all three types of evaluations\u2014peer, party, and staff. (See   fig. 2 for a breakdown of the types of evaluations arbitrators received.)", "Although NASD supplements its evaluations by rating arbitrators on a  quarterly basis, our review showed that ratings are often based on little  or no information. Every quarter NASD rates those arbitrators who have  been active during that time, using a 3-point scale, with 1 being the lowest  and 3 being the highest. Staff bases the rating on evaluations and  complaints received that quarter and any notes recorded during that time  frame in the arbitrator database. In general, NASD reported that any  arbitrator who did not have any evaluations during the quarter is likely to  be rated adequate (\u201c2\u201d). We estimate that the majority of the arbitrators  that were rated received an adequate rating of 2, whether or not they  received any evaluations during this time, and 57 percent of arbitrators  with a 2 rating had not received any evaluations during this time frame.  (See fig. 3.) Some arbitrators without evaluations during this time frame  were also rated excellent, which could be a result of the rating from the  prior quarter.", "Both NASD and NYSE have mechanisms in place to address poor  performance by arbitrators. If NYSE or NASD receives either a poor  arbitrator evaluation or complaints about an arbitrator on a case, staff will  take steps to respond. For example, the staff member assigned to the case  may be asked to corroborate the complaint or be asked to consult other  arbitrators assigned to the case to see if they support the allegation. A staff  member who confirms the complaint may then speak to the arbitrator and  suggest how he or she could improve his or her behavior. If the complaint  suggests no corrective action is possible, both SROs reported that the  arbitrator would be removed from the active roster immediately. All  complaints are recorded in the arbitrator database, and both SROs  reported that staff input how the complaint will be resolved.", "In reviewing the records of NASD arbitrators, we found that staff did not  always document how they responded to poor evaluations and complaints.  We estimate that 10 percent of all 494 NASD arbitrators that heard cases  between January 2001 and June of 2002, received some kind of complaint,  either from a staff member, a party member, or another arbitrator. In our  sample, 6 of the 16 arbitrators that received negative complaints were  permanently dropped from NASD\u2019s arbitrator list and 1 was temporarily  made unavailable pending further review. One arbitrator, who had been  permanently dropped in 2001, appeared to have complaints going back to  1993, yet the notes showed that no changes had been made to the adequate  rating of 2. For another permanently dropped arbitrator, staff noted they  were concerned that no negative comments were recorded on the  computer file since other staff and arbitrators had complained about this  arbitrator\u2019s conduct.

According to SEC\u2019s complaint letter log, of the over 12,000 complaint  letters SEC received from January 1992 through October 2002,  approximately 500 contained a specific reference to arbitration. We  reviewed a random sample of 100 of the letters that referred to arbitration  and found 16 that discussed the arbitration of employment clams. Of the  16, 6 raised concerns about the use of mandatory arbitration to address  employment or employment discrimination claims. The other 10 letters  dealt with a variety of issues, including the amount of time allocated to  address a claim, the scheduling of hearings, and a proposal to limit  damages that can be claimed.", "An SEC official with the division that approves SRO rules said the division  responds to all complaint letters it receives, which are tracked using the  database letter log. The official indicated that when letters register  general discontent with the arbitration process but do not contain a  specific allegation, parties are provided general information about  arbitration, including information on the narrow procedural mechanism  for challenging awards. When letters contain specific allegations, SEC  attorneys contact the SRO or use other means to investigate the allegation  before providing a response. SEC attorneys may also forward a copy of the  letter to the office that oversees periodic inspections, so it can assess the  allegation in its inspection activities.

For example, to ensure  that arbitrators are qualified, SEC staff recommended that one or both  SROs    ensure that they consistently conduct CRD checks of all industry  arbitrators and document those reviews in arbitrator profiles;    ensure that all arbitrator profiles are complete and reflect new or  updated information arbitrators submit about themselves;  lengthen training courses for new arbitrators;  include in arbitrator training manuals guidance on certain arbitration  procedures and certain problems arbitrators are likely to encounter;  and    develop policy on how often arbitrators must attend ongoing training,  the circumstances under which it can be waived, and documentation of  reasons waivers are granted.", "On the basis of our review of SRO documents containing policies and  standard procedures and interviews with SRO officials, we found that each  SRO had taken steps to address SEC\u2019s recommendations. One or both  SROs now require that CRD checks be recorded in arbitrator profiles; have  an online reporting form arbitrators can use to submit updated  information about themselves; and have a basic training course for new  arbitrators, more comprehensive training manuals, and a written policy  regarding ongoing arbitrator training.", "In addition, in recent inspections, SEC staff found that the procedures in  place to track arbitrator performance could be improved. For example,  SEC staff recommended that one or both SROs    ensure that all pertinent information on arbitrator performance,  whether negative or positive, is recorded in a central database and    do more to address complaints of poor arbitrator performance,  including, if appropriate, removing arbitrators from the active pool and  better documenting actions taken in response to complaints of poor  performance.", "SEC staff reported that it appears from recent ongoing and completed  inspections that the SROs have taken steps to address these  recommendations.", "In general, to determine if any issues raised in past inspections remain  unresolved, SEC, at the beginning of each new inspection, reviews  recommendations from prior inspections. SEC is currently inspecting  NASD and will report on the results, including unresolved issues, if any,  within the next year.

All three are responsible for ensuring that the  procedures for arbitrating discrimination and other employment disputes  are fair and the requirements of the Exchange Act are met. Although SEC\u2019s  approval of rules governing arbitration programs and its periodic  inspections of these programs has resulted in improvements, there are  aspects of these programs that deserve closer scrutiny.", "Currently, NASD and NYSE verify the qualifications for those arbitrators  who have worked in the securities industry and neither SRO verifies the  information provided by nonindustry arbitrators.  While we did not find  instances where arbitrators provided false statements of qualifications,  verifying the qualifications of all arbitrator applicants is an important step  in ensuring that employees and employers receive accurate information on  the arbitrators they select to hear their cases. Additionally, while SEC has  reviewed both SROs procedures for evaluating arbitrator performance, we  found evidence that arbitrators are not evaluated on a routine basis.  Although NASD has procedures for peer, party, and staff to evaluate  arbitrators and identify poor performers, these evaluations are not always  completed. While NYSE officials indicated that NYSE has similar  procedures and reported staff generally evaluate active arbitrators at least  once a year, we were unable to confirm this information. Securities  industry employees must use NASD and NYSE arbitration programs to  resolve most employment disputes. Therefore, more effort should be made  to verify that arbitrators meet the qualifications SROs require and to  encourage parties, other arbitrators, and staff to submit evaluations more  regularly, so that only arbitrators who perform adequately are maintained  on SRO rosters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that all NASD and NYSE arbitrators possess the  qualifications required by their SRO, we recommend that the Chairman of  SEC direct NASD and NYSE to verify basic background information of all  new applicants for their arbitrator rosters.

However, SEC believed that in the  absence of any indication that the falsification of information is a problem,  it might not be necessary for NYSE, as a smaller arbitration forum than  NASD, to add this cost to the arbitration process. As a result, SEC  indicated that it should be up to NYSE to decide whether the independent  verification of basic background information of arbitrator applicants is  needed. NASD noted that although it has had no evidence that arbitrators  ever falsified information, it is planning to verify the background  information on all new applicants to increase party confidence in the  accuracy of arbitrator records. NASD reported that a one-time fee for  arbitrator applicants would cover the cost of this procedure. NYSE  reported that since it has found no proof of anyone providing false  information, there is insufficient justification for independently verifying  application information and adding costs to the process. In addition, NYSE  believes that it has already taken steps to ensure that its application  procedures are adequate, such as having applicants affirm that the  information they provide is correct and requiring two recommendation  letters. NYSE also indicated that counsel for employees can and do take  further actions to review the background of arbitrators.", "Despite concerns raised by SEC and NYSE, we continue to believe that  verifying background information for all new arbitrators is an important  part of ensuring the integrity of arbitration, a process required for most  disputes.  While adding costs to the process is a legitimate concern,  NASD\u2019s approach of instituting a one-time application fee of $80 would not  increase the expense of arbitration for the parties involved. Additionally,  the fact that lawyers representing parties are already sometimes verifying  information suggests that verification is valued and further supports the  need for it to be done independently and systematically for all new  arbitrators. Moreover, although our report has focused on the arbitration  of employment cases, a small percentage of all the cases arbitrated in the  securities industry, our recommendation will benefit all parties, since  NASD and NYSE arbitrators are available for both employment and  customer cases.", "Concerning our recommendation that SEC continue to review evaluation  procedures at SROs, SEC, NASD, and NYSE, all indicated that they  understand the importance of evaluating arbitrators. Specifically, SEC  agreed that evaluating arbitrator performance is a fundamental element of  the arbitration process and reported that it will continue to review the  adequacy of procedures for evaluating arbitrator performance during its  inspections of SRO arbitration programs. NASD noted that it would strive  to provide better documentation of the actions it takes in response to  complaints or evaluations.
