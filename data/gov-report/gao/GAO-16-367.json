Advocates meet with children regularly and develop recommendations regarding their care and custody. Approximately 336 children were assigned an advocate in fiscal year 2015\u201497 of them in the three new locations. ORR expects the contractor to provide advocates to an increasing number of children in locations with larger numbers of children in ORR custody, and plans to monitor progress through monthly reports from the contractor.", "Children are referred to the program primarily by shelter staff (care providers), who are expected to use a set of criteria established by ORR to determine eligibility. Once the program contractor receives the referral, it decides if an advocate is available to work with a child and then sends a recommendation to ORR to officially appoint an advocate. However, ORR does not receive a copy of referrals that the contractor is unable to serve. Further, GAO's data analysis shows and the program's contractor reported inconsistent referral practices. Contrary to federal internal control standards, ORR does not monitor referrals by care providers or contractor decisions about which children it serves. As a result, ORR cannot know whether eligible vulnerable children are overlooked.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed said the advocate program gives children a voice during the immigration process and aids decision making regarding their care and custody. However, the contractor said their efforts are hampered by ORR's information sharing policy. GAO found that from fiscal years 2012-2015, more than 70 percent of the 493 recommendations made by advocates were adopted by ORR, immigration courts, and others. However, the contractor said ORR does not provide them with some key information on children. For example, they do not receive significant incident reports that describe behavioral incidents while in ORR care, past abuse or neglect, or other concerns. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 states that child advocates \u201cshall be provided access to materials necessary to effectively advocate.\u201d The contractor said creating recommendations without complete information limits their effectiveness.

Children traveling to the United States from these countries are reportedly  fleeing crime, violence, or extreme poverty and may have undergone  trauma while in their home country or during transit to the United States.  When unaccompanied children are apprehended by the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), most are transferred to the custody of the  Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS). Children transferred to ORR custody are  placed in shelters, foster homes, or other types of facilities that are  operated by ORR-funded care providers until the children can be  released to a sponsor.

With one exception, in each location, we interviewed ORR  care providers, immigration judges, legal services providers, and  volunteer child advocates. In addition, we interviewed headquarters staff  for ORR and the Executive Office for Immigration Review.

The child advocate is to represent what he  or she views as the child\u2019s best interests, and in rare cases, best interests  differ from the child\u2019s expressed wishes.

ORR care providers are  generally limited to referring vulnerable children in the eight locations  where the Young Center has offices, although ORR has care facilities in  additional locations (see fig. 5). For instance, potentially vulnerable  children in ORR custody in areas in northern California, Oregon, and  Washington, where there are ORR care providers, typically do not receive  child advocate services because the Young Center is not located there. In  a small number of cases, the Young Center appointed advocates for  especially vulnerable children in locations where there is no program, and  refers to these as \u201cnational\u201d cases. According to ORR officials, its care  providers and field staff in all locations are given information about how to  make referrals to the Young Center. However, the Young Center serves a  very small number of national cases. In fiscal years 2012 through 2015,  the Young Center provided advocates for 27 national cases, or 3 percent  of total cases served. Further, Young Center staff explained that they  have limited capacity to handle these cases under the new contract.  However, Young Center staff said they expect less demand for national  cases in the future because under the new contract, the Young Center is  expanding to locations where it historically received referrals for national  cases, such as San Antonio.", "In addition to a limited geographical reach, the child advocate program  has not yet aligned the numbers of children served with potential program  demand in certain locations. For example, as of October 2015, ORR\u2019s  capacity was 470 beds in Chicago, 930 beds in New York, and 2,028  beds in Brownsville. However, in fiscal year 2015, the Young Center  served 172 children in Chicago, more than the number of children they  served in New York and Brownsville combined. Young Center staff said  the advocate program began in Chicago and explained that the higher  number of children served in this location is due to a much larger and  more established base of volunteer advocates in the area. Additionally,  since the program began providing advocate services in Chicago in 2004,  the Chicago office has more developed relationships with stakeholders  who regularly refer children to the Young Center.", "ORR officials and Young Center staff expect that the child advocate  program will serve an increasing number of children in locations with  larger bed capacity over time. ORR officials described the child advocate  program as a \u201ccapacity building project\u201d\u2014meaning that as the program  gets up and running in new locations they will obtain the infrastructure  needed to serve additional children.

Young Center staff reported specific targets for  which they are aiming to accomplish this increase. For example, in fiscal  year 2015 the Young Center served 58 children in Brownsville and  anticipates an increase to 75 children in fiscal year 2016. Still, the Young  Center set targets to serve more children in Chicago than other program  locations in fiscal year 2016 (see fig. 6).", "ORR officials said they will review monthly reports from the Young Center  that include details on numbers of referrals to the program and cases  served to monitor the Young Center\u2019s progress towards meeting its  caseload targets.

Our analysis of Young Center data found that among  cases served by the Young Center from fiscal years 2013 through 2015,  nearly 70 percent were referred by care providers (see table 2).", "ORR requires care providers to conduct an assessment of all  unaccompanied children entering ORR custody that covers biographic,  family, legal, medical, and mental health history, among other topics.  Care providers are to use ORR\u2019s child advocate program guidance, which  lists 17 criteria developed by the Young Center and ORR that qualify  children as vulnerable and eligible for advocate services, to help  determine if children should be referred. Referrals are to be submitted  directly to the Young Center which determines whether an advocate is  available to work with the child (see fig. 7). According to Young Center  staff, they have to make decisions about which cases can be staffed,  based on advocate availability, language needs of the child, urgency of  the case, or other factors. After the local Young Center office decides an  advocate is available to work with a child, it sends a recommendation to  ORR headquarters for ORR to officially appoint an advocate for the child.  ORR officials said that because the Young Center has already  determined that advocates are available to work with a child when the  Young Center recommends an advocate appointment, the agency  generally approves the Young Center\u2019s requests. One exception noted by  ORR officials is that requests for Young Center advocates for children  who are released from ORR care are typically not approved, as advocate  appointment is generally limited to children in ORR custody.", "Children served by the Young Center from fiscal years 2012 through 2015  met a range of ORR\u2019s criteria and many children met multiple criteria,  according to our analysis of Young Center data (see fig. 8). For example,  the largest number of unaccompanied children who were appointed  advocates during this time period were referred to the program because  their potential sponsors were undergoing home studies, a possible  indicator that the child\u2019s safety or well-being may be in question (23  percent). Additionally, many children who were appointed advocates  were referred because they were expected to be in ORR custody for 4  months or longer (21 percent), or they were from a country known to  traffic children or identified as trafficking victims (17 percent). Lower  percentages of children were referred to the Young Center and appointed  advocates because they lacked appropriate legal representation or  because they were in a residential treatment center.", "According to Young Center staff, changes in the population of  unaccompanied children in ORR custody over time made it impractical to  rely solely on ORR\u2019s 2011 guidance because many children currently in  custody meet the broad criteria outlined in that guidance. For example,  ORR\u2019s criteria calls for all children under 13 years old to be referred to the  Young Center, and the Young Center used to automatically recommend  advocates for these children. However, Young Center staff told us that  due to the large increase in unaccompanied children entering the United  States, there are so many young children in ORR custody moving quickly  through ORR care that it does not consider age alone to determine  whether a child is vulnerable and should receive an advocate. For  example, according to the Young Center, a young child going to live with  biological parents, with no trauma history or other factors endangering the  child\u2019s safety and well-being, would likely not need a child advocate since  the parent can speak to the child\u2019s best interest.", "In May 2014, the Young Center proposed modified referral criteria  categories, in close consultation with ORR and other stakeholders, to  supplement ORR\u2019s criteria and distributed the modified criteria to care  providers and other stakeholders with ORR\u2019s approval. The Young  Center\u2019s modified criteria categories are intended to help cope with  increases in referrals and address the challenge of screening a changing  and increasing population of children. Specifically, the Young Center  prioritized cases for children who met more than one of ORR\u2019s 17 referral  criteria and added additional vulnerability criteria (see table 3 for  examples).", "Our analysis of Young Center data on cases served from fiscal years  2012 through 2015 found that 489 of 904 children served during this  period were referred for multiple reasons. Further, cases served that met  multiple criteria increased from 44 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 66  percent in fiscal year 2015. These data suggest that the Young Center\u2019s  efforts to supplement ORR\u2019s criteria resulted in more child advocates  appointed to children identified as having multiple vulnerabilities.", "Under ORR\u2019s new child advocate program contract for fiscal year 2016,  the Young Center is required to review and analyze the existing referral  criteria. In addition, it is required to submit monthly reports to ORR  assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the current referral process  and explaining any recommended changes or refinements to the criteria.  ORR officials said they plan to take time to evaluate the Young Center\u2019s  findings and then decide on any needed changes.

The child advocate program relies on other  stakeholders, primarily care providers, to initiate the referral,  according to ORR officials, Young Center staff, and our analysis of  Young Center data. According to ORR policy, care providers shall  refer any unaccompanied child in ORR care to the local child  advocate program within 3 days after the care provider staff discovers  that the child meets any of ORR\u2019s referral criteria. However, ORR  headquarters officials said they prefer to allow care providers to use  their training, knowledge, and judgement to determine which children  need advocates, with the assistance of ORR field staff and the Young  Center. As a result, care providers exercise significant discretion  when deciding which children to refer to the Young Center, according  to Young Center staff. Referrals sometimes depend on the  stakeholders\u2019 working relationship with the Young Center. For  example, when the Young Center advocates on behalf of vulnerable  children, there may be disagreements with care providers on the best  course of action and, at times, care providers have stopped referring  children due to those disagreements, according to Young Center  staff. Young Center staff suggested that to avoid this problem,  children should be automatically referred for advocates if certain  vulnerability criteria listed in ORR\u2019s policy are met, such as trafficking  concerns. Without a better understanding of how care providers make  referral decisions, the Young Center and ORR lack assurance that  eligible, vulnerable children are being referred.", "Inconsistent referral practices. In one program location, ORR field  staff submitted most of the referrals and served a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d role,  causing other stakeholders, including care providers, to make  referrals less often, according to Young Center staff. Our analysis of  Young Center data confirmed that in certain locations, care providers  and other stakeholders submit referrals less often. Specifically, in  fiscal year 2015 ORR field staff in one program location submitted  referrals for 65 percent of cases served by the local Young Center  office. Field staff in other locations submitted referrals for less than 4  percent of cases served by their local Young Center offices. ORR  officials confirmed that referral practices vary by region, stating that in  some locations, ORR field staff ask care providers to submit referrals,  while in other locations, the ORR field staff make the referral. In  locations where care providers and other stakeholders are not  encouraged to make referrals themselves, it is possible that some  vulnerable children may not be referred.", "Unserved referrals. Even with the Young Center\u2019s efforts to modify  referral criteria and prioritize cases, the Young Center continues to  receive referrals for more children than they have the resources to  serve. Five of six care providers we interviewed reported identifying  more vulnerable children in need of child advocate services than the  Young Center can serve. Further, our analysis of program data found  that the Young Center was unable to serve an increasing number of  referred cases. For example, from August 2013 to July 2014, the  Young Center received 279 referrals and was unable to serve 60 of  those cases. From August 2014 to July 2015, the Young Center  received 433 referrals and was unable to serve 116 cases. According  to the Young Center, children referred were not appointed advocates  because no advocates were available or children were released or  transferred before an advocate could begin working with them. For  example, one care provider said that their local Young Center office  was short on volunteer advocates and they experienced an average  wait time of 4 weeks or more for a referral decision from the Young  Center. Care providers in Chicago told us that in one shelter, 30 to 40  percent of children referred to the Young Center left ORR custody  before an advocate could be appointed.", "ORR has not taken steps to monitor initial referrals to the Young Center  to determine the extent to which eligible vulnerable children are referred,  nor has ORR taken steps to monitor which children the Young Center has  determined it is unable to serve. Federal standards for internal control  state that ongoing monitoring should be performed continually, be  ingrained in agency operations, and include regular management and  supervisory activities, comparisons, and reconciliations, among other  actions. ORR officials said they had not monitored referrals to the  Young Center in the past because the child advocate program was a  subcontract under the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) until September 30,  2015.", "Under the new program contract, the Young Center is required to submit  to ORR certain information, including the number of children referred, the  number of children appointed advocates, as well as the reasons those  children were referred and appointed advocates. However, while  collecting this information is useful, it does not include a review of initial  referrals to the Young Center from care providers and others to determine  whether stakeholders decide to refer eligible, vulnerable children. Also,  the information collected does not include a review of the Young Center\u2019s  decisions regarding which children it is unable to serve. Without these  reviews, ORR may not have sufficient data to (1) make informed  decisions about the kinds of vulnerable children care providers should  refer to the Young Center and how consistently referrals should be made,  and (2) ensure the program contractor effectively prioritizes children  recommended for advocate services given limited advocate availability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Child Advocate Program Provides Recommendations to Various Stakeholders, but Faces Challenges Accessing Some Key Information", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Child Advocate Program Develops Recommendations to Promote Children\u2019s Best Interests That Aid Stakeholder Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["The primary benefit of the child advocate program is its best interest  recommendations, according to ORR field staff, immigration judges, and  children\u2019s attorneys we interviewed. The Young Center develops these  recommendations to help ensure a child\u2019s safety and well-being at  different points in their case. Best interest recommendations vary  depending on each child\u2019s circumstances, but generally are to incorporate  information on the child\u2019s history, background, home country conditions,  and the rationale for the recommendations. For example,  recommendations could request that a child receive services while in  ORR custody, express an opinion on the appropriateness of release to a  sponsor, or provide information about whether a child can be safely  returned to their home country. These recommendations give children\u2014 especially those who are unable to make an independent decision due to  young age or trauma\u2014a voice during the immigration process, according  to our interviews with various stakeholders. For example, the Young  Center was appointed as an advocate for a 2-year-old child. When the  Young Center was appointed as advocate, no one had been able to  locate the child\u2019s biological mother. The Young Center gathered  information, located the child\u2019s mother, and learned the mother\u2019s wishes  for her child. Based on that information, the Young Center recommended  to ORR that the child be placed in a long-term foster care home.  According to the Young Center, recommendations are developed using  information gathered during one-on-one meetings with the child, from the  child\u2019s ORR case file, in discussions with the ORR care provider, and  sometimes, with the child\u2019s potential sponsor or family in their home  country.", "We analyzed Young Center program data and found that from fiscal years  2012 through 2015 the child advocate program submitted 493  recommendations to ORR, immigration courts, children\u2019s attorneys, and  others (see table 4). Over 70 percent of these recommendations were  adopted by the entity receiving them. For example, the Young Center  provided 70 recommendations to ORR that advocated for a particular  placement for a child, such as a less restrictive setting or a facility closer  to family members, and 67 percent were adopted.", "ORR field staff, immigration judges, children\u2019s attorneys, and others can  use the information in best interest recommendations to make decisions  about the child\u2019s case. For example, ORR field staff said they rely on  these recommendations to make placement and release decisions,  particularly in complicated cases because the Young Center learns  information about the child that ORR may not be aware of.", "Child Advocate Case Example\u2014Advocacy Related to Placement While in ORR  Custody   The Young Center was appointed as the advocate for an infant, apprehended while in the  care of an adult woman. Due to concerns about the relationship between the woman and  child, the two were separated and the infant was placed in an ORR short-term foster  home. The woman tried to sponsor the child out of ORR custody, initially claiming to be  the child\u2019s biological mother and produced a birth certificate which was later determined to  be counterfeit. Concerned that the child might be a victim of trafficking, the Young Center  initiated an international home study. Through the home study, the Young Center  discovered that the child\u2019s mother did not want a relationship with the child. The mother  had given the child to the woman; however, everything had been done outside of proper  legal channels. The mother did not have any opinions about where the child should be  placed. Faced with this information, the Young Center convened a best interest  determination panel, in order to assess the child\u2019s options. The panel was concerned  about the number of caregivers and separations the child had experienced. The child, who  had been in ORR custody for nearly a year, had formed a strong bond with her foster  family. The panel concluded that it was in the child\u2019s best interests to remain with the  foster family. The Young Center recommended that ORR convert the child\u2019s short-term  foster care placement into a permanent home. ORR agreed with the recommendation and  allowed the foster family to begin the process of making the placement permanent.", "These recommendations also inform attorneys and judges during  immigration court proceedings. Attorneys told us that even though the  recommendations are sometimes different from the child\u2019s expressed  wishes that are represented by their attorney, it is valuable information for  the court. The three immigration judges we interviewed said they  welcomed Young Center best interest recommendations. One judge said  the Young Center provides information she would otherwise be unaware  of and gives her greater assurance she has all the information needed to  move forward with a case.", "The child advocate program also provides support for children during  court proceedings and after release from ORR custody. Child advocates  accompany children to court. An immigration judge and volunteer  advocates told us that court proceedings are intimidating for children.  Volunteer advocates can help prepare children for court proceedings and  explain the legal process in an effort to ease their anxiety. Additionally, an  immigration judge told us he relies on advocates to explain to children  what occurred in court. ORR care providers noted that while they are  required to check in with children one time after their release, the Young  Center can have more frequent contact with unaccompanied children  after their release from ORR custody. For example, after a child is  placed with a sponsor, the Young Center may provide resources to the  child and his or her sponsor, such as assistance finding an attorney, help  with school enrollment, and finding housing for children aging out of care.", "In addition to obtaining stakeholder views on the benefits of the program,  we also asked stakeholders to report any challenges regarding the role of  child advocates. Most commonly, interviewees identified limited capacity  and a need for additional advocates as a shortcoming of the program.  ORR officials mentioned that sometimes the Young Center\u2019s  recommendations are not within the purview of ORR. For example, an  ORR field staff official told us that a Young Center recommendation  requested that she introduce a child to the new medical provider and  counselor at the child\u2019s placement location, which would have been  outside of ORR\u2019s scope of responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Information from ORR Can Hinder Child Advocate Program Efforts", "paragraphs": ["While stakeholders told us they found best interest recommendations  helpful, Young Center staff said their ability to advocate for children is  hampered by ORR\u2019s information sharing policies. Young Center staff we  interviewed at the three program sites reported that obtaining complete  ORR case file information was a challenge and it affected their work with  children and the resulting recommendations. The Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act states that \u201c child advocate shall be  provided access to materials necessary to effectively advocate for the  best interest of the child.\u201d In addition, federal standards for internal  control state that relevant, reliable, and timely information should be  communicated to those who need it in a form and time frame that enables  them to carry out their responsibilities. However, ORR\u2019s policies restrict  access to certain information in children\u2019s case files that describe  children\u2019s past circumstances and current conditions while in ORR care.", "Specifically, child advocates do not have access to significant incident  reports, which Young Center staff described as critical information that  should be factored into its best interest recommendations. Significant  incident reports are prepared by care providers and include information  about abuse or neglect in ORR care, behavioral incidents that threaten  safety, incidences of running away or law enforcement involvement,  pregnancy or pregnancy-related issues, safety measures, past abuse and  neglect, criminal history, or contact or threats to the child while in ORR  care from smuggling syndicates, organized crime, or other criminal  actors. ORR officials told us that significant incident reports may include  information about other children or ORR care provider staff and as a  result, ORR does not provide copies to the Young Center to protect the  confidentiality of the other individuals. ORR\u2019s information sharing policies  allow its care providers to verbally describe information contained in  significant incident reports when requested by the Young Center.  However, Young Center staff told us that crucial information can be lost  when communicated verbally, and they rely on care providers to inform  them if a significant incident report was placed in their assigned child\u2019s  case file. If ORR care providers do not tell the child advocate, the Young  Center will not have that information to help develop their best interest  recommendation.", "ORR does not deny the Young Center access to home study reports, but  the Young Center is required to take several steps to obtain them, which  can affect the timeliness of the advocates\u2019 recommendations. ORR  conducts home studies to evaluate a potential sponsor\u2019s readiness to  support an unaccompanied child upon his or her release from ORR  custody. The Young Center uses home study reports to develop  recommendations related to children\u2019s reunification with potential  sponsors, sometimes at the request of ORR field staff. Although the  Young Center is an ORR contractor, ORR\u2019s policies require that the  Young Center obtain the sponsor\u2019s consent to receive a copy of the home  study (see fig. 9). ORR officials said they require the Young Center to  obtain consent from the child\u2019s sponsor because the agency is concerned  about confidentiality, privacy, and the inadvertent release of sponsor  information. According to Young Center staff, the process for obtaining  home studies is cumbersome and lengthy due to challenges reaching  sponsors to obtain consent. For example, sometimes sponsors need  translation services when they receive a consent form, they may be wary  of an unfamiliar organization requesting information about their family, or  they may lack access to a fax machine to return completed forms. In  addition, Young Center staff said that there are cases where sponsors do  not consent to them receiving a copy of the home study. For example, in  complex cases where there are concerns about the potential sponsor, the  sponsor may not give consent, but those are the types of cases where  best interest recommendations have value. When a sponsor does not  consent to allowing the Young Center to review a home study reports, the  Young Center submits a recommendation to ORR without viewing the  report.", "Developing recommendations without critical information from significant  incident reports and delays in obtaining home study reports as a result of  ORR\u2019s policy affects the completeness of the recommendations,  according to Young Center staff. The Young Center provided an example  in which they had been appointed as advocate for a child that was moved  to a more restrictive ORR care facility as a result of behavioral incidents  while in ORR care. These behavioral incidents were documented in  significant incident reports, and after the move, the child received  additional significant incident reports. However, the child\u2019s care provider  could not provide the Young Center with copies of the reports. According  to the Young Center, without more detailed information about the child\u2019s  behavioral issues, they were unable to provide recommendations on  services that might best meet the child\u2019s needs. In another example  provided by the Young Center, they were appointed as the child advocate  for a 16-year-old girl, who had an extensive history of trauma and abuse.  The child was placed in ORR custody and the child\u2019s uncle sought to  sponsor her out of custody. Because of the child\u2019s extensive trauma  history and a lack of relationship between her and her uncle, ORR  conducted a home study. The Young Center reached out to the child\u2019s  uncle twice to obtain authorization to view the home study report;  however, he declined to provide consent. As a result, the Young Center  was unable to provide ORR a recommendation regarding whether it was  in the child\u2019s best interests to reunify with her uncle. Without relevant and  timely information, the Young Center is unable to fully carry out its  responsibilities.", "As part of the new child advocate program contract that began on  September 30, 2015, ORR plans to work with the Young Center to draft  joint information sharing policies. The contract states that within 180 days  of the contract award, ORR and the Young Center will finalize information  sharing policies. In February 2016, ORR officials told us that the agency  was in the process of updating its information sharing policies, which  could include providing the child advocate program with copies of  significant incident reports and home study reports. Officials said they are  working with the child advocate program to develop procedures for  accessing this information. Officials plan to release new policies by late  April 2016."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The child advocate program provides vulnerable, unaccompanied  children an advocate who is committed to learning their history and  representing their best interests while in custody and during removal  proceedings. As the program expands to the six new locations, additional  children each year will receive help navigating the complex immigration  system. However, because the number of unaccompanied children  arriving in this country has increased significantly in recent years, the  program will continue to serve a very small percentage of the total  number of children in custody. Further, the program will likely continue to  receive more referrals than it can serve; however, ORR has no assurance  that all of the children who need services are being referred. Given this, it  will be important for ORR to monitor program performance through this  expansion and move forward in two key areas. First, by monitoring initial  referrals to the child advocate program, ORR will be better positioned to  know whether referrals are consistently being made by care providers  and field staff. Second, by monitoring the cases that are assigned  advocates by the contractor, ORR will be better able to assess whether  limited resources are being used for the most vulnerable children. Without  taking these steps to ensure thorough and consistent monitoring, ORR  cannot be assured that the child advocate program is operating as  effectively as intended.", "Since its inception, the child advocate program has provided  recommendations to a variety of stakeholders to ensure that the best  interests of hundreds of children are met while in ORR custody and after  their release. Multiple stakeholders agree that these recommendations  are valuable assets that help them determine how best to support the  children.

To address all three objectives, we conducted  interviews with stakeholders that either had experience referring children  to the child advocate program or had received recommendations from the  program. To conduct these interviews, we visited Young Center child  advocate programs in Chicago, Ill., and Washington, D.C., and spoke via  phone with the Brownsville, Tex. program site. The Young Center is  contracted to provide child advocate services for children in ORR  custody. These sites were selected based on variation in the number of  children served, amount of time the advocate program has been  operational, and types of ORR care facilities in operation. In Chicago, we  interviewed staff from three ORR care facilities (two shelters and one  staff-secure facility), one immigration judge, two groups of volunteer child  advocates, and the Young Center\u2019s staff attorneys, social worker, and  management team. In the Washington, D.C. area, we interviewed staff  from one ORR facility with secure and staff-secure beds, one immigration  judge, and Young Center staff attorneys. For the Brownsville, Tex. area,  we interviewed care providers from two ORR facilities (one foster  program and one shelter), one immigration judge, one group of volunteer  child advocates, and Young Center staff attorneys. In addition, we  interviewed three legal services providers\u2014located in Chicago, Ill.,  Corpus Christi, Tex., and Washington, D.C.\u2014that had experience  representing children with an advocate. We also interviewed staff from  the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the U.S. Committee for  Refugees and Immigrants\u2014the two organizations that operated  temporary child advocate programs for children released from ORR  custody in fiscal year 2015. The information obtained from these  interviews is not generalizable.", "To address all three objectives, we also interviewed ORR headquarters  and field staff. In addition, we interviewed headquarters staff for the  Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review,  including the Assistant Chief Immigration Judge for Vulnerable  Populations. We reviewed ORR documents, such as child advocate  program policies and contracts that provided funding to the Young Center  to operate the child advocate program. We also reviewed relevant federal  laws and regulations, including the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2013 and the William Wilberforce Trafficking  Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008.", "To address our first and second objective, we analyzed data on cases  served by the Young Center\u2019s child advocate program from fiscal year  2012 through fiscal year 2015, the four most recent years for which data  were available. These case data included information on children\u2019s age,  gender, country of origin, reasons they were referred to the program, and  the source of those referrals. To prepare the data on reasons children  were referred to the program for analysis, one analyst reviewed the data  and assigned a code for each reason children were referred. Codes for  each referral reason were based on categories of vulnerable,  unaccompanied children established in ORR and Young Center referral  guidance. In many cases children were referred to the program for  multiple reasons and multiple codes were assigned to their case. A  second analyst verified the coding to ensure reasons for referral were  coded consistently. A third analyst conducted a final review and resolved  any disputes over the appropriate codes. We also analyzed data on the  number of cases the Young Center was unable to serve from August  2013 through September 2015. The Young Center did not track this  information consistently for all program locations prior to August 2013.  The data on unserved cases included information on children\u2019s age,  gender, the Young Center location that was unable to serve the case, and  the reason the Young Center was unable to serve the case. Additionally,  we analyzed data from ORR on care providers that included information  on the locations and types of care provider facilities, numbers of children  each facility could house, and numbers of children in custody in each  facility as of October 2015. We compiled information from ORR\u2019s data on  facilities in current and proposed Young Center sites to determine (1) how  many children could be cared for in each location, and (2) how many  children were in custody in each location. We also used publically  available ORR data on the number of children released to sponsors by  county in fiscal year 2015 and data on counties included in metropolitan  areas from the United States Census Bureau to determine how many  children were released in the same metropolitan areas as current and  proposed Young Center sites.", "To address our third objective, we analyzed information collected on  formal best interest recommendations the Young Center provided to a  variety of stakeholders from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015.

The recommendations information we analyzed included all  written recommendations from fiscal years 2012 through 2015 and some  verbal recommendations tracked by the Young Center and provided to  stakeholders in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Therefore, the information we  analyzed likely does not capture all of the Young Center\u2019s formal best  interest recommendations from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. The  recommendation information included the number of recommendations  made; types of decision makers that received recommendations (such as  immigration judges, attorneys, ORR, etc.); key issues on which  recommendations were provided (such as release, placement, legal relief,  repatriation, etc.); and the outcome of those recommendations (such as  adopted, adopted in part, or declined). In addition to formal best interest  recommendations, the Young Center makes informal recommendations  to decision makers; however, we did not analyze information related to  informal recommendations. Additionally, in some instances one  recommendation was submitted to multiple stakeholders; however, the  data identified the primary recipient of the recommendation and did not  include information on additional recipients.", "The case and recommendation data were provided by the Young Center.  We assessed the reliability of the case and recommendation data by (1)  performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing  information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3)  interviewing knowledgeable Young Center staff about the data.
