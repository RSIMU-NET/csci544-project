In 1989, Congress excluded from administrative expenses certain costs associated with military personnel who work on the FMS program as well as unfunded civilian retirement and other benefits.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has some controls to manage the account balance. For example, DSCA has established a method for calculating a minimum desired balance to ensure it has sufficient funds to complete FMS cases despite uncertain future sales. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the account balance was $2.7 billion above this minimum. DSCA, however, has completed rate reviews less frequently than directed by its policy. Moreover, DSCA has not adopted the best practice of setting an upper bound for the account that would, along with the minimum level, provide a target range for the account balance. By not performing timely rate reviews or setting an upper bound, DSCA has limited its ability to prevent excessive balance growth. GAO modeling indicates that, even with a planned fee rate reduction to 3.2 percent, the account balance would likely remain above its minimum level through fiscal year 2024, including if annual expenditures increased by 15 percent more than expected. As such, the account has the potential to pay for additional expenses. These could include expenses first excluded by statute in 1989 at a time when the account balance was negative and which have since been paid from other appropriated funds. DOD told GAO it is willing to revisit these exclusions.", "The FMS contract administration services (CAS) account grew from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 from $69 million to $981 million, due in part to insufficient management controls, including not setting an upper bound. The balances for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 overstated the amount of funds available due to a systems issue and limited related oversight. Since 2014, DSCA has implemented some controls for the CAS account, such as regular reviews of the account balance, but weaknesses remain. In particular, DSCA does not plan to follow its internal guidance to conduct the next CAS fee rate review within 5 years. DSCA also has inconsistently calculated the desired minimum level for the account. Finally, DSCA has not set an upper bound for the account to help officials follow internal guidance that directs them to determine when the balance is excessive and a fee rate reduction should be considered.

Thus, as sales have grown on  average over recent years, the amount of these upfront collections made  on cases and the amount of expenditures that would be needed to work  on these cases have also grown.

As enacted in 1976, the provision of the act  that authorized the collection of administrative fees required that sales  contracts include appropriate fees for administrative services to recover  the full estimated costs of the administration of sales made under the  act. Subsequently, Congress amended the act to exclude some  expenses from the administrative fee. In particular, according to a House  report and DOD testimony, to avoid raising the administrative fee at a  time when annual sales were low and the account was insolvent,  Congress, at DOD\u2019s request, amended the act in 1989 to exclude from  the administrative fee certain expenses associated with military personnel  who work on the FMS program as well as the estimated costs of  unfunded civilian retirement and other benefits.", "Since then, these expenses\u2014with one exception for fiscal year 2000\u2014 have been funded with other appropriated funds rather than with foreign  partners\u2019 administrative fees. For fiscal year 2000, Congress required  DOD to recover expenses attributable to salaries of members of the  Armed Forces and the unfunded estimated costs of civilian retirement and  other benefits by including them in the administrative fee, resulting in  $52 million in additional FMS administrative expenses, or 13.5 percent of  total FMS administrative expenses, for that year. Applying the same  percentage, these costs would approximate $119 million in fiscal year  2017; however, DOD does not track the costs of military pay or unfunded  civilian retirement and other benefits for FMS, so the current value of  these costs is unknown. Our modeling shows that, even if DSCA were to  decrease the administrative fee rate an additional 0.3 percent lower than  it plans to effective June 2018 and annual expenditures increased as high  as 15 percent above expected levels, the account balance would likely  remain sufficient through at least fiscal year 2024. By then, DSCA would  have had an opportunity to reassess the fee rate through another  comprehensive rate review. The circumstances of the administrative  account balance have changed substantially since the 1980s.

However, for the years when the safety level was  calculated, the calculation was performed differently than what is  prescribed in the MICP guidance. For example, for fiscal year 2017, the  DSCA official in charge of managing the CAS account stated the method  was modified to be based on the amount of obligation authority (or total  CAS budget) instead of the amount of disbursements.

However, in the absence of an upper  bound for the account, it is up to the judgment of DSCA officials to  determine when the account is excessive. DSCA officials told us that they  were reluctant to set an upper bound for the account due to uncertainty  regarding future sales and future CAS expenditures. Nevertheless, as  with the safety level, an upper bound could be based on a certain number  of months or years in expenditures and could be flexible and adjusted  over time.

These conditions limit DSCA\u2019s ability to appropriately  target the fee rate and to protect against excessive growth in the account  balance. Our analysis demonstrates that the administrative account is  likely to stay above its safety level even if the rate were reduced to as low  as 2.9 percent and expenditures from the account were raised by 15  percent, signifying there should be even more room for the account to  absorb increased expenditures now that DSCA has announced that the  rate will be reduced to 3.2 percent as of June 1, 2018. Thus, this account  should now have sufficient funds to pay for additional expenses that are  currently paid from appropriated funds, such as those excluded by  statute.

This technique approximates the likelihood of  certain outcomes by performing multiple trial runs, called simulations,  using random variables within a specified range. The simulations capture  the volatility of sales in the projection of the future balance of the  administrative account. We determined to report projections through fiscal  year 2024 for two main reasons. First, there is increasing uncertainty for  longer-term projections. Second, by then, DSCA should have had an  opportunity to reassess the fee rate through another comprehensive rate  review, given that the current review is to be completed in fiscal year  2018 and DSCA policy requires such reviews every 5 years.", "To construct our baseline model, we used the 3.5 percent administrative  fee rate, which was current during the period of our review. We also used  historical annual sales and appropriations data provided by the Defense  Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and annual administrative account  collections, expenditures, and balance data provided by the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). To assess the reliability of the  data provided by both DSCA and DFAS, we interviewed officials from  both agencies, performed manual error checks on the data, and reviewed  relevant documents from DOD and other sources, including DSCA\u2019s  annual assessments of the administrative account and congressional  appropriations laws dating back to fiscal year 2000. In addition, for  collections data, we cross-checked the data provided by DFAS with  reports the agency provided to DSCA on administrative fees owed on  cases implemented since fiscal year 2000 as well as checked for any  anomalies in the data. Through this process, we found errors in the way a  key variable in these reports was pulled for data on cases prior to March  2013. We did not find such errors in the data for fiscal years 2014 to  2017, which led us to only using data on the status of cases in fiscal  years 2014 to 2017 in our modeling. We did not conduct independent  testing or an audit of DSCA or DFAS data. We found these specific data  to be sufficiently reliable for use in our modeling.", "We conducted 10,000 simulations for each year using the following  parameters:", "Sales: We used annual sales data from fiscal years 2000 to 2017 and  the Monte Carlo methodology to build an annual sales distribution for  fiscal years 2018 to 2024. We chose to review this number of fiscal  years of data based on availability of reliable data. For that  distribution, we assumed a uniform distribution with a minimum  possible sales value of $15 billion and a maximum of $47 billion,  which has an equal probability of annual sales values falling anywhere  within that range. A uniform distribution was selected because, as  compared to other potential distributions (e.g., normal, triangular), it  more accurately reflected the current reality of annual sales, including  the increasing trend seen since fiscal year 2000 and the jump in sales  seen in fiscal year 2006. Although annual sales have grown steadily  over time with values of at least $27.8 billion since fiscal year 2008,  DSCA officials explained that the FMS market could shrink at any time  based on global geopolitical and economic factors. As a result, we  took a cautious approach to determining the minimum level of our  sales projections by allowing for the possibility of annual sales  dropping to $15 billion in each year. We set our maximum possible  sales value at $47 billion to reflect the second highest sales value  between fiscal years 2000 and 2017. Sales in fiscal year 2012 were  $69 billion due in large part to one large purchase made by Saudi  Arabia. We excluded this as a possible maximum value in future years  due to DSCA officials\u2019 explanation that this high value of sales was  considered an exception. We also do not take into account any time  trend effects such as inflation, technological advances, or new product  development that could increase the value of future annual sales. The  uniform distribution used in the model produces average sales of  $30.8 billion, with a standard deviation of $9.2 billion, while the  average sales from fiscal years 2006 through 2017 were $36.4 billion,  with a standard deviation of $12.1 billion.", "Collections: First, to calculate collections on ongoing cases for fiscal  years 2018 to 2024, we used administrative account collections data  from fiscal years 2010 to 2017, a schedule of the average percentage  of administrative fee collections for each year in the life of an FMS  case, and administrative fee rates from fiscal years 2010 to 2017. To  develop an average collection schedule for cases, we used a DFAS  report that shows the percentage of the administrative fee that should  have been collected in each year on each case implemented in fiscal  years 2008 to 2017. To address the inaccuracies in the data in this  report prior to March 2013, we developed a schedule of the average  rate of collections in each of the first 9 years of case implementation  by summing the pertinent amounts of the administrative fee that  should have been paid on cases divided by the total amounts of the  administrative fee owed on cases implemented in fiscal years 2008 to  2017 as of fiscal years 2014 to 2017. We excluded from the  collections schedule the large sale made to Saudi Arabia in fiscal year  2012 because that case had a reduced first-year collection rate that  skewed the first-year average. This 9-year collection schedule  accounts for about 91 percent of total expected collections on cases.", "We then calculated expected collections for new cases in a given year  by multiplying the dollar value of sales in that year by the average  collection rate for the first year of a case and the applicable fee rate.  Finally, we added new and ongoing collections to arrive at total  collections projected for each year.", "Expenditures: We used administrative account expenditure and  collection data from fiscal years 2006 to 2017 to develop a regression  model to project administrative account collections in fiscal years  2018 to 2024. We used available data from fiscal years 2006 to 2017  to produce an estimate of the relationship between collections and  expenditures, employing a simple linear regression model where the  dependent variable was expenditures against collections, a linear time  trend, and a constant. We chose to review this number of fiscal years  of data based on availability of reliable data. We then used the  coefficients from the regression model to estimate future expenditures  against simulated collections and a time trend. As designed, to  provide a cautious estimate of future expenditures, this model  reflected an overall increasing trend in expenditures even when  annual sales simulated in future years did not increase on average.", "Safety level: The administrative account safety level is established  each year by DSCA as the minimum balance required to continue  operations and respond to potential volatility in the FMS market.  DSCA calculates the account\u2019s annual safety level as 18 months of  operational funding, as determined by the congressional obligation  limit, which has been annually set in the foreign operations  appropriation since 1992. To project the administrative account  safety level for fiscal years 2018 to 2024, we used the congressional  obligation limit for the administrative account from fiscal years 2000 to  2017, as reported by DSCA, to develop a simple regression model  where the dependent variable was the obligation limit against a linear  time trend and a constant. We chose to review this number of fiscal  years of data based on availability of reliable data. Then, based on  DOD guidance, we divided the projected obligation limit by 12 and  multiplied it by 18 to calculate the projected safety level. This  regression model projects steady growth in the obligation limit and  therefore steady growth in the safety level every year. The same  projected safety level applies to all simulations for each year so that  we can apply a consistent threshold against which to compare the  account balance, although some simulations involved lower future  sales, which could lead to lower future expenditures and hence lower  safety levels.", "Finally, using these parameters, we calculated the administrative account  balance for each year by adding the net income projected for that year  (that year\u2019s projected collections minus that year\u2019s projected  expenditures) to the previous year\u2019s account balance. All of our estimated  projections are in nominal dollars.", "Building upon the baseline projection, we conducted 10,000 simulations  for each year for seven additional scenarios: three in which the  administrative fee rate is reduced from the current 3.5 percent to as low  as 2.9 percent, three in which annual expenditures are increased as high  as 15 percent above expected levels, and one in which both changes  occur (see table 1). We modeled decreases of the fee rate to as low as  2.9 percent to look at the effect of a wide range of possibilities lower than  the current rate. We modeled increases in annual expenditures of up to  15 percent above typical growth because this amount is a little higher  than 1.5 times the average annual growth in expenditures between fiscal  years 2007 and 2017 (9.3 percent). As such, our model accounted for the  potential of large sustained expenditure growth. Finally, we modeled the  effects of adjusting both levers to the maximum extent through a scenario  with a 2.9 percent fee rate and a 15 percent increase above expected  annual expenditures. Using the account balance and safety level  projections for each scenario, we assessed the likelihood of the balance  dropping below the safety level in each year through fiscal year 2024."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Results", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Baseline Scenario", "paragraphs": ["In the baseline scenario, we projected what would happen to the  administrative account balance if the fee rate were to remain 3.5 percent  and expenditures were to remain stable based on historical data.
