DOD\u2019s instruction also requires the military services to determine the  estimated cost of workloads to sustain the core capability requirement.", "The instruction describes a series of mathematical computations and  adjustments that the military services are required to use to compute their  core capability requirements, and to identify the projected workload  needed to support these requirements. Specifically, the instruction  requires that the military services identify the weapon systems required to  execute the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s strategic and  contingency plans, which, among other things, guide the use and  employment of the military forces across all geographic regions and  sustain military efforts over different durations of time. After the systems  are identified, the military services compute annual depot maintenance  capability requirements for peacetime, in direct labor hours, to represent  the amount of time they will regularly take to execute required  maintenance. A military service may adjust calculated direct labor hours  to address redundant capability requirements that are so similar to one  another that they share common base repair processes.", "DOD tracks core capability requirements using the following two metrics: direct labor hours, each of which represents 1 hour of effort directly  allocated to a category of work; and work breakdown structure categories, which bundle types of work  according to weapon systems and equipment.", "DOD uses work breakdown structure categories to organize data on its  various core capability requirements and workloads, as well as to manage  and report on its core capabilities. There are 10 first-level work  breakdown structure categories, and these in turn are broken down into  second-level subcategories, which are the major elements that make up  the system or equipment in the first-level category. Figure 1 shows the 10  first-level categories of DOD\u2019s work breakdown structure. For the full work  breakdown structure, see appendix IV.", "Finally, the instruction requires the military services to provide a reason  for all projected shortfalls, strategies to mitigate the effects of each  projected shortfall, and actions taken by the services to rectify any  projected workload or capability shortfall. A projected shortfall exists if a  military service does not expect to have sufficient workload to sustain the  required level of capability that has been identified. For example, an  armed service may have identified 10,000 direct labor hours of core  capability requirements for ground vehicles, but have only 4,000 hours of  projected depot maintenance work for ground vehicles\u2014resulting in a  projected workload shortfall of 6,000 hours."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Biennial Core Reports and Our Prior Reviews", "paragraphs": ["In 2012 DOD submitted its first biennial core report to Congress, and we  found that DOD did not provide sufficient explanations when reporting on  the military services\u2019 shortfalls in core capability requirements.

Specifically, DOD  updated requirements for reporting depot resources associated with  upgrading and maintaining software in weapon systems. According to  the Army\u2019s 2018 core report submission, the Army previously  determined this requirement based on the number of people assigned  to the Army\u2019s software sustainment activities. However, the Army  revised its methodology for calculating its software sustainment  workload to reflect actual workload, not just the number of people  conducting the work.", "After identifying projected shortfalls, officials used that information to  determine how best to close gaps and mitigate risks in future  implementation. Specifically, the Army is currently working to move  software-related direct labor hours from contractor to military sources,  which will help the Army mitigate\u2014that is, shrink\u2014its projected shortfall  by fiscal year 2020. The Army reported that it plans to mitigate many of its  projected core shortfalls by using skill sets similar to those required for maintaining a core capability in repairing equipment for foreign militaries.  Officials stated that the Army plans to hire and train maintenance  personnel to conduct maintenance work associated with the foreign  military sales program. This workload will also assist the Army in meeting  its core capability requirements for Army systems, increasing the total  projected workload, and decreasing estimated shortfalls. Additionally, the  Army identified mitigations for specific shortfalls\u2014for example, replacing  old generators with a new system by fiscal year 2025 will mitigate its  shortfall in support equipment.", "Navy: The Navy reported that it did not project an overall shortfall, nor did  it project any shortfalls at the first- or second-level of the work breakdown  structure, and therefore it did not provide mitigation plans. Navy and OSD  officials noted that the Navy and the department differ regarding the  definition of software sustainment. Specifically, a Navy official stated that  the service views software sustainment as an engineering function, not a  depot maintenance function. This official observed that while the Navy  believes software sustainment to be critical to maintaining its weapon  systems, it believes that managing software sustainment as depot  maintenance is not the most effective approach for the Navy. As a result,  the Navy did not report any software core capability requirement or  projected workload for fiscal year 2019. OSD defined software  maintenance and reporting requirements in its guidance requesting data  from the military services for the biennial core report.

The Marine Corps identified a  rationale and mitigation plan for its projected shortfall in construction  equipment. The Marine Corps reported that general factors affecting  maintenance workload and funding contributed to the shortfall, including:  (1) After drawdowns from Iraq and Afghanistan, the Marine Corps  repaired equipment to a desired level of combat effectiveness in line with  current mission requirements and available resources. This led to fewer  current maintenance needs and therefore reduced core maintenance  workloads, creating projected shortfalls in some skill sets; and (2) The  Marine Corps made changes to its force structure, which led to having  more equipment in inventory, less equipment in use, and therefore less  required maintenance. This created a shortfall in the skill set for  construction equipment. To address this shortfall, the Marine Corps plans  to use the excess workload in amphibious vehicles to mitigate the  projected shortfall in construction equipment. Marine Corps officials  stated that these second-level subcategories involve similar, tracked  vehicles, which can be maintained using the same skill set.", "Air Force: The Air Force reported that it did not project a total shortfall, but  did project shortfalls within the work breakdown structure, as shown in  table 4. The Air Force identified projected overall shortfalls in 1 of the 10  first-level work breakdown structure categories, and in 7 of the 33  second-level work breakdown structure categories.", "The Air Force identified reasons and provided detailed explanations, as  well as mitigation plans, for each projected shortfall. For example, it  projected a shortfall in rotary workload according to Air Force officials  because of staffing and supply issues with HH-60 Pave Hawk  maintenance at Corpus Christi Army Depot. According to these officials,  these maintenance issues have resulted in the Air Force\u2019s using more  contracted depot maintenance work on the HH-60 Pave Hawk in order to  meet demand. As a result of the more extensive contracting of  maintenance, planned workload at Corpus Christi Army Depot has been  reduced, thereby creating a projected shortfall. The Air Force, Army, and  Navy formed a team to address this projected shortfall. Air Force officials  stated that contracts are being reduced and that they expect to resolve  the maintenance issues before the 2020 Biennial Core Report. To  address its projected shortfall in tactical missiles, the Air Force plans to  identify Letterkenny Army Depot as the Technology Repair Center for this  requirement, as the workloads are small in volume and the Letterkenny  Army Depot can meet this requirement. In addition, the Air Force  projected an overage of about 176,000 direct labor hours in strategic  missiles. The Air Force believes that its projected workload in strategic  missiles will allow it to maintain capability to repair tactical missiles\u2014an  area in which it projects a shortfall of about 42,000 direct labor hours.

Officials with OASD L&MR said that the  May 2018 updated version of DOD Instruction 4151.20 was revised to  require the submission of a detailed rationale for any and all shortfalls,  and a plan to either correct or mitigate the effects of the shortfalls. The  instruction states further that the detailed rationale and plan will identify  the reason for the shortfall; contain a strategy to mitigate the effects of the  shortfall (for example, specific transferrable workload, transfer of private- sector workload); and include actions to rectify any capability or workload  shortfalls, including a description of planned capital investment, timing,  and planned workarounds until the new capabilities or workloads are  available. DOD\u2019s 2018 Biennial Core Report as previously discussed  provided rationales for shortfalls.", "Second, in our review of the 2014 Biennial Core Report, we found that  some data were incomplete. We recommended that DOD review its  processes and implement needed improvements to help ensure accuracy  and completeness. In response to this and our other prior  recommendations, DOD updated DOD Instruction 4151.20 to include  additional steps and more controls that ensure more complete and  accurate data submissions. According to OSD officials, changes to the  guidance included deleting data fields unrelated to core requirements;  streamlining and clarifying reporting instructions; ensuring that service  submissions be reviewed and approved by general, flag, or senior  executive service officials; determining the weapon systems or other platforms that are in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff strategic  and contingency plans; addressing inter-service workloads; having the  worksheet automatically calculate shortfalls; and defining \u201csoftware\u201d and  \u201csoftware maintenance.\u201d", "Most recently, in our review of the 2016 Biennial Core Report, we found  (1) data errors; (2) inconsistent capture of inter-service workloads across  the military services; (3) inconsistent calculations or transpositions of  projected workload shortfalls across the military services; and (4)  inconsistent calculations of the estimated cost of projected workloads  across the military services.

This law required the Department of  Defense (DOD) to maintain a logistics capability to ensure a ready and  controlled source of technical competence and resources. In 1988  Congress codified this law, as amended, at section 2464 of title 10 of the  U.S. Code. While section 2464 has been amended multiple times since  then, the requirement for DOD to maintain a core logistics capability that  is government-owned and government-operated has persisted. In 2011  Congress added a requirement for DOD to provide a biennial core report.  Most recently, in fiscal year 2018 Congress added additional elements  that DOD is required to address in its biennial core reports. Among other  things, changes to the statute are illustrated in figure 2 below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Section 2464(d) of Title 10 of the United States Code requires the  Department of Defense (DOD), among other things, to submit to  Congress a biennial report providing information on its core depot-level  maintenance and repair capability requirements and workload.  Specifically, section 2464(d) identifies 10 elements that DOD must  address for each of the armed services (except for the Coast Guard) in its  biennial report concerning depot-maintenance requirements and  workload. Section 2464 also requires us to review DOD\u2019s report for  compliance with section 2464 and assess the completeness of the  report. DOD submitted its most recent biennial core report to Congress  on May 23, 2018.", "To determine the extent to which the DOD 2018 Biennial Core Report  complies with section 2464(d), we analyzed the text of the report and  obtained supporting information on DOD\u2019s process to determine its core  maintenance capability for fiscal year 2019. Two GAO analysts  independently reviewed DOD\u2019s report to determine the extent to which it  addressed each element required by the statute. All initial disagreements  between the two GAO analysts were discussed and resolved through  consensus. For the military services, when the report explicitly included  all parts of the required reporting element, we determined that DOD  \u201caddressed\u201d the element. When the report did not explicitly include any  part of the element, we determined that DOD \u201cdid not address\u201d the  element. If the report included some aspects of an element, but not all,  then we determined that DOD \u201cpartially addressed\u201d the element. We  compared the types of information and data provided by each of the  military services with the data that the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD) included in the 2018 Biennial Core Report, to assess consistency.  We also discussed our preliminary analyses with OSD and military  service officials to gain additional insight into their analysis and efforts to  address the statutory requirements.", "To assess the report\u2019s completeness, we obtained and analyzed the fiscal  year 2019 data used in compiling DOD\u2019s 2018 Biennial Core Report,  including core capability requirements and projected sustaining workload  expressed in direct labor hours and cost and other information, such as  workload shortfall explanations. We compared the reporting agencies\u2019  submissions with the reporting template in DOD Instruction 4151.20 in  order to determine the extent to which the reporting agencies submitted  the information required by DOD\u2019s instruction, and we identified any  inconsistencies or errors. In order to determine whether these data and  information were complete, we performed a number of data check steps  to identify transposition inconsistencies or errors, and we discussed our  analyses with OSD and military service officials. These steps included (1)  reviewing each military service\u2019s submission to verify that it had  consistently calculated and reported the direct labor hours identified as  the total adjusted requirements and the workload needed to sustain depot  maintenance core capability requirements; and (2) reconciling the  information in the report against each military service\u2019s submission, for  accuracy. However, as in the past reviews of DOD\u2019s biennial core reports,  we did not assess the reliability of the underlying data provided by the  military services for the 2018 DOD Biennial Core Report. The team also  met with OSD and reporting agency officials responsible for overseeing  the data collection and preparing the data submissions, to obtain  clarification and understanding of the content of the submissions, as well  as to discuss the department\u2019s guidance and processes used to collect  the data for the report. Lastly, we reviewed DOD\u2019s actions to address our  prior recommendations that were targeted at improving the completeness  of DOD\u2019s biennial report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2018 to November 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
