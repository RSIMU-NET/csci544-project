GAO examines (1) recent housing market developments, (2) risks and challenges posed by the current federal role, including ongoing conservatorship, and (3) housing finance reform proposals and their strengths and limitations.", "To address these issues, GAO reviewed housing finance data; FHFA and enterprise reports; and 14 housing finance reform proposals introduced in Congress or proposed by industry stakeholders since 2014. GAO also convened panels with housing finance experts and stakeholders (including consumer advocates, mortgage originators, insurers, and investors), who developed reform proposals, testified before Congress, or participated in prior GAO studies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal support of the housing finance market remains significant even though the market has largely recovered since the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis.

For example, mortgage lending standards have loosened slightly in recent years, which could increase the risk of borrower default\u2014especially in a recession or downturn in the housing market\u2014and losses to federal entities. Nonbanks have increased their presence in mortgage lending and servicing, which involves collecting monthly mortgage payments, among other duties. For instance, the share of nonbank originations of FHA-insured mortgages increased from 56 percent in fiscal year 2010 to 86 percent in 2017. The share of nonbank servicers of mortgages in enterprise MBS also grew from 25 percent in 2014 to 38 percent as of the third quarter of 2018. While nonbank lenders and servicers have helped provide access to mortgage credit, they are not subject to federal safety and soundness regulations.", "The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has taken actions to lessen some of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's risk exposure. For example, under FHFA's direction, the enterprises have reduced the size of their riskier retained mortgage portfolios which hold assets that expose them to considerable interest rate and other risks from a combined $1.6 trillion in 2008 to $484 billion in 2017. Since 2013, the enterprises also have transferred increasing amounts of risk on their guaranteed MBS to private investors and insurers through credit risk transfer programs. However, federal fiscal exposure remains significant. The Department of the Treasury's remaining funding commitment through the senior preferred stock purchase agreements\u2014which provide financial support to the enterprises\u2014leaves taxpayers exposed to risk, especially in the event of adverse market or other conditions and given the recent growth in the enterprises' guarantee business. The value of outstanding MBS on which the enterprises guarantee principal and interest payments to investors grew from about $2.1 trillion in 2003 to about $4.8 trillion in 2017. The long duration of the conservatorships also raises uncertainty among market participants. Several experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed said that they have hesitated to make longer-term strategic plans and goals due to potential housing finance reforms that could markedly affect their industries.

The proposals generally fit into four different models: reconstituted enterprises, a multiple guarantor system with an explicit federal guarantee, a government corporation, and a completely privatized market without an explicit federal guarantee. The 14 proposals generally meet key elements of GAO's framework for assessing potential changes to the housing finance system, such as addressing fiscal exposure, protecting investors, and considering the implications of the transition to a new system. However, many proposals lack clearly defined and prioritized goals or do not address the role of other federal entities in the housing finance system, such as FHA and Ginnie Mae\u2014two key elements in GAO's framework.

Examining delinquency rates for mortgages by origination  year reveals significant differences for mortgages originated before and  after the financial crisis. According to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  reports, mortgages originated since 2009 have had lower delinquency  rates than those originated before 2009.

During 2008\u20132017,  total mortgage origination volume\u2014the dollar value of mortgage loans\u2014 remained below pre-crisis levels. Much of the decrease in volume  resulted from large declines in prime jumbo and nonprime originations  since 2008. Prime jumbo and nonprime originations represented a  significant share of originations (market share) before 2007 but declined  sharply since 2008. Prime jumbo market share recovered somewhat,  increasing from a low of 6 percent in 2009 to approximately 18 percent of  originations each year since 2014. Riskier nonprime originations remain  very low compared to their pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile, federally  insured mortgages (such as those insured by FHA or guaranteed by VA)  grew significantly in 2008 and retained a market share between 19 and  25 percent in 2008\u20132017.

Government-insured  mortgages declined leading up to the financial crisis, largely due to the  availability of nonprime mortgages and securitization by fully private  institutions. But when the availability of these products declined sharply,  government agencies such as FHA and VA insured or guaranteed  significantly higher volumes of mortgages. For instance, the share of  mortgages insured or guaranteed by federal agencies grew from 6  percent ($134 billion) in 2007 to more than 20 percent ($328 billion) in  2008. As of 2017, federally insured mortgages were 25 percent ($444  billion) of total originations. Similarly, as the share of conventional  mortgages held in banks\u2019 portfolios declined during the financial crisis, the  enterprises purchased and securitized large volumes of these  mortgages. The share of mortgage originations purchased by the  enterprises peaked at 65 percent in 2008 and still accounted for nearly  half of new mortgages in 2017.", "The federal government also has maintained a very substantial role in the  secondary mortgage market since the financial crisis. The enterprises and  Ginnie Mae guaranteed around 95 percent or more of all MBS issued  each year since 2008, despite a nearly decade-long economic expansion.  In line with the rise in federally insured originations, Ginnie Mae\u2019s market  share increased substantially, from 5 percent ($110 billion) in 2007 to 22  percent ($301 billion) in 2008, and about 33 percent ($455 billion) in 2017  (see fig. 6). Conversely, private-label MBS issuance since 2008 has  been minimal, as many private-label issuers left the market and nonprime  originations declined.", "The growth in the market share of Ginnie Mae and the enterprises  resulted in part from actions by Congress and the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Congress increased the  loan limits for FHA-insured loans and loans eligible for securitization by  the enterprises.

Specifically, average combined loan-to-value ratios (for all loans on the  property) and debt-to-income ratios have increased, while average  borrower credit scores have declined.

As discussed earlier in the report, mortgages originated since 2009 have  performed much better than those originated before 2008, but remain  untested by a large-scale stressful economic event.", "Furthermore, mortgages to refinance an existing mortgage (as opposed  to mortgages for purchasing a home) declined since 2012. According to  FHFA officials, credit scores, loan-to-value ratios, and debt-to-income  ratios tend to be stronger for refinance mortgages than purchase  mortgages. FHFA and HUD officials also told us that reduced refinancing  volume due to rising interest rates may put additional pressure on lenders  to maintain volume and profitability by offering more relaxed credit terms  to borrowers.", "Average combined loan-to-value ratios for mortgages purchased by the  enterprises peaked in 2014 and have remained roughly similar to pre- crisis levels (see fig.7). In December 2014, FHFA began allowing the  enterprises to purchase mortgages with loan-to-value ratios up to 97  percent. In the first three quarters of 2018, 22 percent of mortgages  Fannie Mae purchased included a loan-to-value ratio over 90 percent,  which is higher than shares in 2005\u20132008. FHA\u2019s loan-to-value ratio is  limited to 96.5 percent, and the average among borrowers has remained  relatively consistent around 93 percent since 2008. The higher the loan- to-value ratio when a loan is originated, the less equity borrowers will  have in their homes and the more likely they are to default on mortgage  obligations, especially during times of financial stress or falling home  values. Additionally, house price valuation\u2014measured by the price-to- rent ratio\u2014has increased substantially since 2012 to levels last seen in  2004. Higher valuations could increase the risk of future price  decreases\u2014which would reduce collateral values that protect the  enterprises against losses in the event of default\u2014or more modest price  increases. This could signal increased risk when associated with higher  loan-to-value ratios.", "Average credit scores for enterprise-purchased loans rose significantly  from their pre-crisis lows and remained historically high through 2012 but  have since slightly declined (see fig. 8). The average credit score of  FHA-insured borrowers, while lower than those for loans purchased by  the enterprises, followed a trend similar to those of the enterprises.  Generally, a higher score indicates a greater credit quality and potentially  lower likelihood of default. Lenders continue to use credit scores as a  primary means of assessing whether to originate a loan to a borrower.", "Average debt-to-income ratios for mortgages purchased by the  enterprises remained below their pre-crisis levels but have deteriorated  since 2012, and the share of high debt-to-income mortgages rose.  Additionally, according to Fannie Mae financial reports, in the first three  quarters of 2018, roughly 25 percent of mortgages it purchased included  a borrower debt-to-income ratio over 45 percent, up from roughly 7  percent of mortgages in the first three quarters of 2017.", "The share of high debt-to-income ratios for FHA-insured borrowers also  has risen significantly. For example, nearly half (49 percent) of FHA- insured borrowers in fiscal year 2017 had high debt-to-income ratios,  surpassing the previous high of 45 percent of borrowers in 2009.  According to FHA, as of March 2018, about 24 percent of mortgages  included debt-to-income ratios above 50 percent, up from 20 percent of  mortgages in March 2017.

A lender that originates a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d is  presumed to have met this requirement. All qualified mortgages must  meet mandatory requirements including restrictions on points and fees,  and loan structure. In addition, the borrower\u2019s debt-to-income ratio must  be 43 percent or less; however, loans eligible for purchase by the  enterprises or to be insured by the FHA, VA or USDA are not subject to a  specific debt-to-income ratio.", "Additionally, according to results from the October 2018 Senior Loan  Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, more loan officers  reported loosening than tightening their underwriting standards for  enterprise-eligible mortgages every quarter from 2015 through the second  quarter of 2018.

FHFA and  HUD officials reported that the share of nonbanks mortgage originators  and servicers grew since the financial crisis. According to data from  Inside Mortgage Finance, nonbanks originated roughly half of all  mortgages sold to the enterprises in 2017 and the first three quarters of  2018. Of the top 10 mortgage sellers to the enterprises in the first three  quarters of 2018, six were nonbanks that originated more than 20 percent  of all enterprise purchases during that period. Nonbank servicers of loans  backing enterprise MBS have grown from 25 percent in 2014 to 38  percent as of the third quarter of 2018. For FHA-insured mortgages,  nonbank originations represented 74 percent in 2003, declined to 56  percent in 2010, and then increased to 86 percent in fiscal year 2017.", "While FHFA and HUD officials told us nonbanks have helped provide  access to mortgage credit, several stakeholders and experts in all four of  our panels identified the increased presence of nonbank lenders as a  current risk in the housing finance system. A 2018 paper published by the  Brookings Institution cited that nonbanks are exposed to significant  liquidity risks in their funding of mortgage originations and servicing of  mortgages, because nonbank lenders rely more on credit lines provided  mostly by banks, securitizations involving multiple players, and more  frequent trading of mortgage servicing rights than banks. For instance,  during times of financial stress, lenders to nonbanks have the right to  quickly pull their lines of credit and seize and sell the underlying collateral  if nonbanks do not maintain certain levels of net worth. HUD officials  identified similar risks and added that this may reduce borrower access to  credit in the event of financial stress or a liquidity crisis.", "Additionally, while nonbanks are subject to some federal and state  oversight, they are not federally regulated for safety and soundness.  State regulators may require nonbanks to be licensed and may examine  their financial soundness and compliance with relevant state laws, but  there are no such federal regulations, unlike with banks. The Conference  of State Bank Supervisors has a series of initiatives with the goal of all  state regulators adopting a nationwide nonbank licensing and supervisory  system by 2020. CFPB oversees nonbank issuers for compliance with  consumer financial protection laws but not for financial safety and  soundness. We reported in 2016 that incomplete information on the  identity of nonbank servicers may hinder those responsible for their  oversight.", "The lack of federal safety and soundness oversight of nonbank lenders  and servicers may pose risks for the enterprises and federal housing  finance entities. The enterprises conduct financial and operational  reviews of their counterparties in accordance with FHFA guidance. But,  as we reported in 2016, FHFA does not have the authority to  independently evaluate the safety and soundness of entities that conduct  business with the enterprises. In 2014, the FHFA Office of Inspector  General found that nonbank lenders may have limited financial capacity  and are not subject to federal safety and soundness oversight, creating  an increased risk that these counterparties could default on their financial  obligations. They also found that rapid business growth among specialty  servicers could put stress on their operational capacity or overrun their  quality control procedures, potentially increasing representation and  warranty claims and credit losses on mortgages they sell to the  enterprises. Representation and warranty claims allow the enterprises  and other federal entities to recover some losses from lenders in the  event of misrepresentation by the seller. From 2009 through 2013, the  enterprises received $98.5 billion through repurchase requests to sellers  (that is, they required sellers to repurchase the enterprises\u2019 interests in  the loans). According to the FHFA Office of Inspector General, due to  lower capital levels, nonbanks may be less able to honor these  representation and warranty commitments.", "FHFA and HUD officials also told us nonbanks have helped increase  servicing capacity. We previously reported that nonbank servicers provide  benefits to the housing market through increased capacity to service  delinquent loans and contribute to liquidity by broadening participation in  the market for mortgage servicing rights. In particular, larger numbers of  individual servicers also can reduce market concentration, suggesting  that servicers may be more likely to behave competitively and can, for  instance, increase innovation. Furthermore, large nonbanks are generally  not as interconnected with the financial system as large banks, potentially  limiting broader market effects in the event of the failure of a single large  nonbank servicer.", "But the enterprises and Ginnie Mae likely would incur costs in the event  of a failure of a large nonbank servicer whose portfolio cannot be easily  absorbed by others. Mortgage servicers must continue making payments  to investors when borrowers do not make payments. For mortgages  backed by the enterprises, servicers can be reimbursed for principal and  interest and certain other expenses, but they must finance them in the  interim. Servicers of mortgage pools guaranteed by the enterprises must  advance payments until the borrower is 120 days delinquent on the  loan. Servicers of Ginnie Mae-guaranteed pools are not limited in how  long they must advance principal and interest on delinquent loans, and  they additionally may be required to absorb losses not covered by FHA  insurance or VA guarantees. In the event of a failure of a large nonbank  servicer with a not readily absorbable portfolio, Ginnie Mae and the  enterprises likely would bear most of the associated costs, and  consumers also likely would see some effects, such as service  interruptions. In 2015, FHFA and Ginnie Mae raised their minimum  financial eligibility requirements for sellers and servicers (including for net  worth, capital ratio, and liquidity criteria for counterparties), but these  requirements may not fully account for the high interest rate and default  risks that nonbanks face."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Affordable Housing", "paragraphs": ["Challenges related to affordable housing and access to homeownership  also remain. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are subject to affordable  housing goals for their purchases of single-family and multifamily  mortgages that benefit families with lower incomes. However, a number  of factors affect the development of affordable housing and access to  homeownership. For example, according to a 2018 study on the state of  the nation\u2019s housing, competition for the historically low supply of existing  homes on the market has pushed up home prices in most metropolitan  areas, raising concerns about affordability. The study also noted that  although better housing quality accounts for some of the increase in  housing prices, sharply higher costs for building materials and labor,  among other factors, have made housing construction considerably more  expensive. Land prices also increased as population growth in  metropolitan areas increased demand for well-located sites. Along with  rising housing costs, the study also reported that weak income growth  among low- and moderate-income households contributed to affordability  pressures. As homeownership becomes less affordable with house price  increases, the enterprises\u2019 affordable housing goals become more difficult  to achieve. For example, for calendar year 2016, Freddie Mac met all of  its affordable housing goals, and Fannie Mae met most of its affordable  housing goals, but failed to meet its goal for the single-family home  purchase, very-low income category. For calendar year 2017, based on  FHFA\u2019s preliminary determinations, Fannie Mae met all of its affordable  housing goals, but Freddie Mac missed its single-family home purchase  goals for both the very low-income and low-income categories.", "Experts and stakeholders we interviewed identified other contributing  challenges. For example, a few experts and stakeholders cited lower  levels of lending in minority communities and to low- and moderate- income borrowers, which are typically most in need of affordable housing,  as contributing challenges. A few other experts and stakeholders stated  that borrowers increasingly have been holding other types of debt, such  as student loan debt, which makes it more difficult for them to obtain an  affordable mortgage. Lastly, the qualified mortgage rule exception, which  may have helped some borrowers with a debt-to-income ratio above 43  percent to obtain a mortgage, expires in 2021 or earlier if conservatorship  of the enterprises ends before then.

Under the program\u2019s structure,  Fannie Mae is the entity responsible for purchasing mortgage insurance  on loans with high loan-to-value ratios. To do so, Fannie Mae secures an  insurance arrangement from a qualified insurer, which in turn transfers  the risk to a panel of approved reinsurers. Fannie Mae pays the mortgage  insurance premiums, while the lender is responsible for paying an  additional, loan-level price adjustment.", "Freddie Mac launched a similar pilot program earlier in 2018 known as  the Integrated Mortgage Insurance program. Under this program,  simultaneous with purchasing single-family mortgages, Freddie Mac  purchases mortgage insurance from a panel of pre-approved reinsurance  companies that it has allocated risk among. In addition, the reinsurers  post collateral to provide further assurance that claims will be paid, and  they cannot deny or rescind coverage.", "According to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac documents, these pilot  programs allow the enterprises to better manage their counterparty risk  and streamline the operational requirements of participating lenders. For  example, each participating reinsurer undergoes a thorough counterparty  review in order to be approved for participation in the programs.  Additionally, under the programs, lenders are not required to purchase  mortgage insurance for loans with loan-to-value ratios above 80 percent,  which would simplify the process of selling loans to the enterprises.  However, according to several experts and stakeholders with whom we  spoke, by allowing the enterprises to play a role in selecting the mortgage  insurer, these pilot programs widen the scope of activities of the  enterprises. They also allow them to become more dominant by  potentially growing their role beyond the secondary market and into the  primary market. They explained that these programs promote greater  vertical integration of private-sector activities into the enterprises, and  create challenges for market participants.

The enterprises also have efforts to standardize appraisal  data, loan applications, and closing disclosures. While these efforts are  intended to streamline and standardize aspects of the mortgage process,  several experts and stakeholders explained that the results of these  activities can be costly to smaller lenders and servicers who have to bear  the costs of adapting their systems to enterprise requirements.

The common securitization platform also would  integrate the various securitization infrastructure systems within each  enterprise, which is expected to lower costs and increase efficiency.", "However, several stakeholders we interviewed explained that the platform  presents concerns. For example, mortgage securitizers and investor  stakeholders who participated on our panels expressed concern about  the platform and its availability to other market participants. Specifically,  they stated that the goal of the project has, at times, been unclear and  that it has been difficult to tell to what extent or when the platform will be  accessible to other secondary market participants. They also stated that if  the platform would not be accessible to other secondary market  participants, it would take away opportunities from participants willing and  able to pool eligible securities.

The secondary mortgage market also might reduce its reliance on two  \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d entities with multiple guarantors.

We previously  reported that private-sector actors may benefit from an implicit guarantee  and this may incentivize firms to engage in potentially risky actions and  expose the government to potential losses. Additionally, privatizing the  market could increase fiscal exposure through FHA. The CBO report  noted that a privatized model could reduce the availability of credit to  marginal borrowers, and predicted it would lead to a large increase in  FHA-insured loans. A largely private market also might not sustain  mortgage lending during periods of economic stress. For example, the  private-label market largely disappeared after the 2007\u20132009 financial  crisis and has yet to recover, as previously discussed. Finally, CBO  reported that during a financial crisis, there could be large increases in  mortgage interest rates, large declines in house prices, and limited  availability of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Proposals Generally Meet Some Key Reform Elements", "paragraphs": ["The 14 proposals we reviewed generally meet the following elements of  our housing finance reform framework: recognizing and controlling federal  fiscal exposure, protecting mortgage investors, adhering to an appropriate  regulatory framework with government entities that have the capacity to  manage risks, emphasizing the implications of the transition to a new  housing finance system, protecting mortgage borrowers and addressing  market barriers, and considering market cyclicality and impacts on  financial stability.
