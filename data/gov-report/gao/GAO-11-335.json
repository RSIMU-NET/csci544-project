In 2007, Congress required the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to implement an automated electronic travel authorization system to determine, prior to travel, applicants' eligibility to travel to the United States under the VWP. Congress also required all VWP member countries to enter into an agreement with the United States to share information on whether citizens and nationals of that country traveling to the United States represent a security threat. In 2002, Congress mandated that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) review, at least every 2 years, the security risks posed by each VWP country's participation in the program. In this report, GAO evaluates (1) DHS's implementation of an electronic system for travel authorization; (2) U.S. agencies' progress in negotiating informationsharing agreements; and (3) DHS's timeliness in issuing biennial reports. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed U.S., foreign government, and travel industry officials in six VWP countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has implemented the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and has taken steps to minimize the burden associated with the new program requirement. However, DHS has not fully evaluated security risks related to the small percentage of VWP travelers without verified ESTA approval. DHS requires applicants for VWP travel to submit biographical information and answers to eligibility questions through ESTA prior to travel. Travelers whose ESTA applications are denied can apply for a U.S. visa. In developing and implementing ESTA, DHS has made efforts to minimize the burden imposed by the new requirement. For example, although travelers formerly filled out a VWP application form for each journey to the United States, ESTA approval is generally valid for 2 years. Most travel industry officials GAO interviewed in six VWP countries praised DHS's widespread ESTA outreach efforts, reasonable implementation time frames, and responsiveness to feedback, but expressed dissatisfaction with the costs associated with ESTA. In 2010, airlines complied with the requirement to verify ESTA approval for almost 98 percent of VWP passengers prior to boarding, but the remaining 2 percent-- about 364,000 travelers--traveled under the VWP without verified ESTA approval. DHS has not yet completed a review of these cases to know to what extent they pose a risk to the program. To meet the legislative requirement, DHS requires that VWP countries enter into three information-sharing agreements with the United States; however, only half of the countries have fully complied with this requirement and many of the signed agreements have not been implemented. Half of the countries have entered into agreements to share watchlist information about known or suspected terrorists and to provide access to biographical, biometric, and criminal history data. By contrast, almost all of the 36 VWP countries have entered into an agreement to report lost and stolen passports. DHS, with the support of interagency partners, has established a compliance schedule requiring the last of the VWP countries to finalize these agreements by June 2012. Although termination from the VWP is one potential consequence for countries not complying with the information-sharing agreement requirement, U.S. officials have described it as undesirable. DHS, in coordination with State and Justice, has developed measures short of termination that could be applied to countries not meeting their compliance date. DHS has not completed half of the most recent biennial reports on VWP countries' security risks in a timely manner. According to officials, DHS assesses, among other things, counterterrorism capabilities and immigration programs. However, DHS has not completed the latest biennial reports for 18 of the 36 VWP countries in a timely manner, and over half of these reports are more than 1 year overdue. Further, in the case of two countries, DHS was unable to demonstrate that it had completed reports in the last 4 years. DHS cited a number of reasons for the reporting delays. For example, DHS officials said that they intentionally delayed report completion because they frequently did not receive mandated intelligence assessments in a timely manner and needed to review these before completing VWP country biennial reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS establish time frames for the regular review of cases of ESTA noncompliance and take steps to address delays in the biennial review process.

Previously, Justice had overall  responsibility for managing the program. In July 2004, DHS created the  Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit within the Office of International  Enforcement and directed that unit to oversee VWP activities and monitor  participating VWP countries\u2019 adherence to the program\u2019s statutory and  policy requirements. In September 2007, the office was renamed the Visa  Waiver Program Office.

DHS announced ESTA as a new requirement for travelers  entering the United States under the VWP on June 9, 2008, and began  accepting ESTA applications on a voluntary basis in August 2008.  Beginning January 12, 2009, DHS required all VWP travelers to apply for  ESTA approval prior to travel to the United States.

Prior to ESTA implementation,  passengers traveling under the program were required to complete the I- 94W form to determine their program eligibility each time they boarded a  carrier to the United States.

However, on June 29, 2010, DHS eliminated the I- 94W requirement for most air and sea travelers who had been approved by  ESTA. According to travel industry officials in the six VWP countries we  visited, this change has simplified travel for many travelers, especially  business travelers who travel several times each year.

VWP country government and  travel industry officials praised widespread U.S. government efforts to  provide information about the ESTA requirements. After announcing  ESTA, DHS began an outreach campaign in VWP countries and for foreign  government embassy staff in the United States, with the assistance of  other U.S. agencies, to publicize the requirement. DHS officials said they  spent $4.5 million on ESTA outreach efforts. Although none of the six  embassies we visited tracked the costs associated with outreach, each  embassy provided documentation of their use of many types of outreach  efforts listed in table 2. VWP country government officials and travel  industry officials we met said that although they were initially concerned  that ESTA implementation would be difficult and negatively affect airlines  and many VWP passengers, implementation went more smoothly than  expected.", "Reasonable implementation time frames. Most of the VWP country airline  officials with whom we met said that the ESTA implementation time  frames set by DHS were reasonable. In 2008, DHS introduced ESTA and  made compliance voluntary. The following year, DHS made ESTA  mandatory but did not levy fines if airlines did not verify passengers\u2019 ESTA  approval before boarding them. This allowed the U.S. government more  time to publicize the requirement, according to DHS officials. Enforcement  began in March 2010. According to most of the officials we interviewed  from 17 airlines in the six VWP countries we visited, the phased-in  compliance generally allowed passengers sufficient time to learn about the  ESTA requirement and allowed most airlines sufficient time to update  their systems to meet the requirement. ESTA officials said that the phased- in compliance also provided time to fix problems with the system before  enforcing airline and passenger compliance.", "DHS responsiveness to travel industry feedback. VWP travel industry  officials said that DHS officials\u2019 efforts to adapt ESTA in response to  feedback have clarified the application process. Since initial  implementation of ESTA in 2008, DHS has issued updates to the system on  21 occasions. According to DHS officials, many of these changes  addressed parts of the application that were unclear to applicants. For  example, DHS learned from some travel industry officials that many  applicants did not know how to answer a question on the application  about whether they had committed a crime of moral turpitude because  they did not know the definition of \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d In September 2010,  DHS released an updated ESTA application that included a definition of  the term directly under the question. Further, updates have made the  ESTA application available in 22 languages instead of only English. DHS  also made it possible for denied applicants to reapply and be approved if  they mistakenly answered \u201cyes\u201d to select eligibility questions. Although  travel industry officials we met with in six VWP countries said there are  still ways ESTA should be improved, they said that DHS\u2019s responsiveness  in amending the ESTA application had made the system more user  friendly.", "Shorter reported passenger processing times. According to a study  commissioned by DHS and conducted at three U.S. ports of entry, ESTA  has reduced the average time DHS takes to process a VWP passenger  before deciding whether to admit them into the United States by a range of  between 17.8 and 54 percent. The study attributed this time savings to  factors such as the reduction in number of documents DHS officers  needed to handle and evaluate and the reduction in data entry needed at  the port of entry.", "Although DHS took steps to minimize the burden imposed by ESTA  implementation, almost all government and travel industry officials we  met in six VWP countries expressed dissatisfaction over the Travel  Promotion Act of 2009 (TPA) fee collected as part of the ESTA  application. In September 2010, the U.S. government began to charge  ESTA applicants a $14 fee when they applied for ESTA approval, including  $10 for the creation of a corporation to promote travel to the United States  and $4 to fund ESTA operations. According to many of the VWP country  government and travel industry officials with whom we met, the TPA fee is  unfair because it burdens those traveling to the United States with an  added fee to encourage others to travel to the United States. Some of the  officials pointed out that it was unrelated to VWP travel and that it runs  counter to the program objective of simplifying travel for VWP  participants. DHS officials said that many government and travel industry  officials from VWP countries view the fee as a step away from visa-free  travel and consider ESTA with the fee \u201cvisa-lite.\u201d By comparison, a  nonimmigrant visitor visa costs over $100 but is generally valid for five  times as long as ESTA approval. Several foreign officials said they  expected that the fee amount would continue to rise over time. DHS  officials stated that they cannot control the TPA portion of the ESTA fee  because it was mandated by law.", "In addition, some airline officials expressed concern that the ESTA  requirement was one of many requirements imposed by DHS that required  the carriers to bear the cost of system updates.

As illustrated in table 3 below, DHS, State,  and Justice have made some progress with VWP countries in entering into  the agreements.", "All VWP countries and the United States share some information with one  another on some level, but the existence of a formal agreement improves  information sharing, according to DHS officials. As opposed to informal  case-by-case information sharing, formal agreements expand the pool of  information to which the United States has systematic access. They can  draw attention to and provide information on individuals of whom the  United States would not otherwise be aware. According to officials, formal  agreements generally expedite the sharing of information by laying out  specific terms that can be easily referred to when requesting data. DHS  officials observed that timely access to information is especially important  for CBP officials at ports of entry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HSPD-6 Agreement", "paragraphs": ["HSPD-6 agreements establish a procedure between the United States and  partner countries to share watchlist information about known or  suspected terrorists. As of January 2011, 19 of the 36 VWP countries had  signed HSPD-6 agreements, and 13 have begun sharing information  according to the signed agreements. (See table 3.) Justice\u2019s Terrorist  Screening Center (TSC) and State have the primary responsibility to  negotiate and conclude these information-sharing agreements. An  interagency working group, co-led by TSC and State that also includes  representatives from U.S. law enforcement, intelligence, and policy  communities, addresses issues with the exchange of information and  coordinates efforts to enhance information exchange. While the  agreements are based on a template that officials use as a starting point  for negotiations, according to TSC officials, the terms of each HSPD-6  agreement are unique, prescribing levels of information sharing that reflect  the laws, political will, and domestic policies of each partner country. TSC  officials said most HSPD-6 agreements are legally nonbinding. Officials  said that this allows more flexibility in information-sharing procedures and  simplifies negotiations with officials from partner countries. The TSC  officials noted that the nonbinding nature of the agreements may allow  some VWP countries to avoid bureaucratic and political hurdles.", "Noting that State and TSC continue to negotiate HSPD-6 agreements with  VWP countries, officials cited concerns regarding privacy and data  protection expressed by many VWP countries as reasons for the delayed  progress. According to these officials, in some cases, domestic laws of  VWP countries limit their ability to commit to sharing some information,  thereby complicating and slowing the negotiation process. The terms of  HSPD-6 agreements are also extremely sensitive, TSC officials noted, and  therefore many HSPD-6 agreements are classified. Officials expressed  concern that disclosure of the agreements themselves might either (1)  cause countries that had already signed agreements to become less  cooperative in sharing data on known or suspected terrorists and reduce  the exchange of information or (2) cause countries in negotiation to  become less willing to sign agreements or insist on terms prescribing less  information sharing.", "The value and quality of information received through HSPD-6 agreements  vary, and some partnerships are more useful than others, according to TSC  officials. The officials stated that some partner countries were more  willing than others to share data on known or suspected terrorists. For  example, according to TSC officials, some countries do not share data on  individuals suspected of terrorist activity but only on those already  convicted. In other cases, TSC officials stated that some partner countries  did not have the technical capacity to provide all information typically  obtained through HSPD-6 agreements. For example, terrorist watchlist  data include at least the name and date of birth of the suspect and may  also include biometric information such as fingerprints or photographs.  According to DHS officials, some member countries do not have the legal  or technical ability to store such information.", "TSC has evidence that information is being shared as a result of HSPD-6  agreements. They provided the number of encounters with known or  suspected terrorists generated through sharing watchlist information with  foreign governments. TSC officials noted that they viewed these data as  one measure of the relevance of the program, but not as comprehensive  performance indicators. Although TSC records the number of encounters,  HSPD-6 agreements do not contain terms requiring partner countries to  reveal the results of these encounters, and there is no case management  system to track and close them out, according to TSC officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PCSC Agreement", "paragraphs": ["The PCSC agreements establish the framework for law enforcement  cooperation by providing each party automated access to the other\u2019s  criminal databases that contain biographical, biometric, and criminal  history data.

The language of the PCSC agreements varies slightly because,  according to agency officials, partner countries have different legal  definitions of what constitutes a serious crime or felony, as well as varying  demands regarding data protection provisions.", "Achieving greater progress negotiating PCSC agreements has been  difficult, according to DHS officials, because the agreements require  lengthy and intensive face-to-face discussions with foreign governments.  Justice and DHS, with assistance from State, negotiate the agreements  with officials from partner countries that can include representatives from  their law enforcement and justice ministries, as well as their diplomatic  corps. Further, sharing sensitive personal information with the United  States is publicly unpopular in many VWP countries, even if the countries\u2019  law enforcement agencies have no reluctance to share information.  Officials in some VWP countries told us that efforts to overcome political  barriers have caused further delays.", "Though officials expect to complete networking modifications necessary  to allow queries of Spain\u2019s and Germany\u2019s criminal databases in 2011, the  process is a legally and technically complex one that has not yet been  completed for any of the VWP countries. According to officials, DHS is  frequently not in a position to influence the speed of PCSC implementation  for a number of reasons. For example, according to DHS officials, some  VWP countries require parliamentary ratification before implementation  can begin.

According to  DHS officials, other international mandates have helped the United States  to obtain LASP information. Since 2005, all European Union countries  have been mandated to send data on lost and stolen passports to Interpol  for its Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database. In addition, Australia  and New Zealand have agreements to share lost and stolen passport  information through the Regional Movement Alert System. According to  officials, in fiscal year 2004, more than 700 fraudulent passports from VWP  countries were intercepted at U.S. ports of entry; however, by fiscal year  2010, this number had decreased to 64. DHS officials attributed the  decrease in the use of fraudulent passports in part to better LASP  reporting to Interpol.

In March 2010, State sent a cable to posts in all  VWP countries that instructed the appropriate posts to communicate the  particular compliance date to the government of each noncompliant VWP  country.

Further, termination would  require all citizens from the country to obtain visas before traveling to the  United States. According to officials, particularly in the larger VWP  countries, this step would overwhelm consular offices and discourage  travel to the United States, thereby damaging trade and tourism. U.S.  embassy officials in France told us that when the United States required  only a small portion of the French traveling population\u2014those without  machine-readable passports\u2014to obtain visas, U.S. embassy officials  logged many overtime hours, while long lines of applicants extended into  the embassy courtyard.", "DHS helped write a classified strategy document that outlines a  contingency plan listing possible measures short of termination from the  VWP that may be taken if a VWP country does not meet its specified  compliance date for entering into information-sharing agreements.

In 2002,  Congress mandated that, at least once every 2 years, DHS evaluate the  effect of each country\u2019s continued participation in the program on the  security, law enforcement, and immigration interests of the United States.  The mandate also directed DHS to determine based on the evaluation  whether each VWP country\u2019s designation should continue or be terminated  and to submit a written report on that determination to select  congressional committees.", "To fulfill this requirement, DHS conducts reviews of VWP countries that  examine and document, among other things, counterterrorism and law  enforcement capabilities, border control and immigration programs and  policies, and security procedures. To document its findings, DHS  composes a report on each VWP country reviewed and a brief summary of  the report to submit to congressional committees. In conjunction with  DHS\u2019s reviews, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) produces  intelligence assessments that DHS reviews prior to finalizing its VWP  country biennial reports. According to VWP officials, they visited 12  program countries in fiscal year 2009 and 10 countries in fiscal year 2010  to gather the data needed to complete these reports.

DHS  cited a number of reasons for the reporting delays, including a lack of  resources needed to complete timely reports. In addition, DHS officials  said that they sometimes intentionally delayed report completion for two  reasons: (1) because they frequently did not receive DNI intelligence  assessments in a timely manner and needed to review these before  completing VWP country biennial reports or (2) in order to incorporate  anticipated developments in the status of information-sharing agreement  negotiations with a VWP country. Further, DHS officials cited lengthy  internal review as the primary reason for delays in submitting the formal  summary reports to Congress.

In an  attempt to facilitate visa-free travel without sacrificing travel security,  Congress has mandated security measures such as ESTA, information- sharing requirements, and VWP country biennial reviews. While ESTA has  added a fee and a new pretravel requirement that place additional burdens  on the VWP traveler, it has reduced the burden on VWP travelers in several  other ways. DHS does not fully know the extent to which ESTA has  mitigated VWP risks, however, because its review of cases of passengers  being permitted to travel without verified ESTA approval is not yet  complete. Although the percentage of VWP travelers without verified  ESTA approval is very small, DHS oversight of noncompliant travelers may  reduce the risk that an individual that poses a security risk to the United  States could board a plane or ship traveling to the United States. Even if  DHS has authority to deny individuals entry to the United States in such  cases, ESTA was designed to screen such individuals before they embark  on travel to the United States. Moreover, with only half of the countries  participating in the VWP in full compliance with the requirement to enter  into information-sharing agreements with the United States, DHS may not  have sufficient information to deny participation in the VWP to individuals  who pose a security risk to the United States. In addition, the  congressional mandate requiring VWP country biennial reports provides  important information to Congress on security measures in place in VWP  countries but also on potential vulnerabilities that could affect the  countries\u2019 future participation in the program. Because DHS has not  consistently submitted the reports in a timely manner since the legal  requirement was imposed in 2002, Congress does not have the assurance  that DHS efforts to require program countries to minimize vulnerabilities  and its recommendations for continued status in the VWP are based on up- to-date assessments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that DHS can identify and mitigate potential security risks  associated with the VWP, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security take the following two actions:    establish time frames for the regular review and documentation of cases of  VWP passengers traveling to a U.S. port of entry without verified ESTA  approval, and take steps to address delays in the biennial country review process so that  the mandated country reports can be completed on time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DHS provided written comments on a draft of this report.
