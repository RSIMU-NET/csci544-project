Offshoring occurred in one or more programs in 43 of 50 states and the District of Columbia, most frequently in the Food Stamp and TANF programs. However, expenditures for services performed offshore in the four state-administered programs appear to be relatively small. The services states most frequently reported as being performed offshore in the Food Stamp and TANF programs were functions related to customer service, such as call centers, and in the Unemployment Insurance and Child Support Enforcement programs functions were related to software development. India was the most prevalent offshore location, followed by Mexico. We did not find any occurrences of offshoring in the Pell Grant and FFEL programs and the Department of Education's U.S. residency requirement for contractors performing high-risk work has the effect of limiting offshoring. State officials reported that lower costs are a benefit of having services performed offshore and few officials identified problems with offshore service providers in their contracts. Fifteen state program directors reported having performed cost comparisons for their current contracts, based on differences in the location of services, and all reported that they would achieve cost savings if some of the work were performed offshore. On average, these comparisons showed that with some services performed offshore, contract costs would be between 0.3 and 24 percent less than if all the services in the contracts were to be performed in the United States. The few state officials that reported any problems with the quality of services provided by offshore contractors said that they involved difficulties in understanding the English of software programmers or customer service representatives. While numerous actions have been proposed at the state and federal levels to limit offshoring by government agencies, few restrictions exist with respect to the six programs we reviewed. Two states--New Jersey and Arizona--have prohibited offshoring in state contracts. Some states have also taken other actions, such as requiring state agencies to disclose when state-contracted work is performed offshore or to report on the implications of offshoring. The federal government does not have regulations specifically related to the offshoring of services in the six programs we reviewed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Advances in information technology and communications, coupled with a  large pool of educated workers in some countries, have allowed private  companies to move services work outside of the United States in such  areas as call centers, back-office functions, and software programming.  While some maintain that the services offshoring phenomenon is  widespread, others say that the extent is limited. Media reports in 2004  that call centers providing customer service to Food Stamp recipients  were based in India inspired proposals at the federal and state levels to  restrict \u201coffshoring\u201d in public programs or the practice of performing  contracted work outside of the United States. Offshoring generally refers  to the import from abroad of goods or services that were previously  produced domestically. As states and the federal government have sought  to streamline and improve administrative processes and take advantage of  technological advances, both have outsourced certain functions to private  firms. In some cases, these firms have used offshore resources to perform  these functions. Questions have been raised about the prevalence of  offshoring and the potential consequences when federally-funded human  services programs procure services from companies that offshore.  However, as we reported in 2004, no comprehensive data or studies show  the extent of services offshoring by state governments and data for the  federal government are limited.", "In response to widespread congressional interest in this area, we  conducted work under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to determine  the occurrence and nature of offshoring in six federally-funded human  services programs. Specifically, we examined (1) the occurrence and  nature of offshoring in each of these six programs, (2) the benefits  government agencies have achieved through offshoring in these programs  and the problems they encountered in offshoring work, and (3) the  actions, if any, states and the federal government have taken to limit  offshoring in these programs and why. The six federally-funded programs  we examined include four state-administered human services programs\u2014 Child Support Enforcement, Food Stamp, Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families (TANF), and Unemployment Insurance\u2014and two federally- administered programs that provide student financial aid\u2014Pell Grant and  Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL). We selected these programs  because they receive a substantial amount of federal funding for program  administration, contract out some administrative functions, and are not  administered solely at the local level.", "To determine the occurrence and nature of offshoring in the four state- administered programs, we administered two separate Web-based surveys:    First, we surveyed directors of the Child Support Enforcement, Food  Stamp, TANF, and Unemployment Insurance programs in all 50 states and  the District of Columbia\u2014a total of 204 directors. We asked each program  director to provide information on up to three contracts held by the  program: the contracts with known offshoring or, if there were fewer than  three contracts with offshoring or no offshoring, the largest contracts (in  dollars). We also requested information from each program director on the  total number of contracts and total spending on contracted-out services. In  addition, we reviewed contracts from state officials that reported no  offshoring. We obtained a 93 percent response rate to our survey of state  program directors.", "To supplement the survey of state officials, we surveyed the contractors  whose names were provided by state officials to obtain additional  information on the types of services provided to state programs and where  these services are performed. We obtained a 54 percent response rate to  our survey of contractors.", "It is likely that our two surveys did not identify all instances of offshoring  in the four state-administered programs. Therefore, the figures we cite for  the four programs on the number of contracts in which some services  were offshored and the total expenditures for these contracts should be  viewed as minimum levels. To further understand the nature of  contracting in these programs, we conducted site visits to Florida, Utah,  and New York. We selected these states based on the presence of  offshoring in multiple programs or in multiple contracts within a program.", "At these site visits, we interviewed state program officials and reviewed  contract-related documents.", "To determine whether any services are performed outside of the United  States in the two federal student aid programs, we interviewed officials  from the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid  (Student Aid) and reviewed departmental directives and contracting  documents. While the Department of Education is responsible for overall  administration of the Federal Family Education Loan program, loans are  financed by commercial lenders such as banks and credit unions and non- profit lenders such as postsecondary institutions. State and national non- profit guaranty agencies administer the federal insurance that protects  these lenders against losses and perform a variety of administrative  functions. We did not include commercial and non-profit lenders or the  guaranty agencies in this review. Rather, we focused on cases in which the  Department of Education entered into direct contracts for services related  to program administration.", "To determine what actions states and the federal government have taken  to limit offshore work in these programs, we reviewed laws, policies, and  executive actions, including those identified through our state survey.

Generally, services  offshoring is used to describe the replacement of domestically supplied  service functions with imported services produced offshore. This  definition focuses on a business\u2019s decision to contract out: should it  produce the services internally, contract with a company located in the  United States (outsourcing), or contract out with companies based  offshore? Offshoring has also been used to describe the movement of  domestic production (and the related jobs) offshore. In this case, the  definition focuses not on imports of services from abroad, but on U.S.  companies investing offshore. Business and professional services such as  accounting, bookkeeping, and software programming and design do not  have to be performed on site, and, therefore, can be outsourced offshore  to any location. For example, a U.S.-based company can stop producing  certain services in-house and instead purchase them from a company with  foreign-based staff or a state government could contract out its software  programming to a company with foreign-based staff.", "While limited, U.S. government data provide some insight into trends in  offshoring of services. Trade data from the Department of Commerce  show that, generally, imports of services associated with offshoring are  growing. Federal procurement data show that the total dollar value of the  federal government\u2019s services contracts with offshoring increased  between 1997 and 2002.

According to data  reported by the federal program office in March 2005, 27 state programs  for child support enforcement have contracted with private companies to  handle all or some of these functions. The federal government provides a  66 percent match to state spending for most of the administration of child  support enforcement.", "PRWORA also required states to implement electronic benefits transfer  (EBT) systems for the reimbursement of food stamp benefits. EBT allows  food stamp recipients to use a plastic card, much like a debit card, to pay  for their food from authorized retailers and have the benefit deducted  from the household\u2019s allocation. EBT contracts generally include a range  of programs and support functions, including customer service. It is this  complete group of services, often referred to as \u201cbundled,\u201d that are  included under the term \u201cEBT\u201d and for which states contract out. All   50 states and the District of Columbia provide Food Stamp benefits  through EBT. Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia have  contracts with private companies to provide all or some of these EBT  services. The federal government provides a 50 percent match for most  EBT and other administrative functions for states. Some states combine  the distribution of benefits for Food Stamps with cash assistance under  TANF. As such, some states spend TANF funds for the administration of  their EBT systems. Thirty-six states distribute TANF benefits via EBT in  combination with Food Stamps and other programs. While not mandated  to do so, some Unemployment Insurance programs are redesigning their  benefits systems to provide efficient and cost-effective services to  unemployment insurance customers through electronic submission of  applications and wage and tax data.

Through integrated computer systems, Student Aid will be able to  streamline data sharing among schools, lenders, and its offices and  eliminate system redundancies. The Higher Education Act also requires  Student Aid to establish appropriate administrative, technical, and  physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of privacy- protected information used in these systems.

In total,  administrative spending across the four programs was about $15.7 billion  in fiscal year 2004. At the time of our review, the four programs had about  5,606 contracts valued at approximately $1.8 billion (or 12 percent of total  administrative spending). The total value of the 83 contracts where some  offshoring occurred was at least $335 million. For nine of these contracts,  state officials did not report total contract costs. The contracts with  reported offshoring comprised 2 percent of the total number of contracts  and about 18 percent of the total spending for all contracted-out services  across the four programs. However, the magnitude of actual spending on  the offshored services we identified is likely considerably lower than   $335 million because for many of the contracts with some offshoring, the  bulk of services are performed in the United States. For example, the U.S.  company that holds the majority of state contracts with some offshoring in  the Food Stamp and TANF programs estimated that services performed  offshore constituted less than 3 percent of the total services provided  through these contracts. Similarly, a contractor providing services to  several child support enforcement programs stated that offshored  computer software programming comprised less than 1 percent of the  total package of services provided to states.

However, it is unclear whether this  range of estimates reflects levels of offshore spending in the other  contracts with offshoring. The state officials who provided these spending  estimates did not report expenditure data for each service in their  contracts. For example, officials in New York told us that they do not  receive itemized lists of costs for each service from their contractors who,  in some cases, consider the information proprietary.

EBT systems encompass a wide a range of  services and state officials reported that call centers with human operators  and staff help desks were the services EBT contractors most frequently  performed offshore. EBT call centers were offshored in 24 states.  Typically, the offshoring scenario for call centers is when a food stamp  recipient calls into the automated system to report a lost or stolen EBT  card, inquire about balances, or obtain other assistance for example. The  recipient can choose an option to be connected to a customer service  representative. The telephone call is then routed to an offshore location,  such as India if they are an English speaker or Mexico if they wish to  speak to someone in Spanish, where a person in a call center handles the  call. Staff help desks work much like call centers with human operators,  but are typically available to help state program staff solve administrative  problems such as accessing data from the EBT system.

The services contractors performed  offshore for Unemployment Insurance fell into three general areas:  development of software for a computer system (e.g., a case management  system), development of Web-interfaces (the actual systems the public  would use), and computer system maintenance. In four of the five states  in which program directors reported offshoring in the Unemployment  Insurance program, the offshoring occurred in contracts to convert all or  some of a mainframe computer system to a Web-based system. In child  support enforcement programs, the service contractors most often  performed offshore was software development. State program directors  provided examples of services performed offshore in their contracts in the  areas of software programming, Web development, and computer  maintenance. The following examples illustrate the services that particular  states have offshored in these programs:    Software Programming: In South Carolina, the contractor hired to  update the state\u2019s system for managing employer taxes is using software  programmers in India to develop the new system. In Wisconsin, while the  actual software programming was conducted in the United States, the  contractors used an offshore help desk to obtain technical assistance in  conducting software programming services. In several child support  enforcement programs, the software designed for payment machines used  in handling the receipt and disbursement of child support payments was  created offshore. While the payment machines are housed and operated  within the United States, the company that produces the software that  runs a part of the machine\u2019s operating system creates the software in  India.", "Web Development: In New Mexico the contractor performed Web  development services in India as part of the development of the front-end  system to allow the public to file on-line claims.", "Maintenance: Contractors for Washington and Montana offshored the  periodic maintenance work required when the state needs assistance with  a particular machine or for periodic testing on a system.

In  addition, some contractors that use offshore subcontractors provide  services to a large number of states. For example, one company holds the  EBT contracts with offshoring in 28 of the 31 states where we identified  offshoring in the Food Stamp and TANF programs. In 11 of the 31 states,  the Food Stamp and TANF programs were covered under the same EBT  contract that state officials or contractors identified as having some  services performed offshore.", "In the states where we identified offshoring, offshored services were most  often performed by subcontractors.

In other cases, subcontractors work on an as- needed basis. For example, a contractor building a new computer system  may use software or hardware from various companies. The  subcontractors would be the companies that produced these various  software and hardware parts and would be called upon as needed to  provide maintenance or assist in resolving problems with their products.  In certain cases, services are performed offshore within short time frames  or in response to unexpected deadlines.

The three officials that indicated problems with  offshored services in their contracts said that those problems were related  to difficulties in understanding the English of software programmers and  customer service representatives in India. Other state officials offered  positive reactions to the work of their offshore service providers. For  example, six officials with contracts where EBT call centers were located  in India said that the offshore call centers posed no challenges and  reported specifically that customer service representatives performed  well. Two of these six officials said that the call centers were of high  quality based on their monitoring of calls between customer service  representatives in India and benefit recipients in the United States. One  official said that a benefit of having software programming contractors  based in Poland was that the contractors conducted work overnight and  had products ready for state staff the next day.", "All but four state officials that reported some services in their contracts  were offshored also reported that the contracted services had never been  performed by state employees. In some cases, such as with EBT, the  services were new to states, while in other cases, the services were not  new but had previously been outsourced. In some contracts with  offshoring, state officials reported that the decision to outsource services  stemmed, in part, from a lack of state employees with the needed  expertise. For example, officials in New York stated that they had  difficulty finding persons with the skill set for a certain software  programming language.

These actions have been taken through various  mechanisms, including executive orders, state laws, and agency rules.", "Two states\u2014New Jersey and Arizona\u2014have banned offshoring in state  contracts. Through a state law, New Jersey has prohibited offshoring in all  state contracts for services. In a procurement agency directive, Arizona  prohibited offshoring in state contracts and required state agencies to  include a specific clause in contracts and future requests for proposals  that specifies that work must be performed in the United States. Arizona\u2019s  prohibition does not apply to indirect services, back up services, or  services deemed incidental to the performance of the contract. Kansas  prohibited offshoring related to its EBT services and work performed by  one agency for a limited time in a state appropriations act, but as of June  2005, this provision was no longer in effect.", "At least five states\u2014Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri\u2014 have taken actions that do not directly limit offshoring but require that  information be provided on the location where contracted work is  performed. For example, Missouri requires contractors to provide  information in bids for state contracts about the location where work will  be performed. Missouri allows offshoring if the contractor or  subcontractor has what the state considers a significant business presence  in the state and performs a small portion of work under the contract  outside of the United States or the cost is significantly lower than what it  would cost to have all of the services provided within the United States. In  Illinois, contractors are required to disclose the location where services  will be performed prior to signing a contract. Illinois also allows the state  to make the requirement for disclosure a part of an agency\u2019s request for  proposals and gives the chief procurement officer authority to consider  the location where services will be performed in making award decisions.  In addition to requiring contractors to disclose where they will perform  work, Minnesota and Illinois also require periodic reports on the extent of  offshoring in state contracts.", "Varied perspectives on the potential effects of services offshoring have  influenced states\u2019 decisions about offshoring. For example, executive  orders requiring disclosures by prospective contractors in Alaska,  Minnesota, and Missouri cited concerns over aggravating unemployment,  the possible detriment to state economies, and a potential reduction in  protections for private and personal information. In contrast, legislators  and elected officials in other states have expressed concerns about  legislation that would seek to restrict contracting outside the United  States. For example, in vetoing a bill seeking to prohibit offshoring in 2004,  California\u2019s governor cited a possible increase in prices paid by the state  for goods and services and the potential violation of international trade  agreements. Other concerns expressed by states that did not pass  proposed legislation restricting offshoring include increased  administrative costs for agencies required to enforce the restrictions,  added layers of contract approval processes, and the impediment of  missions of certain agencies, such as tourism boards and economic  development agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Actions on Offshoring Include Relocating Offshored Services to the United States", "paragraphs": ["State actions on offshoring also include the relocation of services to the  United States from their previously offshored locations in some cases.

State program directors said that these moves were not required because  of problems associated with the quality of the services performed  offshore. Rather, the moves were undertaken by state governments to  promote local employment and because of concerns raised about  protections of private client information. One of these states\u2014North  Carolina\u2014converted the EBT call center into a state-run operation and  hired local residents to work as customer service representatives. These  moves often mean that the states will incur increased costs. For example,  North Carolina now pays an additional $1 million per year to operate its  own EBT call center. A state official in Arizona estimated that it costs an  additional $1.2 million annually to have its EBT call center operated within  the United States; and state officials in some other states indicated that,  while certain services are currently performed offshore, there were plans  for relocating these services to the United States.

Despite the widespread media attention, our  findings show that offshoring of services in state level contracts is not a  major practice in the four state-administered programs we reviewed.  Looking forward, there are various factors that could influence offshoring  in these state programs. As some state legislatures move to restrict  offshoring, the private sector continues to increase the use of offshore  resources\u2014often seen as a good business practice. Tighter budgets have  demanded that states find ways to effectively and efficiently perform their  administrative work for lower costs. As such, some states will continue to  see a need to outsource program functions to companies that offshore in  order to achieve such savings. Other states, concerned about the impact of  offshoring on their local economies or workforce, will see a need to  restrict the occurrence of offshoring in state contracts. Differences in  federal agencies\u2019 security-related policies for contractors also have  implications for offshoring in federal human services programs. As we  have seen, Education\u2019s security-related policies for contractors in the  FFEL and Pell Grant programs restrict the ability to perform work  offshore in these programs, whereas the security-related policies of the  federal agencies for the state-administered programs we examined do not  have this effect on state-level contracting. Such differences in policies may  stimulate further debate about the most appropriate balance of policies  pertaining to security and offshoring in various federal human services  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services,  and Labor did not have comments on this report.

First, we  surveyed 204 directors for the Child Support Enforcement, Food Stamp,  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Unemployment Insurance  programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We received  responses from 190 of the directors, for a 93 percent response rate. Five  state directors of Unemployment Insurance programs, one state director  of Child Support Enforcement programs, three state directors of Food  Stamp programs, and five state directors of TANF programs did not  respond to our survey. We asked the directors about contracting policies  and practices, as well as work performed outside of the United States. We  also asked each program director to provide us with information on up to  three contracts held by the program: the largest contracts with known  offshoring or\u2014if there were fewer than three contracts with offshoring,  contracts where officials were uncertain, or there were no contracts with  offshore\u2014the largest contracts (in dollars). We then surveyed the  contractors whose names were provided to determine the types of  services provided to state programs and where these services are  performed. Of the 469 contracts covered by the survey, contractors gave  responses for 251 of them, for a response rate of 54 percent. The survey  data was collected from May 2005 to November 2005.", "We worked with social science survey specialists to develop the  questionnaires. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce errors. For example, differences in how a particular  question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are available to  respondents, or how the data are entered into a database can introduce  unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in the  development of the questionnaires, the data collection, and the data  analysis to minimize these errors. For example, prior to administering the  survey, we tested the content and format of the questionnaires with  several state officials and contractors to determine whether (1) the survey  questions were clear, (2) the terms used were precise, (3) respondents  were able to provide the information we were seeking, and (4) the  questions were unbiased. We made changes to the content and format of  the final questionnaires based on the results of these tests. In that these  were Web-based surveys whereby respondents entered their responses  directly into our database, the possibility of data entry error was  minimized. We also performed computer analyses to identify errors such  as inconsistencies in responses and contacted survey respondents as  needed to correct errors and verify responses. In addition, a second  independent analyst verified that the computer programs used to analyze  the data were written correctly.", "To further examine how state officials knew there was no offshoring in  their contracts, we reviewed contracts. We selected contracts where state  officials responded that there was no offshoring and that all services were  listed in the contract. We requested 48 contracts.

We received all but 1 of the 48 contracts.", "To further understand the nature of contracting for these programs, we  visited the states of Florida, Utah, and New York, where we interviewed  state program officials and contractors and reviewed documents  pertaining to program contracts.
