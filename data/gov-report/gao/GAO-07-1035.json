Schools that miss AYP for 4 years are identified for corrective action, and after 6 years, they must be restructured. GAO examined (1) the characteristics of Title I schools in corrective action and restructuring; (2) the actions that schools in corrective action and restructuring implemented; (3) the assistance those schools received from districts and states; and (4) how Education supports states in their efforts to assist these schools. GAO administered two Web-based surveys to a nationwide sample of schools in corrective action and restructuring status and conducted site visits to five states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, the 2,790 Title I schools that were in corrective action or restructuring status in the 2005-2006 school year were more frequently located in urban areas and in a few states. These schools served higher percentages of minority, poor, and middle-school students than other Title I schools, and many report that factors such as neighborhood violence and student mobility pose additional challenges to improving student academic performance. As state proficiency targets continue to increase to 100 percent in 2014, the number of schools in corrective action and restructuring may increase. A majority of schools in corrective action or restructuring status implemented required activities. However, in some cases, schools may not be meeting NCLBA requirements. GAO estimates that 6 percent of schools did not take any of the required corrective actions and that about a third continued corrective actions implemented during earlier years of school improvement but did not take a new action after entering corrective action status. While this course of action may be an appropriate path for some schools to take, the Department of Education has not provided guidance to districts delineating when continuing a corrective action is appropriate and when it is not. In addition, about 40 percent of schools did not take any of the five restructuring options required by NCLBA. While states are required to report annually to the Department of Education the measures taken by schools in improvement status, Education does not require states to report on the specific measures taken for each school. GAO estimates that 42 percent of the schools in corrective action or restructuring did not receive all required types of assistance through their school districts, although most received discretionary assistance from their state educational agencies. Districts are required to ensure that several types of assistance are provided to all schools in improvement status, including those in corrective action and restructuring status. This assistance includes help in analyzing students' assessment data and revising school budgets so that resources are allocated to improvement efforts. NCLBA generally does not require states to provide specific kinds of assistance to schools in corrective action or restructuring; however, they are required to develop a statewide system of support, including school support teams to provide technical assistance to schools and districts. Most schools received some type of assistance from the state educational agency. Education provides technical assistance and research results to states primarily through its Comprehensive Centers Program. Education also has provided more material in its Web-based clearinghouse to address a greater number of topics and is developing an initiative to outline practical steps for schools in improvement, including those in restructuring."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 40 years, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  Over the past 40 years, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965 (ESEA) has authorized billions of dollars in federal grants to states  1965 (ESEA) has authorized billions of dollars in federal grants to states  and school districts to improve educational opportunities for economically  and school districts to improve educational opportunities for economically  disadvantaged students.

Under NCLBA, when a Title I school does not make AYP for 4 years,  the school enters corrective action, and the district must take a statutorily  prescribed action to improve the school, such as replacing selected  teaching staff. If the school fails to make AYP for 6 years, the district is  required to restructure the school by changing how the school is  governed. Such changes may include closing the school and re-opening it  as a charter school or turning the operation of the school over to the state  educational agency. As annual goals leading up to the 2014 deadline  continue to increase, more schools are expected to enter corrective action  and restructuring and will be required to take major action to improve.", "However, little is known about what specific corrective actions or  restructuring options schools are currently implementing nationwide, the  extent to which these actions are associated with making AYP, and the  support that schools in corrective action and restructuring have received  from school districts and states as they attempt to improve student  performance. In order to shed light on these issues and help the Congress  prepare for reauthorization of the NCLBA, you asked GAO to answer the  following questions: (1) What are the characteristics of Title I schools in  corrective action and restructuring? (2) To what extent have schools in  corrective action and restructuring implemented corrective actions or  restructuring options? (3) What assistance have schools in corrective  action and restructuring received from districts and states? and (4) How  has the Department of Education (Education) supported states in their  efforts to assist schools in corrective action and restructuring status?", "To provide information on these topics, we collected data through  multiple methods. We obtained data on which schools were in corrective  action and restructuring for the 2005-2006 school year. States reported  these data to Education through the Consolidated State Performance  Report process, which collects annual information from states on ESEA  programs. We matched data on these schools with additional data in  Education\u2019s Common Core of Data (CCD), conducted descriptive analyses  of selected characteristics, and compared them to all other Title I schools.  We also administered two Web-based surveys sent to 470 principals in a  nationwide sample of schools in corrective action and restructuring during  the 2005-2006 school year. We administered the surveys between January  and March 2007 and received a combined response rate of about   70 percent. Percentage estimates from the surveys have margins of error  of plus or minus 8 percentage points using a 95 percent confidence  interval, unless otherwise noted. While we did not fully validate specific  information that school officials reported in our survey, we took several  steps, including corroborating evidence of some schools\u2019 improvement  status, to ensure that the information provided by school officials was  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We conducted site  visits to 5 states (California, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and  Pennsylvania) and 10 school districts with schools in corrective action,  restructuring, or both, as well as 20 schools in those districts. The states,  districts, and schools selected for site visits not only provided variation  across such characteristics as geographic location and district size, but  also generally resembled all schools in corrective action and restructuring  in terms of students\u2019 racial, ethnic, and economic characteristics.  Together, schools in these 5 states accounted for over 59 percent of  schools in corrective action and restructuring nationally in the 2005-2006  school year. We also interviewed state officials from several states (Idaho,  South Dakota, Texas, and Virginia) that had few schools in correction  action or restructuring to obtain information on how their state  educational agencies are working with districts on school improvement  issues. We reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency  guidance and interviewed Education officials to obtain information about  how they monitor and provide assistance to states and districts. We also  interviewed officials in some of Education\u2019s comprehensive and regional  assistance centers. We analyzed relevant Education documents and  studies and reports issued by policy and research organizations on schools  in corrective action and restructuring and interviewed staff in many of  these organizations.

The 1994 reauthorization of ESEA\u2014Improving America\u2019s Schools Act  (IASA)\u2014required that schools be designated for improvement for failure  to make AYP for 2 consecutive years and that districts take corrective  action as a final intervention for schools that repeatedly missed AYP.  However, under IASA states assessed AYP in different ways and used  different measures to evaluate school performance. NCLBA added several  new provisions to address these differences and to strengthen  accountability. These provisions include:    The requirement that states develop plans that include academic  standards and establish performance goals for meeting AYP that would  lead to 100 percent of their students being proficient in reading,  mathematics, and science by 2014. To measure their progress, states  were required to establish academic proficiency goals for making AYP  and to administer an annual assessment to students in most grade  levels. In addition, each school\u2019s assessment data must be  disaggregated in order to compare the achievement levels of students  within certain designated groups with the state\u2019s proficiency targets.  These student groups include the economically disadvantaged, major  racial and ethnic groups, students with disabilities, and those with  limited English proficiency, and each of these groups generally must  make AYP in order for the school to make AYP.", "A timeline for implementing specific interventions based on the  number of years the school missed AYP. For a school that fails to meet  AYP for 2 consecutive years, districts must offer students in these  schools the opportunity to transfer to a higher-performing public  school in the district, and after the third year, they must also offer  supplemental education services (SES), such as tutoring. In addition,  the school must also develop an improvement plan in consultation with  the district, school staff, parents, and outside experts. These plans,  which are subject to district approval, must incorporate strategies to  address the specific academic issues that caused the school to be  identified for improvement. Under NCLBA, if a school fails to make  AYP for 4 consecutive years, it is required to implement one of the  corrective actions identified in the legislation. In addition, a new  intervention to change the governance of schools\u2014school  restructuring\u2014was introduced for schools that miss AYP for 5 or more  years. (See table 1.) Districts are responsible for selecting and  implementing the corrective actions and restructuring options for these  schools. Schools exit improvement status if they make AYP for   2 consecutive years.", "Schools in corrective action must implement at least one of six activities  such as replacing selected school staff or implementing a new curriculum.  Schools that do not make AYP after 5 years must plan for restructuring,  which means that the district must decide how to change the school\u2019s  governance. Restructuring, the most severe of the NCLBA interventions,  requires that the school implement a major change to how the school is  operated, such as reorganizing into a public charter school or contracting  with an outside organization such as a private management company to  operate the school. If the school does not make AYP during the planning  phase, the school enters restructuring. The corrective action and  restructuring activities allowed under NCLBA are shown below in table 2.  NCLBA does not address actions that districts must take after  implementing restructuring and the school continues to fail to make AYP.

Other factors may also  include being less qualified than their peers in elementary or middle  schools, teachers in middle schools, and social and emotional challenges  associated with students as they make the transition into middle schools.

Education officials told us that if a  school implemented a corrective action in earlier stages of improvement  (year 1 or 2 of improvement), an additional corrective action might not be  required. They explained that whether a district must take additional  actions depends in part on whether the school is showing improvement in  student achievement. If the school showed evidence that the intervention  is producing results that are likely to enable the school to exit  improvement status, an additional corrective action might not be  necessary. On the other hand, Education officials noted that if the data  indicates that the previous corrective actions have not addressed the  school\u2019s achievement problems they would expect the district to take  additional corrective action.

Our survey  indicated that for many of these schools, it was difficult or very difficult to  recruit new teachers as replacements.", "Very few schools in restructuring had contracted with an entity, such as a  private management organization, become a charter school, or been taken  over by the state. Some states may not have authorized all restructuring  options under state law or policy, which may explain why fewer schools  have taken these options. For example, according to a recent report, while  some states have policies that permit districts to turn schools over to  private management or to reopen schools as charter schools, others do  not. In three of the five states we visited, state officials reported that their  state educational agencies currently do not take over schools. In one of  these states, turning over school management to the state agency is  permissible under state policy, but officials told us that the state does not  have the capacity or expertise to do so. The amount of time it takes to  plan for such a change may also be a factor in why these options are not  often selected. For example, a district official reported that the district did  not have sufficient time during the restructuring planning process to  seriously consider reopening as a charter school, contracting with a  private management company, or turning the operation of the school over  to the state. In about 70 percent of schools, the district played a significant  role in determining the restructuring option taken.", "Although a majority of schools implemented a restructuring option, about  40 percent of the schools that were in restructuring did not take any of the  5 restructuring options prescribed under NCLBA, according to our survey  results. Several principals of schools that had not restructured did not  know why an option was not taken. In other cases, principals believed that  the school board or district had decided not to restructure. In addition,  one of the surveyed schools and some school and district officials we  visited did not believe restructuring was necessary when student  achievement was improving. For example, officials at one of the schools  we visited that was planning for restructuring indicated that the district  and school administration had determined that no changes were needed  because they were confident that the actions already taken were helping  students.", "Nonetheless, about half of the schools that did not take one of the five  restructuring options engaged in a variety of school improvement efforts.  Some of these efforts may fall under the \u201cother\u201d major restructuring  option, while others do not appear to be consistent with NCLBA  requirements for restructuring. For example, one school implemented a  new curriculum as a restructuring option, while at another school extra  funding was used for small group instruction and after-school programs,  both of which more closely resemble corrective action under NCLBA. In  addition, in two districts we visited, officials allowed schools that were  improving to continue efforts started under prior stages of improvement.  However, we could not determine based on the information reported by  survey respondents whether these activities would be considered  restructuring under NCLBA. Further, several Education officials we spoke  with could not determine whether or not the actions schools reported  taking were in compliance without more information from the schools,  such as other on-going districts efforts.", "Similar to our finding that many schools may not be implementing a  restructuring option, Education\u2019s 2006 interim report on Title I stated that  very few schools in restructuring status implemented a restructuring  option prescribed by NCLBA, though many implemented actions NCLBA  specifies for the corrective action stage of school improvement. Despite  these findings, department officials told us that they did not have any  monitoring findings related to restructuring requirements, nor did they  know whether any states had found districts that had not implemented  restructuring requirements, although they did find deficiencies in some  districts\u2019 review of school improvement plans.", "Education\u2019s monitoring tools and reporting requirements do not fully  address issues of compliance. While Education\u2019s state monitoring tool  includes questions about how states monitor the implementation of school  improvement plans, Education officials acknowledged that the department  may be able to strengthen its monitoring tool to determine whether state  oversight of districts is adequate to ensure compliance. Also, since states  are not required to report district noncompliance to Education and  Education does not require states to report on the specific corrective  actions and restructuring options taken to address the achievement  problems of each school, federal officials have limited information on  areas in which there are compliance issues as well as the extent to which  districts are complying."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Higher Percent of Schools That Fully Implemented Improvement Activities Made AYP", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that over a third of schools that fully implemented a  corrective action or restructuring option made AYP, as opposed to   16 percent of schools that had mostly or partially implemented  improvement activities. Several officials noted, and research shows, that  school improvement efforts take more than a year to affect student  achievement, so it is possible that these activities will help these schools  make AYP over the next several years. Many district and school officials  we interviewed told us that implementing a new curriculum takes time and  that other improvement efforts can take several years to fully implement  and to see results. Other factors also can affect school improvement  efforts. For example, among the schools that made AYP, 76 percent of  principals believed teacher quality helped or greatly helped school  improvement activities in their school, opposed to only 53 percent among  schools that had not made AYP. In addition to teacher quality, around 80  percent of school officials believed that instructional support and  resources, such as teacher aides and computers, helped or greatly helped  their school improvement efforts. Schools lacking such support may find  implementation of corrective action and restructuring more challenging.", "Based on our survey results, none of the specific corrective actions or  restructuring options was associated with making AYP, nor was making  AYP associated with the number of activities undertaken, and these  findings are consistent with recent research on school improvement.  Many school officials believed that other factors affected student  achievement and therefore, the schools\u2019 ability to make AYP. About   80 percent of school principals believed that community poverty impeded  student achievement, while two-thirds believed community violence  impeded achievement. We found similar views during our site visits. For  example, at two schools we visited, officials noted that the presence of  gangs in the neighborhood affected student achievement, and teachers at  one school commented that it was unsafe for students to visit the  community library after dark. Several school and district officials  observed that poverty affected students\u2019 academic efforts. School officials  noted that many poor students cannot stay late at school because they  have family obligations, such as taking care of younger children. In  addition, about two-thirds of school principals believed that student  mobility (moving from one school to another) impeded student  achievement, and several officials said that districtwide or statewide  curricula had been implemented, in part, to address widespread student  mobility by establishing a consistent instructional approach across  schools. Moreover, we estimate that nearly half of school officials believed  that low student attendance impeded student achievement at their school.  This finding was more prevalent among schools that had not made AYP  compared to schools that had made AYP.

However, Education  could not tell us how often states take actions against districts for not  providing required assistance, because according to one Education  official, Education did not collect this information from states.", "Generally, school officials we met with told us that the district was  actively involved in providing assistance to their schools. Almost all school  principals and teachers that we interviewed specifically emphasized  district efforts to train their administrators and teaching staff to analyze  and use student testing data to target their instruction to areas of  academic weakness and to students that needed additional assistance. In  addition, they said that districts had targeted resources to provide  professional development and implement effective instructional practices.  For example, in most districts we visited, school officials said that literacy  or math coaches had been hired to provide staff development or to work  with teachers to identify instructional practices to improve instruction.  Also, in some schools we visited, officials told us that districts assisted the  schools in their efforts to increase parental involvement. For example, in  New York City, the district helped some schools by approving a parent  coordinator position to get parents more involved in their schools.  Officials in some districts also reported reviewing school budgets to  ensure that resources are allocated to programs that target student  performance. In regard to budget assistance, district officials in Chicago  told us that they must approve budgets of all schools in restructuring.

The center produced a series of Web-based  seminars during the spring and summer of 2007, also based on the  handbook, for use by the regional centers. In addition, each regional  center has developed an annual work plan, negotiated with the states for  which it is responsible. For example, the New York Regional Center  provides assistance to the state of New York and has negotiated a work  plan with several goals related to school improvement.

Moreover, several state,  district, and school officials we interviewed indicated that they needed  more information on practices for improving schools in corrective action  and restructuring. For example, an official in one district told us that they  had been attempting to create their own approaches to improve schools,  but said that there was insufficient information, from federal or other  sources, on improvement practices. Recognizing the need for information  that may be more suited for teachers, principals, and other educators,  Education officials reported that the department will launch a Web site in  September 2007 related to their initiative, Doing What Works.

Although Education has made efforts to provide  guidance to districts on what actions are required and when, the  department\u2019s efforts do not address several specific issues that would  allow states, districts, and schools to make well informed decisions that  are in compliance with NCLBA. For example, many schools in corrective  action continued efforts implemented previously but did not implement a  new action. While this course of action may be a reasonable and  appropriate path for some schools to take, Education has not provided  guidance to districts delineating when continuing a corrective action\u2014and  not taking an additional one\u2014is appropriate and when it is not. Without  written guidance, some districts and schools that are not demonstrating  sustained improvement may continue previous efforts in order to avoid  having to make more changes.

Because states provided the names of schools in  corrective action and restructuring in their 2004-2005 CSPRs, these  schools comprised the national population of such schools. In some cases,  states used different labels for identifying schools in corrective action and  restructuring. For example, one state identified schools in corrective  action by labeling them as \u201cYear 3\u201d schools. When states used terms other  than corrective action and restructuring to indicate schools\u2019 improvement  status, we contacted state officials to clarify the label the state used.  Education also provided us with numbers of schools in corrective action  and restructuring for the 2006-2007 school year, which we compared to  numbers from prior years. On the basis of our review of the data on  improvement status for school years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, we  determined these sources to be sufficient for the purposes of our work.  We used the lists of schools in corrective action and restructuring for the  2005-2006 school year to develop our survey samples and for comparisons  with other Title I schools not identified as needing improvement.", "Also in the CSPR, states provided each school\u2019s nationally unique  identification number, allowing us to link data on these schools with data  provided in Education\u2019s Common Core of Data (CCD). The CCD is a  database of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics, which  annually collects data from state educational agencies about all public  schools, public school districts, and state educational agencies in the  United States. At the time we began our analysis, the latest CCD data  available were from the 2004-2005 school year. Although we based our  analysis on schools in corrective action and restructuring in 2005-2006, the  characteristics were based on one year prior. Upon linking schools  identified in the CSPR to those in the CCD, we obtained data on the  following characteristics:  locale: whether the school was located was in an urban, suburban, or  rural area or town;    minority status: the percent of students in the school classified as  American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black/Non- Hispanic, or Hispanic;    poverty status: the percent of students in the school who qualified for  free- or reduced-priced meals; and    grade levels served: whether primary, middle, or high school grades.", "To define these levels, we used the definitions provided in the CCD, as  listed in table 9.", "Schools that did not fit these grade-level configurations were classified as  \u201cother,\u201d meaning any other combination, from the low grades of  prekindergarten, kindergarten or first grade up to twelfth grade, consistent  with the CCD definition.", "We compared the percentage of schools in corrective action and  restructuring with all other Title I schools within each category of the  characteristics of locale and grade levels served. For minority status and  poverty status, we compared schools in corrective action and  restructuring with all other Title I schools by comparing the  characteristics of the median school within each group. The median is the  school in the middle of a list of schools when they are listed from highest  to lowest along any given characteristic, such that one-half of the schools  are listed above and the other half are listed below that school. For  example, when all corrective action and restructuring schools were listed  from highest to lowest in terms of poverty status, the school in the middle  of that list had a poverty rate of 96 percent. In contrast, when all other  Title I schools were listed from highest to lowest, the school in the middle  of that list had a poverty rate of 37 percent. We chose to use the median  school instead of calculating the average for all schools or all students,  because so many schools had high rates of poverty and minority student  representation, that the median more accurately characterized the typical  school in our dataset than did the average.", "We performed a series of tests and took additional steps as needed to  assess the reliability of the data used.

Since we followed a  probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one  of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. As each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval (for example, plus or minus 8 percentage points).

As a result, we are 95 percent confident  that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true  values in the study population. We excluded 8 of the sampled schools,  because they were not in corrective action status in the 2005-2006 school  year, were not Title I schools or had closed, and therefore were  considered out of scope.

In developing the Web  survey, we conducted several pretests of draft instruments. We pretested  the survey instrument with school officials in Aurora, Illinois; Berkeley,  California; and Orange, New Jersey, between October and November 2006.  We selected schools in these states because they contained large numbers  of schools in corrective action and thus it was likely that schools from  these states would be included in our sample. In the pretests, we were  generally interested in the clarity of the questions and the flow and layout  of the survey. For example, we wanted to ensure definitions used in the  surveys were clear and known to the respondents, categories provided in  closed-ended questions were complete and exclusive, and the ordering of  survey sections and the questions within each section was appropriate. We  revised the survey on the basis of information we gathered in the pretests.", "A second step we took to minimize nonsampling errors was using a Web- based survey. By allowing respondents to enter their responses directly  into an electronic instrument, this method automatically created a record  for each respondent in a data file and eliminated the need for and the  errors (and costs) associated with a manual data entry process. To further  minimize errors, programs used to analyze the survey data and make  estimations were independently verified to ensure the accuracy of this  work.", "While we did not fully validate specific information that school officials  reported in our survey, we took several steps to ensure that the  information was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.

All percentage estimates  included in this report have margins of error of plus or minus 8 percentage  points or less, unless otherwise noted.", "As with the corrective action survey, we took steps to minimize  nonsampling errors. We pretested the survey instrument with school  officials in Detroit, Michigan and Syracuse, New York, between October  and November 2006. We selected schools in these states because the states  contained large numbers of schools implementing restructuring and thus it  was likely that schools from these states would be included in our sample.  The pretests were conducted in the same manner as those done for the  corrective action survey. On the basis of the pretests, the Web instrument  underwent some revisions. Again, use of a Web-based survey also  minimized nonsampling errors as did independently verifying programs  used to analyze the survey data and make estimations.", "Steps taken to ensure that the information was sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report mirror those taken for the corrective action survey,  including obtaining corroborating evidence of schools\u2019 improvement  status when the information provided by the school conflicted with the  information we had received from the Department of Education. When a  survey response did not align with the information that we obtained from  state Web sites and school report cards, we made changes based on our  documentary evidence. We checked a sample of schools that claimed to  have made AYP to verify these responses and found that the responses  were accurate. Again, we made comparisons between select items from  our survey data and other national-level data sets, and found our survey  data were reasonably consistent with the external sources. On the basis of  our checks, we believe our survey data are sufficient for the purposes of  our work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Response Rate", "paragraphs": ["We received survey responses from 74 percent of the Title I schools  implementing restructuring in our sample. After the survey was closed, we  analyzed the survey respondents to determine if there were any  differences between the responding schools, the nonresponding schools,  and the population, as was done for the corrective action survey. We  found no significant differences between the estimates for the survey  respondents and the overall population values for these characteristics.

For such questions, we  combined the survey responses for reporting purposes. We weighted the  respondents so that the estimates are for the in-scope combined  population of corrective action and implementing restructuring schools.  Because we surveyed a sample of schools, our results are estimates of a  population of Title I schools in corrective action and implementing  restructuring and thus are subject to sampling errors that are associated  with samples of this size and type.
