The  public expects schools to operate in an orderly environment free from  violence. Standards for discipline and safety in schools are set primarily by  local school districts. In recent years, however, federal law has required  states and local districts to implement certain discipline-related policies in  schools\u2014for example, through provisions of the Gun Free Schools Act  and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA requires  that eligible children with disabilities have available to them a free,  appropriate public education that provides for special education and  related services to address their educational needs in the least restrictive environment. The act also requires schools to follow certain procedures  when they make a change in a student\u2019s educational placement because of  his or her behavior.", "Moreover, the act prescribes a set of procedures to ensure that children  with disabilities who engage in misconduct are not unfairly deprived of  educational services. While federal law and regulations require all schools  to provide procedural protections to students with disabilities, states and  school districts have the option to provide them with additional  protections. Almost 6 million youths aged 3 through 21 (more than 1 of  every 8 of the 46.6 million public school students) were classified as having  physical, learning, or emotional disabilities that qualified them to receive  educational services under IDEA in school year 1997-98, according to the  most recent data. In fiscal year 2000 the federal government provided  $6 billion to states and local governments to help provide those services.", "When the Department of Education issued proposed regulations  implementing the IDEA amendments of 1997, some school administrators  and teachers raised concerns about their ability to preserve school safety  and order and at the same time educate children with disabilities.  Specifically, several provisions of IDEA and portions of the proposed  regulations (such as the \u201cstay-put\u201d provision and the cumulative 10-school- day limit on suspensions) were perceived as limiting the authority of school  personnel to remove students with disabilities from school for disciplinary  infractions. Moreover, at that time, anecdotal evidence suggested that even  after engaging in serious misconduct, students with disabilities continued  to receive educational services in schools because of the protections  afforded by IDEA. In contrast, nondisabled students involved in similar  infractions were suspended or expelled without services. This led to the  perception of a double standard for student discipline and gave rise to  concerns about the fairness of school discipline policies for students with  disabilities. As a result, the Congress directed us to conduct a study to  determine how the IDEA amendments of 1997 affect the ability of schools  to maintain a safe environment conducive to learning. We could not  undertake this study until Education issued final regulations to guide  implementation of IDEA\u2019s 1997 amendments, which took place in March  1999. Following discussions with your staffs, we agreed to study the issues  after the final regulations had been in place for at least a significant portion  of a school year and answer the following questions:   What are the incidence and impact of serious student misconduct  (drugs; weapons; assault; rape; sexual assault; and robbery) on schools,  and is the impact primarily attributable to the serious misconduct of  students with disabilities or of regular education students?", "Are students with disabilities who engage in serious misconduct being  disciplined differently from those without disabilities and, if so, how?", "What is the role that IDEA plays in schools\u2019 ability to properly discipline  students with disabilities who engage in serious misconduct?", "Although the IDEA amendments of 1997 required that Education collect  limited data on certain disciplinary actions for special education students,  at the time we did our work this effort had not progressed sufficiently to  provide us with any usable data. Because of this limitation, we surveyed a  nationally representative sample of about 465 public middle and high  school principals about discipline of special education as well as regular  education students. We did not survey elementary schools because data  from Department of Education and Department of Justice reports showed  that elementary schools were much less likely than either middle or high  schools to experience or report any type of serious misconduct. All data  from our survey are self-reported, and we did not independently verify their  accuracy. We had a response rate of 60 percent for our survey. This  response rate is too low to permit us to produce estimates that are  nationally representative. Nevertheless, the size and geographic location of  the 272 responding schools were generally similar to the schools in our  sample, and we believe the survey data provide information not available  from any other source about IDEA\u2019s impact on school discipline. We also  conducted site visits and interviews with principals in Louisiana, New York,  and Wisconsin to help develop our survey instruments and gain a broader  perspective on the IDEA implementation in a variety of settings and in  locations where IDEA and discipline issues were reported to be of  significant concern. Finally, we reviewed the few available studies on IDEA  and school discipline issues. We incorporated, where appropriate, the  results of those studies into the design of our review and the conclusions  contained in this report. We conducted our work between January 2000 and  December 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Appendix I explains our methodology in more detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IDEA is the primary federal law addressing the unique educational needs of  children with disabilities. Millions of youths with disabilities aged 3  through 21 receive educational services under IDEA each year. In 1975, the  Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA),  which mandated that a free, appropriate public education be made  available for all children with disabilities, ensured due process rights,  required individualized education programs, and required placement of  children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. Subsequent  amendments to this law added other provisions and programs in support of  children with disabilities and their parents and renamed the law as the  IDEA in 1990. IDEA was most recently substantially revised in 1997.", "IDEA defines childhood disabilities to include a number of different  emotional or physical conditions. Specifically, IDEA defines a \u201cchild with a  disability\u201d as a child with mental retardation; hearing, speech, or language  impairments; visual impairments; orthopedic impairments; serious  emotional disturbance; autism; traumatic brain injury; other health  impairments; or specific learning disabilities, who, for this reason, needs  special education and related services.", "By requiring that eligible children with disabilities receive special  education services to address their educational needs in the least  restrictive environment, IDEA mandates that such students are to be  educated, to the maximum extent appropriate, with children who are not  disabled. Generally, disabled students are to be removed from the regular  education class only when they cannot be educated in that setting with  supplementary aids and services. IDEA provides safeguards to ensure that  children with disabilities who engage in misconduct are not unfairly  deprived of educational services. For example, in developing the child\u2019s  IEP, the team\u2014which includes at least one of the child\u2019s regular education  teachers and others providing special education resources\u2014must consider  strategies to address any behavior that may impede the child\u2019s learning or  the learning of others. If a child with a disability engages in misconduct, the  school may take disciplinary action; however, the school may also be  required to convene the IEP team to conduct a behavioral assessment and  develop or review an intervention plan to address the behavior that  resulted in the disciplinary action. Also, when the suspension considered is  for more than 10 school days at a time, the IEP team must review the  relationship between the child\u2019s disability and the behavior that resulted in  the disciplinary action.", "In October 1997, the Department of Education issued proposed regulations  implementing the amendments. The proposed regulations contained  several provisions that would allow services to continue to special  education students who were suspended or expelled. In response to these  proposed regulations some districts put in place discipline policies that  were consistent with the proposed regulations that limited suspensions of  special education students. In commenting on the proposed regulations,  some school administrators and others voiced concerns that several  procedural and discipline provisions that were designed to protect the  rights of students with disabilities created problems among some school  administrators and teachers over how to preserve school safety and order.  After receiving nearly 6,000 public comments, Education issued final  regulations for the IDEA amendments on March 12, 1999. The final  regulations included some changes to the discipline provisions that  attempted to respond to some of these concerns.", "According to Education, the discipline provisions in the final regulations  give school officials reasonable flexibility to deal with minor infractions of  school rules, while ensuring that special education students continue to  receive educational services. To avoid disruption during the school year,  Education did not require a state to comply with the new regulations  essentially until the 1999-2000 school year began.", "Generally, under IDEA and the 1999 implementing federal regulations,  schools are permitted to suspend a special education student for up to 10  school days in a given school year without providing educational services  or removing the child to an alternative educational setting. However, if the  misconduct is not a manifestation of the student\u2019s disability, the student  may be suspended beyond 10 school days; for such suspensions, the special  education student must be provided educational services. The final  regulations require a manifestation determination\u2014to assess whether the  student\u2019s misconduct was caused by his disability\u2014and an IEP team  meeting only when a suspension is for more than 10 school days at a time.  Otherwise, for short-term suspensions lasting 10 or fewer school days that  do not constitute a change in placement, a manifestation determination and  an IEP meeting are not mandatory. Additionally, the final regulations also  permit repeated short-term (not more than 10 school days) suspensions of  a disabled student, even if the suspensions cumulatively total more than 10  school days, so long as educational services are provided to the student  after the 10th suspension day in a given school year.", "The regulations also modify a school\u2019s authority to suspend a disabled  student for more than 10 school days. Specifically, prior to the 1997 IDEA  amendments, a student with a disability could be removed for up to 45 days  to an interim alternative educational setting for carrying a firearm; under  the revised law and the implementing regulations, this suspension  authority has been expanded to include a disabled student who possesses  or carries a weapon or possesses, uses, sells, or solicits drugs at school, as  well as a disabled student determined by a hearing officer to be so  dangerous that the student\u2019s behavior \u201cis substantially likely to result in  injury to the child or others.\u201d", "Before special education students may be removed from their current  educational placement, however, IDEA provides a number of procedural  safeguards. One such safeguard is a student\u2019s right to remain in his or her  current educational placement during any due process and subsequent  judicial proceedings that follow the initial disciplinary removal. This  safeguard was designed to limit the exclusion of students with disabilities  from their educational setting because of their disability. In the past, such  exclusions were alleged to have occurred so that schools, under the guise  of minimizing disruptions or protecting other students, would not have to  provide expensive services to disabled students. However, the so-called  \u201cstay-put\u201d provision, whereby a child\u2019s educational placement is to be  maintained, has been perceived by some as limiting the authority of school  personnel to remove special education students from school for  disciplinary infractions.", "Education publicized the issuance of these final regulations extensively  through printed materials and via its agency Web site. It also provided  training and support materials to states and school districts explaining the  changes. Education held a series of public forums around the country for  local education agencies, schools, and other interested parties to explain  the changes to the final regulations, with a special emphasis on the changes  to the discipline provisions. It also held interactive videoconferences for  the public and made numerous presentations at state forums. Education  funded partnership grants with various groups to provide approved training  and information at the local level.

Moreover, most suspended students from either group were given short- term, rather than long-term, suspensions. The portion of suspended special  education students who received educational services during their  suspensions was not much different from the portion of suspended regular  education students who received services. Finally, the percentages of  regular education and special education perpetrators who were suspended  from school and/or placed in an alternative educational setting were 15  percent and 17 percent, respectively.", "We asked principals in our survey to indicate the type and frequency of  disciplinary actions they took with students in response to the serious  misconduct engaged in by regular education and special education  students during the 1999-2000 school year.

Sixty- four percent of regular education students and 58 percent of special  education students who engaged in serious misconduct were given out-of- school suspensions during the 1999-2000 school year.

On these site visits we  met with state officials, nine district superintendents, special education  directors, assistant principals, school security staff, and principals from 45  schools. We selected these states in order to visit with school staff from a  variety of settings (urban/rural, large city/suburban), where IDEA and  discipline issues were reported to be of significant concern. We discussed  with these school officials their experiences with state and local district  policy concerning school discipline for special education and regular  education students and the impact that IDEA law and regulations have had  on their ability to maintain safe and orderly schools."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following persons made important  contributions to the report: George Erhart, Brett Fallavollita, Elspeth  Grindstaff, and Behn Miller."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ordering Information", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report is free.
