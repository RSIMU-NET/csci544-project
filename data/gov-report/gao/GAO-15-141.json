However, since pools have been reaching their capacities, owners and generators of spent nuclear fuel (typically utilities and reactor operators) have been transferring it to canisters that are placed in casks on concrete pads for dry storage\u2014which is an expensive and time-consuming process. When operating reactors' licenses begin to expire in the 2030s, the rate of spent nuclear fuel accumulation is expected to decrease, but the amount in dry storage will increase as the pools are closed and all spent nuclear fuel is transferred to dry storage. By 2067, the currently operating reactors are expected to have generated about 139,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, nearly all of which is expected to be transferred to dry storage.", "Federal liability for managing spent nuclear fuel has been based on costs that owners and generators of this fuel have paid because the Department of Energy (DOE) has not met its contractual obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel.

Although DOE has begun to take actions to address some of these challenges, officials noted that the department's strategy cannot be fully implemented until Congress provides direction on a new path forward. However, experts and stakeholders believe that one key challenge\u2014building and sustaining public acceptance of how to manage spent nuclear fuel\u2014will need to be addressed irrespective of which path Congress agrees to take. In this context, they suggested the need for a coordinated public outreach strategy regarding spent nuclear fuel management issues, including perceived risks and benefits, which would be consistent with the Administration's directive to be more transparent and collaborative.

The  nation\u2019s inventory of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power  reactors is stored at 75 sites in 33 states, generally where it was  generated.

Over the past several decades, the inventory of  commercial spent nuclear fuel in storage in the United States has grown  to about 72,000 metric tons.", "To address the growing inventory, Congress made disposal of spent  nuclear fuel a federal responsibility with the passage of the Nuclear  Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), which directed the Department of  Energy (DOE) to investigate sites for a permanent repository.

Then, in a change  of policy in 2009, the Secretary of Energy said that a repository at Yucca  Mountain was not a workable option, and in 2010, DOE terminated its  efforts to license a repository there. In 2010, DOE chartered the Blue  Ribbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Future to recommend a plan  for management and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. In January 2012, the  Blue Ribbon Commission recommended that Congress create and fund a  new organization dedicated solely to managing spent nuclear fuel.

These pellets are fitted into 12- to 15-foot hollow rods,  referred to as cladding, made of a zirconium alloy. The rods are then  bound together into a larger assembly. A typical reactor holds about 100  metric tons of fuel when operating\u2014generally from 200 to 800 fuel  assemblies. The uranium in the assemblies undergoes fission\u2014a process  of splitting atoms into fragments and neutrons that then bombard other  atoms\u2014resulting in additional fission reactions and a sustainable chain  reaction that creates an enormous amount of heat and radioactivity in the  form of radioisotopes, or radioactive substances. The heat is used to  generate steam to turn a turbine, which generates electricity. The  radioisotopes produced in a reactor can remain hazardous from a few  days to many thousands of years; these radioisotopes remain in the fuel  assemblies and as components of the resulting spent nuclear fuel. Figure  1 shows what a fuel pellet for a commercial nuclear reactor and a fuel rod  in an assembly look like.", "Each fuel assembly is typically used in the reactor from 4 to 6 years, after  which most of the uranium dioxide is no longer cost-efficient at producing  energy. Reactor operators typically discharge about one-third of the fuel  assemblies from a reactor every 18 months to 2 years and place the  spent nuclear fuel in a pool to cool. Most commercial spent nuclear fuel is  stored immersed in pools of water designed to cool and isolate it from the  environment. Water circulates in the pool to remove the heat generated  from the radioactive decay of some of the radioisotopes. In recent years,  reactor operators have used fuel that is burned longer in the reactor  under the same operating conditions, resulting in higher \u201cburn-up\u201d and  higher decay heat in comparison to the lower burn-up fuel that had been  in use. The pools of water for cooling spent nuclear fuel are typically  about 40 feet deep, with at least 20 feet of water covering the spent fuel.  Figure 2 shows a typical spent nuclear fuel pool.", "Industry practice has been to store the spent nuclear fuel in the pools for  at least 5 years, with an industry expectation that, at some point, DOE  would begin to accept it. Spent nuclear fuel typically must remain in a  pool for at least 5 years to decay enough to remain within the heat limits  currently allowed for dry cask storage systems. Spent nuclear fuel can be  sufficiently cool to load into dry storage systems earlier than 5 years, but  doing so is generally not practical. Some dry storage systems, depending  on the rated heat load, may not accommodate a full load of spent nuclear  fuel. High burn-up fuel may have to remain in a pool longer than low burn- up fuel to cool sufficiently.", "The pools at commercial nuclear power reactors have largely reached  their maximum capacities, however. When spent nuclear fuel is  discharged from a reactor at a plant where the spent nuclear fuel pool is  at maximum capacity, spent nuclear fuel equal to the amount of spent  nuclear fuel discharged from the reactor must be transferred to dry  storage. The dry storage systems typically consist of either a thick-walled,  bolted steel vertical cask, or a welded steel canister inside a vertical or  horizontal steel-reinforced concrete cask. Dry storage systems are  designed with thick steel and concrete walls to provide radiation shielding  and passive pathways for removal of spent nuclear fuel decay heat, such  as air vents in the casks. In one typical process of transferring spent fuel  to dry storage, reactor operators place a steel canister inside a larger  steel transfer cask and lower both into a pool. Spent nuclear fuel is  loaded into the canister, a lid is placed on the canister, and then both the  canister and transfer cask are removed from the pool. The transfer cask  shields nearby workers from the radiation produced by the spent nuclear  fuel in the canister. The water is drained and a lid is welded onto the  canister. Then the canister and transfer cask are aligned with a storage  cask and the canister is maneuvered into the storage cask. The transfer  cask can be re-used. The storage casks, in either vertical or horizontal  designs (see fig. 3), are usually situated on a large concrete pad with  safety and security measures, such as radiation detection devices and  intrusion detection systems.", "NRC requires that spent fuel in dry storage be stored in approved  systems that offer protection from significant amounts of radiation. NRC  requires storage systems to demonstrate compliance with its regulations,  including through physical tests of the systems, scaled physical tests, and  computer modeling. Once a dry storage system is approved, NRC issues  a certificate of compliance for a cask design or a specific license. Figure 4  shows spent nuclear fuel on a concrete pad in dry storage.", "Most U.S. reactors were built during the 1960s and 1970s and, after a 40- year licensing period have received a 20-year license extension, and  some may apply for subsequent extensions. Nevertheless, these reactors  may begin permanently shutting down in large numbers by about 2030  and emptying their pools by about 2040 absent additional license  renewals. In the absence of a repository, the reactors\u2019 accumulated spent  nuclear fuel will be \u201cstranded\u201d in a variety of different dry storage systems,  with no easy way of repackaging the spent fuel should repackaging be  required to meet future storage or disposal requirements. NRC  regulations require radioactive contamination to be reduced at a reactor  to a level that allows NRC to terminate the reactor\u2019s license and release  the property for other use after a reactor shuts down permanently.

Second, the amount of spent  nuclear fuel transferred to dry storage is expected to increase as reactors  shut down and their pools are closed. According to data from the Nuclear  Energy Institute, by 2024, the proportion of spent fuel in wet storage and  dry storage from currently existing reactors should be roughly equal\u2014 about 48,000 metric tons each.

The Department of  Justice has also agreed to pay such costs as a result of settlement  agreements. (See app. IV for additional information on the settlement  agreements.) Under the standard contract, DOE was obligated to take  title to and dispose of a certain quantity of spent nuclear fuel beginning in  1998. The order in which spent nuclear fuel was to be picked up is based  on the order in which it was removed from reactors\u2014or the oldest fuel  first. The owner or generator was expected to pay continued storage  costs for the spent nuclear fuel that DOE was not obligated to pick up.", "Some of the costs for which the federal government has been liable have  related to expanding wet storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, the  federal government has compensated owners and generators for  replacing lower-density storage racks with higher-density storage racks in  pools to increase the capacity of the pools. The capacity of nearly all the  spent nuclear fuel pools in the country has been expanded to the extent  practical, and according to NRC, most pools have been filled to their  maximum prudent capacities.", "The majority of the types of costs for which the federal government has  been liable have pertained to dry storage costs of spent nuclear fuel.  Some have been one-time costs, such as the cost of constructing a  concrete pad for storing spent nuclear fuel once it has been transferred  from the pools to dry canisters or casks. Constructing a concrete storage  pad typically costs from about $5.5 million to $6.5 million, but can range  higher if additional equipment or special design requirements are needed.", "Other dry storage costs are recurring; for example, the cost of the  canisters themselves, which depends on the size of the canister and type  of spent nuclear fuel stored in it. Table 1 shows the differences in sizes of  canisters, which typically cost from $700,000 to $1.5 million, and how the  numbers of canisters for which the federal government may have to pay  can vary from site to site.", "Another recurring cost is the cost of transferring spent nuclear fuel in the  canisters from the pools to dry storage.

Before 2000, most  fuel discharged from U.S. nuclear power reactors was considered low  burn-up fuel, and consequently, the industry has had decades of  experience in storing and transporting it. In addition, the first dry storage  canisters were loaded in 1986. One of these, containing low burn-up fuel,  was opened 15 years later and the spent nuclear fuel inspected. The  spent nuclear fuel was found to be in good condition, giving NRC  additional confidence in the safe storage and transport of spent nuclear  fuel. According to NRC, there has been considerable analysis performed  on high burn-up fuel, but because it has only been used for about the past  10 years, there has been little testing performed on it. According to  various reports from DOE, NRC, the Electric Power Research Institute,  and the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, as well as experts we  spoke with, uncertainties exist on how long high burn-up fuel can be  stored and then still be safely transported. Once sealed in a canister, the  spent fuel cannot easily be inspected for degradation.", "Description of Concerns Related to High Burn-Up Fuel  According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), burn up is  considered as part of NRC\u2019s reviews of spent nuclear fuel cask designs  because each dry storage system has limits on temperature and radiation,  both of which are higher for high burn-up fuel. While in the reactor, hydrogen  gas is generated and is absorbed by the cladding. Then, during the transfer  from wet to dry storage, the spent nuclear fuel is loaded into a storage cask,  which is removed from the storage pool and drained of water to dry the fuel.  During the drying process, the fuel heats up, dissolving the hydrogen in the  cladding structure. While the spent nuclear fuel is still hot and the cladding is  still supple, there is little uncertainty in storing or transporting it, as long as  temperature and radiation limits are met. However, as the spent nuclear fuel  cools over extended periods in dry storage, the dissolved hydrogen can  change the characteristics of the cladding and, if certain conditions exist, can  cause the cladding to become brittle over time. The extent of the changes in  cladding depend on the burn-up of the fuel, the type of cladding, and the  temperatures reached during the drying process, and need to be accounted  for in the storage and transportation of high burn-up spent nuclear fuel. There  is not the same level of concern about changes in the cladding causing  brittleness with low burn-up fuel because not as much hydrogen becomes  dissolved in the cladding. In addition, there is more data available on the  performance of low burn-up fuel during storage, since low burn-up fuel has  been stored for long periods.", "As of August 2014, NRC officials told us that they had analyzed  laboratory tests and models developed to predict the changes that occur  during dry storage and the results indicate that high burn-up fuel will  maintain its integrity over very long periods of storage and can eventually  be safely transported. However, NRC officials said they continue to seek  additional evidence to confirm their position that long-term storage and  transportation of high burn-up spent nuclear fuel is safe. In an effort to  obtain evidence confirming the test and modeling results, DOE and the  Electric Power Research Institute have planned a joint development  project to load a special dry cask storage system with high burn-up fuel in  mid-2017 and, using instrumentation built into the cask, monitor the spent  nuclear fuel over a period of about 10 years. At that point, DOE and the  Electric Power Research Institute expect to transport the canister to an  appropriate facility and open it to inspect the high burn-up fuel and its  cladding, as well as the cask, for any indication of damage or  degradation. According to DOE and the Electric Power Research  Institute, the project\u2019s execution has been planned through 2018 and  many future elements of the project still need to be developed. Experts  and stakeholders expressed various views regarding the level of  uncertainty of the safe transportation of high burn-up fuel after long-term  storage. But one theme conveyed during our discussions with them was  that high burn-up fuel would continue to be stored in dry storage canisters  without knowing how long the spent nuclear fuel would be stored or how  safe future transportation would be. DOE officials stated that their  strategy would not involve transportation of large amounts of high burn-up  fuel until at least 2025 and that even then, there is likely going to be  enough low burn-up fuel to ship for the first several years, giving more  time for the development project to yield results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Stored Spent Nuclear Fuel May Not Be Readily Transportable", "paragraphs": ["Because the guidelines governing dry storage of spent nuclear fuel allow  higher temperatures and external radiation levels than guidelines for  transporting the fuel, some of the spent nuclear fuel in dry storage may  not be ready to be moved to an interim storage facility in time to meet  DOE\u2019s time frames. For example, according to the Nuclear Energy  Institute, as of 2012, only about 30 percent of spent nuclear fuel currently  in dry storage is cool enough to be directly transportable. For safety  reasons, transportation guidelines do not allow the surface of the  transportation cask to exceed 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees  Celsius) because the spent nuclear fuel is traveling through public areas  using the nation\u2019s public transportation infrastructure. NRC\u2019s guidelines  on spent nuclear fuel dry storage limit spent nuclear fuel temperature to  752 degrees Fahrenheit (400 degrees Celsius).spent nuclear fuel dry storage systems are typically found, are usually in  secluded areas with a buffer zone between the spent nuclear fuel and the  public. Dry storage sites are also usually located so that workers and the  public have minimal exposure to radiation from the spent nuclear fuel.  According to experts from industry, spent nuclear fuel has typically been  stored in large dry storage canisters to maximize storage capacity and   Reactor sites, where  minimize costs. Spent nuclear fuel stored in the large canisters, however,  may have temperatures that exceed the limits of transportation  guidelines.", "Scientists from the national laboratories and experts from industry  suggested three options for dealing with the stored spent nuclear fuel so it  can be transported safely: (1) the spent nuclear fuel may be left to cool  and decay at reactor sites, (2) the spent nuclear fuel may be repackaged  into smaller canisters that reduce the heat and radiation, or (3) a special  transportation \u201coverpack\u201d may be developed to safely transport the spent  nuclear fuel in the current large canisters.

However, several experts from industry pointed out that not all of the  spent nuclear fuel currently in dry storage is situated near rail lines; also,  one of these experts said that procuring qualified rail cars capable of  transporting spent nuclear fuel will be a lengthy process. Storage sites  without access to a rail line may require upgrades to the transportation  infrastructure or alternative modes of transportation to the nearest rail  line. Constructing new rail lines or extending existing rail lines could be a  time-consuming and costly endeavor. In addition, an industry official  noted that if spent nuclear fuel were trucked to the nearest rail line, the  federal government would have to develop a safe method of transferring  the spent nuclear fuel from heavy haul trucks onto rail cars. In September  2013, DOE completed a preliminary technical evaluation of options  available and needed infrastructure for DOE or a new waste management  and disposal organization to transport spent nuclear fuel from shut-down  sites to a consolidated interim storage facility. According to DOE officials,  currently there is no need to make a decision regarding how best to move  forward with the study results because there is, at this time, no site and  no authorization to site, license, construct, and operate a consolidated  interim storage facility.", "DOE\u2019s Preliminary Evaluation of Removing Spent Nuclear Fuel from  Shutdown Sites  DOE\u2019s \u201cPreliminary Evaluation of Removing Used Nuclear Fuel from  Shutdown Sites\u201d looked at 12 permanently shutdown sites, which included  Maine Yankee, Yankee Rowe, Connecticut Yankee, Humboldt Bay, Big Rock  Point, Rancho Seco, Trojan, La Crosse, Zion, Crystal River, Kewaunee, and  San Onofre. The evaluation found that some shut-down sites, because the  facilities have been decommissioned and lack onsite infrastructure, required  multiple transportation modes such as heavy-haul-truck to rail, barge to rail,  and in the cases of Kewaunee and Humboldt Bay, potentially heavy-haul- truck to barge to rail. For example, Trojan\u2019s rail spur was removed during the  decommissioning process and Big Rock Point will probably need to truck its  spent nuclear fuel 52 miles to Gaylord, Michigan. Some of the sites evaluated  have no rail spur, and heavy haul trucking will be required for anywhere from  7.5 miles to potentially 260 miles, depending on the site.", "A DOE official and experts from industry also told us that DOE needs to  begin procuring qualified rail cars capable of transporting spent nuclear  fuel. DOE officials stated that the agency is beginning to request  information from the rail car industry on the rail car design, testing, and  approval for the transportation of commercial spent nuclear fuel and  anticipates getting responses from interested parties by July 2014.  According to an industry representative, the Association of American  Railroads established the S-2043 standard, which sets higher standards  for transportation of spent nuclear fuel than for normal rail operations. S- 2043 requires, for example, on-board safety protection technology unique  to spent nuclear fuel shipments and a high performance structural  upgrades to accommodate the extra weight of spent nuclear fuel as well  as the transportation cask, which according to the industry representative,  can weigh up to 500,000 pounds. Industry experts said it may be  challenging to design and fabricate rail cars that meet the S-2043  standard for transporting heavy, fully loaded spent nuclear fuel canisters  within DOE\u2019s time frames. According to industry experts, it will take, at a  minimum, 2 years to design and fabricate a new rail car, in addition to an  extensive quality control process to ensure the car meets the S-2043  standard. For example, an industry representative estimated that the  entire rail car procurement process may take up to 9 years and another  agreed that it may be feasible to begin to move the spent fuel by 2025 if  DOE initiates the necessary planning soon. Another option would be for  DOE to use what the U.S. Navy has learned from its rail cars designs for  its nuclear navy program, which also generates spent nuclear fuel.

More specifically, as noted earlier,  some dry storage canisters may be too hot or radioactive to meet  transportation regulations. If the decision were made to transport the  spent nuclear fuel before it had a chance to cool sufficiently, the canisters  may have to be repackaged into smaller canisters that meet the  transportation regulations. In addition, an industry expert and an expert  from a community action group told us repackaging may also be required  if current storage canisters, or the spent nuclear fuel in them, has  degraded. For example, we previously reported that canisters are likely to  last about 100 years, after which the spent nuclear fuel may have to be  repackaged because of canister degradation.repackaging might be needed, reactor operators may no longer have  pools or the necessary infrastructure to undertake the repackaging.", "By the time such  According to DOE, under provisions of the standard contract, the agency  does not consider spent nuclear fuel in canisters to be an acceptable form  for waste it will receive. This may require utilities to remove the spent  nuclear fuel already packaged in dry storage canisters. Nuclear power  reactors that have closed their spent nuclear fuel pools would likely have  to transport their spent nuclear fuel to operating reactors with pools, build  a new pool, or repackage it in a yet-to-be-developed dry transfer facility.  Cutting open these canisters is likely to be an expensive process for  utilities that would require using specialized equipment to open welded  lids, placing the assemblies back into a wet pool, and then packaging the  assemblies into a new cask that DOE would provide under the terms of  the standard contract. Such a process would require personnel and  equipment, increase worker radiation exposure, increase the potential for  fuel damage, produce additional low level waste, and, may, according to  an industry expert, hinder electricity generating activities. In addition,  another industry expert also expressed concerns that re-wetting and re- drying during the repackaging process may lead to cladding degradation  issues. However, NRC officials stated that prior to NRC\u2019s granting a  storage license, each system is analyzed by the applicant and reviewed  by the NRC to ensure it can be re-flooded safely with no damage to the  spent fuel.

The National  Research Council of the National Academies reiterated this conclusion in  a 2001 report, stating that the most significant challenge to siting and  commencing operations at a repository is societal. Our analysis of  stakeholder and expert comments indicates the societal and political  factors opposing a repository are the same for a consolidated interim  storage facility.", "This lesson has been borne out in efforts to site, license, build, and  commence operations at a consolidated interim storage facility. As we  reported in 2011 and as experts and stakeholders reiterated, it may be  possible to find a willing community to host a consolidated interim storage  facility, but obtaining and sustaining state support may be more difficult  because of broader state constituencies and state-federal relations. For  example, the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, established by the  NWPA amendments in 1987, tried to broker an agreement for a  community to host a repository or interim storage facility. Two negotiators  worked with local communities and Native American tribes for several  years, but neither was able to conclude a proposed agreement with a  willing community by January 1995, when the office\u2019s authority expired. In  one siting effort, in 1992, a county in Wyoming sought to host a  consolidated interim storage facility, but the Wyoming governor stopped  that effort.

The experience of Private Fuel Storage is  another example in which a consortium of owners and generators of  spent nuclear fuel found a willing community to host a consolidated  interim storage site on the Goshute Indian reservation in Utah. The state  of Utah opposed the effort and although the Private Fuel Storage site  received a license in 2006, operations never began there because of  ongoing legal battles and land use issues. A spokesperson for the State  of Utah stated that if the owners and generators renewed their efforts to  begin operations at Private Fuel Storage, Utah would continue to fight the  effort. Furthermore, in 2014, the Western Governors Association\u2014an  association representing 19 western states\u2014passed a resolution stating  that the Governor of a state must agree in writing if an interim storage site  for spent nuclear fuel is to be considered in the state.

For example, from 2004 through 2009, the  Department of Justice settled with six owners and generators  representing 40 of the 118 reactors covered under the standard contract.  Under the settlement agreements\u2014known as the Exelon Settlement  agreements\u2014it was assumed that the Department of Energy (DOE)  would have accepted spent nuclear fuel for disposal at a rate of 900  metric tons per year from 1998 through 2014, and at a rate of 2,100  metric tons per year thereafter. Under the Exelon Settlement agreements,  DOE is liable for spent nuclear fuel storage costs that owners and  generators would not have incurred if DOE had accepted and disposed of  the fuel at this rate. Beginning in 2011, the Department of Justice began  using a new settlement agreement\u2014called the New Framework  Settlement agreement. As of September 8, 2014, the Department of  Justice reported that it has executed New Framework Settlement  Agreements with 20 litigants representing 45 reactors covered under the  standard contract. These settlement agreements do not supersede the  Exelon agreements, which remain effective for the parties that settled  through 2009. The New Framework Settlement agreements assumed a  higher rate of acceptance of spent nuclear fuel, based on an appellate  decision. Specifically, the new settlement agreements assumed that DOE  would have accepted spent nuclear fuel for disposal at a rate of 1,200  metric tons per year from 1998 through 2002; 2,000 metric tons in 2003;  2,650 metric tons per year from 2004 through 2007; and 3,000 metric  tons per year beginning in 2008. The result is that some types of spent  nuclear fuel storage costs for which owners and generators were deemed  responsible under the Exelon Settlement agreement are now a DOE  liability under the new settlement agreements.", "According to a Department of Justice document used to discuss  settlements for the owners and generators covered by the New  Framework Settlement agreements, there are five categories of  reimbursable costs:  1.  Additional Pool Storage: Costs to purchase, license, and install  new, additional, or replacement storage racks or to make available  additional storage spaces to the extent, and only to the extent,  necessary to provide additional capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pool  at the site.  2.  Dry Storage Costs: Costs to purchase canisters and casks, including  canisters that may be licensed for transport and casks for transferring  spent nuclear fuel to the dry storage facility; costs to load spent  nuclear fuel into and to transport canisters and casks to the dry  storage facility; costs of ancillary equipment for casks and cask  loading, such as crawler-type transporters, dollies, and vacuum-drying  equipment; costs to conduct initial loading demonstrations required by  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); costs for training and  development of procedures; costs for cask-loading campaign  mobilization and demobilization; costs to study and to evaluate spent  nuclear fuel storage options; costs for quality assurance inspections of  cask vendors; costs for security improvements required by NRC for  the dry storage facility; costs of maintaining and operating the dry  storage facility; costs for security improvements or upgrades required  to comply with utility\u2019s security plan approved by the NRC; and costs  to design, license and build the dry storage facility, including costs of  building the portion of the facility that will be required for the dry  storage of the utility\u2019s spent nuclear fuel in addition to utility\u2019s  allocations, provided that the utility can demonstrate that it was more  cost effective to incur the costs to design, license and build the dry  storage facility during the claim period rather than after termination of  the agreement. If the utility previously constructed a dry storage  facility for reasons other than to store the utility\u2019s allocations or needs  to place, or places, items other than canisters or casks containing the  utility\u2019s allocations in dry storage, only the costs attributable to the  portion of the dry storage facility needed to store the utility\u2019s  allocations will be allowable.  3.  Modifications of the Existing Plant: Costs paid to modify cranes to  the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to increase the rated  lifting capacity of the crane(s) used in the loading of spent nuclear fuel  from the fuel storage pool, provided that the utility can establish that  these modifications would not have been necessary to meet the  requirements of NUREG-0612 or load spent nuclear fuel in casks or  canisters provided by DOE had DOE begun performance in 1998;  building modifications that the utility can establish would not have  been necessary to load spent nuclear fuel into casks or canisters  provided by DOE (e.g., seismic restraints for fuel pool or upgrades to  floor of cask-loading area); and costs to improve the haul path from  the fuel building to the dry storage facility, to the extent that the haul  path is different from the path that the utility would have used to  deliver fuel to DOE. If the utility incurs costs for site modifications or  equipment purchases to store the utility\u2019s allocations that otherwise  benefit the operation of the plant, including crane modifications for  purposes other than loading storage canisters or casks, the cost  reimbursed will be proportional to the benefit to the operation of the  plant.  4.  Property Taxes: Costs paid as a result of any increase in assessed  property tax resulting from and traceable to projects, as identified in  the preceding three paragraphs, that were undertaken to provide  additional storage for the utility\u2019s allocations.  5.  Labor and Overhead: The cost of labor charged directly by the  utility\u2019s employees to any project that is otherwise allowable shall be  considered allowable, provided that the hours expended on such  project are charged in accordance with utility\u2019s standard time  recordation system and are identified at the individual employee level.  In addition, the following types of overhead charges will be deemed  allowable provided that the charges are calculated in accordance with  the utility\u2019s established accounting practice and policy: (a) payroll  overheads or \u201cburdens\u201d associated with labor hours charged to  allowable projects and (b) non-payroll overheads allocated to  allowable projects claimed up to a maximum of 5 percent of the  portion of the utility\u2019s claim which is otherwise allowable and to which  such non-payroll overheads are allocated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Process and Costs of Transferring Spent Nuclear Fuel from Wet to Dry Storage (Text for Interactive Figure 7)", "paragraphs": ["Appendix V: Process and Costs of  Transferring Spent Nuclear Fuel from Wet to  Dry Storage (Text for Interactive Figure 7)", "Nuclear power reactor and spent nuclear fuel pools\u2014Spent nuclear fuel typically  cools for at least 5 years in a pool before a canister ($700,000 to $1.5 million) is placed in  the pool, filled with spent nuclear fuel, removed from the pool, and dried.
