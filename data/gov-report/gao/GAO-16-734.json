HUD instructs small communities, known as nonentitlement communities, to use data based on the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) to determine whether at least 51 percent of residents in their proposed project service areas are low- and moderate-income persons and are therefore eligible for CDBG funds. However, communities may disagree with their eligibility determination based on ACS data, or they may be unable to use this method because the project's service area is larger or smaller than the census boundaries. In these cases, HUD and states allow communities to conduct their own local income surveys to demonstrate eligibility. State officials GAO interviewed said it is common for nonentitlement communities to use local income surveys as an alternative to HUD's ACS-based data, and HUD and states provide guidance on conducting these surveys. However, stakeholders cited costs and other challenges nonentitlement communities face in conducting local income surveys, including resource constraints, administrative burdens, and difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of survey responses. Other than local income surveys, alternative methods for showing eligibility for CDBG funds are limited. For example, communities may qualify by funding activities that serve populations HUD presumes to be low- and-moderate income, such as the elderly or homeless.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed cited challenges associated with measuring income and limitations associated with alternative data sources that might be used to demonstrate that communities meet the low- and moderate-income requirements. For example, stakeholders cited general challenges associated with measuring income and poverty, such as fluctuations in an individual's or community's income over a year. Some stakeholders cited alternative sources of income information that have not been used by communities that disagree with census data to determine CDBG eligibility.

There are several ways a  community can qualify for CDBG funds under the objective of principally  benefitting LMI persons:    If a project is designed to serve the entire community or a smaller  area within a community\u2014for example, a waste water project\u2014the  community or project area would need to qualify by showing that the  entire community or project area is majority LMI persons.

In contrast to  the decennial census, which was conducted once every 10 years, ACS is  an ongoing survey, and the Census Bureau updates its publicly available  data annually. In addition, ACS sample sizes (which changed in 2011)  and the geographic level at which data are available differ from those of  the decennial census long form. See table 1 for a comparison of selected  features of the decennial census long form, ACS before 2011, and ACS  after 2011.", "Differences between the two surveys have resulted in differences  between the LMI summary data values that are based on each survey,  including the following examples:", "Smaller sample size and larger error rates: ACS has a smaller  sample size than the decennial census long form, so the LMI  estimates are based on a sample of fewer households. The 2000  decennial census long form was mailed to approximately 20.9 million  housing unit addresses, all completed within several months of April  2000. The 2006\u20132010 5-year ACS estimates included 2.9 million  housing unit addresses per year, for a total of 14.5 million addresses  over the 2006\u20132010 5-year period, and surveys were mailed to  250,000 addresses each month. Because the ACS sample size is  smaller, HUD uses a 5-year ACS average for its LMI summary data,  with the current LMI summary data based on 2006\u20132010 ACS  estimates. Even using 5 years of data, the ACS sample currently used  by HUD is still smaller, reaching about 12.5 percent of all addresses,  compared with the roughly 17.1 percent of addresses that received  the long form of the 2000 decennial census.", "As a result of smaller sample sizes, ACS generally has higher  sampling errors, and its estimates are less precise (see app. II for  more details on ACS confidence intervals and their potential effects).  HUD and Census Bureau officials noted that unlike the decennial  census long form, ACS publishes margins of error with its public data  for greater transparency.", "In 2011, the Census Bureau increased ACS\u2019s overall sample sizes, as  well as the sample sizes of small areas. These improvements will be  reflected in HUD\u2019s next update of the LMI summary data, which will be  based on 2011\u20132015 data. According to Census Bureau analysis, for  a poverty estimate of 10 percent in an average-sized tract and at the  90 percent confidence level, increasing the sample size from 2.9  million to 3.54 million would result in a 9.2 percent improvement in  margins of error.", "More frequent LMI summary data updates: Another difference  between the decennial census long form and ACS is that the long- form survey was conducted every 10 years; therefore, HUD updated  its LMI summary data every 10 years as well. In contrast, the Census  Bureau updates ACS\u2019s 5-year estimates annually. Since switching to  ACS data, HUD has chosen to update its LMI summary data once  every 5 years.

Officials from two of the states we interviewed told us  that they were not aware of nonentitlement communities that were unable  to show that their project service areas met the LMI threshold using a  local income survey because the state officials only received local income  surveys from communities that successfully showed their project service  areas met the LMI threshold.

In addition,  when a service area covers multiple nonentitlement communities, a local  income survey may be necessary to supplement the LMI summary data.", "HUD does not specify when a service area would be considered too small  or too large to use the LMI summary data. In their role as administrators  of the state CDBG program, states may specify when a service area  should be considered too small or too large and, therefore, when a  nonentitlement community would be required to conduct a local income  survey. One state official we interviewed had specific guidelines on when  a service area is considered too small to use the LMI summary data.  Specifically, in this state, the LMI summary data may be used only when  at least 60 percent of the census geographic area is benefitting from the  proposed activity. Other state officials we interviewed said they did not  have specific requirements and determined whether project service areas  were too large or too small to use the LMI summary data on a case-by- case basis. Based on our review of CDBG guidance from 49 states and  Puerto Rico, 1 state does not allow nonentitlement communities to use  the LMI summary data to show they meet the LMI threshold; instead, this  state requires all communities applying for funding using the area-benefit  criteria to conduct local income surveys. Officials from this state  explained that they require surveys because project service areas in their  state rarely align with the block groups.

For example, officials from one  state told us that the larger geographic areas reported in the ACS-based  LMI summary data have made it difficult for communities to show income  data for more targeted service areas. According to Census Bureau officials,  concerns  about confidentiality and the lack of precision around the data at  these small geographic levels led  the Census Bureau to discontinue  publishing the data at the split-block group level. Census Bureau officials  noted that margins of error at these small geographic levels would be  very high, as they were with the decennial census long form. However,  they said that the high margins of error with the decennial census long  form would not have been evident to grantees because margins of error  were not published. In addition, a few state and local officials attributed  the need to conduct local income surveys to changes in the available  geographic level of the data. For example, officials from one state and  one nonentitlement community explained that the LMI summary data  being reported at the larger geographic level has resulted in two cases  where wealthier neighborhoods were included in the area. They said that  this resulted in two nonentitlement communities not being able to use the  LMI summary data to demonstrate eligibility.", "HUD does not collect data on the extent to which nonentitlement  communities have conducted local income surveys instead of using the  LMI summary data either because they disagreed with eligibility  determinations based on ACS data or because a project service area did  not align with census boundaries.

For example, one state  noted that out of 567 applications the state received during its last funding  cycle, around 200 of those applications based eligibility on local income  surveys. An official from another state said that out of 184 projects that  the state funded in 2014, 75 of the eligible projects were supported by  local income surveys. Several of the state officials we interviewed  discussed nonentitlement communities\u2019 reasons for conducting surveys.  For example, one state official said that out of 36 income surveys  conducted, 26 were conducted because the activities\u2019 service areas did  not align with census geographic areas; the remaining 10 were conducted  because the communities\u2019 did not agree with their LMI percentages based  on ACS data. Similarly, officials from another state said that most local  income surveys conducted in their state were due to project areas not  aligning with census areas. In addition, another state official said that  about half of all surveys conducted in her state were related to  geographic areas not aligning and the other half were related to  disagreement with ACS-based eligibility determinations.

Local stakeholders also told us that conducting  a local income survey can be time-consuming, with one survey generally  taking a few months to complete depending on the resources available to  the community.

Officials from five states and  four nonentitlement communities told us that in some cases, communities  can obtain free assistance from volunteers, grant preparation firms, and  regional development organizations. In addition, according to HUD  officials, states could choose to allow the cost of conducting surveys to be  considered an administrative or program delivery cost, and reimburse  communities for it, but they noted that states have limited funds for  administrative expenses. Officials from most of the states we interviewed  did not provide financial assistance to nonentitlement communities  conducting surveys; however, officials from one state told us that they  allowed application preparation as an eligible administrative expense and  that some communities in the state may have used some of these funds  for conducting surveys.", "HUD and most states provide guidance that nonentitlement communities  can use to develop and conduct their local income surveys.

The  guidance covers how to select the type of survey to use (e.g., in-person  interviews versus interviews conducted by phone), how to develop a  questionnaire, how to select a sample, and how to handle nonresponses.  In general, state officials we interviewed felt HUD\u2019s guidance was  sufficient and did not have any suggestions for additional guidance that  might be needed. In addition, almost all states have CDBG guidance that  includes discussions of conducting local income surveys.

HUD officials said that this  provision was included because these areas expressed concern to  Congress about losing LMI status with the transition to ACS. This  provision would only be applicable from fiscal years 2017 through 2020.  The number of nonentitlement communities eligible under this provision to  continue using the 2000 decennial census long form to demonstrate their  LMI eligibility is relatively small. Since 2014, 22 communities across the  country were designated as Promise Zones.

With respect to  measuring income in general, some stakeholders noted that collecting  accurate household income information can be challenging. They noted  that income may be measured at a point in time, but household members  might move from one household to another during the year. These  stakeholders also noted that income information may also be inaccurately  reported because survey respondents may have difficulty recalling their  income over the past year, particularly if they had fluctuations in income  levels. One stakeholder also said that a community\u2019s income level may be  difficult to determine if the community has many seasonal workers.

A few stakeholders noted that a more complete  assessment of a household\u2019s income level would include its expenses  and benefits, and that the Supplemental Poverty Measure produced by  the Census Bureau considers these aspects of a household\u2019s financial  circumstances. However, according to the Census Bureau, this measure  was designed as an experimental poverty measure and is not used to  determine eligibility for government programs.", "Stakeholders we interviewed cited several types of alternative sources of  income information that have not been used by communities that  disagree with census data to determine CDBG eligibility:", "Other large-scale Census Bureau surveys that include  information on income.

For example, the Census Bureau\u2019s Small Area  Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) supplements ACS income  data with administrative data such as federal income tax return data.  Sources such as the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s  Social Vulnerability Index and Medically Underserved Areas  designations can use survey information, administrative data, or a  combination of survey and administrative data to compile indices that  may provide an indication of a community\u2019s income level.", "However, while these potential sources could provide information on  income at the individual or community level, stakeholders also noted that  they would likely have one or more of the following limitations:", "Does not fully allow communities to determine if they are LMI.", "Some sources of income data may not fully measure a community\u2019s  income level and therefore may not be a more accurate measure of  whether a community should be considered LMI than the LMI  summary data. For example, the Internal Revenue Service publishes  some information from federal tax returns, but while this is a direct  measure of income levels, it may exclude those low-income  households that do not file taxes. In addition, data on participation in  income-based programs such as the National School Lunch Program,  Medicaid, and SNAP may provide indications of a community\u2019s  income level, but they also have limitations. For example, not  everyone who is eligible for the programs participates in them.  Therefore, participation rates may undercount the extent to which a  community's population is low income.", "Proxies for income, such as measures of medically underserved areas,  the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Social Vulnerability Index,  and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Access Research Atlas,  also have limitations. Specifically, the extent to which these indices  correlate with income and the level of income with which they correlate is  unclear. Finally, some sources of income information may use a different  measure of income, which may not correspond to HUD\u2019s LMI measure.  For example, SAIPE estimates median household income, which would  not allow communities to determine the percentage of their population  that meets HUD\u2019s LMI threshold.", "Is not easily accessible by communities. To be used broadly, an  alternative data source may need to be easily accessible by  nonentitlement communities. Some data, such as tax data, may have  some public availability but would likely require states or other  agencies to either provide data to nonentitlement communities that  are not typically made available, or calculate LMI percentages for the  communities. However, sharing this information may raise  confidentiality concerns. It may also raise concerns about whether  communities would be able to access the information from states or  other agencies that may feel burdened by having to provide the data  or LMI calculations based on the data.", "Is not available at small geographic levels. Because  nonentitlement communities are small communities, an alternative  data source would need to be available at a sufficiently small  geographic level. Specifically, the current LMI summary data are  available for census block groups and places. However, many other  sources of income data or related proxies do not have data available  at these levels. For example, Census Bureau officials said this would  be the case for Census surveys other than ACS. They noted that  SAIPE income data, for example, are available at the county level,  which would likely be too large for many nonentitlement CDBG  projects. Other data sources, including SNAP participation rates and  Bureau of Economic Analysis per capita income data, are also only  available at the county level.", "Census Bureau officials noted that it may be possible to use survey and  administrative data to create estimates of income levels for small areas  using statistical models. They noted that SAIPE is based on such models,  which can estimate income levels for a specific geographic level based on  other characteristics, even if there is no specific income data point for that  area. However, they said that such models do not currently exist for  geographic areas small enough to be used by nonentitlement  communities in the CDBG program.", "Is not more precise than ACS. To address the concern that ACS  data do not provide sufficiently precise estimates of LMI for many  nonentitlement communities, an alternative data source would need to  be considered reliable for small geographic areas. However, Census  Bureau officials said that ACS is the nation\u2019s largest household survey  that includes income information, and other Census Bureau surveys  that include income information (e.g., Survey of Income and Program  Participation, Current Population Survey) have smaller sample sizes  than ACS, which would be associated with less certainty about the  reliability of the data. Administrative data, such as those on program  participation, would not have limitations related to sample size that  would affect their preciseness, but they would face at least one of the  other previously noted challenges, such as not allowing the  community to fully determine if it is LMI.", "HUD officials said that in circumstances where a nonentitlement  community disagreed with what ACS showed for their LMI percentage,  HUD would consider allowing states to use an alternative data source  beyond an income survey. However, they noted that such a provision  would need to be fairly and consistently applied within the state. HUD  officials said that they have not received inquiries from states about using  alternative data sources to demonstrate LMI status. As a result, HUD has  not developed formal guidance on accepting alternative data sources and  is still determining how any such requests should be evaluated. In  addition, in July 2015, the Census Bureau announced a plan to evaluate  the availability and sustainability of using external data sources, such as  Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service data, to  supplement income information collected by ACS, which they said could  improve the data.
