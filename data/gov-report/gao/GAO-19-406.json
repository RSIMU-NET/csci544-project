We assessed DOD contract financing policies to determine the rationale  behind these changes. We also interviewed officials from the Defense  Contract Management Agency (DCMA), Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). We  analyzed progress and performance-based payment data provided by  DCMA from DOD\u2019s Mechanization of Contract Administration Services  (MOCAS), the system of record for processing contract financing  payments for DCMA administered contracts. We used these data to  determine how much DOD made in contract financing payments between  fiscal years 2010 and 2018, the types of contractors that received these  payments, and how the mix of performance-based and progress  payments changed as policies changed. We adjusted the numbers for  inflation, using the fiscal year 2018 Gross Domestic Product Price Index.

We also  interviewed representatives within the Office of Defense Pricing and  Contracting (DPC) about the department\u2019s approach to assessing the  effect of contract financing policy on contractor profitability and  operations.

Contract financing assists the defense contractor in managing expenses,  such as material, labor, and overhead. In such cases, DOD can agree to  help finance these expenses as the work progresses through various  types of contract financing payments, including progress payments and  performance-based payments.", "Progress payments based on cost are determined as a percentage  of the costs incurred by the contractor as work progresses. Currently,  DOD pays 80 percent of incurred costs of large business concerns  and 90 percent of incurred costs of small business concerns. To  receive progress payments on the basis of cost, contractors are  required to have an accounting system and controls that are adequate  for proper administration of progress payments. The cognizant  contract administration office is to maintain surveillance of the  contractor\u2019s accounting system as appropriate, and the Defense  Contract Audit Agency is to audit the accounting system. DOD  provides contract financing on fixed-price type contracts for non- commercial items.", "Performance-based payments enable the contractor to be paid for  achieving certain contractual milestones, such as delivery of a major  subcontracted component. DOD can pay up to 90 percent of either  the contract\u2019s price or the price of a deliverable item using  performance-based payments. DOD\u2019s performance-based payments  guide states that these payments should not be structured such that  they amount to advance payments, which in general terms are  payments made before work is complete on a contract regardless of  what performance milestones are met. Unlike progress payments,  however, performance-based payments do not require that the  contractor have an adequate accounting system.", "Lastly, contract financing can also be used when the terms and conditions  of a contract are not yet \u201cdefinitized,\u201d a term that generally means  finalized. These actions, which are termed undefinitized contract actions  (UCAs) at DOD, are to be used only when the negotiation of a definitive  contract action is not possible in sufficient time to meet DOD\u2019s  requirements and the department\u2019s interest demands that the contractor  be given a binding commitment so that contract performance can begin  immediately. The government may incur unnecessary costs if  requirements change before the contract is definitized. Defense  acquisition regulations generally require UCAs to be definitized within 180  days of the UCA date or before more than 50 percent of the estimated  contract price is obligated, whichever occurs first. During this period,  progress payments are limited to 80 percent of work accomplished.  DOD\u2019s 2014 performance-based payments guide recommends that a  UCA be awarded using progress payments first; performance-based  payments should then be considered during the definitization process.", "Table 1 summarizes the conditions and rates applicable to progress  payments based on costs and performance-based payments.", "Several offices and agencies within DOD have a role in managing  contract financing.", "The office of DPC, within DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, is responsible for all pricing,  contracting, and procurement policy matters.

On negotiated contracts, DOD requires contracting officers to use  weighted guidelines, a structured approach used to develop profit  objectives for individual defense contracts. DOD implements its profit  policy through the weighted guidelines. As part of their efforts to  determine the government\u2019s negotiating position, including how much  profit the contractor should receive under the contract, contracting officers  are to consider various factors, including the degree to which the  government is providing contract financing. Assuming other factors are  held constant, the weighted guidelines suggest that the negotiated profit  rate of a fixed-price defense contract might be 1 to 2 percentage points  lower when the government provides contract financing. The contracting  officer may vary the amount to consider other risk elements when  establishing the government\u2019s negotiating position.", "DOD-provided contract financing can also provide contractors higher  rates of return on the amount of corporate funds contractors invest on that  same contract. One measure of this benefit is \u201cinternal rate of return\u201d  (IRR), a tool that can be used to assess the impact of contract financing  on overall contractor profitability. DOD\u2019s 2001 Incentives Guidebook  notes that IRR is one of the basic tools used by industry to determine  where to invest its funds and assess the risks and potential rewards  involved in contracting with the government or commercial entities. IRR  is a measure that integrates both the contractor\u2019s investment to produce  the product and the profit earned on that product. In contrast to contracts  in which the contractors must either self-finance or borrow from  commercial lenders, when contractors receive financing on a contract  from the government the contractor\u2019s IRR can be significantly higher.  Figure 1 provides a hypothetical example of how changes in the progress  payment rate on a 40-month, fixed-priced contract affects the expected  contract profit rate and the contractor\u2019s IRR.", "As illustrated above, providing contract financing (in this case, progress  payments) has a significant impact on the contractor\u2019s IRR and a lesser  impact on the actual profit that DOD expects the contractor to make. For  example, if DOD provided no contract financing, the weighted guidelines  would suggest a profit rate on this hypothetical contract of 13.8 percent,  which would provide an internal rate of return to the contractor of 7.5  percent. If DOD provided progress payments at the customary rate of 80  percent, the weighted guidelines would suggest a profit rate on this  hypothetical contract of 10.4 percent, or 3.4 percentage points lower than  if no financing was provided. However, even though the contractor\u2019s  expected profit is lower, the IRR for the contract would increase to 30.9  percent, or a little more than four times what would be realized if the  contractor had to finance the effort on its own."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Studies of Contract Financing and Contract Profitability", "paragraphs": ["Several studies conducted by DOD, nonprofit organizations and GAO  have assessed the impact of contract financing on contract profit or  contractor profitability.

Under this approach, DOD specified the minimum percentage the  contractor was required to invest and DOD would provide the  remainder. The amount of contractor investment required by DOD  varied from 5 to 25 percent, depending upon the year.

In 1995, the FAR Council amended the FAR  to enable the use of performance-based payments up to a maximum  amount of 90 percent of the contract\u2019s price. In 2000, DOD issued a rule  amending the DFARS to emphasize that performance-based payments  were the preferred method of financing. The rule required contracting  officers to consider and deem performance-based payments  impracticable before deciding to provide progress payments. This rule  was part of a larger effort by DOD to make contract financing procedures  easier to understand and to simplify related provisions. DOD  subsequently issued a user\u2019s guide in 2001 to help its contracting  personnel and contractors in using performance-based payments.", "Despite the provisions to encourage the use of performance-based  payments when appropriate, DOD subsequently initiated department- specific actions that, according to industry officials, decreased the  frequency with which they received performance-based payments on  defense contracts. For example, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics\u2019 September 2010 Better Buying  Power memorandum instructed contracting officers to use progress  payments as the basis for price negotiations. After the contractor and  DOD contracting officer agreed on price using progress payments,  contractors could propose using an alternate financing arrangement,  including performance-based payments. The memorandum indicated  that the rationale for this change was to provide increased incentives for  contractor performance. In April 2011, the Director of Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy (now known as DPC) issued a  memorandum that focused on the \u201cpracticality\u201d of performance-based  payments, stating they \u201care not practical for use on all fixed-price  contracts and require considerable effort between the contractor and  Government.\u201d The memorandum noted that if contractors wanted to use  performance-based payments, then the contractor should submit a  proposed schedule to include all performance-based payment events,  completion criteria, and event values, along with the contractor\u2019s  expected expenditure profile.", "To implement its April 2011 performance-based payment policy, DOD  issued a proposed rule to amend the DFARS in January 2012.

Between fiscal years 2010  and 2018, DCMA data indicates that DOD provided between $36 billion  and $49 billion a year in contract financing on contracts DCMA  administered. We found that nearly 98 percent of those contract financing  payments were paid to medium and large defense contractors. We also  found that the amount DOD paid out in performance-based payments on  those contracts fell between 2010 and 2016 before increasing in 2017. In  December 2016, Congress enacted Section 831 of the Fiscal Year 2017  NDAA to establish performance-based payments as the preferred type of  contract financing for DOD in statute.

The proposed rule would have set a base  progress payment rate for large businesses (specifically, for other than  small businesses) at 50 percent and small businesses at 90 percent. At  the same time, however, the proposed rule provided opportunities to  increase the rate if the contractor achieved certain enterprise-wide  priorities such as meeting contract delivery dates. The proposed rule also  eliminated some of the administrative requirements associated with  performance-based payments to encourage their use.

For example, these  officials noted that the proposed rule would change the intent of contract  financing from a means of assisting contractors to help meet short-term  expenses to a mechanism for ensuring compliance with contract terms  and conditions on an enterprise-wide basis. Industry officials said they  believe compliance with contract terms and conditions should be  addressed on a contract-by-contract basis. Further, industry officials  stated that the changes suggested in the proposed rule could negatively  impact the health, competitiveness, and resiliency of the defense  industrial base and introduce significant uncertainty as to how much  contract financing DOD would provide. Additionally, industry officials  noted that the rule did not contain specific implementation details in such  areas as whether the incentives would be applied on an enterprise-wide  basis and how to ensure the data were reliable. DOD withdrew this rule in  October 2018, citing the need to conduct additional outreach with industry  regarding contract financing methods.", "Subsequently, DPC held three public meetings in January and February  2019 to obtain public comments on revising policies and procedures for  contract financing, performance incentives, and associated regulations  prior to proposing a new rule.

According to industry officials, the industrial base has moved  away from heavy industrial manufacturing toward technology and more  sophisticated industry partners, including contractors who do not typically  work with DOD. These officials noted that these contractors may not be  eligible for contract financing because they may not have an approved  cost accounting system needed to receive progress payments. In that  regard, in July 2017, we reported that one company conducted a study  that determined it would take at least 15 to18 months and millions to  establish a government-unique cost accounting system.
