Although the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act of 1974 (Settlement Act) intended for ONHIR to complete its activities 5 years after its relocation plan went into effect, the agency has continued to carry out its responsibilities for over three decades beyond the original deadline and the potential remains for relocation activities to continue into the future. For example, GAO found that by the end of fiscal year 2018", "at least 240 households whose relocation applications were previously denied could still file for appeals in federal court and if the court rules in their favor these households could become eligible for relocation benefits under the Settlement Act, and", "ONHIR is still responsible for helping homeowners who might request repairs for 52 relocation homes that remain under warranty.", "ONHIR believes that it has substantially completed its responsibilities under the Settlement Act and has stated its intent to close by September 2018. However, ONHIR does not have the authority to close its operations and has not yet taken the steps necessary to facilitate such a closure. GAO identified a number of areas where either executive branch or congressional actions would be needed to affect a closure of ONHIR, as shown in these examples:", "The Settlement Act states that ONHIR will cease to exist when the President determines that its functions have been fully discharged. ONHIR, however, has not requested a determination nor provided specific information to the President that could facilitate such a decision.", "ONHIR has prepared a transition plan and identified potential successor agencies that could assume its remaining activities. However, officials at these agencies said they currently do not have authority under the Settlement Act to undertake ONHIR's activities. Without congressional authorization these agencies would not be able to succeed ONHIR.", "ONHIR has prepared an implementation plan to guide its closure but has not yet taken necessary steps to ensure that all the key information about its activities has been compiled. For example, ONHIR's database for tracking warranty requests is missing information, such as the date of warranty repairs and other contractor information. Similarly, ONHIR has not prepared complete information from its files on the remaining denied households who could file for federal appeals. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify and respond to risks and use quality information. By not preparing complete information on the relocation activities it has been engaged in, ONHIR places an effective transition of its functions to another agency at risk. This is because any successor agency authorized to continue these activities will not have the complete information needed to effectively fulfill these functions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four matters for congressional consideration; including that Congress provide successor agencies necessary authority to continue ONHIR's remaining activities if it closes. GAO is also making five recommendations to ONHIR, including that it request a closure determination from the President and prepare necessary information to facilitate the transfer of its activities to a successor.

The 1882 Executive  Order, signed by President Chester Arthur, set aside approximately 2.5  million acres of land for the Hopi and \u201csuch other Indians as the Secretary  of the Interior may see fit to settle thereon.\u201d Since that time, the Navajo  and Hopi tribes have disputed the rights and occupancy of the lands. In a  1962 court case, Healing v Jones, the Hopi tribe claimed exclusive rights  to the entire reservation, and the Navajo claimed exclusive rights to about  80 percent of the reservation. In 1963, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed  an Arizona District Court decision that set aside about 631,000 acres of  the land\u2014known as District Six\u2014as exclusively Hopi and designated the  remaining about 1.9 million acres as a joint use area, to be managed and  used jointly by the two tribes. The two tribes legally co-owned the joint  use area, but the use of the land remained a source of disputes between  the two tribes. The Settlement Act authorized the partitioning of the  surface of the joint use area and directed that it generally be split evenly  between the tribes. It required Navajo households residing on lands  partitioned to the Hopi Tribe (Hopi Partitioned Lands) to relocate and,  similarly, Hopi households residing on lands partitioned to the Navajo  Nation (Navajo Partitioned Lands) to relocate.

The Settlement Act mandated that ONHIR submit a  report, including a detailed plan, to Congress concerning the  relocation of households and members of each tribe from lands  partitioned to the other tribe. ONHIR stated that it has no authority to  require any person to leave the land that was awarded to the other  tribe. The act instructed that the relocation process be completed 5  years after the relocation plan took effect. The report and plan, which  ONHIR transmitted to Congress in April 1981, provided details on  relocation of households and their members, including generating  names of those residing on the partitioned lands and identifying sites  for relocation, among other things. The relocation was scheduled to  be completed by July 1986. Specifically, the relocation benefits  include $130,000, adjusted to current construction and housing  development costs, for a household of three or fewer and $136,000  for a household of four or more to obtain a decent, safe, and sanitary  replacement home, in addition to moving expenses and, within the  first few years, bonus payments provided within the first years  following the relocation plan. Because there were far fewer Hopi  households residing on lands partitioned to the Navajo Nation, almost  all of the households relocated (about 99 percent) have been for  Navajo families.", "Resettlement land taken into trust for the Navajo Nation. The  Settlement Act as amended authorizes and directs the Secretary of  the Interior to take certain lands into trust for the Navajo Nation, which  would become part of the Navajo Reservation. The 1980 amendments  to the Settlement Act required the border of any parcel taken into trust  to be within 18 miles of the Navajo reservation\u2019s then boundary. Most  of the lands taken into trust in Arizona pursuant to the Settlement Act  as amended are known as the New Lands. Navajos living on Hopi  Partitioned Lands could choose to relocate to the New Lands, as well  as other areas on the Navajo reservation or off-reservation.", "Administration and use of acquired trust land. Pursuant to the  Settlement Act as amended, ONHIR administers these lands taken  into trust for the Navajo Nation until relocation is complete. In contrast,  Interior administers other land the federal government holds in trust  for Indian tribes, including the Navajo Nation. In addition, the  Settlement Act as amended requires the lands taken into trust for the  Navajo Nation to be used solely for the benefit of Navajo families\u2014 known as relocatees\u2014that at the time of the Settlement Act\u2019s  enactment had been residing on lands partitioned to the Hopi.", "Leasing of acquired trust land. The Navajo and Hopi Indian  Relocation Amendments of 1988 transferred responsibility for issuing  leases and rights-of-way for housing and related facilities on the New  Lands from Interior to ONHIR. In July 1990, ONHIR issued  procedures for the leasing of New Lands, including homesite and  business leases, in section 1810 of its management manual.  ONHIR\u2019s regulations specify that the agency\u2019s operation is to be  governed by a management manual.", "Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund. The 1988 amendments to the  Settlement Act established the Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund in the  U.S. Treasury. The Trust Fund consists of appropriations made for the  fund, deposits of income from certain trust assets, and any interest or  investment income accrued. The Trust Fund is essentially a loan from  the federal government to the Navajo Nation to be repaid from  revenues derived from leases of the lands and minerals taken into  trust in New Mexico pursuant to the Settlement Act as amended. The  tribe assumed responsibility for managing the Trust Fund pursuant to  the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994,  according to Interior officials. Under this act, neither Interior, ONHIR,  nor Treasury has a role in managing or overseeing the Trust Fund  once a tribe has assumed responsibility for managing it.", "Aside from administering the relocation activities and the lands taken into  trust pursuant to the Settlement Act as amended, ONHIR also operates  the Padres Mesa Demonstration Ranch. The ranch was established in  fiscal year 2009 on the New Lands and teaches sustainable cattle  ranching and modern livestock marketing to the Navajo. According to  ONHIR officials, the ranch is on approximately 60,000 acres of trust land  acquired pursuant to the Settlement Act as amended. The purpose of the  ranch is to teach relocatees methods to maximize income from cattle- raising operations and be good stewards of the land. In addition to  purchasing cattle, ONHIR hired an employee to manage the ranch\u2019s  operations and contract cowboys to work on the ranch. ONHIR sells the  cattle raised on the ranch and uses the proceeds to help pay for ranch  operations. According to ONHIR documents, from fiscal years 2009  through 2016, ONHIR obligated approximately $1.8 million for the ranch\u2019s  operation from a mixture of appropriations and cattle sale revenue. Over  the same period, cattle sales generated over $1.4 million, according to  ONHIR documents.", "The Settlement Act established a three-member commission, the Navajo  and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, to administer the relocation  program. The 1988 amendment abolished the three-member Relocation  Commission and established in its place ONHIR as an independent entity  of the executive branch under the authority of a single Commissioner.  ONHIR has not had a Commissioner since 1994 and has been under the leadership of its Executive Director. As of December 2017, ONHIR said  that they had 31 employees among its three offices in Flagstaff, Sanders,  and Chambers, Arizona.", "ONHIR was not designed to be a permanent agency, but a specific  closing date has not been determined. ONHIR previously developed  plans to close out its activities in 2008, according to ONHIR officials, but  has continued to operate. The Settlement Act states that ONHIR will  cease to exist when the President of the United States determines that its  functions have been fully discharged. During a testimony at a  congressional hearing in February 2016, ONHIR\u2019s Executive Director said  that ONHIR was working toward completing its work so the office can  close by the end of fiscal year 2018. ONHIR has developed a draft  transition plan, dated March 2017, that identifies, among other things, four  areas of activity that would need to be transferred to another entity in the  event of its closure in September 2018: (1) appeals and eligibility; (2)  housing; (3) administration of the New Lands; and (4) the Padres Mesa  Demonstration Ranch. In the draft transition plan, ONHIR primarily  identified offices within Interior\u2014including BIA, the Office of Hearings and  Appeals, and the Office of the Solicitor\u2014to take over several key  activities, as well as other entities including the Department of Justice and  the Navajo Nation government.

For example, a 2017 Urban Institute report  prepared for HUD found that 5.6 percent of American Indian households  had problems with plumbing, 6.6 percent had problems with the kitchen,  and 12 percent had problems with heating. In comparison, 1.3 percent of  households in the United States had problems with plumbing, 1.7 percent  had problems with the kitchen, and 0.1 percent had problems with  heating.", "As we have previously found, common housing challenges in Indian  communities are largely related to remoteness and other geographical  factors, lack of adequate infrastructure, land use regulation, and other  factors. Some remote areas where Indian tribes are located can present  unique logistical challenges, including a lack of buildable land and limited  supply of building materials. In some regions, tribes face challenges  related to a lack of adequate infrastructure, such as roads, water, and  sewer systems. According to Navajo Nation officials, traditionally, tribes  lived a lifestyle that was connected to their traditional and ancestral lands,  with homes and other structures built from natural materials and  constructed in communities with extended families. For example, many of  the Navajo who were on the Hopi Partitioned Lands were self-sufficient  and lived in traditional homes called hogans, which are made of wooden  poles, tree bark, and mud.

All applicants must apply through ONHIR for  relocation benefits and demonstrate that they meet eligibility criteria,  discussed later in this report. Based on eligibility criteria, in general, a  certifying officer determines whether an applicant is certified or denied. If  an applicant is certified, the applicant becomes an ONHIR client for  relocation. If an applicant is denied, the applicant is eligible to file for  appeals\u2014first, an administrative appeal, then an appeal with the U.S.  District Court for the District of Arizona, if the administrative appeal  upholds the denial decision.

After the original deadline,  ONHIR provided a second application period from April 1997 through  March 2000 after the enactment of a new law, which ratified a formal  agreement under which the Hopi tribe agreed to allow traditional Navajo  residents to remain living on Hopi Partitioned Lands for 75 years. In  conjunction, the formal agreement provided that ONHIR relocate all  eligible Navajo residents on Hopi Partitioned Lands who (1) did not sign  an individual agreement to remain on the land, or (2) signed but then  surrendered their signed individual agreement before the February 2000  deadline.", "ONHIR accepted applications again from May 2005 through June 2006  (third application period) based on language in a 2005 Senate bill to  provide a last chance for Navajos living on Hopi Partitioned Lands to  relocate, which passed the Senate but was not enacted, according to  ONHIR officials.

Demonstrating head of household or residency status  has been difficult for residents for several reasons, according to a Navajo-Hopi Legal Services Program representative and Navajo Nation chapter  officials we interviewed. For example, Navajo is an oral culture that  historically existed mostly on a livestock or cash economy in which  transactions were not documented, making it difficult to document the  source of income or head of household status. In its comments on a draft  of this report, ONHIR stated that the legal residence determination was  complicated because many Navajos performed seasonal work and lived  outside the Hopi Partitioned Lands for extended periods. According to  Navajo Nation officials, oral evidence has not been allowed by the ONHIR  Hearings Officer, and language and cultural barriers have also been  obstacles. Some Navajos have limited English proficiency, although  ONHIR offers translators for Navajo speakers. In its comments on a draft  of this report, ONHIR stated that oral evidence has always been allowed  but has sometimes been found not to be credible. Another unique  characteristic of the Navajo is the use of shared mailboxes at trading  posts\u2014a place in the community for people to meet and receive their  mail\u2014making it difficult to ensure that ONHIR denial letters or other  notifications reach individual applicants.

Families lived a spiritual  and religious lifestyle that was connected to their traditional culture and  ancestral lands, with homes constructed in communities with extended  families.", "ONHIR\u2019s management manual also includes policies that require  employees to work with clients on the home acquisition process starting  from the time clients are certified and continue until 2 years after the client  has been relocated, including assisting clients with finding contractors,  signing home-building contracts, understanding home maintenance, and  requesting warranty repairs. ONHIR works with families after they have  moved into their relocation home by providing assistance with warranty  issues; assistance in adjusting to their new community; and referrals to  agencies in the new community that provide health care, supplemental  nutrition, financial assistance, behavioral health, employment, and other  social services. Relocation homes are the property of the client, and  ONHIR has no responsibility for relocation homes after a 2-year warranty  period on each home expires. ONHIR wrote a standard template of a  contract that clients and contractors must sign, but ONHIR is not a  signatory of the home-building contract. However, ONHIR is a signatory  to the 2-year home warranty contract, along with the client and the  contractor. Additional policies and procedures required by ONHIR\u2019s  management manual are summarized in table 2.", "ONHIR\u2019s management manual also includes policies for overseeing  contractor performance. ONHIR officials provide clients with a list of home-building contractors, but clients may choose any licensed  contractor in the jurisdiction where the home is built. ONHIR officials  estimate that more than 95 percent of relocation homes have been built  by contractors from its list. ONHIR officials said that contractors on the list  ONHIR provides to clients must demonstrate good standing and must be  licensed by the state of Arizona, as stated in its policy. In addition,  ONHIR\u2019s policy states that ONHIR may take action against contractors  whose work results in an excessive number of warranty complaints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Building Is Complete, but Weaknesses in Oversight Allowed Poor Performing Contractors to Build Homes", "paragraphs": ["The majority of ONHIR\u2019s home-building work is now complete.

For example, ONHIR provided us with  a report generated from its contractor performance database that shows a  contractor who had failed 42 percent of final inspections during a 11-year  period\u2014from January 2006 through September 2017\u2014continued to  receive home-building contracts. Similarly, we identified homes with  multiple warranty complaints in ONHIR\u2019s warranty database. Specifically,  one home in the warranty file database had 17 warranty defect  complaints attributed to the contractor. ONHIR officials said that they do  not track complaints by contractor in a database nor do they have a defined number of complaints for removing contractors. ONHIR officials  said that they have not removed a contractor involuntarily from their list  since the 1990s.", "ONHIR officials explained that these contractors continued building  homes because it is difficult to find contractors who want to work on the  reservation due to the isolated nature of homesites. Moreover, in recent  years they said they did not track complaints by contractor because they  would be aware of complaints about a contractor due to the smaller  number of relocation homes that have been built. As a result, according to  ONHIR officials, they have not needed to take actions to remove  contractors from their list since the 1990s or to generate reports on  contractor performance. In addition, ONHIR officials said some warranty  complaints were trivial, such as peeling paint or visible carpet seams, and  thus terminating contractors for such issues was unnecessary. ONHIR  officials also noted that all homes eventually passed their final inspections  and any failed inspection items were corrected and reinspected before  contractors received payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Tribal Government Officials and Relocatees Said ONHIR Has Not Discharged Its Responsibilities because of Construction, Societal, and Infrastructure Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Although ONHIR said it has nearly completed its relocation obligations,  some relocatees, the Hopi tribe, and Navajo Nation government officials  said that it has not completed its work. Specifically, Navajo Nation  officials and some relocatees said the office should remain open to  address various concerns with relocation homes and the societal effects  of relocation. Moreover, according to some relocatees and Navajo Nation  government officials, these concerns include homes that were built with  faulty materials and with unfinished infrastructure, such as electricity. As  previously mentioned, ONHIR has no responsibility over relocation homes  after the 2-year warranty period on each home expires. However, an  official from the Navajo-Hopi Legal Services Program said that  homeowners had concerns with their homes beyond the 2-year warranty  period. While ONHIR has attributed such issues to a lack of homeowner  maintenance, relocatees have attributed these issues to ONHIR\u2019s lack of  oversight of the home-building process. Concerns some relocatees and  tribal government officials described include the following:  Construction. Navajo Nation officials from three separate chapters told  us that relocation homes were not built properly. The President of the  Navajo Nation said that homes frequently have construction issues  related to cheap materials or poor workmanship, while another official  said that ONHIR does not properly oversee contractors. Another official  told us that the windows fall out of homes when it gets too windy. One  official said that some families have left their relocation homes behind  because of structural issues. Hopi tribe officials said relocatees from their  tribe were provided the cheapest homes available and that the conditions  of mobile homes are substandard. See figure 7 for examples of homes  with cracked foundations and broken windows.", "ONHIR officials said they inspect all complaints on relocation homes,  even after the warranty period has expired. If the investigation reveals an  issue that is a result of a construction defect, ONHIR officials said they  will fix the issue, whereas they will not fix issues they deem are the result  of poor homeowner maintenance.", "Soil settling. Navajo Nation officials from two chapters told us that  ONHIR did not conduct soil tests on homesites and others said that some  homes have experienced foundation issues. For example, one relocatee  said her relocation home has cracks in the walls and the floors. ONHIR  helps clients to apply for homesite leases, and according to ONHIR  officials, they assigned engineering technicians to conduct feasibility  studies to assess the condition of the soil for all on-reservation homesites,  as required by ONHIR policy. However, ONHIR officials also  acknowledged that expansion and contraction of soil over time in Arizona  is common and that shifting soil can lead to cracks in the foundation or  walls of homes. As reported by the Interior Inspector General in 2016, 5  relocatee homes on the Navajo reservation experienced cracks and other  visible signs of damage due to soil settling and have consequently been  replaced by ONHIR. ONHIR officials acknowledged that they have  demolished and replaced an additional 9 homes due to foundation issues  related to soil expansion and other issues, such as leaks in utility lines  and septic tanks. For the homes experiencing foundation issues outside  of the 14 homes ONHIR has replaced, ONHIR attributed continued soil  collapse to homeowners not maintaining the proper degree of slope  around their home to allow for drainage. In addition, they said that homes  may now be occupied by three generations of families. According to a  2016 Interior Inspector General report, ONHIR officials said this leads to  increased water use inside the homes which, in their opinion, exacerbates  the soil-settling issue.", "Societal effects. Relocated families expressed that relocation has  contributed to societal ills such as depression; alcoholism; drug abuse;  and suicide due to substandard living conditions and homesites away  from their family and previous sources of livelihood. The Navajo Nation  stated that relocatees experienced hardships adjusting to a new way of  life and felt a loss of connection with their culture moving away from their  ancestral lands and traditional way of life. According to a report issued by  the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission, relocatees were promised  by the federal government, the Hopi Tribe, and the Navajo Nation that  relocation would offer a better life that did not materialize. ONHIR  officials noted that both the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe have  requested extended counseling beyond the warranty period; however,  according to the March 2017 transition plan, ONHIR does not believe  providing it is within their statutory authority.", "Connections to utility infrastructure. According to Navajo Nation  officials, some homes are not properly connected to utility infrastructure,  such as electricity and water. For example, they stated that a number of  relocation homes in the Navajo area do not have electricity. In its  comments on a draft of this report, ONHIR stated that some relocatees  chose to relocate to remote areas and signed a form to affirm that they  wanted solar or cistern rather than grid utilities. A representative from the  Hopi Tribe told us that in one home, contractors installed plumbing  systems that were subsequently covered in concrete, which made repairs  difficult. Another chapter official said that a septic tank in one relocation  home continually overflowed because the tank was smaller than the  specifications. ONHIR officials said all homes are built to code at the time  of construction and have proper connections to infrastructure in terms of  water and electricity. They said they verify that homes pass necessary  inspections, including framing; mechanical; plumbing; and insulation, prior  to disbursing payments to the contractors.", "Community infrastructure. Some Navajo Nation chapter members and  ONHIR officials disagree as to whether ONHIR had an obligation to  provide additional community infrastructure under the Settlement Act.  Some chapter members said that ONHIR should not close because it has  not met its responsibilities to provide infrastructure projects, such as  paved roads and running water. The Navajo Nation Human Rights  Commission report states that relocatees were told they would be  provided with running water and the ability to raise livestock, among other  things. Provisions in the Settlement Act directed ONHIR to create a  report with a plan to ensure that infrastructure such as water, sewers, and  roads would be available at their relocation sites. ONHIR published a  report to meet the provision in 1981. This provision was repealed in  November 1988. ONHIR officials acknowledged that relocatees have  expressed the need for additional infrastructure, but said it is not within  ONHIR\u2019s statutory responsibility to provide it.

During this 2-year  period, ONHIR is responsible for helping homeowners, who are located  on-reservation, request warranty repairs. After September 2018, 52  relocation homes will remain under the 2-year warranty period, according  to ONHIR officials. In addition, as previously discussed, ONHIR officials  told us that at least 240 denied applicants could still file for appeals in the  federal court and become eligible for relocation benefits, which would  necessitate the construction of additional homes.

As previously discussed,  ONHIR\u2019s remaining home-building responsibilities include managing the  52 remaining 2-year warranty agreements and assisting in the  construction of homes for any newly certified applicants. To fulfill these  responsibilities, complete information on home warranties and contractor  performance is critical. ONHIR\u2019s warranty database has data fields to  track relevant information on concerns reported to ONHIR\u2014including  warranty expiration date, date warranty complaint received, type of  complaint (possible warranty defect or homeowner maintenance issue).  However, the database is incomplete. For example, our review found that  about 98 percent of warranty complaints in the warranty database have  no record of the date of warranty repairs. Moreover, ONHIR does not list  the names of contractors in its database. ONHIR officials said the  information is not recorded because they rely on memory and paper files  to supplement the information in the warranty database about contractors.  ONHIR officials also said they do not regularly use the database to  monitor contractors\u2019 performance because it became too cumbersome to  track electronically. However, in its comments on a draft of this report,  ONHIR stated that it has the capability in its electronic data system to  search for warranty complaints.", "In its October 2017 implementation plan, ONHIR suggested BIA\u2019s  contract office as a potential successor agency for administering the  remaining warranty provisions in the event that it closes before these  home-building responsibilities are fully discharged. With regard to any  newly certified applicants deemed eligible for benefits through the  appeals process, the October 2017 implementation plan suggests that  these applicants be given the cash equivalent of a relocation home  instead of building new homes. However, the Settlement Act provides for  no authority to issue cash payments and Congress has not otherwise  authorized cash payments, and any future home-building activities may  need to be assumed by a successor agency. Because OHNIR does not  have complete information on existing warranties and contractor  performance, another successor agency could be hampered in its ability  to assume ONHIR\u2019s remaining home-building responsibilities. Federal  internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze,  and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives.  Additionally, the standards state that management should use quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.

Should ONHIR close before the 6-year statute of  limitations has expired for all denied applicants, another agency or  agencies would need statutory authority for coordinating eligibility  determinations and home-building for any newly certified applicants. As  previously discussed, at least 240 households that had been denied  relocation benefits as of September 2017 may choose to contest their  denial in federal court, according to ONHIR officials. ONHIR\u2019s March  2017 transition plan states that the Department of Justice will continue to  represent the government on behalf of ONHIR in any federal court  hearings, and ONHIR has also identified Interior\u2019s Office of Hearing and  Appeals to hear any matter remanded to the agency by the federal court  for a further hearing.", "Home-building. Another entity would need authority to assume  remaining home-building activities. Alternatively, ONHIR\u2019s October 2017  implementation plan suggests that newly certified applicants be given the  cash equivalent of a relocation home. However, as previously  mentioned, cash payments are not currently authorized under the  Settlement Act and legislation would be needed to provide such  payments. Moreover, Navajo Nation officials said they do not approve of  using cash payments in place of providing relocatees with a home. In  November 2017, ONHIR officials said that, as an alternative to cash  payments, they discussed with the Navajo Nation the potential for the  Navajo Housing Authority\u2014a recipient of the HUD Indian Housing Block  Grant Program\u2014to administer remaining home-building activities. They  did not make a decision, however, because the Navajo Nation wanted to  inquire about the capacity of the Navajo Housing Authority to assume  these activities. Although ONHIR has not identified HUD as an agency  with a potential role, such as assuming or providing oversight of Navajo  Housing Authority administration of remaining home-building activities,  HUD officials told us that HUD would not be able to assume ONHIR  housing functions. This is due to the nature of its block grant program,  restricted oversight mechanisms, and limited capacity in terms of staff  resources and technical skills to supervise construction. In addition,  HUD officials said that their current oversight is limited to reviewing a  sample of Indian Housing Block Grant program grantees\u2019 policies,  procedures, and implementation of procurement and environmental  regulations, which may not be consistent with the oversight or authority  needed should the Navajo Housing Authority administer the remaining  ONHIR home-building activities.", "Warranties. Should ONHIR close before 2-year home warranties expire  on the remaining homes constructed under ONHIR\u2019s oversight, another  agency would need statutory authority to oversee these home warranties.  As previously mentioned, ONHIR is currently a signatory to the warranty  along with the contractor and the client, and more than 52 homes will  have warranties in effect after ONHIR\u2019s proposed closure date of  September 2018, according to ONHIR officials. In its draft transition plan,  ONHIR suggests transferring warranty-related activities to the BIA  Contract Office. However, according to BIA officials, BIA does not  currently have the authority to conduct these activities, and BIA is not  equipped to implement warranties.", "Post-move counseling. Another agency would need statutory authority  to provide post-move counseling to the 52 clients who will remain under  warranty after ONHIR\u2019s proposed closure date of September 2018.  Currently, ONHIR provides relocatees with post-move counseling during  the 2-year warranty period. According to ONHIR\u2019s management manual,  the purpose of post-move counseling is to assist families in adjusting to  their new house, connect families to local service agencies, and gain  understanding about the client\u2019s familial and employment situation.  ONHIR\u2019s March 2017 transition plan suggested that the post-move  counseling program could be transitioned to BIA. However, BIA officials  said BIA currently does not have the authority to conduct these  activities. In November 2017, ONHIR officials said the program would  discontinue for any newly certified applicants if cash settlements for  relocation benefits were authorized, but they did not address what would  happen to the 52 clients that will remain within the 2-year warranty period  after September 2018.", "The Settlement Act does not include provisions on the transfer of  activities after ONHIR\u2019s closure, and as described above several activities  will remain past ONHIR\u2019s planned closure date.

The Navajo Nation would like to make  changes to some of the land it has selected and make new selections,  but the Settlement Act as amended does not authorize deselection of  land the tribe previously selected to be taken into trust pursuant to the  act\u2019s mandatory trust acquisition provision. Deselection had not  occurred as of January 2018, but bills have been introduced in  Congress that would cancel some of the tribe\u2019s land selections and  authorize the tribe to replace those with new selections.

From fiscal  years 1990 through 1995, Congress appropriated approximately $16  million to the Trust Fund. The Settlement Act as amended requires all  net income derived by the Navajo Nation from the surface and mineral  estates of lands in New Mexico taken into trust pursuant to the act to be  deposited into the Trust Fund. Moreover, the net income is required to be  used to reimburse the general fund of the Treasury for the amounts  originally appropriated to the Trust Fund. According to leasing and other  documents from the Navajo Nation and BLM, several of these parcels  have been generating modest income since at least the 1990s.  Specifically, BLM identified several parcels of the New Mexico trust land  with grazing allotments or oil and gas leases. In addition to these sources  of revenue, the tribe entered into an agreement for use of a parcel of the  New Mexico trust land that requires, beginning in 2015, annual rent  payments of $25,000 to be paid to the Trust Fund.", "The Navajo Nation has not reimbursed the general fund of the Treasury  for the approximately $16 million appropriated to the fund, contrary to the  statutory requirement to do so.

However, the Settlement Act does not give other agencies the authority to  undertake various ONHIR responsibilities. Therefore, if ONHIR closes  without congressional actions, any potential successor agency will not  have the appropriate authority to administer any remaining activities. As a  result, newly certified applicants and clients who remain under the 2-year  warranty period will not have an entity to assist with securing decent,  safe, and sanitary relocation homes, as intended in the Settlement Act.  Further, several other provisions in the Settlement Act as amended may  need congressional action. These include (1) the requirement for the trust  lands acquired in Arizona pursuant to the Settlement Act as amended to  be used solely for the benefit of relocatees and whether grazing on the  New Lands should be regulated consistent with ONHIR\u2019s current  regulations; (2) the mandatory trust acquisition provision for the Navajo  Nation; and (3) the requirement for the Navajo Nation to repay the U.S.  Treasury for appropriations made to the Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund.", "In addition, although ONHIR believes it has completed most of its  responsibilities under the act and believes it can close by September  2018, it does not have the authority to make this decision.

Because the  land ONHIR administers is held in trust by the federal government,  another entity will need to assume these responsibilities if ONHIR closes.  However, OHNIR does not maintain a complete inventory of leased or  occupied land and does not have written agreements for some occupied  land.

In this e-mail, the  Acting Director stated that HUD believes the report should clearly state  that HUD would not be an appropriate agency to continue ONHIR\u2019s  housing functions, because it does not provide direct services to tribes,  review or approve actions or transactions, or have the technical capacity  to assume ONHIR housing functions. We have acknowledged this in the  report and our objective was to identify legislative actions that may be  necessary to transition remaining relocation activities. Therefore, our  focus was on whether or not additional authorities might be needed if  ONHIR were to close. Although we present background information about  other federal agencies and tribal entities with responsibilities in Indian  Country as well as perspectives from various agencies on the transition  and remaining activities, we did not independently evaluate these  agencies\u2019 authorities or capacity and do not draw conclusions about  which agencies and tribal entities including HUD should be provided the  necessary authority by Congress to continue ONHIR\u2019s remaining  activities.", "In ONHIR\u2019s comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in  appendix II, ONHIR did not explicitly agree or disagree with our five  recommendations but stated that it had either already taken steps or had  plans to once a successor is identified.", "With regard to the draft report\u2019s first recommendation to request a  presidential determination as to whether ONHIR has fully  discharged its responsibilities and whether it should close, ONHIR  stated that it has worked for decades with the Office of  Management and Budget within the Executive Office of the  President on completing its work. While this may be the case, our  review found that no presidential determination for ONHIR to  cease operation has been requested, and no such decision has  been communicated, therefore we believe our recommendation is  valid.", "With regard to the second recommendation to prepare complete  information on the remaining denied households that could still file  for federal appeals, ONHIR stated that it has a solid grasp of  potential appeals. Specifically, ONHIR said that case files have  been identified and all needed information already exists in the  case files and in its database. ONHIR stated that it will provide  potential successor agencies with any information they request.  However, because it is unclear when ONHIR will close and which  agency will assume ONHIR\u2019s remaining eligibility and appeals  activities at that time, a successor agency will not have the  institutional knowledge to follow and connect the information  needed for determining eligibility and providing support for cases  for which appeals were filed in federal court. Therefore, we  maintain that ONHIR should proactively prepare the necessary  information associated with these appeals for any successor  agency. Preparing complete and readily available information  could minimize the challenges the successor agency may  encounter in administering future appeals and eligibility  determinations.", "With regard to the third recommendation to prepare complete  information on warranties and contractors, ONHIR stated that up- to-date and complete information on warranty status appears in  the existing case files. We maintain our concern about the  accuracy of ONHIR\u2019s warranty database because in its comment  letter ONHIR acknowledged that some complaints were entered  multiple times due to data entry issues. Moreover, ONHIR states  that its staff know which relocatee homes will still be under  warranty as of September 30, 2018, and have compiled a list of  such homes. However, preparing the case file and list of such  homes does not address the deficiencies that we found in the  warranty database. While we revised the report by including  ONHIR\u2019s statement that its system has the capability to search  warranty complaints, we continue to believe that the information  available through searches will be incomplete for a successor  agency because the information is disconnected. Without linking  warranty complaints to the relevant contractor, completing missing  warranty information, and completing information on contractors\u2019  past performance, any successor agency may have difficulty  understanding what warranty issues have already been addressed  or have difficulty overseeing contractors to help ensure that newly  certified applicants secure decent, safe, and sanitary relocation  homes.", "With regard to the fourth recommendation to establish a  comprehensive inventory of (1) properties located on trust land it  administers, (2) leases of those properties, and (3) surface use  and other use agreements for trust land it administers, ONHIR  stated that such documentation exists and is maintained and  updated. However, this statement is inconsistent with what we  found during our review. We reviewed information provided by  ONHIR from various sources as part of our review, and the  information available did not include a comprehensive inventory of  leased and vacant properties on or surface use and other  agreements for Navajo trust land ONHIR administers. We  continue to believe that without developing a comprehensive  inventory of leased and vacant properties on Navajo trust land that  ONHIR administers and leases and agreements for those  properties, the entity that assumes responsibility for leasing the  land will not have the information it needs to carry out that  responsibility.", "With regard to the fifth recommendation to identify which leases  and other agreements need to be amended or assigned because  (1) ONHIR is the lessor; (2) the lease or agreement provides for  annual payments to be made to ONHIR, and/or (3) the lease or  agreement terminates upon ONHIR\u2019s closure, ONHIR stated that  it will move forward with specific transition activities after a  successor entity is identified. We believe that such an approach is  risky because it assumes that ONHIR staff will be available to  work closely with staff from a new successor entity to personally  transfer their knowledge to the new staff. However, there is no  guarantee that ONHIR will continue operating or that its many  retirement-eligible employees will be available to assist any  successor entities during a transition period.

We obtained two data files as of June 2017 from ONHIR\u2019s  Client Database\u2014Client Master and Hearing File\u2014to analyze the time  frame for becoming certified for relocation benefits and relocating to the  house provided by ONHIR. Using the case numbers in the Hearing File,  we identified those applicants that were certified for relocation benefits  through the administrative appeals process. We assessed the reliability of  ONHIR\u2019s data files by conducting a file review of a random sample of 30  case numbers, which we selected based on the distribution of two factors:  (1) application date, and (2) type of determination. We recorded the  relevant information in the paper files\u2014 such as date applied, date of  determination, determination code, and date relocated\u2014and compared it  to the data fields in the electronic files.

We reviewed the terms of the leases and agreements  provided to identify specific elements, such as the identity of the lessor,  lessee, and any concurring parties; start and end dates; required rental  payments, if any; and any provisions on the leases\u2019 continuation or  termination in the event that ONHIR closes. We compared the leases to  ONHIR\u2019s list of properties on Navajo trust land it administers to determine  if all of the properties were covered by leases. We also reviewed  information, such as summary spreadsheets, on sources of revenue  ONHIR collects, retains, and uses, including documentation of Treasury  accounts where such revenue is deposited. We cross-checked the  revenue information ONHIR provided with information from Treasury  about deposits into ONHIR\u2019s Treasury account and we interviewed  ONHIR officials regarding discrepancies. Revenues from the Padres  Mesa Demonstration Ranch were included as part of the revenue  information and ONHIR provided a separate accounting of the  obligations, expenditures, and revenues for the ranch. We reviewed  ONHIR\u2019s regulations and management manual for policies and  procedures on leasing and grazing on the New Lands and compared  them to the agency\u2019s practices. We also reviewed BIA\u2019s regulations on  leasing and grazing on Indian trust lands under the agency\u2019s  administration to identify comparable grazing and leasing policies and  procedures.

Our report focuses on ONHIR\u2019s management  of the home building process and the status of these activities. To  appropriately address our audit objective on the home building  process, we included the experiences of the population that was being  served by ONHIR. While ONHIR states that the information included  in our report is unsubstantiated, we do not assert that the views on  home building from those we attributed\u2014tribal government officials  and relocatees\u2014are accurate or draw conclusions about the reasons  for the condition of the homes.

We revised the report to indicate the attorney fees reported were over  a 35-year period.  4.  We revised the report to state that, for the third application period, the  requirement was for applicants to maintain legal residency until their  contact with ONHIR.   5.  We made revisions to the report to include ONHIR\u2019s efforts related to  eligibility determination, such offering administrative appeals to  Navajos for whom ONHIR could not show actual receipt of denial  letters and using restricted delivery certified mail for almost 30 years.  6.  We made revisions to the report to include ONHIR\u2019s perspective on  the difficulties in determining residency because of the nature of  Navajos\u2019 employment opportunities.  7.

Our report focuses on actions that may be necessary to terminate  ONHIR in an orderly manner and transition remaining relocation  activities. We did not make a change in the report in response to  ONHIR\u2019s comment because ONHIR had not identified and compiled  the case files during our review that would be necessary or easily  accessible for a successor agency. While ONHIR states in its letter  that case files have been identified and all needed information already  exists in the case files and in its database, because these activities  may have occurred subsequent to our review, we cannot confirm the  accuracy of this comment.

We did not make a change to the report in response to  ONHIR\u2019s comment because we already describe several procedures  related to home building, including contractor licensing requirements  and feasibility studies. The report also acknowledges that houses  have passed final inspection.    18. As described in comment 2, we disagree with ONHIR\u2019s  characterization of our methodology. We did not make a change in the  report because we maintain that including the experiences of the  population served by ONHIR is appropriate for balance.  19. We disagree with ONHIR\u2019s characterization of our report and did not  make a change to the report based on this comment. Throughout the  body of the report, we have included ONHIR\u2019s policies, its  implementation of activities, as well as the statements of officials  related to relocatees\u2019 home-building concerns.  20. We have made revisions to clarify the figure title.  The two  photographed houses are on the Navajo reservation, shown to us  during our site visit. Because one of the houses was shown to us by  ONHIR officials, we believe the home was built by ONHIR. The other  home was from a separate tour with Navajo Nation officials. The  Navajo Nation officials indicated that the home was built by ONHIR.    21. As described in comment 2, we disagree with ONHIR\u2019s  characterization of our methodology. We did not make a change in the  report because we maintain that including the experiences of the  population served by ONHIR is appropriate for balance.   22. As described in comment 2, we disagree with ONHIR\u2019s  characterization of our methodology. Throughout the report, we  specifically attribute all the views on home building to those we  interviewed\u2014tribal government officials and relocatees. We also do  not draw conclusions about the reasons for the condition of the  homes. We did not make a change in the report because we maintain  that including the experiences of the population served by ONHIR is  appropriate for balance.   23. We revised the report to include ONHIR\u2019s statement about the search  capability of its electronic data system.    24. During our review, ONHIR officials did not identify contracting for post- move counseling services as an option that they have considered nor  did we find any such reference in transition documents we reviewed.  Therefore we have not made any changes to the report based on this  comment.  25. We disagree with ONHIR\u2019s characterization of our report. We  reviewed information provided by ONHIR from various sources, and  accurately reported that ONHIR does not have a comprehensive  inventory of leased and vacant properties or surface use and other  agreements for Navajo trust land it administers. Therefore, we made  no changes in response to this comment.  26. We disagree with ONHIR\u2019s characterization of our report and did not  make a change in the report based on this comment. ONHIR\u2019s  management manual calls for written leases and land use approvals  for the New Lands, whether or not the Navajo Nation requests these.  It is not the responsibility of the trust beneficiary to request a written  lease. The trustee has a duty to maintain clear, complete, and  accurate books and records regarding trust property.  27. We disagree with ONHIR\u2019s statement that it will wait until a successor  is identified to inform it of the leases. Moving forward with specific  transition activities only after a successor entity is identified is a risky  approach because it assumes that ONHIR staff will be available to  work with staff from a successor entity to transfer their knowledge to  the new staff. However, there is no guarantee that ONHIR will  continue to be operating at that time or that its many retirement- eligible employees will be available to assist any successor entities  during a transition period. ONHIR has proposed closing on September  30, 2018. As of March 2018, no successor entities have been  designated or authorized to assume any ONHIR activities. As we  recommended, clearly documenting what needs to happen as part of  the transition will help ensure a smoother transition in the event that  there is not a transition period between ONHIR and a new successor  entity.  28. We revised the report to indicate that, according to ONHIR, Federal  Aviation Administration has continued to pay rent to ONHIR while a  new lease is negotiated.  29. We disagree with ONHIR\u2019s characterization of the report and did not  make a change based on this comment. As we reported, the  Settlement Act as amended does not specifically authorize ONHIR to  collect, retain, and use revenues from leases of Navajo trust land it  administers. The Settlement Act as amended also does not specify  whether ONHIR, the Navajo Nation, or the relocatees should receive  lease revenues. However, as we reported, under BIA\u2019s regulations for  trust land it administers, revenue from leases is to be either paid  directly to the tribe whose trust land is being leased or to BIA, which  deposits the revenue in the tribe\u2019s trust account that generally earns  interest. BIA officials told us leases of trust land that provide for BIA to  retain lease revenue would not be consistent with the agency\u2019s trust  responsibility.  30. We recognize that ONHIR is not, and has never been, part of BIA. As  we note in the report, the comparison to BIA is instructive because  BIA administers the vast majority of Indian trust land. In addition,  ONHIR in its comments and draft transition plan identify BIA as a  possible successor entity for some activities.  31. As described in comment 29, we disagree with ONHIR\u2019s  characterization of its duties and powers as a trustee and did not  make a change to the report. The Settlement Act as amended does  not specifically authorize ONHIR to collect, retain, and use revenues  from leases of Navajo trust land it administers. Moreover, BIA officials  told us leases of trust land that provide for BIA to retain lease revenue  would not be consistent with the agency\u2019s trust responsibility.  32. We disagree with ONHIR\u2019s characterization of the realities of leasing  Navajo trust land and did not make a change to the report. ONHIR did  not provide documentation of requests from the Navajo Nation for  ONHIR to serve as the lessor on some commercial leases. When  ONHIR served as the lessor, ONHIR provided the Navajo Nation with  some leases for \u201ctechnical review\u201d or for \u201creview and comment\u201d.  However, only one of the leases we reviewed includes the Navajo  Nation President\u2019s signature when the tribe, or a tribal entity, is not the  lessee. Moreover, as we reported, the Navajo Nation Department of  Justice repeatedly informed ONHIR that it lacked the authority to  lease Navajo trust land.  33. As described in comment 27, we disagree with ONHIR\u2019s planned  approach to wait until a successor is identified and did not make a  change in the report. Moving forward with specific transition activities  only after a successor entity is identified is a risky approach because  it assumes that ONHIR staff will be available to work with staff from a  successor entity to transfer their knowledge to the new staff. However,  there is no guarantee that ONHIR will continue operating or that its  many retirement-eligible employees will be available to assist any  successor entities during a transition period.  34. We clarified the report to note that another entity is needed to assume  remaining home building activities.  35. We clarified the report to include ONHIR\u2019s statement that it has had  regular communications with executive and legislative branch offices  on completing its work and closing.   36. We disagree with ONHIR\u2019s comments that the report is misleading  related to a presidential determination. Although we included ONHIR\u2019s  statement on its communications about closure in the report, we  maintain that without a presidential determination, ONHIR has not met  the explicit requirements for being permitted to cease operations  under the Settlement Act.  37. As described in comment 11, during the course of our review, ONHIR  did not have complete information readily available for use by a  successor agency. We cannot assure that any efforts ONHIR has  taken subsequently to compile this information as stated in its  comment letter are accurate. We continue to believe that ONHIR  should proactively compile necessary information rather than waiting  for a successor to request it. Moreover, we maintain our concerns  about ONHIR\u2019s database given its admission of data entry issues in  its comment letter. Therefore, we did not make a change in the report  based on this comment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Navajo Nation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jill Naamane and Jeffrey  Malcolm (Assistant Directors), Chir-Jen Huang (Analyst in Charge),  Susan Baker, William Chatlos, Brad Dobbins, Justin Fisher, Randi Hall,  Erik Kjeldgaard, Ellie Klein, Jessica Sandler, Jennifer Schwartz, Jena  Sinkfield, and Jeanette Soares made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["A 1974 law divided land used by the Navajo and Hopi tribes into two regions, requiring families to move.
