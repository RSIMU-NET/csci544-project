OPM provided guidance to help agencies develop disability hiring plans and reviewed the 66 plans submitted. OPM identified deficiencies in most of the plans. For example, though 40 of 66 agencies included a process for increasing the use of a special hiring authority to increase the hiring of people with disabilities, 59 agencies did not meet all of OPM\u0092s review criteria, and 32 agencies had not addressed plan deficiencies as of April 2012. In response to executive order reporting requirements, OPM officials said they had briefed the White House on issues related to implementation, but they did not provide information on deficiencies in all plans. While the order does not specify what information these reports should include beyond addressing progress, providing information on deficiencies would enable the White House to hold agencies accountable. OPM is still developing the mandatory training programs for officials on the employment of individuals with disabilities, as required by the executive order. Several elective training efforts exist to help agencies hire and retain employees with disabilities, but agency officials said that more information would help them better use available tools. To track and measure progress towards meeting the executive order\u0092s goals, OPM relies on employees to voluntarily disclose a disability. Yet, agency officials, including OPM\u0092s, are concerned about the quality of the data. For example, agency officials noted that people may not disclose their disability due to concerns about how the information may be used. Without quality data, agencies may be challenged to effectively implement and assess the impact of their disability hiring plans.", "The Department of Education (Education), Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) submitted disability hiring plans, and have taken steps to implement leading practices for increasing employment of individuals with disabilities, such as demonstrating top leadership commitment. The executive order provided SSA, VA, and Education an opportunity to further develop existing written plans. However, officials at these agencies cited funding constraints as a potential obstacle to hiring more employees with disabilities. In terms of leading practices, all four agencies have communicated their commitment to hiring and retaining individuals with disabilities and coordinated within or across other agencies to improve their recruitment and retention efforts. For example, each agency has a single point of contact to help ensure that employees with disabilities have access to information that is comparable to that provided to those without disabilities, and for overseeing activities related to hiring and retaining employees with disabilities. In addition, VA holds senior managers accountable for meeting hiring goals by including targets in their contracts. Each agency requires training for managers and supervisors on procedures for hiring individuals with disabilities, and VA further requires that all employees receive training on the legal rights of individuals with disabilities. Education, SSA, and VA rely on centralized funding accounts to pay for reasonable accommodations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OPM: (1) incorporate information about plan deficiencies into its required regular reporting to the president on implementing the executive order and inform agencies about this process; (2) expedite the development of the mandatory training programs required by the executive order; and (3) assess the accuracy of the data used to measure progress toward the executive order\u0092s goals and, if needed, explore options for improving its ability to measure the population of federal employees with disabilities, including strategies for encouraging employees to voluntarily disclose disability status.

This executive order called for increasing the  number of individuals with disabilities in the federal government through  the hiring of 100,000 individuals with disabilities over the next 5 years and  through greater efforts to retain federal workers with disabilities, including  ensuring the return to work of individuals injured on the job. According to  draft data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the  government is not on track to meet the goals of the executive order,  having hired approximately 20,000 employees with disabilities during  fiscal years 2010 and 2011; however, as discussed later in this report, we  were unable to verify these data.", "Because of concerns about the federal government\u2019s ability to meet the  goals set out by Executive Order 13548, you asked us to assess the  efforts that (1) OPM and the Department of Labor (Labor) have made in  overseeing the implementation of the executive order across the federal  government, and (2) selected agencies have taken to implement the  executive order and to adopt leading practices for hiring and retaining  employees with disabilities. To assess OPM and Labor\u2019s oversight efforts,  we examined relevant documents from OPM and Labor, including OPM\u2019s  guidance to federal agencies for implementing the executive order,  agency plans for hiring and employing people with disabilities, and OPM\u2019s  review of these plans. We also interviewed key agency officials at OPM,  Labor, and other agencies cited in the executive order such as the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB). We also interviewed advocates for  individuals with disabilities from the American Association of People with  Disabilities, the National Council on Disabilities, and the National  Disability Rights Network to obtain their opinions on the executive order.  To determine how selected agencies are implementing the executive  order and leading practices, we focused our review on four federal  agencies: (1) the Department of Education (Education), (2) the Social  Security Administration (SSA), (3) the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA), and (4) OMB. We selected this nongeneralizable sample among  many agencies within the federal government to provide a cross section  for review.

Federal employees voluntarily submit this form to disclose that they have  a disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act. For reporting purposes,  disabilities are separated into two major categories: Targeted and Other  Disabilities. Targeted disabilities, generally considered to be more severe,  include such conditions as total deafness, complete paralysis, and  psychiatric disabilities. Other disabilities include such conditions as partial  hearing or vision loss, gastrointestinal disorders, and learning disabilities.", "Further, Labor is given responsibilities in the executive order to improve  efforts to help employees who sustain work-related injuries and illnesses  return to work.

SSA and VA have also  participated in the Workforce Recruitment Program for College Students   VA and Education have also worked together to assist  with Disabilities; disabled veterans by providing unpaid work experience at Education,  which may lead to permanent employment.", "Managed by Labor\u2019s Office of Disability Employment Policy and the Department of  Defense\u2019s Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity, this program is a  recruitment and referral effort that connects federal sector employers nationwide with  highly motivated college students and recent graduates with disabilities. said that the site is useful for seeing what other agencies are doing, and  that they have also shared their own practices on the site.", "Training for staff at all levels: Agencies can leverage training to  communicate expectations about implementation of policies and  procedures related to improving employment of people with disabilities,  and help disseminate leading practices that can help improve outcomes.  All of the selected agencies provide some training for staff at all levels on  the importance of workforce diversity. They also require managers and  supervisors to take training on hiring procedures related to individuals  with disabilities, and the use of Schedule A hiring authority. In addition,  VA requires employees at all levels to take training specifically devoted to  the legal rights of individuals with disabilities. At Education, this training is  required for managers and supervisors, while at SSA it is available but  optional for all employees.", "Career development opportunities: Opportunities for employees with  disabilities to participate in work details, rotational assignments, and  mentoring programs can lead to increased retention and improved  employee satisfaction, and improve employment outcomes by helping  managers identify employees with high potential. All of the agencies we  interviewed provided special work details or rotational assignments for all  employees; one reported having a program exclusively for those with  disabilities. Specifically, Education uses Project SEARCH to provide  internships for students with disabilities to help them become ready to  work through on-the-job training. Education officials reported that some of  these internships have led to permanent employment at Education.", "A flexible work environment: Flexible work schedules, telework, and  other types of reasonable accommodations are valuable tools for the  recruitment and retention of employees, regardless of disability status.  Such arrangements can make it easier for employees with health  impairments to successfully function in the work environment or facilitate  an injured employee\u2019s return to work. All of the agencies we interviewed  provide flexible work arrangements, including flexible work schedules and  teleworking. These agencies also make assistive technologies, such as  screen reader software, available for employees with disabilities, which  can facilitate their ability to take advantage of flexible work arrangements.  Education, OMB, and SSA also offer all employees opportunities for job  sharing.", "Centralized funding for reasonable accommodations: Having a  central budget at the highest level of the agency can help ensure that  employees with disabilities have access to reasonable accommodations  by removing these expenses from local operational budgets and thus  reducing managers\u2019 concerns about their costs. Education, SSA, and VA  use centralized funding accounts to pay for reasonable accommodations  for employees with disabilities. At Education, a centralized fund is usually  used to cover expenses related to providing readers, interpreters, and  personal attendants. However, in cases where these services are needed  on a daily basis, Education may require the operating unit to hire  someone full-time and pay for this from their unit budget. OMB provides  funding from its own budget to pay for reasonable accommodations,  rather than receiving funding from the Executive Office of the President.  OMB officials also told us that they also have been able to rely on the  Department of Defense\u2019s Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program  to help provide reasonable accommodations for some of the employees.  This program facilitates access to assistive technology and services to  people with disabilities, federal managers, supervisors, and information  technology professionals by providing a single point of access for  executive branch agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the nation\u2019s largest employer, the federal government has the  opportunity to be a model for the employment of people with disabilities.  Consistent with the July 2010 executive order, OPM, Labor, and other  agencies have helped provide the framework for federal agencies to take  proactive steps to improve the hiring and retention of persons with  disabilities.", "However, nearly 2 years after the executive order was signed, the federal  government is not on track to achieve the executive order\u2019s goals.  Although federal agencies have taken the first step by submitting action  plans to OPM for review, many agency plans do not meet the criteria  identified by OPM as essential to becoming a model employer of people  with disabilities. Though the executive order does not specifically  authorize OPM to require agencies to address deficiencies, regularly  reporting to the president and others on agency progress in addressing  these deficiencies may compel agencies to address them and better  position the federal government to reach the goals of the executive order.", "Further, officials responsible for hiring at federal agencies need to acquire  the necessary knowledge and skills to proactively recruit, hire, and retain  individuals with disabilities. Agency officials we spoke with said more  comprehensive training on the tools available to them, including the  requirements of Schedule A hiring authority, is needed. While the  mandatory training program remains in development, until it is fully  developed and communicated to agencies, opportunities to better inform  relevant agency officials on how to increase the employment of  individuals with disabilities may be missed.", "Finally, concerns have been raised by stakeholders, including EEOC,  OPM, and advocates for people with disabilities, about the reliability of  government statistics on the number of individuals with disabilities in the  federal government. Most of the concerns focus on the likelihood of  underreporting given the reliance on voluntary disclosure, but the extent  of the underreporting is unknown. Unreliable data hinder OPM\u2019s ability to  measure the population of federal workers with disabilities and may  prevent the federal government from developing needed policies and  procedures that support efforts to become a model employer of people  with disabilities. Determining the accuracy of SF-256 data, for example,  by examining the extent to which employees voluntarily disclose their  disability status and reasons for nondisclosure, is an essential step for  ensuring that OPM can measure progress towards the executive order\u2019s  goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the federal government is well positioned to become a  model employer of individuals with disabilities, we recommend that the  Director of OPM take the following three actions:  1.  Incorporate information about plan deficiencies into its regular  reporting to the president on agencies\u2019 progress in implementing their  plans, and inform agencies about this process to better ensure that  the plan deficiencies are addressed.  2.  Expedite the development of the mandatory training programs for  hiring managers and human resource personnel on the employment  of individuals with disabilities, as required by the executive order.  3.  Assess the extent to which the SF-256 accurately measures progress  toward the executive order\u2019s goal and explore options for improving  the accuracy of SF-256 reporting, if needed, including strategies for  encouraging employees to voluntarily disclose their disability status.  Any such strategies must comply with legal standards governing  disability-related inquiries, including ensuring that employee rights to  voluntarily disclose a disability are not infringed upon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education, EEOC, Labor, OMB,  OPM, SSA, and VA for review and comment. In written comments, OPM  agreed with findings and recommendations identified in the report, and  described actions being implemented in an effort to address them. To  better ensure agencies address deficiencies identified in their disability  hiring plans, OPM has begun notifying agencies that it plans to report  remaining deficiencies to the president and on the OPM website by  August 2012. With regard to the need to expedite the development of the  mandatory training program, OPM, in coordination with partner agencies  has identified training for hiring managers and supervisors, and Human  Resource personnel. Finally, OPM stated that it is engaged in discussions  with the White House and stakeholder agencies to better define questions  on the SF-256 to increase response rates. OPM also said it plans to work  with EEOC and Labor to develop guidance for agencies to encourage  voluntary self-disclosure through annual re-surveying of the workforce  and providing employees with the option to complete the SF-256 when  they request a reasonable accommodation. OPM expects to complete  these efforts by January 2013. While these actions may help improve the  accuracy of the SF-256 data, we think taking steps to assess the  accuracy of the data will enhance OPM\u2019s efforts. For example,  understanding the extent to which employees do not voluntarily self- disclose their disability status and the reasons why may help target the  messages agencies can use to encourage voluntary self-disclosure.  Without such an understanding, OPM and agencies may miss  opportunities to increase the accuracy of the data collected on the SF- 256.", "Education, EEOC, OMB, OPM, and SSA provided technical comments,  which have been incorporated into the report as appropriate.
