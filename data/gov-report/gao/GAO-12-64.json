Thousands of FAS citizens have migrated to U.S. areas (compact migrants)--particularly to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, and Hawaii, which are defined as affected jurisdictions. In fiscal year 2004, Congress appropriated $30 million annually for 20 years to help defray affected jurisdictions' costs for migrant services (compact impact). Though not required, affected jurisdictions can report these costs to the Department of the Interior (Interior), which allocates the $30 million as impact grants in proportion to compact migrant enumerations required every 5 years. This report (1) describes compact migration, (2) reviews enumeration approaches, (3) evaluates impact reporting, and (4) reviews Interior grants related to compact impact. GAO reviewed U.S. agency data, recent enumerations, impact reports, and grants and it also interviewed officials, employers, and migrants in the affected jurisdictions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Combined data from the U.S. Census Bureau's (Census) 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) and the required enumeration in 2008 estimate that a total of roughly 56,000 compact migrants from the FSM, the Marshall Islands, and Palau--nearly a quarter of all FAS citizens--were living in U.S. areas. Compact migrants resided throughout U.S. areas, with approximately 58 percent of all compact migrants living in the affected jurisdictions. According to the 2008 required enumeration, compact migrant populations continued to grow in Guam and Hawaii and were roughly 12 percent of the population of Guam and 1 percent of the population of Hawaii. Working under agreements with Interior, Census used a different approach for the most recent enumeration than for prior enumerations, employing two methods in 2008: (1) a one-time survey in Guam and the CNMI and (2) a tabulation of existing multiyear ACS data for Hawaii. The affected jurisdictions opposed the change in approach. The 2008 approach allowed for determining the precision of the estimates but did not yield comparable results across jurisdictions or detailed information on compact migrants. Interior and Census officials have a preliminary plan for the required 2013 enumeration but Interior has not determined its cost or assessed its strengths and limitations. The methods used by affected jurisdictions to collect and report on compact impact have weaknesses that reduce their accuracy. For fiscal years 2004 through 2010, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI reported more than $1 billion in costs associated with providing education, health, and social services to compact migrants. However, some jurisdictions did not accurately define compact migrants, account for federal funding that supplemented local expenditures, or include revenue received from compact migrants. Although Interior is required to report to Congress any compact impacts that the affected jurisdictions report to Interior, it has not provided the affected jurisdictions with adequate guidance on estimating compact impact. Compact migrants participate in local economies through employment, taxation and consumption, but data on these effects are limited. From fiscal years 2004 to 2010, Interior awarded approximately $210 million in compact impact grants to the affected jurisdictions, which used the funds primarily for budget support, projects, and purchases in the areas of education, health, and public safety. In Guam and Hawaii, government officials, service providers, and compact migrants discussed approaches to more directly address challenges related to migration by bridging language barriers, providing job training, and increasing access to services. The amended compacts also made available $808 million in sector grants for the FSM and the Marshall Islands from fiscal years 2004 to 2010. Sector grants are jointly allocated by the joint U.S.-FSM and U.S.-Marshall Islands management committees and have been used primarily in the FAS for health and education. Few sector grants directly address issues that concern compact migrants or the affected jurisdictions. The committees had not formally placed compact impact on their annual meeting agendas until 2011 and have not yet allocated any 2012 sector grant funds to directly address compact impact."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Interior assess the 2013 enumeration approach, disseminate adequate guidance on estimating compact impact, and encourage uses of grants that better address compact migrants' impact and needs.

Limitations of Census\u2019s approach for the 2008  enumeration included its use of two different methods and its use of data  from two different time periods, both of which affect the perceived fairness  and usefulness of the enumerations. In addition, data resulting from the  2008 approach has limited comparability with data from the prior surveys  and includes limited demographic information, limiting the usefulness of  the 2008 data for purposes other than the required enumeration.  \uf0b7  Use of two different methods. The data produced by block sampling  in Guam and the CNMI and the ACS tabulations in Hawaii that were  used for the 2008 enumeration are not fully comparable among the  affected jurisdictions.  \uf0b7  Use of data from different time periods.

Annual costs for health services across all jurisdictions increased from  approximately $33 million to $54 million, or by 66 percent.", "The affected jurisdictions\u2019 impact reports, numerous studies, federal and  state officials, and officials from affected jurisdictions have identified  several other factors, in addition to growing migrant populations, that  contribute to the cost of providing public services to compact migrants.  \uf0b7  Educational services. Compact migrant school children generally lag  academically owing to (1) poor-quality schools in the FAS; (2) limited  language skills and experience with a school environment; and (3)  difficulties in involving parents in their children\u2019s education, due to  language barriers. Various officials from affected jurisdictions,  Interior, and service providers said these factors increase the  resources required to provide educational services to compact  migrants relative to other students.  \uf0b7  Health services. FAS citizens have high rates of obesity; diabetes;  hypertension; cardiovascular disease; and communicable diseases  such as tuberculosis, Hansen\u2019s disease, and sexually transmitted  diseases. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Inspector General has  reported on inadequate health care systems in the FAS, which can  lead to the prevalence of these health issues among FAS citizens.  These health factors also lead some FAS citizens to migrate in order  to gain access to the U.S. health care system. In U.S. areas, compact  migrants\u2019 low household incomes may lead many migrants to rely on  public health services.  \uf0b7  Social services. Like many other migrant populations, compact  migrants often face challenges related to homelessness, reliance on  public housing, and crowded living conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compact Migrants Are Ineligible for Several Federal Programs", "paragraphs": ["Various officials in Guam and Hawaii also cited compact migrants\u2019 limited  eligibility for a number of federal programs, particularly Medicaid, as a key  contributor to the cost of compact migration borne by the affected  jurisdictions. Table 2 shows compact migrants\u2019 eligibility status for  selected federal benefit programs.", "In some cases, affected jurisdictions have provided services for compact  migrants at local expense that are similar to those available to U.S.  citizens. For example, Guam, Hawaii and the CNMI provide funding for  medical services that, prior to 1996, were available through Medicaid to  low-income non-U.S. citizen compact migrants. U.S.-born children of  compact migrants are eligible as citizens for the benefits available to them  as U.S. citizens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compact Impact Estimates Have a Number of Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["We identified a number of weaknesses in affected jurisdictions\u2019 reporting  of compact impacts to Interior from 2004 through 2010 related to  accuracy, adequacy of documentation, and comprehensiveness.  Examples of such weaknesses include the following (see appendix VI for  more details).  \uf0b7  Definition of compact migrants. For several impact reports that we  examined, the reporting local government agencies (state and  territorial agencies in the affected jurisdictions) did not define compact  migrants according to the criteria in the amended compacts enabling  legislation when calculating service costs. For instance, some  agencies defined and counted compact migrants using the proxy  measures of ethnicity, language, or citizenship rather than the  definition in the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation. Using  ethnicity or language as a proxy measure could lead to overstating  costs, since neither measure would exclude individuals who came to  the jurisdiction prior to the compact, while using citizenship as a proxy  measure could lead to understating costs, since it would exclude U.S.- born children of compact migrants.  \uf0b7  Federal funding. States and territories receive federal funding for  specific programs that offsets a portion of the costs of providing  services to compact migrants. However, two of the three affected  jurisdictions\u2019 public school systems and health agencies did not  account for these offsets in their impact reporting, thus overstating  reported compact impact costs.  \uf0b7  Revenue. Multiple local government agencies that receive revenues,  such as user fees, associated with services provided to compact  migrants did not consider them in their compact impact reports, thus  overstating reported costs.  \uf0b7  Capital costs. Many local government agencies did not include  capital costs in their impact reporting. Capital costs entail, for  example, providing additional classrooms to accommodate an  increase in students or additional health care facilities. In cases where  compact migration has resulted in the expansion of facilities, agencies  understated compact migrant impact by omitting these costs.  \uf0b7  Per person costs. A number of local government agencies used an  average per-person service cost for the jurisdiction rather than  specific costs associated with providing services to compact migrants.  Hawaii reported in 2008 that several costly diseases are  overrepresented within the compact migrant population. Using the  average cost may either overstate or understate the true cost of  service provision. In some cases\u2014for example, the provision of  health services\u2014the service cost for each compact migrant could be  determined. However, a number of agencies apply a range of  approaches, such as using the simple average cost (e.g., cost per  student) or factoring in higher costs if additional or more costly  services are used.  \uf0b7  Discretionary costs. Some compact impact costs local government  agencies reported were for benefits or services provided at the  discretion of the affected jurisdiction.  \uf0b7  Data reliability. One local government agency used data on compact  migrants that were found to be in error in a subsequent compilation of  their impact reporting and caused an overstatement of total costs in its  impact reporting.", "A number of local government agencies did not disclose their  methodology, including any assumptions, definitions, and other key  elements, for developing impact costs making it difficult to evaluate  reported costs.", "For those years when the affected jurisdictions submitted impact reports  to Interior, not all local government agencies in the jurisdictions included  all compact impact costs for those years.

Approximately 60 percent of this difference  results from compact migrant workers\u2019 being much less likely to be  employed in Guam\u2019s higher paying public sector. The remaining  difference results from the higher number of exemptions that compact  migrant workers could claim, on average, for family members when filing  taxes.

As part of this review, to approximate the  dispersion of compact migrants, we arranged with the U.S. Census  Bureau (Census) to purchase a special tabulation of multiyear American  Community Survey (ACS) data gathered from 2005 through 2009. These  state estimates represent migrants if they are present in sufficient  numbers to be reportable; state estimates are unreportable when fewer  than 50 people respond in each category of cross-tabulated data. Census  also applies statistical disclosure avoidance techniques to the tabulated  data to protect respondent confidentiality, such as suppressing the  number and location of compact migrants. The new tabulation mirrors the  one used by Census to estimate the number of compact migrants in  Hawaii in 2008 using ACS data. To determine the trend of migrants as a  percentage of the populations of affected jurisdictions and identify  reasons for migration, we reviewed our previous report on compact  migrant impact and analyzed the information presented in previous  enumerations. To estimate the populations of affected jurisdictions, FSM,  and the Marshall Islands in 2003 and 2008, we used the 1999 Marshall  Islands census, an estimate from the Marshall Islands\u2019 embassy to the  U.S. for the 2011 population, and 2000 and 2010 censuses for the FSM  and the affected jurisdictions, assumed that the population changed at a  constant rate, and interpolated the population counts for the years in  between. The 1993 and 1998 estimates of affected jurisdiction  population are existing Census estimates.", "To assess Interior and Census approaches to enumerating compact  migrants in affected jurisdictions, we reviewed the requirement for the  enumerations in the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation. In addition,  we interviewed Census and Interior officials and officials in affected  jurisdictions who had contacted or worked with Census and Interior as  they developed the 2003 and 2008 enumerations.

We  also conducted a literature review to identify existing studies of the uses  and limitations of the various methods for enumerating populations such  as compact migrants.", "To compile the compact impact costs reported by the governments of  Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI, we used the most recent data that they  submitted to Interior for 1986 through 2010, Interior\u2019s 2010 compact  impact report to Congress, and data from our previous report. We then  categorized the reported costs using the categories that the amended  compacts\u2019 enabling legislation defines as eligible for compact impact  funding\u2014education, health, public safety, and social services and  infrastructure related to such services\u2014to identify the main sources of  compact impact reported by the affected jurisdictions. For additional  context, we reviewed the narrative of the reports submitted by affected  jurisdictions and interviewed compact migrants and officials in affected  jurisdictions. To identify the eligibility of compact migrants for selected  federal programs that may help address the compact impact on affected  jurisdictions, we reviewed existing legislation and discussed our findings  with officials from affected jurisdictions and subject matter experts.", "To evaluate the affected jurisdictions\u2019 estimates of compact impact costs,  we compared the costs that the affected jurisdictions had reported to  Interior since 2004 with cost estimation criteria that we developed based  on OMB guidelines as well as our own guidance on cost -benefit  analyses, a previous report on costs associated with illegal alien  schoolchildren, and requirements in the amended compacts\u2019 enabling  legislation. We identified the methodologies used by local government  agencies in the affected jurisdictions to develop their compact impact  costs and determined their limitations by reviewing the compact impact  reports; interviewing officials from many of the reporting agencies in  affected jurisdictions; and collecting information from the Guam and the  CNMI\u2019s single audit reports. Using our cost criteria, we developed  questions and circulated them to affected jurisdictions\u2019 reporting  agencies, providing them an opportunity to further explain how they  derived their estimates. Not all agencies responded to these questions;  therefore, additional examples beyond the ones we have identified may  exist. Table 8 includes Hawaii\u2019s most recent reported compact impact  costs which were submitted to Interior in August 2011. However, our  analysis of compact impact reporting does not include this information.  Officials from Hawaii\u2019s Department of Human Services, Department of  Health, and Department of Education said that their reporting  methodologies had generally not changed since their last report, which  was submitted in 2008 and which we included in our analysis. However,  the Department of Education said that it excluded federal funds from its  2008 through 2011 compact impact costs and corrected its reporting error  regarding the number of compact students for 2006 through 2008. In  addition, the Department of Health said that the Tuberculosis Branch  changed its methodology and the Family Health Services Division  changed its presentation of the data to show excluded federal funds.

To determine whether additional data on  the compact migrants\u2019 role in the economy exist, we contacted agencies  from affected jurisdictions that address labor and taxation and reviewed  reports and data sets. These sources of additional information and data  include the following:  \uf0b7  To describe compact migrant health status and the health and  education systems in the FAS, we reviewed and summarized  published literature.  \uf0b7  To describe compact migrants\u2019 contributions to the labor market in the  CNMI, we analyzed data from the CNMI Department of Finance for  2001 through 2009, comparing the size of the compact migrant labor  force to the size of the overall CNMI labor force and the income of the  compact migrants to that of the general population.  \uf0b7  To compare the amount of taxes paid by compact migrants with the  amount paid by the general population in Guam, we used data from  the 2008 and 2009 Guam Annual Census of Establishments, the 2008  and 2009 Guam Current Employment Reports, the 2008 Guam  Statistical Yearbook, and the 2008 migrant survey. These data  allowed us to estimate under certain assumptions the number of  compact migrants and others working in the private and public  sectors, their average wages, and taxes paid. The method we used  to prepare this estimate drew on a method first outlined by an official  in the Guam Bureau of Statistics and Plans.  \uf0b7  To estimate the amount of remittances that migrants sent and  received while in the U.S. areas, we analyzed data from the Inter- American Dialogue, the fiscal year 2008 Economic Reviews of the  FSM and the Marshall Islands, and data reported in the 2008 report of  the 2003 survey.

Several local government reporting  agencies that responded to our inquiries did not define compact migrants  according to the criteria in the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation  and, as a result, may have either overcounted or undercounted costs.  The legislation defines the population to be enumerated as persons, or  those persons\u2019 children under the age of 18, who pursuant to the  compacts are admitted to, or resident in, an affected jurisdiction as of the  date of the most recently published enumeration. By counting compact  migrants based on their ethnicity or language, agencies may have  overcounted by including those present prior to the compacts; by  identifying compact migrants by their citizenship, agencies may have  undercounted, because they would have excluded compact migrants\u2019  U.S.-born children under the age of 18. For example, school  administrative data from each of the affected jurisdictions show a  potential for overcounting by identifying compact migrant children by  means of ethnicity (as in Guam and the CNMI) or the language spoken at  home (as in Hawaii). According to the 2003 Census survey data,  approximately 32 percent of FAS citizens identified in the CNMI, 10  percent of those identified in Guam, and 13 percent of those identified in  Hawaii were not part of the defined impact population. Therefore, the  number of children used to estimate impacts may also be overstated.", "Federal funding. Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI, among other U.S. states  and territories, receive federal funding for programs that compact  migrants use; however, not all compact impact reports accounted for this  stream of funding. For example, the Hawaii Department of Education  reported as compact impact the cost of programs that federal funding had  partially addressed. In addition, Guam and the CNMI\u2019s single audit  reports show that these jurisdictions have received federal revenue from  various agencies such as the U.S. departments of Health and Human  Services (HHS), Agriculture, and Homeland Security. To the extent that  revenue for these programs is based on population counts or data on  usage, the presence of, and use of services by, compact migrants lead to  federal offsets. For example, in fiscal years 2004 through 2008, Guam  received an annual average of $1,027,825 from HHS for the Consolidated  Health Centers program, an amount based partly on the number of  beneficiaries in Guam. Based on Guam\u2019s resident and compact migrant  populations in 2008, services to compact migrants accounted for a  $112,942 share of that amount\u2014equal to 16 percent of compact migrant  impact costs reported by the Guam Bureau of Primary Care Services.  However, in reporting impact costs, the Guam Bureau of Primary Care  Services did not deduct the HHS funding that was used for compact  migrants.", "Revenue. Multiple local government agencies that receive fees as a  result of providing services to compact migrants did not consider them in  their compact impact reports. For example, the CNMI Department of  Public Health and Guam Department of Mental Health and Substance  Abuse did not include payments received from compact migrants into  their costs. This exclusion of revenue may cause an overstatement of the  total impact reported.", "Capital costs. Many local government agencies, such as the CNMI  Public School System, did not include capital costs in their annual  compact impact reporting. This exclusion can cause an understatement of  total costs of providing services to compact migrants.", "Per person costs. Many local government agencies estimated impact  costs based on average, rather than specific, costs of providing services  to compact migrants, possibly leading to under or overestimations. For  example, the CNMI Department of Public Health based the cost of  providing healthcare services to compact migrants on the number served  out of the total patient load instead of totaling each patient\u2019s specific  costs. However, other agencies more comprehensively accounted for  costs by including additional compact impact expenses beyond the  average costs. For example, the Hawaii Department of Education  included language training costs in its reported per pupil expenditures.  Alternatively, the CNMI Public School system did not include special  services such as language training or translation which suggests an  underestimation.", "Discretionary costs. Some compact impact costs reported by local  government agencies were for benefits or services provided at the  discretion of the affected jurisdiction.", "Data reliability. In one case, we found a discrepancy between the data  reported and the data provided during this review. According to the  Hawaii Department of Education, this discrepancy resulted from a system  error that caused a double counting of Marshallese students over a 5- year period, which resulted in an overestimation of impact costs. For its  2011 impact report, the Department of Education said it excluded federal  funds from its 2008 through 2011 compact impact costs and corrected the  reporting error made regarding the number of compact students for 2006  through 2008.", "Many local government agencies did not report their methodologies for  estimating costs of providing services to compact migrants under the  compacts. For example, the Hawaii Department of Human Services did  not provide a detailed description of how it derived its estimates. As a  result, it is difficult to determine whether the reported figures are accurate.  Further, some agency methodologies vary between affected jurisdictions.  For example, Guam prorates police costs based on the percentage of  compact migrants in the total population, and the CNMI prorates its police  costs based on the percentage of total arrests that are FAS citizens. The  Guam Bureau of Statistics and Plans said it documented its  methodologies in its 1995 compact impact report and applied these  approaches in calculating its compact impact costs. However, these  methodologies were not discussed in Guam\u2019s annual reports from 2004 to  2010 and were generally not used by the reporting agencies.", "Hawaii has not submitted annual compact impact reporting each year and  is not required to do so, but for those years when affected jurisdictions  submitted impact reports to Interior, not all local government agencies  included all compact impact costs. However, some agency costs were  reported in subsequent fiscal year reports. For example, Hawaii did not  provide estimated costs to Interior in 2005 and 2006, although it included  partial costs incurred in those years in its 2007 and 2008 reports. Without  comprehensive data in the year they are submitted, the compact impact  reports could understate Hawaii\u2019s total costs. In addition, compact impact  reporting has not been consistent across affected jurisdictions.

An official at Interior said the  agency uses the same grant management process for compact impact  funds as it does its other grants. To implement these requirements,  Interior has reviewed and at times questioned whether the proposed uses  of compact impact grant funds were in keeping with the amended  compacts\u2019 enabling legislation.", "While the vast majority of Interior reviews resulted in approvals, Interior  questioned some uses in Guam and the CNMI. Specifically:  Interior initially viewed Guam\u2019s fiscal 2010 request to fund a  Community Pool Complex and Fitness Trail as only distantly  connected to compact migrants. Ultimately, Interior accepted Guam\u2019s  justification that it could improve the health of migrants by reducing  obesity and provide a healthy outlet for youth, thereby reducing public  safety concerns.", "In fiscal year 2011, Interior approved the use of compact impact grant  funds for Guam Memorial Hospital Authority (GMHA), but restricted  their use to future purchases rather than paying past bills, contrary to  previous Interior practice. According to an Interior official, this change  was made in order to strengthen the link between migrant impacts  and compact funds and to stop \u201cbandaging\u201d the chronic financial  issues of GMHA.", "In fiscal year 2006, Interior denied a CNMI grant proposal to use  $400,000 for the Marianas Visitors Authority and $500,000 for  Financial Control/Economic Recovery Initiatives.

The Department of the Interior suggested that our report\u2019s use of the  terms \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201creimbursement\u201d to describe compact  impact funds could give the impression that these funds were  intended to fully reimburse the affected jurisdictions for their added  expenses when the amended compacts' enabling legislation states  that compact impact grants are \u201cto aid in defraying costs incurred by  affected jurisdictions as a result of increased demands placed on  health, educational, social, or public safety services or infrastructure  related to such services due to the residence in affected jurisdictions\u201d  of compact migrants. We have modified the text to make our  characterization of the act\u2019s intent clearer. Also in response to this  comment, as well as comments received from Guam, we have cited  additional provisions of the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation  that authorize funds to address compact impact. As the affected  jurisdictions may view the law as implying a reimbursement, we have  kept such a characterization when it reflects the viewpoint of the  affected jurisdiction.   2.  The Department of the Interior stated that the record of the compact  negotiations, the compact agreements, and the amended compacts\u2019  implementing legislation do not support the use of sector grants to  provide assistance to FAS expatriates living in affected jurisdictions.  Interior stated that the compact provides sector grants to support FAS  government activities in-country and that the few training programs  taking place outside of the FAS are the result of the FAS  governments\u2019 choices in the use of sector grants. We agree with  Interior that the sector grants listed in the compacts are to support the  governments of the FSM and the Marshall Islands by providing grants  in certain sectors such as health care and education; however, we  note that the compacts allow grants to fund other sectors as mutually  agreed and we have added this text to our description of compact  economic assistance. Currently, limited FSM compact grant funds are  being used to support worker training in Guam, addressing a concern  of compact migrants in Guam as well as the Guam government.  According to the Center for Micronesian Empowerment,  approximately 45 percent of its trainees in Guam are compact  migrants residing in Guam.  3.  The Department of the Interior did not agree with our recommendation  that it work with affected jurisdictions to evaluate the current use of  compact impact grant funds and consider alternative uses. Interior  observed that the amended compacts' enabling legislation authorizes  broad uses and that it has chosen to respect the priorities of  governors. Interior further stated that it does not believe there would  be any practical gains from proposing alternative uses. We believe  this position overlooks opportunities to respect the priorities of the  governors while at the same time working with the governors to  review their current use of funds and consider alternatives uses. In the  course of our review we identified alternative grant uses for  consideration. We found that government officials, service providers,  and compact migrants in the affected jurisdictions identified a  significant need for language and cultural assistance, job training, and  improved access to basic services for compact migrants. The sources  suggested that migrant needs could be addressed by, for example,  establishing centers that offer such services. This may also help  reduce some of the negative impact from compact migration. For  example, more translators could result in more effective health  treatment.", "Other alternative uses may also offer practical gains. For example,  health experts have advocated for the adoption of primary health care  as a more cost-effective strategy for providing health care in the  Pacific Islands. This adoption would address the need for preventive  care among Micronesians and Marshallese in Hawaii\u2014studies have  shown that the Marshallese in Hawaii do not generally seek  preventive care and only seek professional health care when they  experience a certain level of pain.  4.  The Department of the Interior stated that it believes compact sector  grants are limited to use within the FAS; however, Interior agreed that  some activities may be related both to sector grant priorities and to  programs that would better prepare migrants to live and work in the  United States. Interior stated that our report implies that compact  sector grant funds should be shifted from providing assistance to the  FAS governments to providing assistance to FAS citizens living in  affected jurisdictions, an action that Interior sees as inconsistent with  the compacts and their enabling legislation. We expect that compact  sector grant awards will be provided consistent with the terms of the  compacts and the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation; we do not  intend to imply that funds should be shifted from the FAS  governments to FAS migrants. In response to Interior\u2019s concern, we  clarified that our findings and recommendation highlight the  opportunity for the joint management committees to consider the use  of sector grants to the FSM and Marshall Islands in ways that address  the concerns of FAS citizens\u2014whether they are in the FAS or in U.S.  areas\u2014and the concerns of the affected jurisdictions. The  recommendation supports consideration of the use of sector grants in  ways that respond to the concerns of FSM and Marshall Islands  migrants and the affected jurisdictions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Census Bureau", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  Census emphasized that the migrant survey content was purposely  chosen to enumerate compact migrants while minimizing costs and  maximizing respondent participation. As our report notes, however,  collecting only those data needed to enumerate migrants limited the  collection of data that stakeholders such as affected jurisdictions  would have found useful.  2.  Census stated that, in contrast to our report\u2019s findings, the 2008  Guam and CNMI surveys were designed to produce estimates with a  similar coefficient of variation to the ACS estimates for Hawaii.  However, the 2008 Guam and CNMI estimates are point-in-time  estimates while the ACS is a multiyear estimate. As Census guidance  on interpreting the ACS multiyear estimates states, \u201cThe ACS  estimates the average of a characteristic over the year or period  years, as opposed to the characteristic at a point in time\u201d and \u201cWhen  comparing estimates across geographies or subpopulations, users  should compare the same period length for each estimate.\u201d Our  findings do not suggest that the 2008 Guam and CNMI surveys are  not comparable with the ACS estimates for Hawaii in terms of  reliability, but rather are not comparable in terms of their sampling  methods and reporting period. We show that the estimates have  similar relative errors, as presented in appendix V. If the reported  precision for the Guam and CNMI surveys is accurately estimated,  and includes proxy respondents, the estimates have similar levels of  precision.  3.  Census recommended that the Department of the Interior adopt the  two-pronged approach described in our report for the 2013  enumeration of compact migrants and stated that the approach would  provide cost-effective required estimates. We agree that the low cost  is a strength of this approach. As our report notes, however, the 2013  two-pronged approach will have limitations such as using data from  different time periods, limited comparability with prior data, and limited  collection of demographic data.  4.  Census referred to a footnote in our draft report that indicated that the  homeless population was not represented in the 2008 surveys. We  have moved this discussion to appendix V and included an  assessment of the varying coverage of the homeless population of the  2003 snowball, ACS, and 2008 migrant survey in Guam and the  CNMI.  5.  Census disagreed with our statement that the effect of using an earlier  time frame of data in Hawaii relative to Guam and the CNMI results in  an undercount of compact migrants in Hawaii relative to Guam and  the CNMI. However, as our report notes, migration is ongoing, with  approximately 7,000 persons estimated to have left the FSM and the  Marshall Islands in 2007 and 2008. Other available data also indicate  that the migrant population is growing. Because the Hawaii data do  not include 2008 and the Guam and CNMI data are from the closing  months of 2008, nearly a year of additional migration is captured in  the Guam and CNMI totals that is not included in the Hawaii ACS  data. Alexander and Navarro (2003) show that even the upper bound  of the ACS multiyear confidence interval, an amount that is greater  than the estimate, can lag behind the actual value for a growing small  population at a given point in time.  6.  Census stated that the frequent changing of address by the compact  migrant population, cited by Guam and CNMI officials as potentially  leading to a miscount, would not produce bias in the surveys as  designed. We agree with Census\u2019 comment that inaccurate migrant  counts in the sample design would lead to lack of efficiency and not  bias. However, we note that researchers inside and outside the  Census Bureau studying the foreign-born population agreed that an  assumption of complete coverage of legal immigrants and temporary  migrants in the 2000 Census was unreasonable indicating the  potential for coverage error and bias of the estimates based on the  2000 Census sampling frame. Further, migrants, especially those who  frequently change address, are not only hard to count in the census,  but they also are less likely to participate in other surveys, indicating  the potential for nonresponse bias. Census further stated that it gave  both Guam and CNMI an opportunity to provide local information that  might improve the accuracy but that neither produced this information  before the design had to be finalized. However, we note that both  Guam and CNMI officials stated that, from their perspective,  implementation of the survey was rushed and they had only limited  opportunity to provide such input.  7.  Regarding our statement about the change in enumeration method  limiting the comparability of the 2008 and 2013 enumerations, Census  stated that both methods would provide a comparable count, which is  what is required for the purpose of determining funding. We note that  the estimates across jurisdictions, within an enumeration, are not  comparable. We note that estimates across enumerations are not  comparable due to changing methodology and the lack of use of a  method that is statistically designed to measure change over time.  8.  Census asserted that its varying estimates of compact migrants in  Arkansas are not based on the same criteria and therefore should not  be compared. We agree that the surveys have different bases for  identification and have identified several reasons for these differences  in appendix IV. However, we have also noted Arkansas\u2019 concerns  about the accuracy of the ACS data.  9.  Census disagreed with our observation that the ACS was not  designed to make estimates of a population as small as the compact  migrants and notes that concluding that the ACS cannot provide  reliable estimates depends on which definition of \u201creliable\u201d is used.  We note that the Census Bureau did not determine the level of  precision, or reliability, necessary for these estimates to be used for  funding. As we show in appendix III, while the ACS can be used to  detect the presence of compact migrants, the smaller the population,  the less reliable the estimates will be, as indicated by the wide  confidence intervals. In some cases, the estimates are so unreliable  that we suppressed them.  10. In response to our observation that Census did not provide an  unweighted response rate, Census stated that it is not usual for the  agency to publish unweighted response rates. Our review of OMB  Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys indicates that both  unweighted and weighted response rates should be calculated and  reported. However, an unweighted response rate was not provided in  Census Survey Documentation that we received for review.  11. Census disagreed with our statement that the use of proxy  respondents indicates an overstatement of the response rate and  asserts that proxy responses are generally accepted in household  surveys and included in the response rate. Proxy respondents are  substitutions for the intended sample member, and Census  acknowledged that proxy responses are a potential source of  nonsampling error due to the proxy respondent\u2019s potential lack of  knowledge of the sample respondent\u2019s information. OMB guidelines  and standards call for the calculation of response rates without  substitutions, as well as overall response rates that include  substitutions.  12. Census stated that the issues of nonresponse bias, as well as  collection strategy and content, that we highlight regarding the 2008  survey effort were also present in the 2003 survey but are not listed  for the 2003 survey. For the 2003 survey, we had no documentation  of the nonresponse bias or the collection strategy and content  information related to personal interviewers leaving contact  information. We have noted Census\u2019s comments in the report.  13. Census stated that final weights were used when calculating the  variance estimates. While we acknowledge that final weights,  including a nonresponse adjustment factor, were used when  calculating variances, Census documentation does not indicate that  variance estimates properly accounted for the variability due to the  nonresponse adjustment factor, such as through the use of replicate  weight methodologies, and thus will likely result in an underestimate  of the variance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the Government of Hawaii", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The government of Hawaii stated that while the report sets out relative  strengths and weaknesses of the different enumeration  methodologies, it does not highlight the inherent inadequacies of the  American Community Survey (ACS) for enumeration of small discrete  groups such as compact migrants.

We further note in appendix V that ACS estimates are not  equivalent to point-in-time estimates and may be biased due to  nonresponse and coverage error.  2.  The government of Hawaii stated that the report does not point out the  discrepancies between the Census estimates in each affected  jurisdiction and the utilization data for services provided by agencies  in each jurisdiction, such as the number of compact migrant students  enrolled in school. We did explore the use of school data in particular  as a basis for evaluating the enumeration findings; however, we found  that the schools identified compact migrant students by language (as  in Hawaii) or ethnicity (as in Guam and the CNMI). These definitions  do not match that contained in the amended compacts' enabling  legislation and could include the children of persons with FAS  ethnicity who were present in Hawaii prior to the compacts or the  children of persons who were born in U.S. areas. For this reason,  although they are informative in a general way, the difference  between the school data and the enumeration data could result from  methodological differences as well as from any potential miscount in  the enumeration.  3.  The government of Hawaii stated that it agrees that a portion of the  sector grants given to the FAS might more effectively be used to  provide services to compact citizens living in the affected jurisdictions  and that the affected jurisdictions should provide input into the uses of  the grants. In response to other comments, we clarified our  recommendation regarding compact sector grants to not imply that the  use of sector grants to address migration concerns should be in the  affected jurisdictions.
