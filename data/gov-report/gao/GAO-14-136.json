These insurers provide coverage for risks that the traditional, or admitted, insurance market is unwilling or unable to cover. Historically, insurance brokers who sell such coverage have found it to be time consuming and often difficult to allocate state taxes brokers collect and remit on insurance premiums on behalf of policyholders when the risks covered reside in multiple states. To help address this issue, Congress passed NRRA as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.", "The act mandates GAO study changes in the surplus lines insurance market. This report (1) describes the size and condition of the surplus lines insurance market and (2) examines actions states have taken to implement NRRA's provisions and the effects of the act, if any, on the price and availability of coverage. To address these questions, GAO analyzed end-of-year financial data for 2008 through 2012 for insurers who sold surplus lines insurance in 2012 and interviewed insurance regulators from states with a large number of surplus lines insurers, industry associations representing interests in the surplus lines market, and large insurers and brokers. GAO also reviewed related studies and analyses.", "In commenting on a draft of the report, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Surplus lines insurers' premiums written have increased modestly and the companies have generally remained profitable. From 2008 through 2012 premiums written by surplus lines insurers, who sell property/casualty insurance through brokers in states where they are not licensed, grew slightly from $24.8 billion to $25.2 billion and remained stable at around 5 percent of the property casualty market as a whole. Over this time, surplus lines insurers' premiums generally exceeded their claims and underwriting expenses and they remained profitable. Surplus lines insurers also saw capital gains over this period.", "Almost all states have modified their laws to implement at least portions of the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (NRRA). In 2010, Congress passed the act, which supporters argued would make it easier for surplus lines insurers and brokers conducting business across states. Under NRRA, only the \"home state\" of the insured--the state where the insured maintains its principal business or residence or, if the risk is 100 percent outside that state, the state to which the greatest percentage of the insured's taxable premium is allocated--may tax or regulate surplus lines insurance transactions. According to market participants GAO interviewed, the changes in states' laws have simplified compliance for multistate risks. While most home states are collecting and retaining 100 percent of premium taxes, a few states are participating in a tax-sharing agreement, as permitted under NRRA. According to industry associations, including those whom GAO interviewed, some states are making additional requests of surplus lines insurers beyond the requirements specified in NRRA. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners formed a subgroup to address this issue and in August 2013 issued options for improving compliance. Market participants said that NRRA has had little, if any, effect on the prices or availability of coverage, as this was not an intent of the act. The participants said that the insurance business cycles are primarily responsible for any changes in prices and availability. According to surplus lines insurers that GAO contacted, NRRA has caused little noticeable shifting in coverage between the admitted and surplus lines markets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The surplus lines insurance market is a critical component of the larger  property/casualty (P/C) insurance market because it can provide  insurance coverage for risks that traditional insurers, sometimes referred  to as admitted insurers, are unwilling or unable to cover. In 2012, the  premiums for such coverage totaled over $25 billion. The risks covered  can include those with potentially catastrophic property damage and  liability associated with high-hazard products, special events,  environmental impairment, and employment practices, among others.  While admitted insurers must be licensed in the states where they sell  insurance, surplus lines insurers must be licensed in only one state but  may sell in others where they are not, provided they are authorized  according to the states\u2019 surplus lines laws. In the surplus lines market,  specialized insurance brokers typically seek coverage on behalf of clients.  Unlike the insurers themselves, these brokers must be licensed to sell  insurance in every state where they operate and must have a special  license to operate in the surplus lines market.", "In some cases, the risks that surplus lines insurers cover are spread  across several states. Each of these states can tax premium income at a  different rate, and historically it has often been difficult and time  consuming for brokers to determine how to apportion premium taxes and  determine which tax rates to apply. Also, some states have had differing  requirements for brokers with respect to providing important information  to policyholders, determining that a risk could not be placed with a  traditional insurer before allowing use of a surplus lines insurer, and  determining which insurers were eligible as surplus lines insurers. Surplus  lines brokers have cited these differences as challenges brokers face in  complying with state surplus lines regulations. To address these issues,  Congress passed the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010  (NRRA) as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). In enacting NRRA, Congress sought to  streamline the process for taxing multistate risks, make it easier to access  the surplus lines market, and create uniform standards for regulating  surplus lines insurers.", "NRRA also mandates that GAO study the legislation\u2019s effect on the  admitted and nonadmitted markets\u2014specifically, surplus lines coverage.  This report (1) describes the size and condition of the surplus lines  market and (2) examines actions states have taken to implement NRRA\u2019s  provisions and describes the effects of the act, if any, on the price and  availability of insurance coverage in the surplus lines market.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed end-of-year financial and  corporate data for 2008 through 2012 on all surplus lines insurers and the  surplus lines and P/C industries obtained from SNL Financial, A.M. Best,  National Association of Professional Surplus Lines Offices (NAPSLO),  and National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). We  identified a population of 199 surplus lines insurers that operated in  calendar year 2012 based on documentation from NAIC. These insurers  were eligible or approved to sell surplus lines insurance in 2012 and  actually did sell it in that year. We did not include risk retention groups in  our study population because the nonadmitted insurance reforms of  NRRA specifically excluded these groups. We also obtained and  examined states\u2019 lists of eligible surplus lines insurers from state  departments of insurance, state surplus lines associations, and NAIC. We  interviewed officials with NAIC and the Federal Insurance Office (FIO).  We also interviewed several market participants, including surplus lines  insurers and their corporate parents; two large brokers; representatives of  multiple industry associations representing brokers, insurers,  underwriters, managing general agents, and actuaries; and state  insurance regulators and stamping offices. We selected these  organizations for interviews based on each having a role in the surplus  lines market. To assess issues related to data reliability, we reviewed  related documentation, conducted interviews with knowledgeable officials,  and reviewed previous related reliability assessments GAO had  conducted of these data and determined that no material changes had  been made in how the data were collected and tabulated. We determined  that, for the purpose of describing the size and condition of the surplus  lines insurance market, for this review, the data were sufficiently reliable.  We also reviewed past GAO work and the work of others who have  examined surplus lines and related insurance markets.

Admitted insurers can sell insurance in one or more states but  must be licensed to operate in every state in which they sell coverage.  Their activities are regulated primarily by the states, which make and  enforce their own laws and regulations. State regulators license agents,  review insurance products and premium rates, and examine insurers\u2019  financial solvency and market conduct.

They collected $293.9  billion in premiums in 1998 and $523.9 billion in 2012. Compared to the  liabilities held by life insurers, their liabilities tend to be fairly short-term,  so they generally invest in a mix of relatively low-risk, liquid, conservative  instruments, such as government and municipal bonds, higher-grade  corporate bonds, short-term securities, and cash. State regulators require  admitted insurance companies to maintain specific levels of capital in  order to continue to conduct business. To help ensure that policyholders  continue to receive coverage if their insurer becomes insolvent or unable  to meet its liabilities, states have guaranty funds (separate for life and P/C  insurance), which are funded by assessments on insurers doing business  in their state. All states have laws that permit surplus lines insurers to  sell coverage in their states, but do not cover their policies with state  guaranty funds (which are funded by assessments on admitted insurers  doing business in their state), leaving policyholders unprotected if their  surplus lines insurer becomes insolvent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Nonadmitted Insurance Market and Surplus Lines Insurers", "paragraphs": ["P/C insurers provide coverage for numerous property and casualty risks,  but there are some risks that they will not cover\u2014for instance, risks that  are difficult to assess, occur too frequently to be acceptable to admitted  insurers, are specialized or unusual, or require coverage that exceeds the  capacity of admitted carriers. In these cases, potential insureds may turn  to the nonadmitted market. This market functions as a safety valve,  offering insurance products for risks that the admitted market will not  cover.", "Among the nonadmitted insurers are surplus lines insurers. These  insurers provide coverage for general, management, and professional  liabilities and commercial automobile, environmental, and property risks,  among other things, and tailor their products to meet the needs of the  insured. For example, they may write policies to cover a research  laboratory working on an unproven drug, special sporting or other events,  or liabilities arising from environmental impairment. They may also write  policies on new and innovative products that have little loss history\u2014 something admitted insurers would typically require in order to adequately  price the risk. Some of the carriers also write coverage for personal lines,  such as homeowners insurance in catastrophe-prone areas. Figure 1  shows that over the 5-year period from 2008 through 2012, these insurers  provided relatively larger amounts of coverage for commercial lines and  property liabilities, with lesser amounts of coverage for reinsurance and  personal lines. There was also a sizeable amount of coverage provided  by companies writing less than $1 million in premiums where the liabilities  covered were not clearly identified.", "Surplus lines insurers have more flexibility with respect to the terms and  pricing of the coverage offered because, according to NAIC, unlike  admitted insurers, they do not need state approval to modify policy  exclusions and coverages. This flexibility to tailor the coverage provided  and the price at which they provide it enables nonadmitted insurers to  manage unique or large risks.", "Surplus lines insurers can be domiciled\u2014that is, headquartered\u2014either in  the United States or abroad. Those domiciled in the U.S and licensed in  at least one U.S. state are known as \u201cforeign\u201d insurers in states other than  their state of domicile, while those domiciled in a foreign country are  known as \u201calien\u201d insurers. A foreign surplus lines insurer is regulated as  an admitted insurer in the state in which it is domiciled, and that state is  its financial solvency regulator. Alien insurers wishing to enter the U.S.  surplus lines market must apply to NAIC\u2019s International Insurers  Department (IID) for inclusion in the Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers,  which reviews their financial condition as part of the alien insurer  application process. These insurers then become an eligible surplus lines  insurer in all states. Alien insurers may also apply to an individual state to  become authorized only in that jurisdiction. Table 3 in appendix II lists the  alien insurers approved by NAIC from 2008 through 2012, and table 4  shows their location\u2014mostly in England and Bermuda.", "Surplus lines insurers must sell their insurance through a broker. These  brokers are licensed retail agents that represent insurance buyers and  place coverage with surplus lines insurers. They are responsible for (1)  selecting an eligible surplus lines insurer, (2) reporting the surplus lines  transaction to insurance regulators, (3) remitting the premium tax due on  the transaction to state tax authorities, and (4) assuring compliance with  all the requirements of the surplus lines state regulations. To place  coverage in the surplus lines market, brokers must follow state due  diligence requirements. Although they vary from state to state, according  to an association representing surplus lines insurers and brokers, these  requirements generally call for brokers to establish that three admitted  companies licensed to write the kind and type of insurance requested  have declined to provide it before turning to a surplus lines insurer.", "Historically, brokers and the surplus lines insurers have had to comply  with a multitude of state laws and regulations dealing with taxation,  oversight, and market access. For example, brokers have had to comply  with differing rules across states for things like providing policyholders  with important notices and determining which insurers were eligible for  placing business.

The act creates a \u201chome-state\u201d  system of taxation and regulation to resolve difficulties in determining how  to tax and regulate surplus lines transactions. NRRA defines the home  state as the state in which the insured maintains its principal place of  business, or in the case of an individual, the individual\u2019s principal  residence. If all the insured risk is outside this state, NRRA defines the  home state as the state to which the greatest percentage of taxable  premium taxed for that insurance contract is allocated. Under NRRA, the  home state has sole and exclusive authority to tax and regulate a sale of  surplus lines insurance. In addition, only the insured\u2019s home state may  require a surplus lines broker to be licensed, even for transactions that  involve multiple states. NRRA also permits but does not require states to  form an interstate compact or otherwise establish procedures to allocate  premium taxes collected by an insured\u2019s home state for transactions.  These compacts, if instituted, are intended to help states adopt  nationwide uniform requirements, forms, and procedures for reporting,  paying, collecting, and allocating premium taxes.", "NRRA further seeks to simplify and make more uniform the criteria states  use to determine which insurers can be eligible to sell insurance on a  surplus lines basis. Specifically, NRRA states that a state may not impose  eligibility requirements on or establish eligibility criteria for surplus lines  insurers domiciled in the United States that are authorized to write  policies in their state of domicile. The act also states that the insurer  generally must maintain minimum capital and surplus levels as required  by NAIC\u2019s Non-Admitted Insurance Model Act, which is the greater of $15  million or the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the insured\u2019s  home state, or in certain situations, less than the minimum capital and  surplus when a state\u2019s insurance commissioner finds an insurer  acceptable. This model act, among other things, is intended to protect  persons seeking insurance, assure such insurance is placed only with  reputable and financially sound insurers, and establish state regulation of  surplus lines insurance. NRRA also specifies that a state may not prohibit  a broker from placing surplus lines insurance with an alien insurer listed  on NAIC\u2019s Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers. Under NRRA, Congress  delegated to NAIC responsibility for reviewing and approving the financial  information of alien surplus lines insurers. Finally, NRRA contains a  provision specifying that, after July 21, 2012, a state may not collect any  fees for licensing a surplus lines broker unless it participates in NAIC\u2019s  national producer database or an equivalent.", "Although NAIC does not regulate admitted or surplus lines insurers,  according to NAIC officials it does provide services designed to make  certain interactions between insurers and regulators more efficient.

As a result, surplus lines insurers also saw growth in capital holdings.", "From 2008 to 2012, premiums written by the population of surplus lines  insurers that we examined rose modestly, mirroring trends in the overall  P/C market. While the total amount of premiums written (the sum of  premiums written by the surplus insurers on an admitted basis in their  states of domicile and on a surplus lines basis) declined following the  2008 financial crisis in both markets, it began increasing in 2011 and  continued to rise through 2012.

Surplus lines  premiums, which account for a small fraction of this overall P/C market,  declined slightly as a share of total P/C premiums in 2009 and 2010 but  began rising in 2011. In 2012, they accounted for 4.8 percent of the  overall P/C market (see fig. 2).", "According to market analyses and surplus lines insurers and  representatives of industry we interviewed, surplus lines premiums can  fall for several reasons, including an overall slowdown in the economy  and a \u201csoft\u201d insurance market, which tends to occur after losses have  been relatively low. Economic slowdowns or downturns, such as the one  during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, can result in fewer new business  ventures of the type that would use surplus lines insurance. And in a  softening insurance market, generally after losses have been relatively  low, admitted insurers are often willing to write higher-risk coverage for  lower prices\u2014coverage that might at another time be written by surplus  lines insurers. In contrast, during a \u201chard\u201d insurance market, generally  after losses have been higher, admitted insurers are often less willing to  write high-risk coverage, and surplus lines insurers are more likely to step  in to write such coverage. With the U.S. economy in recovery, pricing  evidence suggests that since 2010 insurance markets have likely been  hardening, creating a flow of business from the admitted market into the  surplus lines market. Consistent with this trend, insurers that sell surplus  lines coverage saw the proportion of their total premiums from surplus  lines transactions increase slightly in 2011 and 2012, rising from 63.9  percent to 65.3 percent.", "Most of the largest surplus lines insurers sell surplus lines coverage  almost exclusively, while smaller insurers that sell this coverage write  most of their premiums in the admitted market. Because U.S. surplus line  insurers are licensed as admitted insurers in their states of domicile, they  may sell some coverage on an admitted basis (see table 5 in app. III). Of  the top 25 surplus lines insurers as measured by total premiums written  (both admitted and surplus lines), 20 wrote over 98 percent of their  premiums as surplus lines in 2012, on average. Only three wrote less  than 95 percent. By comparison, the remaining smaller surplus lines  insurers received on average 38.9 percent of their premiums from the  surplus lines business during this period.", "Since 2008, the list of top 25 surplus lines insurers has remained largely  unchanged, and these insurers have sold the bulk of surplus lines  coverage. Most of the top 25 insurers from 2012 were also among the top  insurers from 2008 through 2011 and in 2012 wrote about $16.9 billion in  surplus lines premiums, or about 66.9 percent of the market (see fig. 2).  The largest five surplus lines insurers each wrote over $1 billion in  premiums, with the largest U.S. based surplus lines insurer, Lexington  Insurance, writing $4.2 billion in premiums in 2012. Lloyd\u2019s of London,  which is licensed as an admitted carrier in Illinois, Kentucky, and the U.S.  Virgin Islands, is the largest surplus lines insurer and wrote $6.3 billion in  surplus lines premiums in 2012, or about 25 percent of the total 2012  premiums written for all U.S. based surplus lines insurers. Lloyd\u2019s surplus  lines premiums are written primarily to cover property exposures, and in  2012 their share of the surplus lines market premium was largest in  Texas (30 percent) and South Carolina (29 percent) and was at least 20  percent each in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and North  Carolina. Table 6 in appendix III includes detailed information about  premiums written by the top 25 surplus lines insurers.", "A majority of surplus lines premiums were written in a small number of  states. For example, from 2010 through 2012 just under half of the  surplus lines premiums written in the United States were written in 4  states, and almost two-thirds of the premiums were written in 10 states  (see table 7 in app. III).

Underwriting expenses are those incurred by an insurer as it  obtains business, such as brokers\u2019 commissions, employee incentive  programs, and marketing.

According to our review of state  insurance laws in all 50 states, as of December 2013, all states except  Michigan have amended their laws to address this provision, which  regulators and market participants we spoke with consider to be the key  provision of NRRA. We found that the states had largely adopted a  definition of the home state that closely matched the term as defined in  NRRA\u2014that is, the state in which the insured maintains its principal place  of business or residence or, if all the risk resides outside that state, the  state to which the greatest percentage of taxable premium is allocated for  that insurance contract. According to officials of an association  representing surplus lines insurers and brokers, the home state provision  has produced significant benefits for the surplus lines industry by  reducing the need for insurers to comply with differing sets of rules,  disclosures, and requirements. As shown in figure 7, the act has also  simplified the payment of premium taxes for transactions involving a  multistate risk. Most market participants we interviewed agreed that the  home state provision has brought needed clarity to the market.", "Under the home state system, as an option for collecting and allocating  premium taxes, NRRA permitted but did not require states to form an  interstate compact or otherwise establish procedures to allocate premium  taxes paid to a home state. These compacts, if instituted, were intended  to help states adopt nationwide uniform requirements, forms, and  procedures for reporting, paying, collecting, and allocating premium taxes  for multistate risks. To date, only a few states have chosen to participate  in an interstate compact. Two compacts exist, but only one was  operational as of November 2013. The operational compact, called the  Nonadmitted Insurance Multi-State Agreement (NIMA), includes five  participating states\u2014Florida, Louisiana, South Dakota, Utah, and  Wyoming\u2014and Puerto Rico (fig. 8). The other compact is the Surplus  Lines Insurance Multi-State Compliance Compact (SLIMPACT). It  comprises nine states\u2014Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, New  Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Vermont\u2014but  requires 10 states (or 40 percent of surplus lines premiums written),  whichever comes first\u2014to take effect. Having not reached the minimum  threshold, SLIMPACT is not currently operational.", "Rather than joining an interstate compact, most states have opted to levy  (at their own state tax rate) and then retain 100 percent of the premium  tax when they are the home state of the insured (see fig. 8). Although  data were unavailable to analyze the net effect on taxes of states  adopting this approach, representatives from two industry associations  we spoke with have expressed support for it because of its simplicity and  view it as most consistent with the intent of NRRA.", "Market participants, such as surplus lines insurers, and representatives of  the industry associations we interviewed said that a state\u2019s decision of  whether to join a compact depended largely on the amount of revenue  involved. One analysis of the tax-sharing effect of NIMA, performed by an  association representing surplus lines insurers and brokers, showed that  a small amount of tax revenue, roughly $125,000 across the participating  states, was eligible for sharing among NIMA\u2019s members. The largest  states in terms of premium, such as California, New York, and Texas, are  currently not members of an interstate compact. Rather, these states tax  and retain 100 percent of premium when they are the home state of the  insured, as discussed above. Market participants told us it is unlikely  these large states would join an interstate compact because they stand to  collect more revenue by using their current approach rather than by  joining an interstate compact. In addition, states apply a range of tax rates  to both single and multistate risks when they are the home state of the  insured (see table 9 in app. IV). For example, some states will use the tax  rate in their own state, while others will use the applicable tax rate from  the respective states where each portion of the multistate risk resides.", "In addition, according to NAIC, all states except for Washington are now  participating in its national insurance producer database for licensing  surplus lines brokers, which NRRA made a prerequisite for collecting fees  for licensing an individual or entity as a surplus lines broker. The  database contains information on insurance producers\u2019 (agents\u2019 and  brokers\u2019) name, address, state of license, and any regulatory actions  taken, among other elements. According to NAIC, the database, which is  updated daily, links state regulatory licensing systems into a single  common system. NAIC officials told us that they are working with  Washington on the implementation of the state\u2019s surplus lines for both  initial licensing and renewals of surplus lines brokers and the state will be  participating in the database in December 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "To Assess Eligibility, Some States Are Making Additional Requests of Nonadmitted Insurers", "paragraphs": ["Section 524 of NRRA establishes nationwide criteria for determining  whether insurers are eligible to sell in states where they are not  domiciled. In particular, the section discourages states from imposing  eligibility requirements on these insurers if they are authorized to write  coverage and meet minimum capital and surplus requirements in the  insured\u2019s home state. However, a range of industry associations we  spoke with representing insurers, and insurance agents and brokers,  among others, noted that some states were taking actions that they  believed were inconsistent with Section 524. For example, the  associations said that some states were requesting information\u2014such as  business plans, disaster plans, and policy forms\u2014that the associations  believe were not relevant to confirming the criteria set forth in Section  524. They said that some states were also asking for fees or other  charges that are not specified in Section 524. According to the  associations, in some cases, states are applying different standards for  single and multistate risks, a particular issue for alien insurers. For  example, according to the associations, one state may consider an alien  insurer listed on NAIC\u2019s Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers as eligible to  sell coverage if the covered risk resides in more than one state; however,  if the policy is a single state policy, then the same alien insurer must meet  state-specific eligibility standards to write the policy. The associations say  that these actions place an additional administrative burden on surplus  lines insurers and result in a lack of consistency across states, which  NRRA was intended to address.", "To reduce the requesting of additional information by state insurance  regulators, NAIC formed a subgroup that in August 2013 developed  options for improving access to financial information by regulators,  brokers, and the insured. These options, which received input from the  surplus lines industry, include the following:", "NAIC will provide quarterly and annual summaries of insurer financial  data (surplus lines total direct premium written and policyholders\u2019  surplus) to help states confirm an insurer\u2019s financial health,   states will make greater use of NAIC\u2019s automated systems to verify  insurer financial data, and   states will provide a link to NAIC\u2019s Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers  on their insurance department websites.", "According to NAIC officials, they will continue to encourage states to  implement these suggestions and in 2014, the association may consider  a survey to gauge state implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRRA Appears to Have Had Little, If Any, Effect on Prices and Availability of Coverage", "paragraphs": ["According to surplus lines insurers and brokers and representatives of the  industry associations that we contacted, NRRA has had little, if any, effect  on the price and availability of coverage in the admitted and surplus lines  markets. Market participants noted that the changes under NRRA were  intended to streamline and simplify the taxation and regulation of surplus  lines insurance, and these changes would not likely affect the price or  availability of coverage. Market participants noted that the insurance cycle  of soft and hard markets (rising and falling premiums), as discussed in  greater detail later, was the primary factor affecting the price and  availability of coverage. They added that in their view it would be difficult  to determine the precise effect, if any, of NRRA because it generally  would be difficult to separate the effects of laws and regulations from the  normal functioning of the insurance cycle.", "While surplus lines insurers generally write tailored products, according to  a market participant, in some instances the insured (individuals or groups  covered by an insurance policy) may move from the surplus lines to the  admitted market. Insureds may do so because an admitted insurer  changed its underwriting and pricing standards to accept risks that it  previously did not accept. For example, an admitted insurer that did not  cover commercial apartment risks may decide to do so. According to a  study of surplus lines insurance, whether this strategy succeeds depends  on the admitted insurer\u2019s underwriting and pricing expertise and ability to  comply with the state\u2019s form and rate filing regulations. The study noted  that insureds may also migrate from one market to another because of  the insurance cycle, a concept noted by many of the market participants  that we interviewed. As we have discussed, in a soft market, admitted  insurers may lower their acceptability standards, broaden their coverage,  and decrease prices to retain customers and attract new ones. In a hard  market, by contrast, admitted insurers may raise their acceptability  standards, restrict coverage, and raise prices, so insureds may not find  the coverage they want in the admitted market and thus move to the  surplus lines market.", "According to market participants, any changes in coverage would be due  to the insurance cycle rather than NRRA and there has been little  noticeable shifting in coverage between the admitted and surplus lines  markets as a result of NRRA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft report to NAIC for review and comment.

We used the types of coverage  identified in SNL Financial\u2019s \u201cdesignated focus,\u201d which identifies the types  of coverage or broad categories of business provided by the insurer.  Specifically, if a company writes 60 percent or more of its overall P/C  premiums in a specific category, it is given a corresponding SNL- designated focus. SNL uses the following methodology to assign a focus  to a company: Companies with less than $1 million in net premium written  are not given a line of business designated focus. Companies whose  reinsurance business is greater than 64 percent (a figure determined by  SNL Financial) of their premiums written are classified as reinsurers.  Reinsurance companies with more than $1 billion in assets are  designated as large reinsurers. All other insurers are designated as  having a personal, commercial, or accident and health focus. A company  is designated as having a commercial lines focus if it has very diversified  operations within the commercial lines. Otherwise, SNL designates a  company as focusing on one of the following commercial lines:  commercial property (auto, multiperil, fire and allied, and inland and  ocean marine), commercial medical malpractice, commercial workers\u2019  compensation, commercial financial lines (financial lines such as fidelity,  surety, and mortgage guaranty), and commercial general liability (other  and general liability).", "To provide a comparison of the surplus lines market to the admitted  market, we drew upon a recent report we issued on the insurance  markets and the impacts of and responses to the 2007-2009 financial  crisis.
