However, the department cannot provide reasonable assurance that all recommendations addressing container management in the CENTCOM area of responsibility have been incorporated in DOD's policy or guidance, as appropriate. DOD officials incorporated some recommendations made by DOD audit agencies and other organizations aimed at improving container management into policy and guidance. For example, in August 2012 the commanders of CENTCOM and U.S. Transportation Command issued a joint memorandum outlining leadership's responsibility for container management in the CENTCOM area of responsibility that was a direct result of a 2012 Joint Logistics Board report that recommended corrective actions to enhance senior leaders' understanding of container management. However, DOD does not have a comprehensive list of the corrective actions that have been recommended over time. Without such a list, DOD cannot reasonably ensure that all of the recommendations have been incorporated into policy and guidance as appropriate. For example, of the 95 corrective actions that GAO identified from reports by DOD audit agencies and other organizations issued from 2003 through 2013, DOD officials could not provide information on steps taken to address 40 of the corrective actions.", "Since 2012, DOD has taken steps to manage and reduce shipping container detention fees incurred due to the untimely return of commercial carrier-owned shipping containers in Afghanistan, but its ability to manage and reduce these fees is limited by inaccurate and incomplete data. In August 2012, DOD established the requirement that within 15 days of a shipping container's arrival: (1) receipt of the container was to be recorded by the unit in-theater, (2) the container was to be unloaded, and (3) the responsible carrier was to be notified that its container was available for pickup. DOD also developed a set of tracking metrics to monitor progress in meeting this requirement. However, incomplete and inaccurate data about the location and number of containers accruing detention fees hindered DOD's ability to manage and reduce detention fees for containers in Afghanistan. For example, GAO analysis of DOD's container-management system data and carrier delivery data for each month in 2013 showed that DOD had not recorded in the container-management system about 16 percent of the carrier-owned containers delivered and received in Afghanistan. DOD has identified factors, or procedural weaknesses, that may contribute to incomplete and inaccurate data; however, it has not assessed the extent to which these weaknesses have contributed to data inaccuracies, determined the root causes of these weaknesses, or developed a corrective-action plan for correcting them. Without an assessment of the root causes and a corrective-action plan, it will be difficult for DOD to have complete and accurate data, which could limit its ability to manage and reduce detention fees for containers in Afghanistan and in future contingency operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) develop a list of recommendations and incorporate them into policy and guidance and (2) identify root causes for procedural weaknesses that contribute to inaccurate, incomplete container data and develop and implement a corrective plan.

Subsequently, in August  2012, DOD implemented one of the team\u2019s recommendations when the  commanders of the U.S. Transportation Command and CENTCOM  issued their joint memorandum\u2014addressed to the military services, the  Defense Logistics Agency, U.S. Forces Afghanistan, and CENTCOM\u2019s  component commands\u2014directing them to focus specifically on improving  container-management operations to reduce detention fees.

In addition, according to the joint memorandum,  U.S. Transportation Command and CENTCOM developed a set of tracking metrics to monitor progress in meeting this requirement.Furthermore, in March 2013, U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s  subordinate organization, the Surface Deployment and Distribution  Command, developed and began tracking data against container- management goals to support the drawdown from Afghanistan, according  to officials from the organization. The data included the number of  containers not released for carrier pickup and the number of containers  accruing detention fees for longer than 3 months. Lastly, in September  2013, according to CENTCOM officials, CENTCOM formed an assistance  team in Afghanistan to help operating bases focus on container  management in order to improve container inventory database accuracy  and reduce the number of containers, which could reduce detention fees.", "Following the collective actions it has taken to manage and reduce  detention fees, DOD estimated that there would be a significant decrease  in fees for 2013 and 2014.

DOD officials said  that they expected the decrease in detention fees because of a  combination of two factors: (1) a projected reduction in the number of  containers being shipped into Afghanistan as operations draw down  there, and (2) a reduction in the average detention fees that will be  accrued per container resulting from actions DOD has taken to reduce  and manage those fees. Because of insufficient data, however, according  to Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials, DOD could  not determine the extent to which the expected decrease would be due to  actions the department has taken in theater to reduce and manage  detention fees or the expected decrease would be the result of other  factors such as there being fewer containers in Afghanistan as a result of  the drawdown. Further, according to Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command officials, because there is a lag in the time carriers  submit detention-fee invoices, it is difficult for DOD to determine a reliable  estimate for detention fees for containers in theater at a given time. The  officials said that they hope to have more reliable data after (1) operations  cease in Afghanistan, when remaining detention invoices and requests- for-equitable-adjustment detention-fee claims are received and  processed, and (2) the Universal Services Contract is closed out, which  will not occur until fiscal year 2016 or later."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Incomplete and Inaccurate Container- Management Data Limits Its Ability to Manage and Reduce Detention Fees in Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has estimated that there will be a decrease in the amount  of detention fees it will pay, its ability to manage and reduce detention  fees for containers subject to them in Afghanistan is limited by incomplete  and inaccurate data on the number and location of containers in country.  Moreover, DOD has not assessed contributing factors to determine the  root causes for its incomplete and inaccurate data.", "According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  for an agency to run and control its operations, it must have relevant,  reliable information relating to internal events. In this regard, the DOD  Transportation Regulation specifies that combatant commanders are to  collect and maintain data on every container in theater. However,  DOD\u2019s data on the number of carrier-owned containers subject to  detention fees is incomplete and inaccurate. Without relevant and reliable  data, DOD\u2019s ability to monitor and reduce detention fees is limited. For  example, DOD concluded that the total number of containers in DOD\u2019s  container-management system subject to detention fees were  understated because the invoices DOD received for the same period  indicated that there was a greater number of carrier-owned containers in  theater. Specifically, using data from DOD\u2019s container-management  system on the number of carrier-owned containers used in the  CENTCOM area of operations (including in Afghanistan), container  managers estimated that detention fees for fiscal year 2011 would be  about $23 million. However, DOD received detention-fee invoices totaling  about $84 million for fiscal year 2011, about 3.7 times higher than  estimated, which represents approximately 5,200 containers that DOD  could not account for. According to Surface Deployment and Distribution  Command officials, improvements in data feeds and user data entry have  been made over the past 4 years as they have worked to resolve this  discrepancy but have not yet fully done so. Nonetheless they believe that  the discrepancy arose primarily from inaccuracies in inventory data.  Without accurate inventory data to validate invoices, DOD is at risk for  being overbilled, which happened during fiscal years 2010 and 2011  according to Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials.  Specifically, investigations by the Surface Deployment and Distribution  Command and others beginning in 2010 led to recouping costs for  incorrect carrier-shipment billings, resulting in $3.9 million and $9.0 million  in detention-fee refunds to DOD for fiscal years 2010 and 2011,  respectively.", "CENTCOM Container Management Letter of Instruction (Jan. 15, 2014). illustrates the portion of containers in Afghanistan with known and  unknown locations on October 31, 2013.", "Moreover, our additional analysis indicated that, over the period  September 2010 through December 2013, 7,707 individual carrier-owned  containers had unknown locations recorded in the container-management  system with 572 of those individual shipping containers accruing  detention fees for 1 year or more. Without accurate location data, DOD\u2019s  ability to locate, empty, and return those carrier-owned shipping  containers is limited, and detention fees, therefore, can continue to  accrue unabated until reaching the maximum allowed by contract\u2014 approximately twice the purchase price of the container.", "DOD has identified several procedural weaknesses in the management of  containers in theater that may affect the accuracy and completeness of  container-management data. According to Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command officials, one procedural weakness is that  containers are not always being recorded in theater when received.  Specifically, the officials stated that the procedures for verifying the  receipt of a container at a base in Afghanistan do not require a receiving  unit representative to sign directly for shipping containers upon arrival  because operations at bases can be quite extensive, and waiting for a  receiving unit representative to arrive at the delivery point would create  or exacerbate backlogs. Therefore, according to Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command officials, the person manning the delivery point  when the container arrives signs for it, although that person has no  responsibility for entering any data into the DOD container-management  system. As a result, container managers may be unaware of containers  delivered to their areas of responsibility and not learn that such containers  are accruing detention fees until after DOD receives a bill from the carrier  for the detention fees. CENTCOM\u2019s container management policy  specifies that within 48 hours of receiving a container the receiving unit  should record the event in DOD\u2019s container-management system. In  addition, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state  that events such as the receipt of goods (e.g., shipping containers and  their contents) should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance  and value to management in controlling operations and making  decisions. However, our analysis of DOD\u2019s container-management  system data and carrier delivery data for the end of each month in 2013  showed that DOD had not recorded in the container-management system  about 16 percent of the carrier-owned containers delivered and received  in Afghanistan. Moreover, according to U.S. Transportation Command  officials, without records of receipts, DOD does not always have complete  documentation to confirm whether or not delivery dates and resulting  detention fees claimed by the carrier are correct, and, as a result, has  accepted unsupported delivery claims and billings for detention fees. Until  the location of a container is determined, DOD may purchase containers  that are known to be lost to avoid further detention payments or it may  continue to pay the detention fees up to the maximum amount allowed by  contract\u2014ranging from approximately $3,200 to $47,500 depending on  the type of container\u2014at which time, DOD becomes the owner of that  container.", "In addition, Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials have  identified a variety of other procedural weaknesses that they stated led to  carrier-owned containers not being recorded in the container- management system, which may also affect the accuracy and  completeness of data. Specifically, they identified instances where the  following occurred:", "Containers were shipped into the theater outside of the DOD  container-management system. For example, a carrier delivers a  container to the theater before it is recorded in DOD\u2019s container- management system. This situation may occur when a unit orders  items that are shipped directly from a supplier or manufacturer instead  of through an intermediary military supply activity.", "Container records were closed before the container was returned to  the specified pickup location without prior approval from the carrier for  this change. For example, a unit in theater unloads a container at a  location other than the original delivery point and records the  container as ready for carrier pickup without the carrier\u2019s agreement to  the alternative location. Recording the container as ready for carrier  pickup causes DOD\u2019s container-management system to disregard the  container as subject to detention fee accrual. However, without carrier  agreement to the alternative pick up location, detention fees continue  to accrue under the terms of the Universal Services Contract.", "Container records were closed while the container was in use. For  example, an in theater container manager may mistakenly conclude  that because a container is no longer in a unit\u2019s possession, it has  been returned to a carrier. The container manager, therefore,  designates the container record as inactive in DOD\u2019s container- management system. However, the container may still be in DOD\u2019s  possession and subject to detention fees.", "Containers were recorded incorrectly as government-owned  containers. For example, a container manager in theater with a large  volume of containers may mistakenly code a carrier-owned container  as a DOD container. The DOD container-management system does  not consider these incorrectly coded containers as subject to  detention fees, however detention fees continue to accrue.", "While DOD has identified the procedural weaknesses above that may  affect the completeness and accuracy of container-management data and  has, according to Surface Deployment and Distribution Command  officials, researched container data and taken other steps to resolve most  of these instances, the department has not assessed the extent to which  these weaknesses have affected the data. For example, the Joint  Logistics Board-directed container-management team recommended  more automated reporting to significantly reduce manually inventorying  containers, thereby improving the accuracy of inventory data. In  response, DOD contracted for the development of automated technology  for the recording of shipping containers as they enter and exit military  installations and, according to DOD officials, expects to complete an initial  evaluation of the selected technology after the end of fiscal year 2014.  According to DOD officials, the technology is intended to provide  irrefutable proof of a container\u2019s movement, work without reliance on  satellite tags, and supplement or even replace the need for human  manual entry. However, DOD has not identified the root cause or causes  for the inaccurate inventory data that this recommendation and the  selected technology are intended to address, which is critical if the  department is to correct the procedural weaknesses that contribute to  inaccurate and incomplete data. Further, according to Surface  Deployment and Distribution Command officials, no DOD office has  identified the root causes of the other procedural weaknesses discussed  above or developed a corrective action plan with corrective measures to  address the root causes. In our process for determining agencies\u2019  programs at high risk due to their greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address  economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges, we developed criteria  stated in our November 2000 report, Determining Performance and  Accountability Challenges and High Risks, which found that one step that  agencies can take to help resolve their programs\u2019 performance and  accountability challenges is to develop a corrective action plan that  includes identifying root causes and effective solutions. For container  management, such a corrective plan would contain corrective measures  intended to help develop effective solutions for better locating and  confirming receipt of containers and verifying detention invoices as a  means to manage and reduce detention fees in current and future  contingencies. According to these criteria, for improving federal agency  performance and accountability, agencies can help resolve a program\u2019s  performance and accountability challenges by developing a corrective  action plan that identifies root causes and effective solutions and provides  for completion of corrective measures in the near term. Further,  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that an  agency\u2019s procedures are among the control activities that help ensure  actions are taken to address risks and are an integral part of an entity\u2019s  implementing and accountability for stewardship of government resources  and achieving effective results. One reason DOD has not identified the  root cause or causes for the procedural weaknesses that contribute to  inaccurate or incomplete container-management data nor developed a  corrective-action plan with effective solutions that provide for completion  of corrective measures, according to Surface Deployment and Distribution  Command officials, is that the responsibility for handling containers in  Afghanistan is dispersed among CENTCOM, U.S. Transportation  Command, and U.S. Forces\u2013Afghanistan and its subordinate units.  According to the officials, their command, which is a subordinate element  of U.S. Transportation Command, has attempted to improve the  completeness and accuracy of container-management data and to  identify root causes for its inaccuracy and incompleteness by focusing on  areas that fall within their responsibility, such as providing training on  managing containers and on assessing and improving the data systems.  However, they also noted that other factors affecting the completeness  and accuracy of container-management data fall outside of the Surface  Deployment and Distribution Command. According to Surface  Deployment and Distribution Command officials, other than the  command\u2019s attempts, no other DOD office has assessed root causes for  the procedural weaknesses identified in this report or developed a  corrective-action plan to assess the procedural weaknesses and  determine their root causes.", "According to Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials with  global container management responsibilities, complete data on the  number of carrier-owned containers, including which containers are  accruing detention fees, would help DOD container managers achieve a  reduction in these fees. Until DOD assesses its procedural weaknesses,  identifies the root causes for those weaknesses, and develops and  implements a corrective-action plan to address them, the department is  limited in its ability to manage and reduce detention fees. Further,  because it will not have the information it needs to correct the deficiencies  in the data to better locate and confirm receipt of containers and verify  detention invoices until it does so, DOD will not have reliable data to  assess how well its efforts to manage and reduce detention fees are  working currently and in future contingencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The management of shipping containers has been a long-standing  challenge for DOD, a challenge that is particularly acute during  contingency operations and one that has been exacerbated in  Afghanistan given the harsh conditions that exist there.

However, in order to proactively and successfully improve  future container-management operations and prevent the accumulation of  detention fees, DOD would benefit by being fully apprised of all  recommendations made by DOD audit agencies and other organizations  thus far and determining which actions would potentially resolve  container-management challenges. DOD could use our work as a starting  point for identifying additional recommendations to improve container- management policy and guidance for the next contingency. In addition,  until DOD assesses its procedural weaknesses, identifies the root causes  for those weaknesses, and develops and implements a corrective-action  plan to address them to help improve the quality of its container- management data, it will be difficult for the department to determine how  best to improve its container-management operations, including the  reduction of detention fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help DOD to improve the overall management of shipping containers  for current and future contingencies, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense take the following three actions.", "To more fully incorporate recommendations into its policy and guidance  and to ensure that improvements to container management will be  sustained for future contingencies, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense develop a comprehensive list of recommendations made by  DOD agencies and other organizations, and make the information  available for policymakers to incorporate, as appropriate, into new or  existing container-management policy and guidance. DOD could use our  work as a starting point for this assessment.", "To help ensure DOD\u2019s container-management system has more complete  and accurate data, and DOD is better positioned to assess progress in  managing containers to reduce detention fees, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Commander CENTCOM to  identify the root cause or causes for the procedural weaknesses in the  handling of containers and the extent to which they contribute to the  incomplete and inaccurate recording of container-management data in  theater, and develop and implement a corrective action plan with effective  solutions for the root causes identified that provide for completion of  corrective measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.

DOD  stated that it concurred with the recommendation, but added that  CENTCOM is responsible for theater container management and control  in its area of responsibility. DOD also stated that CENTCOM will  coordinate with U.S. Transportation Command to the extent that specific  theater actions affect overall global container management. We initially  drafted the recommendation to both CENTCOM and the U.S.  Transportation Command in order to ensure that action would be taken  from both commands; however, we agree with DOD that CENTCOM is  responsible and that coordination with U.S. Transportation Command to  the extent that specific theater actions affect overall global container  management is appropriate.

Further, DOD stated that only CENTCOM may direct military Service  component commands to take specific actions in the CENTCOM area of  responsibility. DOD added that if resolution of the issues requires actions  beyond CENTCOM\u2019s purview, then CENTCOM will refer specific actions  to the Joint Staff for assistance in obtaining resolution with other  commands and organizations.

To identify recommendations made by DOD  audit agencies and other organizations that addressed container- management challenges, we researched websites and databases and  contacted officials as necessary from the following audit agencies: Army  Audit Agency, Naval Audit Service, Air Force Audit Agency, DOD Office  of Inspector General, Defense Contract Audit Agency, Defense Contract  Management Agency, Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction,  Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, and GAO. We  interviewed DOD logistics and container-management officials from the  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Transportation  Policy, U.S. Transportation Command, CENTCOM, the U.S. Army, the  U.S. Marine Corps, Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, and  the Defense Logistics Agency to discuss challenges with and efforts to  improve container management, and identify additional reports or studies  with findings and recommendations involving container-management  issues.

The recommendations we identified  may not be comprehensive because DOD did not have an alternative  source or means to corroborate or verify what we identified. Additionally,  the same or similar recommendations may appear in different reports and  therefore may be duplicated. We analyzed the relevant recommendations  to identify the organizations responsible for implementation and  categorized the recommendations to determine patterns and repetition  over time. We discussed the listing of recommendations with DOD  container-management officials to determine how the department  addressed the findings and recommendations. We then requested the  department provide us with the status of the recommendations we had  identified to determine whether actions were completed or implemented.  We reviewed DOD policy and guidance pertaining to container  management to determine the extent that the categories of  recommendations we identified were reflected in them. We also reviewed  the recommendations status updates DOD provided to identify instances  where DOD stated that recommendations had been incorporated into  container-management policy and guidance. We compared DOD\u2019s  inclusion of recommendations addressing container-management  challenges into its policy and guidance documents against criteria for  recording and communicating important information to management as  contained in the Information and Communication, and Monitoring,  standards in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To determine the extent to which DOD managed and reduced container  detention fees, we met with officials from the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Transportation Policy, U.S.  Transportation Command, CENTCOM, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps,  Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, and the Defense  Logistics Agency to develop an understanding of how DOD accrues and  pays detention fees, and manages shipping containers to reduce the  accumulation of detention fees. We observed the processes and  procedures by which invoices for detention fees are received, reviewed,  and paid. Also, we observed demonstrations of the DOD system used to  track and manage shipping containers used in the CENTCOM area of  responsibility and collected comprehensive listings of containers and  associated data for each container captured in these listings. We  observed demonstrations of DOD\u2019s two key systems used in container  management for Afghanistan (the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s  Container Management Module and the Army Container Asset  Management System), collected information on the systems\u2019 structure  and data content, and requested and collected various reports produced  in queries on 4 separate days, from April 2013 through December 2013,  for complete data on the number of containers in theater that officials  conducted at our request. From the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s  Container Management Module we then collected and analyzed complete  data sets for all shipping containers recorded for Afghanistan to  understand the densities and usages of shipping containers in  Afghanistan. This included determining locations where containers were  recorded and the ratios of carrier-owned containers to government-owned  containers; and identifying containers without recorded geographic  locations, the length of time carrier-owned containers had been in  Afghanistan, and the ratios of containers recorded as empty to those with  contents or occupants.", "In Afghanistan, we met with U.S. Forces\u2013Afghanistan officials and various  container control officers identified by officials from the Surface  Deployment and Distribution Command to discuss shipping-container  management and the accuracy of data recorded in the Container  Management Module.

We selected September 2010 because it was the first month for which  DOD had available end-of-month data. We concluded with December  2013 because it was the cutoff date for the analyses that we had planned  to conduct. We summarized and discussed our initial analysis with  officials from the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command to  ensure accurate interpretation of the data collected.
