The remaining two programs breached their schedule or cost goals. This represents an improvement since GAO's last review. However, GAO found that some of the programs that were on track as of August 2019 are at risk of not meeting cost or schedule goals or both in the future. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter program faces potential cost increases and schedule slips in the future as a result of damages to the shipbuilder's facility from Hurricane Michael in October 2018.", "Traceability, which is called for in DHS policy and GAO scheduling best practices, helps ensure that program goals are aligned with program execution plans, and that a program's various stakeholders have an accurate and consistent understanding of those plans and goals. Of the 27 programs GAO assessed, 21 had established baselines after DHS updated its acquisition policy in March 2016 (the most current version of the policy at the beginning of this review). GAO found that the 21 programs' baseline cost and performance goals generally traced to source documents, such as life-cycle cost estimates and planned performance outcomes. However, schedule goals did not generally match up to the programs' integrated master schedules (IMS), as required by DHS acquisition management instruction and as a best practice identified in GAO's Schedule Assessment Guide (see figure).", "The lack of traceability between IMSs and schedule goals in the approved acquisition program baselines (APB) indicates that DHS does not have appropriate oversight processes in place to ensure that schedules are accurately reflected in program baselines, in accordance with DHS policy and GAO's best practices. Therefore, DHS cannot ensure that the understanding of program schedules among different stakeholders, including component and DHS leadership is consistent and accurate. As a result, DHS leadership may be approving program schedule goals that do not align with program execution plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations, including that DHS put in place an oversight process to ensure that programs' schedule goals are developed and updated according to GAO's scheduling best practices.

In fiscal year 2020 alone, DHS plans to spend  more than $10 billion on these acquisition programs, and ultimately the  department plans to invest more than $200 billion over the life cycle of  these programs. DHS and its underlying components are acquiring  systems to help secure the border, increase marine safety, screen  travelers, enhance cybersecurity, improve disaster response, and execute  a wide variety of other operations. Most of DHS\u2019s major acquisition  programs cost at least $300 million and take multiple years to acquire.", "To help manage these programs, DHS has established an acquisition  management policy that we have found to be generally sound in that it  reflects key program management practices we have identified in prior  work. Over the past decade, we have also found that department  leadership has dedicated additional resources and implemented new  policies designed to improve acquisition oversight. However, our work  has also identified shortcomings in the department\u2019s ability to manage its  portfolio of major acquisitions and we have made numerous  recommendations over the past decade to help address these  challenges. For example, we previously recommended that DHS  leadership ensure all major programs fully comply with the acquisition  management policy by obtaining department-level approval for acquisition  documents before the programs are allowed to proceed. We have also  recommended that DHS specifically assess whether adequate funding is  available during all program reviews. In response to these  recommendations, DHS has taken several steps to improve acquisition  management, such as strengthening implementation of its acquisition  management policy and requiring components to certify that programs  are affordable before they are approved to move through the acquisition  life cycle. Nonetheless, DHS has not fully addressed some of our other  recommendations. For example, in April 2017, we found that DHS policy  required programs to establish schedule, cost, and performance  baselines prior to gaining full knowledge about the program\u2019s technical  requirements. As a result, DHS programs were not matching their needs  with available resources before starting product development, which  increased programs\u2019 risk for cost growth, schedule slips, and inconsistent  performance. We recommended that DHS update its acquisition policy to  require that major acquisition programs\u2019 technical requirements are well  defined and key technical reviews are conducted prior to approving  programs to initiate product development and establishing acquisition  program baselines (APB), in accordance with acquisition best practices.  Although DHS has begun to update its acquisition policy, as of October  2019 it has yet to fully implement this recommendation.", "The Explanatory Statement accompanying a bill to the DHS  Appropriations Act, 2015 contained a provision for GAO to conduct  ongoing reviews of major DHS acquisition programs, as directed in the  Senate report. This is our fifth review of major DHS acquisition  programs. This report assesses the extent to which (1) DHS\u2019s major  acquisition programs are on track to meet their schedule and cost goals,  and (2) current program baselines trace to key acquisition documents.", "To answer these objectives, we reviewed 29 of DHS\u2019s 80 major  acquisition programs. This included all 17 of DHS\u2019s Level 1 acquisition  programs\u2014those with life-cycle cost estimates (LCCE) of $1 billion or  more\u2014that were in the process of obtaining new capabilities at the  initiation of our audit. We also selected 12 other major acquisition  programs that we or DHS management identified as at risk of not meeting  their schedules, cost estimates, or capability requirements. Six of these  12 programs were Level 1 acquisitions that were either delivering  capabilities to end users, or establishing plans to do so. The other six  programs were Level 2 acquisitions with LCCEs between $300 million  and less than $1 billion.", "Appendix I presents individual assessments of and information about  each of the 29 programs we reviewed. These assessments include key  information, such as the status of programs\u2019 schedules, costs, projected  funding levels, testing, and staffing. Our objective for the 2-page  assessments is to provide decision makers a means to quickly gauge the  programs\u2019 progress and their potential cost, schedule, performance, or  funding risks.", "To determine the extent to which the 29 programs we selected are on  track to meet their schedule and cost goals, we analyzed available  acquisition documentation, such as APBs, which contain information on  programs\u2019 schedules and cost estimates. Since the November 2008  update to DHS\u2019s overarching acquisition management directive, these  documents have required DHS-level approval; therefore, we used  November 2008 as the starting point for our analysis. We found that 27 of  the 29 programs had one or more department-approved LCCEs and  APBs between November 2008 and August 2019. The remaining two  programs were early in the acquisition process and planned to establish  department-approved schedule and cost goals during our review.  However, these programs were delayed in getting department approval  for their initial APBs for various reasons and we therefore excluded them  from our analysis. We assessed the 27 programs against the most recent  DHS acquisition management directive and instruction updates (March  2016) because these were current at the time our review began. We used  the APBs and other program documents to construct a data collection  instrument for each program, determining whether the programs had  experienced schedule slips or cost growth, or whether they were on track  against their established baselines as of August 31, 2019. We also  reviewed the Future Years Homeland Security Program (FYHSP) report  to Congress for fiscal years 2020-2024\u2014which presents 5-year funding  plans for each of DHS\u2019s major acquisition programs\u2014to assess the  affordability of DHS\u2019s acquisition portfolio.", "To determine the extent to which current program baselines trace to key  acquisition documents, we reviewed DHS acquisition policy and  supplemental guidance to identify documents that programs are required  to complete to provide the basis for programs\u2019 cost, schedule, and  performance parameters in APBs. Of the 27 programs we assessed with  established baselines, we found that 21 programs had established or  revised their APBs after DHS updated its acquisition management  instruction in March 2016, which was the most current version of the  guidance when we initiated our review. Therefore, for each of these 21  programs we reviewed the most recent APB and identified documents  that were used as the basis for cost, schedule, and performance  parameters. We then compared the APB cost, schedule, and  performance parameters to the information in the underlying documents.  We determined that the program was traceable if the information from the  underlying documentation was the same as the cost, schedule, and  performance parameters in the APB. In addition, we interviewed officials  from headquarters organizations to discuss how policies related to  developing APBs are being implemented and clarified requirements for  establishing APB parameters. We interviewed component and program  officials to identify causes of inconsistencies between the approved APB  and documents that provided the basis for approved cost, schedule, and  performance parameters. We included programs in our analysis with  APBs approved between March 2016 and February 2019. At the time we  initiated this review, the March 2016 policies and procedures were  current, but the policies and procedures were subsequently updated  beginning in February 2019.

Generally, we could trace the cost and performance goals back to the plans and information used to set them\u2014but not the schedule goals.
