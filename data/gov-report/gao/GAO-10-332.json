It also required compliance with federal standards and the establishment of a joint interagency program office to function as a single point of accountability for the effort. Further, the act directed GAO to semiannually report on the progress made in achieving these requirements. For this fourth report, GAO determined the extent to which (1) DOD and VA developed and implemented electronic health record systems or capabilities that allowed for full interoperability by September 30, 2009, and (2) the interagency program office established by the act is functioning as a single point of accountability. To do so, GAO analyzed agency documentation on project status and conducted interviews with agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA previously established six objectives that they identified as necessary for achieving full interoperability; they have now met the remaining three interoperability objectives that GAO previously reported as being partially achieved--expand questionnaires and self-assessment tools, expand DOD's inpatient medical records system, and demonstrate initial document scanning. As a result of meeting the six objectives, the departments' officials, including the co-chairs of the group responsible for representing the clinician user community, believe they have satisfied the September 30, 2009, requirement for full interoperability. Nevertheless, DOD and VA are planning additional actions to further increase their interoperable capabilities and address clinicians' evolving needs for interoperable electronic health records. Specifically, (1) DOD and VA plan to meet additional needs that have emerged with respect to social history and physical exam data; (2) DOD plans to further expand the implementation of its inpatient medical records system to sites beyond those achieved as of September 2009; and (3) DOD and VA plan to test the capability to scan documents, in follow-up to their demonstration of an initial document scanning capability. Additionally, in response to a Presidential announcement, the departments are beginning to plan for the development and implementation of a virtual lifetime electronic record, which is intended to further increase their interoperable capabilities. The interagency program office is not yet positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the implementation of interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities. The departments have made progress in setting up their interagency program office by hiring additional staff, including a permanent director. In addition, consistent with GAO's previous recommendations, the office has begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter in the areas of scheduling, planning, and performance measurement. However, the office's effort in these areas does not fully satisfy the recommendations and are incomplete. Specifically, the office does not yet have a schedule that includes information about tasks, resource needs, or relationships between tasks associated with ongoing activities to increase interoperability. Also, key IT management responsibilities in the areas of planning and performance measurement remain incomplete. Among the reasons officials cited for not yet completing a schedule, plan, or performance measures were the office's need to focus on verifying achievement of the six interoperability objectives and participating in the departments' efforts to define the virtual lifetime electronic record. Nonetheless, if the program office does not fulfill key management responsibilities as GAO previously recommended, it may not be positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the delivery of future interoperable capabilities, including the development of the virtual lifetime electronic record."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) have long-standing efforts to increase sharing of data between their  health information systems.

Historically, patient health information has been  scattered across paper records kept by many different caregivers in many  different locations, making it difficult for a clinician to access all of a  patient\u2019s health information at the time of care. Lacking access to these  critical data, a clinician may be challenged to make the most informed  decisions on treatment options, potentially putting the patient\u2019s health at  greater risk. The use of electronic health records can help provide this  access and improve clinical decisions.", "Interoperability\u2014the ability to share data among health care providers\u2014is  key to making health care information electronically available.  Interoperability enables different information systems or components to  exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged.  This capability is important because it allows patients\u2019 electronic health  information to move with them from provider to provider, regardless of  where the information originated. If electronic health records conform to  interoperability standards, they can be created, managed, and consulted  by authorized clinicians and staff across more than one health care  organization, thus providing patients and their caregivers the necessary  information required for optimal care. Unlike paper-based health records,  electronic health records can provide decision support capabilities, such  as automatic alerts about a particular patient\u2019s health, or other advantages  of automation.", "Interoperability depends on the use of agreed-upon standards to ensure  that information can be shared and used. In the health IT field, standards  may govern areas ranging from technical issues, such as file types and  interchange systems, to content issues, such as medical terminology. DOD  and VA have agreed upon numerous common standards that allow them to  share health data. They have also participated in numerous standards- setting organizations tasked to reach consensus on the definition and use  of standards. For example, DOD and VA officials serve as members and  are actively working on several committees and groups within the  Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. The panel identifies  and harmonizes competing standards and develops interoperability  specifications that are needed for implementing the standards.", "Interoperability can be achieved at different levels. At the highest level,  electronic data are computable (that is, in a format that a computer can  understand and act on to, for example, provide alerts to clinicians on drug  allergies). At a lower level, electronic data are structured and viewable,  but not computable. The value of data at this level is that they are  structured so that data of interest to users are easier to find. At still a  lower level, electronic data are unstructured and viewable, but not  computable. With unstructured electronic data, a user would have to  search through uncategorized data to find needed or relevant information.  Beyond these, paper records also can be considered interoperable (at the  lowest level) because they allow data to be shared, read, and interpreted  by human beings. According to DOD and VA officials, not all data require  the same level of interoperability, nor is interoperability at the highest  level achievable in all cases. For example, unstructured, viewable data  may be sufficient for such narrative information as clinical notes. Figure 1  shows the distinction between the various levels of interoperability and  examples of the types of data that can be shared at each level."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and VA Efforts to Exchange Health Information Are Long- standing", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA have been working to exchange patient health information  electronically since 1998.

For example, veterans may receive  outpatient care from VA clinicians and be hospitalized at a military  treatment facility. The interface also allows DOD sites to see previously  inaccessible data at other DOD sites.", "The Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CHDR)  interface,  implemented in September 2006, linked the department\u2019s separate  repositories of standardized data to enable a two-way exchange of  computable outpatient pharmacy and medication allergy information.

To facilitate  compliance with the act, the departments\u2019 Interagency Clinical Informatics  Board, made up of senior clinical leaders who represent the user  community, began establishing priorities for interoperable health data  between DOD and VA. In this regard, the board is responsible for  determining clinical priorities for electronic data sharing between the  departments, as well as what data should be viewable and what data  should be computable. Based on its work, the board established six  interoperability objectives for meeting the departments\u2019 data sharing  needs. According to the former acting director of the interagency program  office, DOD and VA considered achievement of these six objectives, in  conjunction with capabilities previously achieved (e.g., FHIE, BHIE, and  CHDR), to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement for full interoperability  by September 2009. The six objectives are listed in table 1.", "Also since April 2008, the departments have been working to set up an  interagency program office to be accountable for their efforts to  implement fully interoperable electronic health record systems or  capabilities by the September deadline. In January 2009, the office  completed its charter, articulating, among other things, its mission and  functions with respect to attaining interoperable electronic health data.  The charter further identified the office\u2019s responsibilities in carrying out its  mission, in areas such as oversight and management, stakeholder  communication, and decision making. Among the specific responsibilities  identified in the charter was the development of a plan, schedule, and  performance measures to guide the departments\u2019 electronic health record  interoperability efforts.", "Subsequent to an April 2009 Presidential announcement, the departments  approved a new version of the interagency program office\u2019s charter in  September to expand the office\u2019s responsibilities to include coordination  and oversight of the development of a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record  (VLER). Still in the planning stages, VLER is intended to enable access to  all electronic records for service members as they transition from military  to veteran status, and throughout their lives. According to the Director of  the DOD/VA Interagency Program Office, VLER is to expand the  departments\u2019 existing electronic health record capabilities by enabling  access to private sector health data as well.
