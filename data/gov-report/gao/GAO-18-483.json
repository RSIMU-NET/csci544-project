While the overall downward trend is reliable, GAO found that the Planning Board uses outdated methods to calculate GDP, which results in unreliable data from year to year and can make it difficult for policymakers to fully analyze specific economic needs and develop long-range plans. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce), does not calculate GDP for Puerto Rico, as it does for the other U.S. territories. For 6 years, BEA has provided technical support to the Planning Board to update its methods and Planning Board officials described plans to do so, but its methods remain outdated. A 2016 Congressional Task Force recommended that BEA calculate Puerto Rico's GDP, and BEA considers it a long-term goal; however, BEA has not taken steps to do so.", "Further, Puert Rico has limited labor statistics because it is not included in the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is produced by Commerce's Census Bureau (Census) and Department of Labor's (DOL) Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). CPS provides detailed information about employment, such as hours of work and earnings. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) suggested that Census conduct a study to determine the feasibility of expanding data collection to include Puerto Rico. Census officials said that they estimated the cost of such a study but have not yet conducted it. Census officials also cited concerns with data collection burdens. However, without CPS data on Puerto Rico, policymakers are limited in estimating the full economic impact of different policy changes. For example, DOL did not have the data needed to include Puerto Rico in its assessment of the economic impact of DOL's 2016 Overtime Rule. Conducting such a study would help policymakers consider the tradeoffs of including Puerto Rico in the CPS.", "GAO used a different dataset\u2014American Community Survey (ACS)\u2014to assess the potential effects of applying the 2016 Overtime Rule, which would have increased the salary level threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 at which executive, administrative, and professional workers would not be eligible for overtime pay. GAO estimated that about 47,250 of 1.06 million workers in Puerto Rico would be affected\u2014that is, they would become eligible for overtime pay. In response to a salary level threshold increase, employers from selected industries in Puerto Rico told GAO that they might increase certain workers' salaries, but cut overtime hours for other workers, and adjust the number of staff. An economist and a labor group official said that employers could respond by adjusting the number of staff or their hours, but the impacts to employers may be limited and the workforce could benefit.

In its analysis of the impact of the 2016 Overtime  Rule in the states, DOL estimated the largest impact would be an  aggregate transfer of income from employers to employees, which would  be seen as a positive for some employees (e.g., increased pay, fewer  hours for same pay, or new hires) and a negative for others (e.g.,  employers in our facilitated discussion groups said they would have  layoffs, move employees from salaried to hourly, or lower benefit  amounts).", "While we were unable to conduct a full impact analysis identical to DOL\u2019s  because of data limitations, we held facilitated discussion groups, to gain  insight into how employers would have responded if the 2016 Overtime  Rule was implemented in Puerto Rico.

Employers in 3 of 10 industry discussion groups said they would be able  to absorb some of the higher costs associated with an increase in the  Overtime Rule threshold. For example, some manufacturers told us it  would not be difficult for their businesses to absorb these additional costs,  particularly if the salary threshold was at a somewhat lower level.  Similarly, some hotel employers told us they would be able to absorb  costs associated with the change across their many hotel locations, but  others said they may not be able to assimilate the threshold increase.  Hospital employers who participated in our facilitated discussion groups  told us they have lower margins and face threats of closure even without  the threshold increase.

Additionally, this economist said an increase to the threshold  would not be as burdensome to business, because employee wages  have risen above the current overtime salary threshold. One labor group  representative suggested that the 2016 Overtime Rule would have a  minimal impact because very few workers in Puerto Rico earn enough to  meet the 2004 salary threshold. Further, one economist said that under  the current threshold, workers work excessive hours and do not have the  same bargaining power. An increased overtime threshold would improve  these dire working conditions. Specifically, this economist said that  implementing the 2016 Overtime Rule would encourage firms to hire  more workers, provide employees with more bargaining power, and help  prevent worker exploitation.", "One economist said implementing the 2016 Overtime Rule only in the  states could increase the wage differential between Puerto Rico and in  turn increase outmigration from Puerto Rico. One member of the Puerto  Rico Economic Administration said that if Puerto Rico were to have a  lower threshold than the U.S. mainland the effects might be worse than  those caused by the increased labor costs of implementing the higher  threshold.

The  ACS is a national survey designed and administered by the Census  Bureau (Census), and it contains data on individual earnings. Since 2005,  the ACS has also included the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS)  which extends the survey through Puerto Rico. Our data set selection  process included interviews with current and former agency officials as  well as review of dataset documentation such as data handbooks, data  dictionaries, and guidance on the different versions of data available. The  ACS is conducted annually with estimates based on 1-year and 5-year  data with benefits and drawbacks for each version. The 1-year ACS is  updated the earliest and gives the most current data; however, according  to Census\u2019 guidance on the different ACS samples, it also contains the  smallest sample size and is more appropriate for analyzing large  populations than small ones. The 5-year ACS is the most reliable data,  according to Census\u2019 ACS guidance, as it includes the largest population  size, which can be used to analyze small populations; however, the 5- year ACS is the least current version of the data. Additionally, while the  2015 5-year ACS data were not the most recent available, we used them  because the Department of Labor (DOL) used 2015 data in its impact  analysis of the 2016 Overtime Rule for the states. Based on these  benefits and limitations, we chose to use the 2015 ACS 5-year  estimates. Estimates produced from ACS data are subject to sampling  error. For all of our estimates we weighted observations based on the  individual weight. We compared our estimates of values derived from our  weighting procedures to those published by the DOL and found them to  be consistent. In addition to estimates, we generated standard errors or  the margin of error for the 95 percent confidence interval, and report them  with estimates in figures and tables.

While the methodologies are similar, the DOL analysis  used the Current Population Survey (CPS) data that do not include  Puerto Rico. The ACS data we use serves a similar role; however, we  made a few adjustments to the analysis in light of available data.  Specifically, in the ACS, there is no variable identifying whether the  individual works an hourly job. In order to simulate the removal of hourly  workers from the sample, we randomly assign hourly worker designation  to the same proportion of the population that are classified as hourly  workers in DOL\u2019s analysis (41.01 percent). A few assumptions are  associated with this manipulation: 1) We are assuming that the proportion  of the population that works an hourly job in Puerto Rico is similar to that  of the 50 states, and 2) when we perform industry and region analyses,  we assume the same hourly worker proportion across all industries and  regions. Additionally, in its final rule, DOL analyzes the impact of the 2016  Overtime Rule on individual worker\u2019s propensity to work multiple jobs; the  ACS does not identify workers employed in multiple jobs and we could  not perform this analysis. Also, the CPS data contain several variables on  the number of hours worked that allowed DOL to analyze who likely  works overtime on a regular basis. While the ACS includes a variable  indicating the usual number of hours worked per week over the past year,  we found it does not capture the schedule fluctuations as accurately as  the CPS variables. As such, we do not calculate the dollar amount  transfers from employers to employees and dead weight losses, or the  loss in economic efficiency from the rule that DOL shows in its analyses.  To the extent possible, we used DOL\u2019s methodology to determine the  potential effect of the 2016 Overtime Rule in Puerto Rico. However, due  to data limitations there were some ways in which our approach differed  from the approach used by DOL.", "In DOL\u2019s analysis, the sample includes only the workers covered by its  regulation. We adapt the sample to match the DOL\u2019s analysis as follows:  1) remove military personnel, unpaid volunteers, self-employed  individuals, clergy and other religious workers, and federal employees, 2)  remove blue-collar workers and workers paid hourly; and 3) remove  workers who are categorized under occupation and industry codes that  are generally exempt under other exemptions.", "For consistency, our analysis makes the same adjustments to our sample  that DOL makes in its analysis. Since we use the 2015, 5-year ACS data,  we first put all wages into 2015 levels using ACS defined variables. Next,  we inflate from 2015 to 2017 levels using the calendar year consumer  price index (CPI-U). Just as in DOL\u2019s analysis, we do not know whether  any specific worker satisfies the duties test of the 2016 Overtime Rule, so  we follow the same steps DOL took in its final rule. These steps include  using DOL\u2019s probabilities that specific job codes meet the duties test and  assigning the probability to individual workers using the gamma  distribution with the shape parameter alpha was set to the squared  quotient of the sample mean divided by the sample standard deviation,  and the scale parameter beta was set to the sample variance divided by  the sample mean. Additionally, DOL explicitly removes certain industries  and occupations from the sample and we follow its methodology exactly  to remove these. Finally, to estimate the population that would have been  affected by the 2016 Overtime Rule, we limit the sample to only those  above the 2004 overtime salary threshold ($23,660) and below the 2016  salary threshold ($47,476) just as DOL did in its analysis.", "DOL\u2019s estimates for industries and regions use different groupings than  those provided in the ACS; however, since the ACS variables use the  same coding but, a finer level, we can recreate the variables used in  DOL\u2019s analysis.
