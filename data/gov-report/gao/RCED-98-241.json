National Priorities List sites generally follow a regular path toward cleanup that includes a study of site conditions and an evaluation of cleanup alternatives, the selection of one or more cleanup remedies (that is, the cleanup standards and techniques to be used at site), and the design and construction of the remedies.", "Given the congressional interest in the status of sites on the National Priorities List, you asked us to (1) determine the progress the Superfund program has made in selecting remedies at both federal and nonfederal sites; (2) verify the accuracy of the information in the Superfund database on sites\u2019 cleanup progress; and (3) determine the number of cleanup projects that cannot be started in fiscal year 1998 because of a lack of funding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The National Priorities List (NPL) is EPA\u2019s list of hazardous waste sites that present the greatest long-term threats to human health and the environment. After being placed on the NPL, a site generally proceeds through the remedial program, which is responsible for conducting long-term cleanups. A remedial cleanup starts with a remedial investigation, which assesses in detail the contamination and related environmental and health risks, and a feasibility study, which evaluates alternative remedies for cleaning up a site. After one or more cleanup remedies are selected, EPA or, under EPA\u2019s oversight, the parties responsible for contaminating the site design the technical drawings and develop specifications for the remedial actions. The remedial actions are then constructed or implemented. To organize cleanup activities, EPA may divide a site into two or more \u201coperable units\u201d corresponding to different physical areas at the site or different environmental media, such as soil or groundwater.", "Under CERCLA, EPA has the authority to compel parties responsible for the contamination at a site to perform the cleanup. EPA may also pay for the cleanup and attempt to recover the costs. Site cleanups conducted by EPA are financed through a trust fund, commonly called the Superfund, established under CERCLA. The state in which a site is located may also carry out a CERCLA cleanup and related actions at the site under an agreement with EPA.", "In addition to using the Superfund to pay for remedial actions at NPL sites, EPA can use the fund to pay for removal actions at NPL and other sites. Removals are shorter-term actions that generally address immediate threats from hazardous substances\u2014such as removing leaking hazardous waste containers. These actions may be performed instead of or in addition to the remedial actions. Removal actions may use some of the same cleanup methods as the remedial program but are typically faster because they use a simpler site assessment and remedy selection process.", "EPA uses a database called the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) to track activities at NPL and other sites. CERCLIS also contains the dates by which EPA regions are planning to select remedies at NPL sites. Data entries to CERCLIS must be supported by specific documents required by the Superfund/Oil Program Implementation Manual. For example, an entry showing the completion of a remedy design by a responsible party must be supported by an EPA-approved final design document.", "EPA allocates the annual Superfund appropriation it receives from the Congress for various program functions. For example, it estimates the funds that will be needed to continue work at ongoing remediation projects and to conduct emergency removal actions. After these and other needs are provided for, it assigns the remaining funds to new cleanup actions. It uses a National Prioritization Panel to allocate these remaining funds to sites ready to start new remedial actions and to unusually large removal actions beyond what can be funded through the regular removal allocation. The Prioritization Panel, which consists of regional and headquarters officials, ranks new remedial and removal actions proposed by the regions in order of priority based on the risks the sites pose and other factors.

EPA officials said that the slower pace of remedy selection at federal sites occurred because many were listed on the NPL after nonfederal sites and were larger and more complex. They said that their latest data showed that federal sites had an average of 8 operable units, while nonfederal sites contained 1.8 operable units on average.

CERCLIS also indicates whether all remedies have been constructed at sites.

Regions reported that at five sites CERCLIS incorrectly recorded the status of cleanup work. At two of these sites, one or more operable units had not reached the cleanup stage recorded in CERCLIS; at two other sites, an operable unit had progressed beyond the stage indicated by CERCLIS; and at the fifth site, an action that was recorded as a remedial action in CERCLIS was actually a removal action. Regional information management personnel attributed these errors to data entry problems and agreed to correct the database. On the basis of our sample results, we estimate that the cleanup status of NPL sites reported by CERCLIS, as of September 30, 1997, was accurate for 95 percent (plus or minus 4.4 percent) of these sites.

The amount available for new remedial actions could also be affected by the amount of unspent funds that is recovered from Superfund contracts.", "The number and identity of sites ready for remedial actions in fiscal year 1998 could also change.
