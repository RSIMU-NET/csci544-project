The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) helps protect this income by insuring the pensions of 42 million participants in about 45,000 private defined benefit pension plans. During 1997, PBGC paid $824 million in guaranteed benefits to 213,000 retirees and other beneficiaries who had participated in plans that had terminated with insufficient assets to pay promised benefits. Moreover, it will pay guaranteed benefits to another 260,000 people once covered by these terminated plans when they reach their plans\u2019 normal retirement age.", "PBGC administers two separate programs\u2014one for single-employer plans, the other for multiemployer plans. Single-employer plans provide benefits to (1) employees of one firm (the terms of these plans may be collectively bargained) or (2) employees of several related firms (the terms of these plans may not be collectively bargained). Multiemployer plans are maintained under collectively bargained agreements involving more than one unrelated firm, generally in a common industry, such as construction, trucking, or textiles. PBGC pays benefits to participants in single-employer plans that terminate without sufficient assets to pay all promised benefits; PBGC provides loans to multiemployer plans that are insolvent.", "Historically, PBGC\u2019s single-employer program has had a deficit: its liabilities, the present value of future benefits PBGC is or will be obligated to pay for terminated plans or plans that are likely to terminate in a future year, exceeded its assets. In 1992, we placed PBGC on our list of federal programs at high risk because of problems in its operations as well as the large and growing deficit that threatened its long-term financial viability.To address these problems, the Congress passed the Retirement Protection Act (RPA) in 1994, which strengthened minimum funding requirements for plans and increased premiums paid to PBGC by underfunded plans. In addition, PBGC improved administration of both insurance programs. Consequently, we removed PBGC from our high-risk list in 1995.", "The Congress, however, remains concerned about the long-term financial viability of the pension insurance programs. Because of this concern, you asked us to (1) provide information on the financial condition of the insurance programs and trends in the plans they insure, (2) determine the impact the 1994 legislation has had on the financial condition of PBGC and insured plans, (3) describe risks to PBGC\u2019s solvency, (4) review PBGC\u2019s efforts to forecast its future financial condition, and (5) discuss PBGC\u2019s efforts to improve administration of the programs.", "To provide information on the financial status of PBGC\u2019s insurance programs, trends in insured plans, and the impact of recent pension reform legislation, we analyzed PBGC annual reports and statements of financial condition. We also analyzed annual plan data and studies on insured plans. To describe risks to PBGC, we analyzed trends in plan terminations and resulting PBGC claims. To report on its forecasting methodologies, we reviewed PBGC\u2019s techniques and assumptions used for forecasting the financial condition of the insurance programs. We reviewed our previous work as well as that of the PBGC Office of Inspector General (OIG) and others and examined PBGC efforts to address weaknesses in its administration of the insurance programs. Finally, we interviewed officials from PBGC, pension experts, and actuaries in the private pension community. We conducted our work between October 1997 and September 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) was enacted to better protect participants in private pension plans. Among other things, it established an insurance program, administered by PBGC, to protect the benefits of participants in most private defined benefit pension plans. PBGC was created as a government corporation under title IV of ERISA to encourage the continuation and maintenance of private pension plans, insure the pensions of participants in defined benefit plans, and maintain pension insurance premiums at the lowest level necessary to carry out PBGC\u2019s obligations. PBGC is financed through premiums paid annually by employers that sponsor plans, investment returns on PBGC assets, assets acquired from terminated plans, and recoveries from employers responsible for underfunded terminated plans.", "Employers that sponsor plans control how much they contribute to their pension plans (subject to ERISA\u2019s funding standards). These sponsors estimate plan liabilities on the basis of the characteristics of plan participants and assumptions about the anticipated experience of the plan, such as the expected retirement age and anticipated investment return. Each plan is required to file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) an annual report (form 5500) that lists, among other items, the value of the assets in the plan\u2019s portfolio and an estimate of the plan\u2019s accrued liabilities (the present value of future pension benefits that have been earned to date). Subtracting the estimated liabilities from assets indicates whether the plan is fully funded or has unfunded liabilities under ERISA\u2019s funding standards.", "PBGC may terminate a plan with unfunded liabilities if the plan has not met ERISA\u2019s minimum funding standards; if it will be unable to pay benefits when they are due; if it has made a lump sum distribution of $10,000 or more to a participant who is a substantial owner of the sponsoring firm, leaving the plan with unfunded nonforfeitable benefits; or if the possible long-run loss to PBGC is expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated. PBGC must terminate a plan when it determines a plan is unable to pay current benefits. Generally, a company in financial distress may voluntarily terminate an underfunded plan only if the employer is being liquidated or if the termination is necessary for the company\u2019s survival.", "When a plan is terminated with insufficient assets to pay guaranteed benefits, PBGC takes over the plan: it assumes the plan\u2019s assets and becomes responsible for paying a guaranteed benefit to participants. To do this, PBGC evaluates the plan\u2019s assets and estimates the liabilities it will be responsible for paying. The unfunded liability calculated by PBGC may exceed the unfunded liability reported by the plan because PBGC uses different actuarial assumptions to value plan liabilities. The plan\u2019s unfunded liability for guaranteed benefits then represents a claim against PBGC\u2019s insurance program.", "The single-employer premium has two parts: an annual flat-rate premium of $19 per participant and an additional annual variable rate charge of $9 for each $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits. Before 1994, the variable rate premium was capped at $53 per participant. The RPA of 1994 phased out the cap, increasing premiums for many underfunded single-employer plans, and instituted changes to both improve plan funding and to require that more information be provided to plan participants. For single-employer plans terminating in 1998, the maximum guaranteed benefit for participants aged 65 is about $34,570 per year.", "The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 reformed the multiemployer insurance program. Among the reforms under the 1980 act is the requirement that a firm that withdraws from a plan may be liable for a proportional share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits\u2014a withdrawal liability. Further, in the event of the bankruptcy of a participating firm, the remaining firms are required to assume the additional funding responsibility. According to PBGC officials, because the remaining employers have this funding responsibility, PBGC rarely takes over a multiemployer plan. Instead, if a multiemployer plan is unable to pay benefits, PBGC\u2019s multiemployer insurance program provides financial assistance in the form of a loan to the plan to pay participants their guaranteed benefits. PBGC does not necessarily expect such a plan to be able to repay the loan. PBGC guarantees a portion of multiemployer plan pensions\u2014up to $16.25 per month times the years of credited service up to a maximum of about $5,850 per year. The multiemployer premium is a flat $2.60 per participant per year. The multiemployer program\u2019s maximum benefit guarantee has remained unchanged since 1980.", "An increase in the premium rates for either program would require congressional approval. PBGC receives no funds from federal tax revenues, but it is authorized under ERISA to borrow up to $100 million from the federal treasury.", "ERISA requires that PBGC annually provide an actuarial evaluation of its expected operations and financial status over the next 5 years. In its evaluation, PBGC actually presents three 10-year forecasts for its single-employer program to provide a longer-term view of the financial condition of the program under different scenarios. In addition, ERISA requires PBGC to develop, every 5 years, projections of the potential liabilities the multiemployer insurance program could incur to inform policymakers whether changes in the program\u2019s benefit guarantee or premium might be necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Condition of PBGC\u2019s Single-Employer and Multiemployer Programs Has Improved, but Some Concerns Remain", "paragraphs": ["PBGC\u2019s financial condition has improved greatly over the past few years, and both of its insurance programs currently have a surplus. However, despite this improvement and increased funding levels among the plans PBGC insures, continued underfunding in some large plans remains a concern. Although the number of single-employer plans has declined, the number of participants has increased slightly. The number of multiemployer participants and plans has remained relatively stable despite a decline in the number of active workers in these plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Single-Employer Program and Insured Plans Have Improved, but Underfunding Continues", "paragraphs": ["The single-employer program\u2019s financial condition has improved significantly since 1993, and PBGC reported that the program achieved its first surplus in 1996. As shown in figure 1, the single-employer program moved from a deficit of $2.9 billion in 1993 to a surplus of $3.5 billion in 1997.", "Unprecedented returns on investments are a key factor contributing to PBGC\u2019s improved financial condition. As of September 30, 1997, PBGC\u2019s combined insurance programs had about $15.6 billion in assets available for investment\u2014$9 billion from premiums and $6.6 billion in assets from terminated plans. Investment income, primarily from stocks and fixed-income investments, increased from $927 million in 1996 to almost $2.8 billion in 1997. PBGC\u2019s annual rate of return on investments was 21.9 percent for fiscal year 1997 and averaged 14.4 percent over the past 5 years.", "The financial condition of the single-employer program has also been helped by continued economic growth and the lack of large claims over the past few years. Historically, PBGC\u2019s financial condition has been affected by the financial failure of only a small number of relatively large firms. Claims from terminated underfunded plans and the growth in PBGC\u2019s net liabilities have been concentrated over short periods of time and in specific industries. The largest claims came from 10 firms that terminated 46 plans in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Claims from these 10 firms accounted for more than half the dollar amount of all PBGC claims from 1975 to 1997.", "The number of single-employer plans insured by PBGC has declined significantly since the mid-1980s; however, the number of participants has increased slightly. The number of plans fell by more than 50 percent, from about 112,000 in 1986 to about 43,000 in 1997. The decline in single-employer plans resulted mostly from terminations of small plans\u2014those with fewer than 100 participants\u2014and mergers of larger plans. Offsetting the decline in the number of small plans has been growth in the number of plans with 10,000 or more participants. As a result, the number of participants in single-employer plans increased slightly, from about 30 million in 1986 to about 33 million in 1997, despite the decline in the number of plans.", "The funding level of many single-employer plans has increased but underfunding, especially among a few large plans, continues. Using PBGC termination assumptions, about 45 percent of all plans were overfunded while 55 percent were underfunded as of the end of 1995. However, 70 percent of covered participants and 80 percent of vested liabilities were in plans that were at least 90-percent funded, according to PBGC assumptions. For underfunded plans, the average funding ratio (percentage of assets accumulated to pay vested benefits) increased from 74 percent in 1986 to 87 percent in 1996.", "Plans with funding ratios under 50 percent have accounted for 76 percent of PBGC\u2019s claims since 1975, while plans with funding ratios of 75 percent or better have accounted for only 3 percent of PBGC claims. The amount of underfunding increased from about $15 billion in 1986 to about $64 billion in 1996, largely because of the decline in discount rates (over 3 percent) used by PBGC. Some plans that had previously been fully funded became slightly underfunded as a result of the decline in interest rates. The strong financial condition of these plans, however, improved the average funding ratio for all underfunded plans.", "The amount of overfunding in plans declined from $228 billion in 1986 to about $103 billion in 1996. Similarly, the average funding ratio of overfunded plans declined during this period from 165 percent to 117 percent, primarily because of the fall in interest rates and increases in plan liabilities. The enactment of more restrictive full funding limits in 1987 resulted in lower employer contributions to fully funded plans and contributed to the decline in funding ratios.", "Underfunding remains a concern because the underfunding of a few large plans or underfunding in several plans in certain industries poses a long-term risk to PBGC solvency. Most of the claims against PBGC\u2019s single-employer program have come from \u201cflat-benefit\u201d plans that cover hourly workers in unionized companies. Unlike most other defined benefit plans, flat-benefit plans do not fully anticipate future benefit increases in their funding calculations. Because benefits are often increased at regular intervals as part of contract negotiations, new liabilities are added to the plan before old ones are fully funded, thereby leaving the plans chronically underfunded.", "Two features in the design of the pension insurance program have made it hard for PBGC to control the exposure it faces from underfunded pension plans. First, ERISA\u2019s minimum funding standards do not ensure that plan sponsors will contribute enough so that if the plans terminate, they will have sufficient assets to cover all the promised benefits. Second, the premiums that PBGC charges pension plans do not fully cover the risks that PBGC assumes. These premiums do not insure plans against a specified and limited shortfall in assets but rather against any underfunding, up to the maximum benefit guarantee per participant, no matter how large. Thus, premiums are only partially exposure-related, which enables a sponsoring company to engage in practices that reduce the level of plan assets knowing that if the plans terminate before benefits are fully funded, the responsibility for paying guaranteed benefits will fall on PBGC.", "Despite PBGC\u2019s improved financial condition, its current federal budgetary treatment may not adequately reflect the potential cost of the insurance programs. Previously, we reported that under the cash-based federal budget, PBGC\u2019s annual net cash flows help reduce the annual federal budget deficit. However, PBGC\u2019s growing liabilities (funded and unfunded) from the plans it insures increase the amount of its long-term commitment to pay pension benefits. Liabilities from plans taken over by PBGC and its exposure to future claims from insuring currently healthy firms\u2014that is, the risk assumed by the government in general\u2014are not recognized in the budget. If budget amounts were reported on an accrual basis, the long-term cost of the insurance commitment would be apparent at the time the insurance was extended. The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) risk-assumed estimate for future PBGC costs\u2014that is, the portion of a full risk-based premium not charged to PBGC-insured plans\u2014was approximately $30 billion at the end of fiscal year 1997. This estimate contrasts with the $21 billion to $23 billion of \u201creasonably possible exposure\u201d that PBGC reported in note 9 of its 1997 financial statements.We have recommended that PBGC (and other agencies operating insurance programs) develop and provide cost information in the budget document on a risk-assumed basis, in addition to the cash-based budget information it currently provides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiemployer Program Remains Financially Stable, but Trends in Plans Are Cause for Concern", "paragraphs": ["PBGC\u2019s multiemployer program has been in surplus almost since the program was reformed in 1980 (see fig. 2). With assets of $596 million and liabilities of $377 million, the multiemployer program had a surplus of $219 million in fiscal year 1997, up from $124 million in 1996. The surplus had declined in recent fiscal years as the program incurred losses of $79 million in 1994, $5 million in 1995, and $68 million in 1996. The losses resulted primarily from the increase in PBGC\u2019s allowance for uncollectible future loans for two plans.", "Since 1980, PBGC\u2019s multiemployer program has provided approximately $35 million in loans to 19 plans. In 1997, the program provided about $4 million in loans to 14 plans. For about the next 10 or 20 years, PBGC estimates that about $361 million will be needed to cover future loans to the 14 plans currently receiving assistance as well as loans to other plans expected to require assistance in the future. Generally, PBGC does not expect that multiemployer plans receiving financial assistance will necessarily be able to repay the loans. In January 1998, however, the Anthracite Fund repaid $3.2 million in loans it received from PBGC during the 1980s. This plan became the first to repay a PBGC financial assistance loan.", "Overall, funding among multiemployer plans has improved since enactment of the 1980 reforms. In 1980, multiemployer plans as a group reported a funding ratio (ratio of accumulated assets of all plans to the sum of their estimated liabilities) of 77 percent. By 1994, the overall funding ratio had increased to 105 percent, and overfunding among multiemployer plans totaled about $12.6 billion. Similarly, the funding ratio of underfunded plans has also improved since 1980. The recent high rates of return on plan investments have reduced the level of underfunding in some plans despite lower interest rates. The average funding ratio in underfunded plans increased from 58 percent in 1980 to 80 percent in 1994. The amount of underfunding decreased from about $35 billion to $27.4 billion during the same period.", "The number of multiemployer plans and participants has remained relatively stable since the early 1980s. In 1980, approximately 2,000 plans covered about 8.3 million participants; in 1997, about 2,000 plans covered about 8.8 million participants. The distribution of multiemployer plan participants by industry also remained relatively unchanged. In 1980, the construction, manufacturing, and transportation industries had about 5.9 million participants, or 71 percent of plan participants. In 1994, these industries had about 5.3 million participants, or 65 percent of plan participants. The construction industry alone had 2.8 million participants.", "There has been, however, a substantial decline in the number of active workers in multiemployer plans because many of these plans are in declining industries that are hiring few new workers. But because many workers are retiring or are vested and moving to other employment, the number of covered participants has remained relatively stable. Multiemployer plan contributions are based primarily on two factors: (1) administrative expenses and \u201cnormal costs\u201d (costs to fund retirement benefits that active workers accrue each year) and (2) costs of plan modifications or deviation of plan experience from expectations. Payments or credits for these latter costs are amortized over a period of between 15 and 30 years. However, as active workers retire, contributions for normal costs fall and payments for retirees\u2019 benefits increase. If such retirements occurred unexpectedly or in large numbers, the plan\u2019s financial condition could deteriorate.", "For an adequate contribution base (ratio of active workers to other participants), the plans primarily depend on new employers joining or existing employers staying in and hiring new workers. The rate of growth in active workers provides a measure of the ability of the plan to fund its liabilities. Further, this growth tends to be correlated with the health of the industry covered by the plan.", "Despite the improvement in multiemployer plan funding since 1980, some large plans remain underfunded and could pose a risk to the multiemployer program. In 1986, we reported that the multiemployer program was jeopardized by an eroding contribution base. The number of active workers in multiemployer plans declined from about 6.4 million in 1980 (almost 76 percent of all participants) to about 4.4 million in 1994 (just 54 percent of participants). A continued erosion in contribution bases could eventually cause some plans to be unable to generate sufficient income under current funding rules to pay benefits, thereby increasing the number of plans requiring loans from the multiemployer insurance program. However, in its 1996 report on the financial condition of the multiemployer program, PBGC reported that it expected the multiemployer insurance program to remain financially strong, even with the decline in the contribution base.", "Many of the multiemployer plans with sizable underfunding are in industries such as manufacturing and transportation, which may continue to experience further decline in the number of active workers. On the basis of 1993-94 form 5500 data, PBGC identified 50 multiemployer plans (about 3 percent of all insured multiemployer plans) with underfunding of about $21 billion. Underfunding is worsened by benefit increases obtained through collective bargaining. Given the declining contribution bases and continuing benefit increases, it could be difficult for the underfunded plans to substantially improve their funding levels.", "Pending legislation in the 105th Congress (S. 1501) would, among other things, increase funding and reporting requirements for multiemployer plans and prohibit benefit increases if a plan was less than 95-percent funded. Recognizing that less than 1 percent of participants in multiemployer plans projected to become insolvent have their benefits fully guaranteed, the legislation also would increase the annual maximum guaranteed benefit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Effects of Recent Legislation on PBGC and Plan Funding Are Currently Difficult to Determine", "paragraphs": ["It is difficult to isolate the effects of RPA, the 1994 pension legislation, on PBGC\u2019s financial condition and plan funding levels from other important factors, such as the growth in the stock market or economic expansion. In addition to enhancing PBGC\u2019s regulatory authority and increasing participant protection through broadened reporting requirements, RPA strengthened funding requirements for single-employer plans. For plans that are less than 90-percent funded, RPA increased funding in three ways: accelerating the funding formula for certain benefit increases, constraining the assumptions used for calculating minimum contributions, and adding a new solvency rule to ensure that plans can pay current benefits.", "A comprehensive analysis of the effects of RPA requires more recent plan data than are currently available because of the time lag in filing plan annual reports. Plans are not required to file form 5500 reports until 210 days after the close of the plan year, and IRS processing time requirements further delay data availability. Even when the necessary data become available, it will be difficult to determine the extent to which RPA alone contributed to the improved financial condition of PBGC and insured plans.", "However, an increase in PBGC\u2019s premium income suggests that the legislation probably had a positive impact on PBGC\u2019s financial condition. As figure 3 shows, premium income from single employers rose from $890 million in 1993 to $1.1 billion in 1996 and fell slightly in 1997. PBGC expects that premium income may further decline as the statutory interest rate under RPA, the interest rate used to calculate the underfunding on which premiums are based, increases. Also, around the year 2000, the measure of plan assets may change from an actuarial value to a generally higher fair market value. The expected increase in the ratio of plan assets to liabilities may reduce both the reported amount of plan underfunding and the variable premiums based on this underfunding.", "RPA also resulted in increased plan contributions. A PBGC official told us that some sponsors with large underfunded plans made more than the minimum required contributions to lower the amount of premiums they would have to pay. Also, some sponsors increased their plans\u2019 funding ratios instead of having to report to plan participants that the plans were underfunded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite PBGC\u2019s Improved Financial Condition, Long-Term Risks Remain", "paragraphs": ["Although PBGC\u2019s financial condition has significantly improved over the past few years, risks remain from the possibility of an overall economic downturn or a decline in certain sectors of the economy, substantial drops in interest rates, and actions by sponsors that reduce plan assets.

If such a downturn were to occur either nationwide or in those industries with mature underfunded plans (plans in which many workers are less than 15 years from retirement) and several large underfunded plans terminated, PBGC could be obligated to take on additional benefit obligations, which could drastically reduce its net financial position. For example, bankruptcies in the airline and steel industries during the past 15 years resulted in large claims against PBGC. Terminations of 10 underfunded pension plans by Eastern Air Lines and Pan American Airways resulted in about $1.3 billion in PBGC claims. Similarly, terminations of underfunded plans in the steel industry, including plans from Wheeling Pitt Steel, Sharon Steel, and LTV Republic Steel, resulted in almost $1.4 billion in claims. Terminations from these two industries alone account for almost half of PBGC\u2019s total claims. PBGC estimates that its reasonably possible future loss exposure is primarily from single-employer plans in the steel, airline, industrial and commercial equipment, and transportation equipment industries.", "An overall economic downturn could have three effects on PBGC\u2019s financial condition. First, more financially troubled companies might terminate their underfunded plans, resulting in increased claims against PBGC. Second, as plan terminations rose, PBGC\u2019s premium base could erode, lowering premium income. Finally, a recession or a substantial decline in the stock market could adversely affect the value of and income from PBGC\u2019s assets. (This could also occur for individual pension plans.) The value of PBGC\u2019s assets and income from them could decline at the same time that claims from the increased number of plans taken over by PBGC raised benefit payments. The combination of lower premium income and greater benefit payments could limit PBGC\u2019s ability to set aside investment assets to help meet its new obligations to pay future benefits and could require PBGC to liquidate some assets to pay expenses.

If the plan terminated after one or a series of benefit increases, PBGC could end up paying part or all of the unamortized liability. Other methods a plan sponsor can use to shift its pension liabilities onto PBGC are to (1) forgo making its required contribution to the pension plan either legally through IRS waivers or illegally, (2) sell a subsidiary with an underfunded plan to a financially troubled buyer, or (3) use the plan\u2019s assets to pay business expenses.

PBGC does not have the regulatory authority available to other federal insurance programs, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), to help protect itself from risks. Instead, PBGC uses moral suasion and negotiation to encourage improved funding. In fiscal year 1991, PBGC created a Corporate Finance and Negotiations Department to identify and work with sponsors whose plans posed a risk to the agency. Through this department, PBGC targets companies that represent the biggest risks to its insurance programs and negotiates additional plan protections when it identifies problems. For example, PBGC had published its Top 50 list of companies with the largest amount of pension plan underfunding, hoping that public identification of large underfunded plans and discussions with troubled sponsors would persuade them to take corrective action to better fund their pension plans.", "If negotiating with the companies that pose the greatest risk fails to improve their funding, PBGC can terminate these plans. In such cases, PBGC assumes responsibility for the plans\u2019 liabilities either through agreement with the plans\u2019 sponsors or through a court order. Even when PBGC can terminate a plan, it tries to avoid doing so because such action is onerous to all involved. For example, in terminating a plan, PBGC would incur a claim that it would have to pay; participants still working under the plan would stop accruing benefits, resulting in lower future benefits; and retirees whose benefits exceeded the maximum guarantee level, whose benefits were recently increased, or who were receiving supplemental benefits might have their benefits reduced. Further, the plan sponsor might spend time and money to try to protect its own assets from court claims filed by PBGC on behalf of the plan for missed contributions and on behalf of itself for the recovery of the unfunded benefit liability.

However, PBGC\u2019s current methodology for forecasting the financial status of its single-employer program is relatively unsophisticated and does not capture the high degree of uncertainty surrounding potential future claims. PBGC is already using an improved methodology for forecasting the financial condition of the multiemployer program.", "Currently, PBGC relies on extrapolations of its past claims experience and past economic conditions to develop 10-year forecasts of the single-employer program\u2019s financial condition. The actuarial assumptions PBGC uses for these forecasts are consistent with assumptions used to prepare PBGC\u2019s financial statements.", "Recognizing the weaknesses of its current single-employer forecasting methodology, PBGC is developing a new approach to forecast its exposure to future claims under a wide range of possible future economic conditions. The model, called the Pension Insurance Modeling System (PIMS), is designed to simulate pension funding and bankruptcy rates over a 30-year period. The model generates estimates of average expected claims and probability measures of the uncertainty surrounding the estimates under various economic and policy scenarios. PBGC, working with outside reviewers, has extensively tested PIMS over the past few years and intends to use PIMS as its forecasting tool beginning in fiscal year 1999. For its fiscal year 1998 annual report, PBGC plans to generate forecasts of its financial condition using both PIMS and its current methodology. PBGC will also continue to use PIMS for internal research.", "PBGC uses a different model for forecasting the financial condition of the multiemployer program. The Multiemployer Insolvency Projection (MIP) uses plan-specific historical data to determine whether a plan would become insolvent under a set of economic assumptions over a 15-year period. For those plans projected to become insolvent, MIP calculates the present value of the future financial assistance that would be required from PBGC.", "MIP is an improvement over PBGC\u2019s earlier approach to estimating future multiemployer program liabilities. Previously, PBGC used a methodology developed for a review of the program after passage of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act. This method relied primarily on collecting data on all multiemployer plans from 1980 to 1986, identifying plans with deteriorated financial condition that could lead to insolvency, and estimating the required PBGC financial assistance. MIP allows PBGC to examine the potential effects on the multiemployer program assuming that each plan\u2019s recent history continues and to test the program\u2019s ability to withstand a variety of economic and demographic changes. MIP is less sophisticated than PIMS and does not attempt to assign probabilities to plan insolvency.

As a result of the lack of documentation and support, PBGC could not substantiate the reasonableness of its actuarial assumptions and estimation techniques, and we were unable to evaluate the reliability of PBGC\u2019s estimated liability. Further, PBGC had significant system and control weaknesses in its premium and accounting operations. For example, between 1988 and 1992, PBGC was unable to fully perform basic premium processing, collecting, accounting, and enforcement functions because its premium processing system was not modified in time to accommodate the variable-rate premium structure that became effective in 1988. PBGC also lacked an integrated financial system for processing financial data and preparing financial statements and instead relied on time-consuming and labor-intensive processes to support operations and financial/budgetary reporting.", "PBGC has made significant progress in addressing the systems and internal control weaknesses in its operations. By 1993, PBGC had substantially improved its valuation systems and internal controls for estimating its liability for future benefits, allowing us, for the first time, to express an opinion on its 1993 financial statements. PBGC has also taken steps to improve its premium processing system. In 1992, PBGC began limited manual processing to generate bills and subsequently collected almost $60 million owed for certain past-due premiums, interest, and penalties.
