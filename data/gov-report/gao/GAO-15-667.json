While certification does not ensure that a building meets all requirements, agencies have developed tools to ensure that any remaining federal requirements are implemented at their buildings, and officials noted that there are additional benefits to using these systems. For example, officials stated that certification provides a well-established framework for documenting and ensuring compliance; serves as a tool to communicate with contractors and the public; and reduces the need for additional staff to verify that a building meets requirements. Of the select agencies GAO reviewed, none require third-party certification for existing buildings, but three have developed their own systems for assessing the implementation of key requirements for existing buildings. Several agencies stated that they are not certain how they will use third-party certification systems in the future after the revisions to key green building requirements are issued. For example, EPA and VA officials stated that they may reevaluate their requirement to certify specific projects after the revised green building requirements are issued.", "Regardless of whether they use certification systems, the agencies GAO reviewed identified a variety of challenges in implementing current green building requirements, including challenges related to their building inventories, missions, and the criteria for evaluating compliance. For example, DOD officials said that the sheer number of buildings in their inventory proves challenging. In addition, according to officials from several agencies, their building inventories include certain building types, such as laboratories, hospitals, and industrial buildings for which some requirements are difficult to implement. VA cited mission concerns, including new safety requirements and extended hours to address patient backlogs, as a challenge to implementing energy and water conservation requirements. Also, some agency officials said that the criteria for evaluating compliance with the requirements can be a disincentive to implementing some requirements because no credit is received unless all of the requirements are implemented. Forthcoming revisions to key green building requirements may address some of these challenges.

VA  and Air Force officials noted that while a general crosswalk would be a  good starting point, they would need to customize it based on their  specific needs. For example, VA officials stated that they use the health  care facilities-specific certification for medical centers, which is not very   Officials from several agencies (DOE,  common across the federal government, and they would have to make  sure that a general crosswalk made sense for those buildings. Air Force  officials stated that the DOD policy and its crosswalk will be updated  when the Guiding Principles are revised; in the past when updating DOD  policy they used GSA guidance and customized it through the \u201cDOD  lens.\u201d", "Officials from agencies we spoke with said that their agencies use  different tools to ensure that remaining federal requirements are  implemented at their buildings after third-party certification. Several  agencies developed guidance for project managers. For example,  according to VA officials, its Sustainable Design Manual was developed  to be a one-stop shop for new construction and major renovations,  including guidance on how to meet requirements that are not covered by  obtaining third-party certification. Several agencies (EPA, VA, Navy, Air  Force, and Army) have developed a checklist that project managers must  submit. The checklists provide guidance on what is needed to meet the  requirements through third-party certification and by other means. The  Army and Air Force checklists provide the text of the requirement, the  statutory or executive source, and specific design elements that can be  included to meet the requirement. Several agencies we spoke with (DOE,  EPA, GSA, and VA) require specific language in contracts to ensure that  contractors comply with all requirements, even those that did not align  with the third-party certification system.", "In addition to helping agencies implement key federal green building  requirements, agency officials and building energy managers (DOE, EPA,  GSA, Army, Air Force, Navy, OASD EI&E, and VA) that we spoke with  mentioned other benefits of using third-party certification, including the  following:  Provides a well-established framework. Some third-party certification  systems are recognized industry standards and familiar to contractors. An  interagency group co-chaired by DOD, DOE, and GSA found that the  main benefit of using third-party certification systems is that they have a  robust infrastructure that is able to keep up with an evolving  marketplace. Furthermore, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  reported that some federal agencies found the systems to be useful tools  for documenting and tracking a building\u2019s progress toward meeting  requirements in its review of third-party certification systems. In addition,  these systems offer frameworks for reducing energy and water use in  buildings, compared with design approaches and practices used for  conventional buildings, according to the National Research Council\u2019s  review. The National Research Council\u2019s review also found that these  systems can help establish explicit and traceable objectives for future  building performance and a feedback loop to determine if the objectives  were met. VA building-level officials stated that, because of the strict  documentation requirements, they use a third-party certification system  as a guide even when they do not pursue formal certification.", "Reduces need for additional staff. DOD officials (Air Force, Army, and  Navy) stated that using third-party certification reduces the need for  additional staff to conduct certain activities. Specifically, current staff  would have an increased workload or agencies would need additional  personnel if they used their own system to validate a building\u2019s  compliance with the key requirements. Air Force headquarters and  building-level officials stated they do not have sufficient personnel to  implement their own system and that using a third-party eliminates the  need to rely on staff to ensure a building complies with key requirements.  A Navy official stated that third-party certification provides a level of  subject matter expertise that their staff currently do not have. Army  officials also stated that third-party certifiers already have the subject  matter expertise and for the government to gain that level of expertise  would require significant time and effort.", "Serves as a communication tool. Officials from some agencies (Army,  EPA, and OASD EI&E) and GSA building-level officials said that  certification can be used as a tool to communicate the agencies\u2019  sustainability efforts with its own staff, the public, and contractors.  According to Army and OASD EI&E officials, third-party certification  provides a common language across industry and government to  evaluate and measure sustainability features. GSA building-level officials  told us that obtaining certification was an important method for them to  communicate GSA\u2019s sustainability efforts to the public. Specifically, third- party certification provided a recognizable label to show the public the  agency\u2019s use of sustainable practices in the recent renovation of a large  federal office building. EPA officials we spoke with stated that because a  third-party system is a trusted brand it is like a building received a seal of  approval.", "According to some agency headquarters and building-level officials (Air  Force, Army, EPA, and Navy), although third-party certification can  reduce the need for additional staff resources, certification is a resource- intense process. Some agency headquarters and building-level officials  (Air Force, Army, Navy, and EPA) stated that the current process to  complete certification involves some costs. The monetary costs for  certification vary project-to-project, according to several agency officials  (Air Force, EPA, and VA). GSA and DOE building-level officials said that  it was difficult to isolate the cost of certifying their buildings because  certification fees were paid for by the contractors designing and  constructing the building, so these costs are included as part of the  overall contract award. Officials from GSA stated that the cost of certifying  a new construction or major renovation project is, on average, 0.012  percent of the total project budget. A study completed in 2004 for GSA  estimated that the documentation costs associated with obtaining LEED  certification ranged from about $22,000 to about $34,000 per project,  although GSA officials told us that since 2004 these costs have  decreased as the market has changed. According to Green Building  Initiative representatives, the typical total agency costs for Green Globes  certification are about $12,000 to $30,000 per project. In addition to  certification fees, some agencies also allocate staff resources for  administrative purposes, such as reviewing the documentation submitted  by contractors. Representatives of one third-party certification system  stated that, in working with federal agencies, they have found that the  biggest element of the cost of certification for the agencies is the agency  staff time. A Navy official stated that the time needed to complete all of  the documentation was a limitation because staff have other higher- priority responsibilities. According to Army officials, documentation to  support certification also could be particularly challenging for less  experienced project teams or for small contractors. Despite the current  staff resources needed to oversee third-party certification, Army officials  stated that it is still less expensive to use a third-party system than to  develop, execute, and oversee their own. The costs for the Army to obtain  third-party certification are negligible relative to the costs of the design  elements needed to meet key requirements, according to these officials.", "Officials from several agencies we spoke with are not certain how they  will use third-party certification systems in the future. Air Force officials  stated that they are currently updating the implementing guidance for its  sustainability policy. As part of DOD\u2019s process, OASD EI&E and Air Force  officials are determining how the use of third-party certification for new  construction projects will be most valuable to help ensure and  demonstrate compliance with federal requirements, which could include  the use of certification systems aimed specifically at assessing  compliance with the Guiding Principles. According to EPA and VA  officials, the agencies may reevaluate the use of third-party certification  depending on the new version of the Guiding Principles. A DOE official  said that it will continue to allow the use of third-party certification but may  not require it anymore.", "While none of the five select agencies require third-party certification of  existing buildings, three agencies (EPA, GSA, and VA) developed their  own systems for assessing the implementation of key requirements at  existing buildings. GSA developed a methodology using a third-party  certification system\u2013LEED Volume Program for Operations and  Maintenance\u2013as a framework to identify the type of documentation  needed to achieve certification, as well as compliance with key federal  requirements. GSA mapped each of the Guiding Principles, federal  regulations, and mandates, and the agency\u2019s operational policies against  one or more LEED for Existing Buildings credit categories. It found that, in  some cases, GSA\u2019s policies were more restrictive than LEED\u2019s and, in  other cases, LEED\u2019s requirements were more restrictive. The  methodology GSA developed requires a building to meet the most  restrictive category, whether it is based on the third-party certification  system or GSA policy. According to GSA, project teams can meet  approximately 80 percent of key requirements by obtaining LEED- Certified for Existing Buildings Operations and Maintenance. In addition,  on an annual basis, GSA officials said that they use the LEED Volume  Program for Operations and Maintenance to pursue certification for  approximately one existing building in each of its 11 regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Face Challenges Implementing Key Requirements Based on Their Building Inventories, Missions, and Competing Priorities", "paragraphs": ["Select agencies face challenges implementing key federal green building  requirements because of the characteristics of their building inventories,  mission-related concerns, competing priorities, and the criteria used to  evaluate compliance with the Guiding Principles, which can be a  disincentive to implementing some requirements.

Air Force officials told us that the majority of the existing building  inventory incorporated the building standards in place at the time they  were constructed and, as a result, have mechanical or other systems that  do not incorporate current requirements. In addition, VA officials said that  existing buildings are more difficult than new construction because certain  design features that could help implement requirements such as passive  solar\u2014a building design that uses structural elements of a building to  heat and cool it without the use of mechanical equipment\u2014in many cases  can only be incorporated when constructing a new building, or with  greatly increased technical difficulty and cost in existing buildings. These  officials said that retrofitting an existing building is also challenging if the  building is occupied because occupants may require relocation, which  entails moving and other costs. In addition, according to OASD EI&E  officials, in some cases, existing buildings may have been inadequately  maintained as a result of funding shortfalls. In January 2003, we  designated federal real property as a high-risk area, in part, due to the  deteriorating condition of some government facilities. We previously  reported that the deteriorated conditions were due, in part, to the age of  many federal facilities (often over 50 years old) and other factors that  resulted in agencies deferring some maintenance and repair of their  facilities. We reported that delaying or deferring routine maintenance  and repairs can, in the short term, diminish the performance of these  systems and, in the long term, shorten service life. In addition, we have  previously reported on opportunities to concurrently address deferred  maintenance and repair backlogs and reduce energy consumption. For  example, in January 2009, we concluded that agencies can replace old  systems\u2014such as heating and air conditioning, electrical, and plumbing\u2014 with new, more efficient systems that would lead to energy savings and  reduce or eliminate deferred maintenance and repair associated with the  systems.", "DOD officials (Army and OASD EI&E) said that the sheer number of  existing buildings in their portfolios is a challenge.
