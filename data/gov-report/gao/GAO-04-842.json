Each of the bureau's divisions and other organizational units that manage IT projects performs integrated planning for its respective IT projects. However, the plans do not provide a common, authoritative, and integrated view of how IT investments will help optimize mission performance, and they do not consistently contain the elements expected to be found in effective systems modernization plans. FBI officials attributed the state of modernization planning to, among other things, the bureau's lack of a policy requiring such activities, which is due in part to the fact that the responsibility for managing IT--including modernization planning--has historically been diffused and decentralized. The FBI's CIO recognizes these planning shortfalls and has initiated efforts to address them. Until they are addressed, the bureau risks acquiring systems that require expensive rework to be effectively integrated, thus hampering organizational transformation. The FBI has established policies and procedures governing IT human capital that are consistent with best practices used by leading private and public organizations. However, the bureau's policies and procedures governing systems acquisition, which are developed on a decentralized basis by the divisions and other units that manage IT projects, include some but not all best practices. In addition, the bureau's investment management policies and procedures, which started in 2001, have been evolving and progressing slowly toward alignment with best practices. According to FBI officials, the state of the bureau's acquisition and investment management policies and procedures is due to a number of factors, including diffused and decentralized IT management authority. The CIO recognizes these problems and has efforts planned and under way to strengthen policies and procedures.

Similarly, the  Laboratory division stores records of known criminals on the Combined  DNA Index System to compare with DNA evidence submitted by federal,  state, and local law enforcement agencies. The FBI reports that it  collectively manages hundreds of systems, networks, databases,  applications, and associated IT tools at an average annual cost of about  $800 million.

The weaknesses included not  having (1) a policy that ensures consistent implementation of configuration  management activities, (2) processes to ensure adequate definition of  system requirements, and (3) an agencywide systems life cycle  methodology.

Specifically, the  Inspector General reported that the bureau did not have a complete  process for selecting new IT investments and was not following a  disciplined process for controlling ongoing projects. To address this, the  Inspector General made a series of recommendations aimed at  implementing the processes and practices defined in our IT investment  management framework. In a January 2004 follow-on report, the  Inspector General stated that, while the bureau had developed plans to  address these recommendations, full development and implementation of  the plans\u2014and thus the establishment of effective investment management  processes\u2014remained to be completed.", "More recently, between September 2003 and March 2004, we reported on  the challenges the FBI faced in establishing effective IT modernization  management.

Accordingly, we made  recommendations to help the bureau establish the architecture  management capabilities needed to develop, implement, and maintain an  enterprise architecture. The FBI agreed with our recommendations and is  in the process of implementing them. In addition, in March 2004, we  reported that the FBI has not benefited from having sustained IT  management leadership with bureauwide authority. Specifically, the  bureau\u2019s key leadership and management positions, including the position  of the CIO, had experienced frequent turnover, and the position of the CIO  lacked bureauwide authority over IT. We found that historically much of  the responsibility and authority for managing IT\u2014including modernization  planning, human capital management, systems acquisition management,  and investment selection and control\u2014was dispersed among the bureau\u2019s  divisions.

According to the Inspector General\u2019s September 2003 report, Trilogy  funding grew from an original estimate of $379.8 million to $596 million,  due in part to the lack of integration planning for one of the three  components of Trilogy. In addition, the Inspector General reported that the  original delivery date for Trilogy\u2019s first two components (Transportation  Network Component and Information Presentation Component) slipped 8  months, in part due to inadequately defined requirements. In March 2004,  the Inspector General testified that the continued series of missed  completion estimates and associated cost growth were due to, among other  things, poorly defined requirements, project management deficiencies,  frequent turnover of FBI IT managers, and the FBI\u2019s focus on its other  important law enforcement challenges.", "In addition, in September 2003, we reported that the bureau lacked an  enterprise architecture\u2014a key component in developing and modernizing  systems. We found that the absence of the architecture contributed to  unnecessary rework to integrate several modernization initiatives,  including Trilogy. In March 2004, we testified that the bureau\u2019s  weaknesses in IT management controls, such as investment management  and enterprise architecture, contributed to Trilogy schedule delays of at  least 21 months and cost increases of about $120 million.", "Moreover, the National Research Council reported in May 2004 that the  bureau was experiencing significant challenges in developing and  implementing Trilogy.

In addition, OMB provides guidance to federal  agencies on such planning. As part of this planning, agencies are  supposed to identify, understand, and manage interdependencies within  and across individual IT systems modernization projects. Key elements of  effective integrated project planning include  linking all IT projects to the organization\u2019s mission and related strategic   identifying and demonstrating gaps in mission performance due to,  among other things, weak or nonexistent integration among existing  projects, services, systems, databases, networks, or tools;    defining interdependencies among IT projects, including the business  processes to be supported and technical system interface requirements;   assigning responsibilities and management structures for coordinating  and overseeing IT project interdependencies;   identifying the risks associated with project interdependencies and  developing strategies to mitigate the risks; and  ensuring that affected organizations provide input and commitment to  plan development and implementation.", "Addressing these elements, among other things, identifies the points where  systems are to be integrated and establishes common ground for  interproject planning and management, which is essential to ensuring that  project plans\u2014and thus system solutions\u2014are effectively integrated. Our  prior reviews at federal agencies and research on IT management have  shown that attempting to modernize IT systems without performing such  planning increases the risk of investing in system solutions that are  duplicative, are not well integrated, are unnecessarily costly to maintain  and interface, and do not effectively optimize mission performance.  Accordingly, until agencies develop integrated approaches, we have  recommended limiting IT spending to cost-effective efforts that are  congressionally directed; are near-term, relatively small, and low-risk  opportunities to leverage technology in satisfying a compelling agency  need; support operations and maintenance of existing mission-critical  systems; involve deploying an already developed and fully tested system; or  support establishing integrated planning and other modernization  management controls and capabilities.", "The FBI does not have a bureauwide integrated plan or set of plans for its  many systems modernization projects. Instead, divisions have developed  modernization plans covering solely those IT projects that are within their  respective lines of authority. These plans include (1) division plans that  describe to varying degrees how IT projects are to be executed to support  the accomplishment of division-specific objectives and (2) capital asset  plans and business cases\u2014commonly referred to as budget Exhibit 300s\u2014 that justify the resources needed for the division\u2019s major IT projects.  However, these plans are not integrated and do not consistently  demonstrate the elements of integrated IT project planning. Specifically, of  the six FBI divisions we examined, two divisions\u2014Cyber and CJIS\u2014 included the majority of the elements of integrated project planning, while  the other four divisions each incorporated two or fewer of the elements.  Table 3 summarizes our analysis.", "More specifically, our analysis for each of the modernization planning  elements showed the following:  With respect to the first element, two divisions\u2014Cyber and the Program  Management Office\u2014consistently linked their projects to either the  bureau\u2019s strategic plan or its top 10 priorities. The other divisions linked  at least some of their individual projects to bureau-level strategy.  Linking individual projects to the FBI\u2019s strategic plan is an essential step  to ensuring that the bureau IT initiatives do not overlap or leave gaps in  mission functions and goals.", "Only two divisions (CJIS and Security) identified and demonstrated  gaps in existing capabilities. CJIS undertook an analysis of system  deficiencies and technology trends to identify and specify  improvements to its law enforcement systems. Security relied on prior  reviews of security incidents and comparisons of existing practices with  best practices to identify needed improvements in system security  requirements. Other divisions largely stated the need for improvements  in system capabilities and capacity without corresponding data on  current or projected mission shortfalls. This is crucial because without  supporting data to derive performance gaps, proposed improvements  may be unnecessary, insufficient, or not identified at all. In addition, our  research and experience with federal IT modernizations show that  projects with inadequately defined improvements are likely to require  more resources to plan and manage\u2014including planning and  management of interdependencies\u2014than those that have been based on  reliable performance data and thorough analysis.", "All of the divisions addressed the third element, in part, but only two  divisions\u2014Cyber and CJIS\u2014fully identified interdependencies for all of  their projects. For example, CJIS identified interrelationships among  business processes, systems, databases, networks, components, and  tools. The Investigative Technology Division, on the other hand, did not  consistently identify interdependencies for tools, networks, or security.  In addition, Security did not fully identify technical and programmatic  interdependencies. Identifying project interdependencies is essential for  recognizing the points of integration of projects and systems and for  establishing common ground for interproject planning and management.", "The CJIS and Security divisions had the most robust mechanisms for  coordinating their project interdependencies with other parts of the  bureau and with external organizations. CJIS relies on its Advisory  Policy Board to identify needed improvements, assess impacts to  customers and their systems, and coordinate schedules and interfaces.  Security collaborates with system owners and managers through  division configuration and change control boards, the security  certification and accreditation process, and other mechanisms to  integrate its security projects and information assurance objectives.  Both divisions have well-defined responsibilities for their project team  members. Other divisions focused on coordination within individual  project teams or a single division, leaving mechanisms for interacting  with other divisions, systems, and technologies poorly defined. This is  important because vague responsibilities and processes for managing  project integration efforts can lead to omissions and conflicts in system  interfaces and project activities.", "The fifth element was satisfied by four of the six divisions. Specifically,  Cyber, CJIS, Investigative Technology, and the Program Management  Office consistently addressed integration risks in their capital asset  plans and business cases. Doing this is important because it allows for  the systematic identification of risks associated with project  interdependencies and management action to mitigate those risks.", "Finally, the CJIS and Cyber divisions enlisted participation and  commitment from organizations affected by their projects and related  system improvements. For instance, CJIS partnered with the advisory  boards and councils, the vendor community, and the nation\u2019s criminal  justice community in successfully developing its systems. Other  divisions, such as Investigative Technology and the Program  Management Office, fell short of meeting this criterion because they did  not consistently specify a means for project personnel to collaborate  with other stakeholders on the development of integrated project plans.  Establishing such a means for knowledgeable personnel to contribute to  planning for interdependencies in areas such as project requirements,  interfaces, and timetables is key to ensuring stakeholder commitment to  project integration plans and their execution.", "FBI officials from each of the divisions agreed with the results of our  analyses of their respective planning efforts and attributed the state of their  planning to several factors. First, as we previously reported, the FBI does  not have an enterprise architecture, and thus business processes and IT  systems have been viewed parochially, rather than as corporate resources  that must be planned and managed on a bureauwide basis. Second, no  bureau policy exists for divisions to develop integrated IT project plans.", "Instead, existing policy assigns responsibility for IT planning, including  planning for modernization projects, to divisions. Third, the bureau has not  assigned responsibility and authority for ensuring that integrated  bureauwide planning occurs. While the divisions are responsible for  project planning, no organization is responsible for reviewing and  approving the divisions\u2019 plans to ensure that mission gaps across the  bureau are fully addressed and project dependencies and overlap are  minimized.", "According to the CIO, several efforts are underway and planned to address  these underlying weaknesses and strengthen modernization planning.  Consistent with our prior recommendations, the FBI has established a  program to develop an enterprise architecture. In doing so, the bureau has,  among other things, (1) established a program office to manage the effort,  (2) assigned a chief architect and supporting personnel, (3) established an  architecture governance board that includes representatives from all  divisions to review and identify projects that are inconsistent with the  existing IT environment and inhibit internal and external information  sharing, and (4) hired a contractor to assist with developing the  architecture. The bureau plans to issue the first version of the architecture  by the end of September 2004. This version is to document the bureau\u2019s  current IT environment. The bureau plans to issue the other key parts of  the architecture\u2014namely, the future IT operating environment and  transition plan\u2014in fiscal year 2005.", "Also, the CIO is in the process of merging agencywide authority and  responsibility for IT, including systems modernization planning, under the  CIO in time to be reflected in the bureau\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget and  associated capital investment plans and business cases. Further, the CIO\u2019s  office intends to hire a contractor to facilitate bureauwide integrated  planning, including the formulation of integrated plans for systems  modernization projects.", "Until the FBI completes these and other efforts to introduce an integrated  approach to IT project planning, there is increased risk that the bureau\u2019s IT  systems will be unnecessarily duplicative, will later require expensive  rework to be integrated, and will thus hamper organizational  transformation efforts. According to the FBI, this risk has already become  reality in the case of five key infrastructure projects (including Trilogy and  the Integrated Data Warehouse) that were launched independently  between May 2001 and June 2003 and later found to have significant areas  of overlap. The FBI attributed the redundancy in part to the lack of  integrated planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policies and Procedures Governing Key Systems Modernization Management Capabilities Are Partially in Place and Further Improvements Are Planned", "paragraphs": ["Establishing effective corporate policies and procedures for managing IT  human capital, acquiring systems, and making investment decisions are  examples of key best practices that leading organizations use to modernize  their IT systems and facilitate organizational transformation.

In December 2003, GAO issued a set of key principles, or  practices, for effective strategic human capital planning. These practices  include  involving top management, employees, and other stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing a strategic workforce  plan;  determining the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to  achieve current and future programmatic results;  developing strategies that are tailored to address gaps between the  current workforce and future needs;  building the capability to support workforce strategies; and  monitoring and evaluating an agency\u2019s progress toward its human  capital goals and the contribution that human capital results have made  to achieving programmatic goals.", "These practices are generic and apply to any organization or organizational  component, such as an agency\u2019s IT organization.", "The bureau has developed IT human capital policies and procedures and  incorporated them into the bureau\u2019s enterprisewide strategic human capital  plan issued in March 2004.

The first effort started in December 2001, when the bureau  developed an investment management and transition plan. This plan called  for establishing and defining bureau policies and procedures for the select,  control, and evaluate steps set forth in GAO\u2019s framework. In March 2002,  the FBI completed the definition of select phase procedures and began  pilot testing them in developing its fiscal year 2004 IT budget request for  new investments and legacy (existing) system enhancements bureauwide.

The process for investments that are planned and  under way is still being defined. The CIO has established a program office  and has allocated staff, but the work is just beginning and is not planned to  be completed until the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. For existing  systems, the bureau developed a set of policies and procedures that define  a process to allocate operations and maintenance resources against  competing needs by assessing the performance of existing systems. The  bureau is piloting the process on different types of systems (e.g.,  application, infrastructure) with the goal of enterprisewide implementation  by April 2005. Between June and December 2003, the program office tested  the procedures on Information Resources application systems.

For the  first objective, we focused on the bureau\u2019s IT modernization plan and  supporting documents. In light of the FBI\u2019s response that its divisions were  responsible for modernization planning, we included six divisions in our  scope of work\u2014Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), Cyber,  Information Resources, Investigative Technology, the Program  Management Office, and Security\u2014because they had the largest planned or  ongoing IT modernization investments. For the second objective, we  focused on the bureau\u2019s policies and procedures for IT human capital,  systems acquisition, and investment selection and control. In response to  this request, bureau officials told us that systems acquisition policies and  procedures were developed within each division. To obtain a crosscutting  sample, we analyzed the systems acquisition policies and procedures of at  least one division with major IT modernization investments from each of  the components, based on funding for fiscal years 2003 through 2005; thus,  the scope for systems acquisition included Counterterrorism, CJIS, Cyber,  Information Resources, Investigative Technology, and the Program  Management Office.", "To address the first objective\u2014determining whether the FBI had an  integrated plan or set of plans for modernizing its IT systems\u2014we reviewed  program plans, IT capital asset plans and business cases (commonly called  Exhibit 300s), and other supporting documentation from each of the six  divisions, as well as the bureau\u2019s strategic plan, draft IT strategic plan, and  information sharing strategy, and then compared this documentation with  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) planning guidance and our  research and past experience on federal systems modernizations to  determine the extent to which the plans exhibited an integrated approach  to managing IT projects, including addressing project interdependencies.  We also interviewed FBI officials from these organizations, as well as the  Finance Division, Counterterrorism Division, Counterintelligence Division,  Office of Intelligence, and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO)  to (1) verify and clarify our understanding of headquarters and division  modernization planning roles, processes, and products; (2) determine why  division plans did not fully satisfy the elements of effective modernization  planning; and (3) identify the effects of not having a fully integrated  modernization plan (or set of plans).", "In addressing the second objective\u2014determining whether the bureau has  effective policies and procedures governing management of IT human  capital, IT systems acquisition, and IT investment selection and control\u2014 we assessed whether bureau policies and procedures were fully consistent  with the practices of successful private and public IT organizations and,  where appropriate, those specified in relevant federal IT management laws  and administrative guidance (e.g., OMB circulars and agency-specific rules  and regulations) that embody such best practices.
