In January 1998, the estimate had increased by $600 million to $3 billion ($1 billion for facilities and equipment and $2 billion for operations). The increased costs for facilities and equipment are attributable to FAA\u2019s including previously overlooked costs for periodically updating WAAS\u2019 equipment. The revised cost estimate for operations and maintenance is largely attributable to higher than expected costs to lease geostationary satellites.", "In developing WAAS, FAA has also encountered delays. When signing the original development contract with Wilcox Electric in August 1995, FAA planned for the initial system to be operational by December 1997. Because of concerns about the contractor\u2019s performance, however, FAA terminated the original contract and signed a development contract with Raytheon (formerly Hughes Aircraft) in October 1996 that called for the initial system to be operational by April 1999. The 16-month schedule slippage was caused by problems with the original contractor\u2019s performance, design changes, and increased software development.", "Last year, we reported that the implementation of STARS\u2014particularly at the three facilities targeted for operating the system before fiscal year 2000\u2014will likely be delayed if FAA and its contractor experience any difficulties in developing the software. These difficulties have materialized. In January 1998, FAA reported that more delays are likely because software requirements could increase to resolve air traffic controllers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the system\u2019s computer-human interface.", "FAA also reported an unexpected cost increase of $35 million for STARS during fiscal year 1998. It attributed the increase to such factors as adding resources to maintain the program\u2019s schedule and the effects of any design changes to address new computer-human interface concerns. Also, the estimated size of software development\u2014measured in source lines of code\u2014is now 50 percent larger than the original November 1996 estimate.

In February 1997, we reported that FAA has been doing a good job of defining one piece of its architecture\u2014the logical architecture. That architecture describes FAA\u2019s concept of operations, business functions, high-level descriptions of information systems and their interrelationships, and information flows among systems. This high-level architecture will guide the modernization of FAA\u2019s ATC systems over the next 20 years. We identified shortcomings in two main areas. FAA\u2019s system modernization lacked a technical architecture and an effective enforcement mechanism.", "FAA generally agreed with the recommendation in our February 1997 report to develop a technical architecture and has begun the task. We will continue to monitor FAA\u2019s efforts. Also, to be effective, the architecture must be enforced consistently. FAA has no organizational entity responsible for enforcing architectural consistency. Until FAA defines and enforces a complete ATC systems architecture, the agency cannot ensure compatibility among its existing and future programs.", "We also recommended in the February 1997 report that FAA develop a management structure for enforcing the architecture that is similar to the provisions of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 for department-level Chief Information Officers (CIO). FAA disagrees with this recommendation because it believes that the current location of its CIO, within the research and acquisition line of business, is effective. We continue to believe that such a structure is necessary. FAA\u2019s CIO does not report directly to the Administrator and does not have organizational or budgetary authority over those who develop ATC systems or the units that operate and maintain them.

We recommended that FAA improve its cost-estimating processes and fully implement a cost-accounting system.", "Our recent review of the reliability of FAA\u2019s reported financial information and the possible program and budgetary effects of reported financial statement deficiencies again highlights the need for reliable cost information. The audit of FAA\u2019s 1996 financial statement disclosed many problems in reporting of operating materials and supplies and property and equipment. Many of these problems resulted from the lack of a reliable system for accumulating project cost accounting information.

Furthermore, FAA lacks an effective approach for improving its processes for acquiring software.", "In the March 1997 report, we recommended that FAA improve its software acquisition capabilities by institutionalizing mature acquisition processes and reiterated our prior recommendation that FAA establish a management structure similar to the department-level CIOs to instill process discipline. FAA concurred with part of our recommendation and has initiated efforts to improve its software acquisition processes. These efforts, however, are not comprehensive, are not complete, and have not yet been implemented agencywide. Furthermore, FAA disagrees with our recommendation related to its management structure.

We recommended that FAA develop a comprehensive strategy for cultural change that (1) addresses specific responsibilities and performance measures for all stakeholders throughout FAA and (2) provides the incentives needed to promote the desired behaviors and achieve agencywide cultural change.", "In response to our recommendations, FAA issued a report outlining its overall strategy for changing its acquisition culture and describing its ongoing actions to influence organizational culture and improve its life cycle acquisition management processes. For example, the Acquisition and Research (ARA) organization has proposed restructuring its personnel system to tie pay to performance based on 15 measurable goals, each with its own performance plan. ARA\u2019s proposed personnel system is under consideration by the Administrator.", "In our August 1996 report, we also noted that the Integrated Product Development System, based on integrated teams, was a major FAA initiative to address the shortcomings with its organizational culture. According to an ARA program official, FAA has 15 integrated product teams, the majority of which have approved plans. The official indicated that all team members have received training to prepare them for their roles and that ARA is developing a set of standards to measure the performance of the integrated teams. However, the official also acknowledged that FAA has had difficulty in gaining commitment to the integrated team concept throughout the agency because offices outside of ARA have been resistant to integrated teams.", "To help overcome institutional cultural barriers, FAA and external stakeholders have been discussing the establishment of a special program office responsible for the acquisition of free flight systems. Although, the details of how such an office would operate have not been put forward, one option would be for this office to have its own budget and the authority to make certifications and regulations and to determine system requirements. Such an office could be viewed as the evolutionary successor to the integrated product team system. Another approach being considered by FAA is the establishment of a single NAS manager at the level of associate administrator to eliminate traditional \u201cstovepipes\u201d between the acquisition and air traffic organizations.", "As FAA considers recommendations to create a new structure, we believe that it would be advantageous for FAA to implement our recommendation to create a management structure similar to the department-level CIO as called for in the Clinger-Cohen Act. Having an effective CIO, with the organizational and budgetary authority to implement and enforce a complete, agencywide systems architecture would go a long way towards eliminating traditional \u201cstovepipes\u201d between integrated product teams, as well as between the acquisition and air traffic organizations. Furthermore, the agency could gain valuable insight from the experiences of other organizations that have implemented similar structures.

Similar to our findings on the logical architecture, a review of this program by the NAS Modernization Task Force concluded that the architecture under development builds on the concept of operations for the NAS and identifies the programs needed to meet the needs of the user community. However, the task force found that the architecture is not realistic because of (1) an insufficient budget; (2) the preponderance of risks associated primarily with certifying and deploying new equipment and with users\u2019 cost to acquire equipment; and (3) unresolved institutional issues and a lack of user commitment.", "The task force recommended a revised approach that would be less costly and would be focused more on providing near-term user benefits. Under this revised approach, FAA would (1) implement a set of core technologies to provide immediate user benefits; (2) modify the Flight 2000 initiative to address critical risk areas associated with key communications, navigation, and surveillance programs; and (3) proceed with implementing critical time-driven activities related to the Host computer and the year 2000 problems and with implementing such systems as STARS, surveillance radars, and en route displays to replace aging infrastructure.", "The details on how FAA intends to implement the task force\u2019s recommendations are not yet known. However, from our discussions with task force officials, their practical effect would be that the development and the deployment of some current programs would be accelerated while others would be slowed down. Meanwhile, FAA would continue developing programs like STARS and the Display System Replacement and work to ensure that its computers recognize the year 2000. For example, under the revised approach, the WAAS program would be slowed down after Phase I, which is scheduled to provide initial satellite navigation capabilities by 1999, to enable FAA to resolve technical issues and explore how costs could be reduced. Further development would be subject to review and risk mitigation under the expanded Flight 2000 initiative.", "FAA faces both opportunities and challenges as it revises the modernization program. On the one hand, FAA has an opportunity to regain user confidence by delivering systems that benefit them. On the other hand, FAA is challenged to follow through with its investment management process improvements. We urge FAA to proceed cautiously as it attempts to expedite the deployment of key technologies to avoid repeating past practices, such as undue concern for schedules at the expense of disciplined systems development and careful, thorough testing.

We are currently reviewing FAA\u2019s investment management approach, including its practices and processes for selecting, controlling, and evaluating projects, and expect to report later this year. As FAA continues to implement AMS and embarks on a revised modernization approach, it will need to establish baselines for individual projects and performance measurements to track key goals.", "Under AMS, an acquisition project should have a baseline, which establishes the performance, life-cycle cost, schedule, and benefit boundaries within which the program is authorized to operate. Having an effective investment analysis capability is important in developing these baselines. In its May 1997 report on AMS, FAA noted that it has focused more attention on investment management analyses. The agency reported that it has established several investment analysis teams of individuals with expertise in such areas as cost estimating, market analysis, and risk assessment to help prepare program baselines to use in determining the best way to satisfy mission needs.", "Although FAA has begun efforts to establish new baselines for projects that were underway prior to AMS, program evaluation officials question the availability and the quality of operations and maintenance data that are being used to estimate life-cycle project costs. FAA\u2019s history of unplanned cost increases, most recently seen with its STARS and WAAS programs, coupled with past deficiencies in cost estimating processes and practices point to the need to use reliable and complete data to establish realistic baselines.", "As for performance measurements, FAA does not have a unified effort underway to effectively measure progress toward achieving acquisition goals. FAA has established a goal to reduce the time to field systems by 50 percent and to reduce the cost of acquisitions by 20 percent during the first 3 years under AMS. FAA also plans to measure performance in such other critical areas as customer satisfaction and the quality of products and services. According to FAA\u2019s evaluation, while individual organizations are attempting to measure progress in meeting the two goals, a coordinated agencywide measurement effort is lacking.", "FAA\u2019s failure to field systems on time and within cost indicates the need for a comprehensive system of performance measurements that can help provide systematic feedback about accomplishments and progress in meeting mission objectives.
