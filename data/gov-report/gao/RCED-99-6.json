To avoid the problems commonly experienced in acquiring major systems, such as cost overruns and delays, OMB Circular A-109 specifies five major phases that agencies must complete when making large acquisitions: (1) determine mission needs, (2) identify and explore alternative design concepts, (3) demonstrate alternative design concepts, (4) undertake full-scale development and limited production, and (5) commit to full production. To secure the involvement of the agency\u2019s top management in reviewing a project\u2019s progress, problems, and risks, Circular A-109 establishes a key decision point between each phase.", "The Coast Guard has already moved beyond the first phase of the A-109 process: it has examined mission needs as they relate to the need to replace or modernize its fleet of deepwater ships and aircraft. This first phase is critical because it justifies the project and identifies the deficiencies that need to be resolved. The Department of Transportation (DOT), the Coast Guard\u2019s parent agency, does not allow its agencies to request funds for a project unless DOT has reviewed and approved a well-documented statement of mission needs.", "In the first phase of the Circular A-109 process, the Coast Guard assembled and obtained DOT\u2019s approval of a Mission Needs Statement. This statement is based on the Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater Mission Analysis Report (DMAR), which was issued in November 1995. The DMAR determined that the Coast Guard\u2019s ships and aircraft were aging and that future demand exceeded the number of operational hours provided by the ships and aircraft. The DMAR also determined that capability improvements were needed in such matters as speed, boarding capacity, and the ability to classify targets. The DMAR concluded that as a result of these findings, there was a need to begin a project for acquiring new ships and aircraft.", "The Coast Guard is now in the second phase, or concept exploration, of the Circular A-109 process. During this phase, the Coast Guard or its contractors will develop key program documents, such as project baselines, requirements documents, acquisition plans, and evaluation criteria. Alternative concepts for correcting the deficiencies identified in the DMAR must also be explored as part of this step.", "For this acquisition, the Coast Guard is using a novel systems approach to examining its mission, its existing assets, and how best to accomplish its mission. Rather than using the traditional approach of considering the replacement of an individual class of ships or aircraft, the Coast Guard will use a \u201csystem of systems\u201d approach that integrates ships, aircraft, sensors, and communication links together as a system to accomplish mission objectives. Through this approach, the Coast Guard hopes to avoid \u201cstovepiping\u201d the acquisition of ships and aircraft, which has led to a situation where they could not operate optimally together.", "According to the Coast Guard, the process incorporates multiple controls, which will maximize existing resources in an efficient manner.

The proposals could include replacing existing ships, aircraft, and other equipment; upgrading them; or some combination of the two. Besides submitting their proposals, the contractors will be required to provide other products such as cost estimates for implementing their proposals, a schedule for acquiring or upgrading any new ships and aircraft, and an implementation plan for integrating the new or upgraded equipment into the Coast Guard.", "Once the contractors submit their initial proposals, the Coast Guard will go through a series of steps designed to refine its concept of the system of systems. When the Coast Guard has selected a system that it wants from the proposals submitted, it will ask the contractors to submit additional final proposals for the system for the Coast Guard to evaluate.

The Coast Guard cautioned that the estimate reflected a rough order of magnitude and that future estimates would be more accurate as the types and numbers of ships and aircraft are determined. The agency suggested that its estimate may portray the worst-case scenario because, through the use of technology, the Coast Guard intends to reduce the number of ships and aircraft required.", "When the Coast Guard supplied guidance for contractors to use in deciding how to develop proposals for the new system, it proposed a budget target that was consistent with the August 1996 estimate. For planning purposes, the Coast Guard told contractor teams to develop proposals that assume a cost of $9.8 billion over a 20-year period, or roughly $500 million a year starting in fiscal year 2002.

We analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s documents depicting this need, such as the Deepwater Mission Analysis Report and the Mission Needs Statement, and compared the information that these documents presented with other Coast Guard data, such as engineering studies on the condition of Coast Guard ships and aircraft, planned upgrades for extending the service life of ships and aircraft, and records of actual usage. In those instances where the Coast Guard had relied on contractors to develop data for the project\u2019s justification, we interviewed contractor officials and obtained information on the procedures and methodology they used.

Information developed since the initial proposal indicates, however, that many of these assets, particularly aircraft, have a service life that extends considerably beyond what the Coast Guard projected at the time. In the 1995 proposal, the Coast Guard also asserted that the capabilities of existing ships and aircraft were inadequate to meet current and future demand. We were unable to verify whether these assertions were correct because the Coast Guard did not have sufficient supporting evidence.", "The Coast Guard and DOT now recognize that the 1995 justification did not adequately reflect the condition of deepwater ships and aircraft or their ability to meet future needs. The Coast Guard is conducting a number of internal studies that will update the condition and capabilities of its ships and aircraft as part of the next phase of the acquisition process. This phase began in August 1998, when the Coast Guard awarded contracts to three teams of contractors for developing competing proposals for the future deepwater system. Delays in providing updated information to the contractor teams could adversely affect the quality of the proposals submitted, in that, the teams could be disadvantaged in developing the most effective economical proposals for the Deepwater Project.", "The 1995 project justification was inadequate in part because of the Coast Guard\u2019s relative inexperience in preparing a mission analysis this complex and in part because of certain weaknesses in the system for developing and approving such studies.

However, such estimates are not always reliable predictors of actual service life, according to industry sources and officials in the Coast Guard who operate and maintain deepwater ships and aircraft. Instead, the estimates are benchmarks signaling the need for a more thorough engineering reevaluation of the condition and remaining life of the ships and aircraft. Since 1995, a number of these reevaluations have been conducted. They show that for deepwater aircraft, service lives can be extended significantly beyond the initial estimates through a combination of maintenance, safety, and capability upgrades.

This conclusion substantially affects the estimated service life of aircraft presented in the DMAR.

For fiscal year 1999, for example, the Coast Guard is requesting $37 million in acquisition, construction, and improvements (AC&I) funding for projects to upgrade individual types of aircraft. In addition to projects related to specific aircraft, other current AC&I projects are improving the flow of communication and information for all aircraft\u2014for example, a $21.5 million project is providing secure and reliable communications for command and control through commercial satellite communications.

According to the Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) official responsible for maintaining the agency\u2019s aircraft, a rigorous maintenance program for aircraft, as well as periodic assessments of the condition of each aircraft, allow the aircraft to operate beyond original service life estimates. The Coast Guard uses a two-level maintenance system that includes maintenance performed at the air stations (servicing, component replacement, and inspection for corrosion and fatigue cracks) and more extensive maintenance performed periodically at the ARSC, which can take several months to be completed.", "At the four air stations we visited, we asked 37 Coast Guard flight crew members what they thought about the condition and capability of their aircraft and their ability to carry out their missions.

Like their aviation counterparts, most of the ships\u2019 crew members were satisfied with the performance of their vessel. However, many said that outdated sensors and communication equipment limited their abilities to fully perform their missions. Similar to Coast Guard pilots, crew members cited the need to improve night vision capabilities, which could improve target detection capabilities and the ability of helicopters to land on cutters at night.

So far, the studies showing that the agency\u2019s ships and aircraft have a longer life than originally thought have presumed that proper maintenance and upgrades will be carried out. Several of the studies note that upgrades are more likely to be a lower-cost solution than replacing the entire ship or aircraft.

For example, two Coast Guard performance standards task the Coast Guard to (1) board 10 percent of the targets of interest within high-threat areas and (2) apprehend, assist in the apprehension of or hand-off to another counter-drug law enforcement agency, every known narcotrafficker intercepted. To accomplish both standards, the Coast Guard must identify and board vessels.

Our work on DOD\u2019s acquisition projects shows that costs can expand dramatically when this latter approach is adopted as a solution to acquisition plans that are not closely aligned with probable funding levels. For example, in a study of DOD\u2019s acquisition strategy, we found that an attempt to purchase too many weapon systems at once had the effect of driving up costs, even when the weapons being produced were proven systems that were beyond the testing stage. When DOD was faced with funding limitations and had to stretch out the procurement period for 17 such weapons systems, the systems had cost increases totaling $10 billion.", "The Coast Guard has already used schedule stretch-outs as a way to deal with tight budgets\u2014and with the same consequences. For example, the Coast Guard stretched procurement of 11 seagoing buoy tenders to 5 years instead of the planned 3-year period. Because of the loss of quantity discounts and higher administrative costs, the acquisition cost increased by an estimated $20 million to $30 million, according to the Coast Guard.", "As the Coast Guard proceeds with the project, the better-than-anticipated life of current deepwater ships and aircraft may provide the agency with an opportunity to adopt a more effective approach. It is now clear that many deepwater assets\u2014especially aircraft\u2014can operate many years beyond earlier estimates, assuming they receive the proper maintenance and upgrades. If many of these ships and aircraft can be upgraded and used for a much longer period of time, replacement needs\u2014particularly in the short term\u2014could be considerably less than the $500 million a year the Coast Guard has asked contractors to design their proposals around. Instead of being in a situation that commits the Coast Guard to replacing several kinds of deepwater ships and aircraft at once, the improved outlook would appear to allow the Coast Guard to focus on acquiring those ships and aircraft clearly in need of immediate recapitalization. This, in turn, would allow the Coast Guard to focus more dollars on completing other nondeepwater acquisition projects in the near term, thereby avoiding the waste that can occur under stretched-out schedules.", "Coast Guard managers pointed out that their planning approach to the Deepwater Project permits adjustments to the acquisition strategy and projected funding stream if projected levels of funding are not appropriated.

According to agency managers, proceeding to the next phase of the acquisition\u2014demonstration and validation\u2014will be contingent on the availability of funds. In the likelihood that $500 million a year is not received, they said, the agency will make adjustments and call on its contractors to revise their proposals and plans.", "We acknowledge that the Coast Guard has the flexibility to adjust the project later, but we question the advisability of continuing to ask contractors to develop a proposal so expensive that its funding appears doubtful. Our concern is that the planning assumption on which the Deepwater Project\u2019s development is currently being based (a funding stream of $500 million a year) make the options for later adjustments expensive. If proposals must be extensively redone to make them less expensive, the government will have spent time and money in funding work that may be of limited value, and if the decision is made to adopt an expensive proposal but stretch out the procurement period to make it affordable, the Coast Guard could repeat the money-wasting scenario we have identified in so many other DOD scenarios.

To align these proposals more realistically with the agency\u2019s budget constraints and other capital needs, the Coast Guard would need to move as quickly as possible in changing the funding assumptions on which the project is based."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Transportation direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to evaluate whether contracting teams should be instructed to base their proposals for the Deepwater Project on the assumption that the funding level will be lower than $500 million a year.
