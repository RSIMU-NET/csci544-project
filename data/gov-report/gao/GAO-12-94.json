As a result, it is important that the program is clearly explained and properly overseen. However, some aspects of FEGLI, such as program disclosures and the use of retained asset accounts (RAA)--financial accounts used to settle life insurance claims--have raised questions about the program's operations. GAO was asked to describe and evaluate (1) the FEGLI program's structure and operations, (2) OPM's administration and oversight of the program, and (3) the use of RAAs in FEGLI claims payments. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FEGLI law and regulations, interviewed OPM, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), and state insurance officials, and met with insurance industry experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OPM, by directing the funding of the Employees' Life Insurance Fund, has effectively allowed the FEGLI program to assume the risk of loss, while MetLife provides administrative services for the program. FEGLI has some insurance coverage features that most private sector group life plans do not, but a lack of disclosure in certain areas may make it difficult for employees to make fully informed decisions about buying coverage. Generally with private group plans the employer pays the full premium for a set amount of basic coverage, but the statute that created FEGLI requires that enrolled employees contribute two-thirds of the premium for Basic coverage. In addition, FEGLI premiums include the cost of a portion of retirement coverage, a feature generally not found in private sector alternatives, and which can make FEGLI coverage more costly than those alternatives. Further, for Basic coverage, FEGLI premiums are level over employees' working lives, so that early on premiums may be higher than the actual cost of coverage, while later they may be lower. This feature can make FEGLI coverage appear to be more costly than private individual plans for certain employees. However, the materials that FEGLI provides to employees do not disclose either the retirement coverage costs or the level premiums. Employees, particularly those who might leave government service or stop participating in FEGLI before realizing the benefits of these features, may find such disclosures important when deciding whether to purchase the insurance. OPM oversees FEGLI's provision of life insurance, but certain processes for reviewing program benefits and premiums could be improved. OPM administers basic FEGLI functions such as determining and collecting premiums, publishing program regulations, and overseeing the claims payment processes of MetLife, the insurer contracted to provide claims services. Because the program was intended to provide a low-cost benefit to federal employees, OPM has periodically conducted informal comparisons of FEGLI costs and benefits to those of private group life plans. In addition, to better ensure that the program charges appropriate premium rates, OPM actuaries conduct annual reviews and may recommend rate changes. However, OPM does not have documented processes for conducting its comparisons or for documenting any recommended rate changes. The lack of documented processes in both areas creates a risk that FEGLI benefits may not be meeting the needs of federal employees and could be priced at inappropriate rates. From the mid 1990s until early 2011, RAAs were the default settlement option for many FEGLI beneficiaries. While RAAs offer some benefits to FEGLI beneficiaries, OPM does not provide beneficiaries with some important information on RAA operations and protections. According to OPM and some industry officials, RAAs can reduce administrative costs, provide guaranteed interest rates, and allow beneficiaries time to decide how to use settlement funds. But other industry participants and a federal regulator said that beneficiaries might not be fully aware of their settlement options or that RAAs are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. OPM has recently improved FEGLI disclosures for RAAs, and RAAs are no longer the default settlement option. However, the disclosures still lack information on how the accounts are established and regulated, and how certain protections differ across states. Without this information, beneficiaries may not be able to make fully informed decisions when choosing a settlement option for their FEGLI claims payment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OPM (1) improve disclosures on important FEGLI features, (2) develop and implement a more structured process for reviewing the FEGLI program and premium rates, and document review outcomes, and (3) improve disclosures on RAA protections and regulation. OPM concurred with these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Life insurance is an important purchase for many Americans because it  provides income replacement and financial protection to beneficiaries if  they lose loved ones. While many Americans obtain life insurance by  purchasing individual policies in the private market, many also obtain  such coverage through employer-sponsored group plans, including the  approximately 4 million federal employees and annuitants who purchase  life insurance through the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance  program (FEGLI). This program, administered by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), involves substantial federal resources. In fiscal year  2010, the total amount of FEGLI life insurance coverage in force was  $824 billion, and the balance in the plan\u2019s financial fund\u2014the Employees\u2019  Life Insurance Fund (FEGLI Fund)\u2014totaled approximately $38 billion. In  addition, throughout 2010, FEGLI paid out approximately $2.6 billion in  insurance claims to beneficiaries of federal employees. The program also  involves substantial premium costs to enrolled federal employees, who  pay two-thirds of the premium for an initial amount of Basic life insurance  and the entire premium for any Optional insurance. As a result, ensuring  that FEGLI is properly administered, with appropriately priced policies,  and that federal employees receive enough information to make an  informed decision about participating in the program, is important.", "The processes and methods for paying FEGLI life insurance claims  determine how beneficiaries of federal employees receive insurance  settlement funds. For the first several decades of the program,  beneficiaries received settlement funds through a lump-sum check. In  1994, FEGLI began offering retained asset accounts (RAA) to  beneficiaries as the default settlement option where the proceeds payable  were $7,500 or more. With RAAs, the Metropolitan Life Insurance  Company (MetLife)\u2014the life insurer under contract with OPM for the  FEGLI program since its creation by Congress in 1954\u2014makes claims  payments by establishing guaranteed accounts in beneficiaries\u2019 names,  manages the assets backing RAA liabilities created by these accounts,  determines how to invest RAA funds, guarantees a minimum interest rate  to be credited to retained funds, and administers the accounts that allow  beneficiaries to access funds as they choose. While some industry  participants point to the potential benefits that RAAs provide, other  participants have raised questions about these accounts. For FEGLI,  these questions have included whether policyholders fully understand  their settlement options and their associated costs, benefits, and  protections.", "This report responds to your interest in how FEGLI operates and how it  uses RAAs.

In addition, we compared FEGLI\u2019s coverage and practices with those of  several large private sector group life insurers. To describe and evaluate  OPM\u2019s administration and oversight of the FEGLI program, we reviewed  applicable federal and state laws, regulations, policy guidance, and  materials from consumer advocates, and examined OPM\u2019s monitoring,  reporting, and other oversight activities.

To describe and evaluate the role  of RAAs in FEGLI\u2019s settlement process, we examined key OPM and  MetLife policy documents and program guidance and interviewed OPM  management officials. We focused on how RAAs function, what kinds of  RAA disclosures FEGLI participants receive, and what RAA protections  are available to FEGLI beneficiaries. In addition, we examined how  RAAs are regulated by focusing on the activities and processes OPM and  state regulators use to oversee these accounts. In particular, we  interviewed insurance regulators from California, Florida, New York, North  Carolina, and Maryland to determine their methods for overseeing RAAs.  We selected this sample of states because it is geographically diverse,  has a large number of federal employees, and contains some states that  have RAA-specific regulations and others that do not.

Upon starting their federal employment, federal employees are  automatically enrolled in FEGLI\u2019s Basic life insurance coverage unless  they file appropriate paperwork with their employing agency to opt out of  the program. Basic life insurance coverage equals a federal employee\u2019s  annual salary rounded up to the next even thousand plus two thousand  dollars, or $10,000, whichever is higher. Basic insurance also provides  an extra benefit to employees under age 45, at no additional cost. This  extra benefit doubles the amount of Basic insurance payable if the  employee dies at age 35 or younger. The extra benefit decreases 10  percent each year until there is no extra benefit at age 45 and above. For  Basic coverage, employees pay two-thirds of the premium determined by  OPM, and the employing agencies pay the remaining third. The rate all  covered employees, regardless of age, pay for each $1,000 of Basic  insurance is $0.150 bi-weekly or $0.325 monthly. FEGLI also provides  accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance as part of its  Basic insurance at no additional cost. AD&D insurance protects  employees in the event of a fatal accident or an accident which results in  the loss of a limb or eyesight. For benefits to be paid, the death or loss  must occur no later than 1 year from the date of the accident and must be  a result of bodily injury sustained from that accident.", "Federal employees may also choose to purchase three types of Optional  insurance in addition to Basic coverage\u2014Options A, B, and C\u2014by  submitting a Life Insurance Election Form (SF 2817) within 60 days of  beginning their employment to their human resources office.  \uf0b7  Option A offers $10,000 of life insurance coverage. Premiums for  Option A coverage vary by age groups, as determined by OPM.  These groups start with employees \u201cunder age 35,\u201d progress in 5-year  increments until age 59, and finish with a \u201c60 and over\u201d group.

According to the American  Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), RAAs have existed since 1982, and many  insurers provide them for both group and individual life insurance policies.  When an insured person dies, the life insurance company that issued the  policy may place the death benefit proceeds into an RAA, which accrues  interest for the beneficiaries from the day the account is established for as  long as the funds remain in the account. Beneficiaries have full and  immediate access to their funds and can withdraw some or all of the funds  at any time without penalty. In addition, MetLife pays RAA accountholders  a minimum guaranteed interest rate that typically is calculated using one of  several market rate indexes. MetLife compounds interest on RAAs daily  and credits that interest monthly. MetLife issues a book of drafts to the  beneficiary, allowing immediate access to the funds without penalty.  Beneficiaries may then use them to meet various financial needs, for  example to pay bills, make retail purchases (fig. 1), or transfer funds from  the RAA to another account, such as a savings or checking account.  FEGLI beneficiaries, like other life insurance beneficiaries, may leave funds  in their RAA for as long as they wish or withdraw the entire amount at any  time, and there are no maintenance fees associated with these accounts.  By investing the assets backing the liabilities of RAAs funded with FEGLI  claims payments, MetLife may earn a profit in the form of a spread, or the  difference between the interest it pays beneficiaries and what it earns on  invested assets backing RAA liabilities less expenses.

First, both FEGLI and most  private sector plans automatically enroll employees in basic coverage,  often including AD&D coverage, unless they opt out of the program, and  both provide options for employees who opted out of the program to join  later. Second, neither FEGLI nor private sector basic insurance initially  requires employees to provide information on their medical condition or  history. That is, any employee can enroll in the program regardless of  age or state of health at the time that the employee is first eligible to join.  Third, while some private sector plans offer a flat amount of basic  insurance ranging from $5,000 to as much $50,000, many offer cover an amount equal to the employee\u2019s salary or a multiple of it, as FEGLI  does. Finally, FEGLI and private sector programs both typically use a  composite rate structure to price their basic group life benefits; that is, a  rate structure where all employees pay the same average rate regardless  of age or health status. The effect of a composite rate is that all employees  pay the same rate per $1,000 of insurance coverage regardless of  characteristics such as age and health that impact the cost of life  insurance.", "In addition to similarities with respect to basic coverage, FEGLI and  private sector group plans generally offer some form of optional coverage  that shares some similarities as well. First, employees in both FEGLI a nd  private group plans typically must fund any optional coverage with employer contribution. In addition, both FEGLI and private sector  employers generally offer optional coverage in increments of one to fi times the employee\u2019s annual salary. Finally, both FEGLI and private  sector plans generally offer life insurance coverage on the employee\u2019s  dependants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unlike Private Group Li Plans, FEGLI Assumes Most of the Insurance Risk", "paragraphs": ["Unlike most private sector group life insurance plans, FEGLI, accord OPM officials, assumes most of the risk of loss associated with the  program. In the private sector, according to industry experts, employers  generally purchase group life insurance policies from insurers that then  bear the risk of loss. That is, the insurer bears the risk that the claims  associated with the policy may exceed the premiums collected from the  policyholder. In contrast, according to OPM officials, the FEGLI program effectively bears all such risk based on the expectation that the FEGLI  Fund is sufficient to cover claims made by FEGLI beneficiaries. ing to  FEGLI\u2019s creation contemplated the federal government purchasing group  life insurance from a private sector group life insurer or insurers and  mitigating the risk of loss by purchasing reinsurance for those insurers.  However, as the FEGLI Fund balance has grown over time, OPM officials  noted, the need for an insurer and reinsurers to assume the program\u2019s  risk of loss has diminished. For example, according to OPM and MetLife  officials, even though OPM has a policy with MetLife to provide FEGLI life  insurance and makes funds available to MetLife for this policy, when  FEGLI beneficiaries submit claims, MetLife draws upon OPM\u2019s FEGLI  Fund to make claims payments. In addition, according to the same  officials, MetLife\u2019s exposure to loss is currently limited to its role as a  reinsurer for the FEGLI program, as it covers approximately 85 percent of  the FEGLI program\u2019s reinsurance. However, this exposure would only  result in payment after the depletion of the entire FEGLI Fund, which has  a balance as of September 30, 2010, of $37.6 billion, or approximately 14  times the amount of FEGLI\u2019s annual claims payments. OPM and MetLife  both consider the possibility of exhausting the FEGLI Fund to be so  remote that the cost of the reinsurance is negligible. While the program  initially had about 160 reinsurers, only 10 were participating in 2011, with  MetLife providing about 85 percent of the program\u2019s reinsurance. OPM  pays each of the 10 reinsurers approximately $500 annually for their  participation in the program, and FEGLI has never had to use this  reinsurance coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain FEGLI Features and Benefits Can Result in Higher Costs for Employees Compared with Private Sector Group Term Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Compared with private sector group term life plans, FEGLI has certain  features and benefits that can make premiums for all coverage higher for  federal employees. First, FEGLI\u2019s statute requires enrolled federal  employees to pay two-thirds of the premium rate for their Basic life  insurance coverage, while employers in the private sector generally cover  the full cost of their employees\u2019 basic coverage. According to insurance  industry officials, the amount of basic coverage that private group plans  generally provide can be a flat amount or equal to an employee\u2019s annual  salary or more. Whether an employee receives more employer-paid  coverage through a private plan that pays the entire premium for some  amount of coverage than through FEGLI would depend on the amount of  no-cost coverage the private sector employer provides.", "Second, according to OPM officials, FEGLI offers federal employees a  retirement life insurance benefit that is financed, in part, by a portion of the  premiums charged while employees are working. FEGLI\u2019s retirement  benefit raises FEGLI premiums above those of most private sector group  plans, which generally do not offer such a benefit. As we have seen, FEGLI  offers a postretirement benefit for both Basic and Optional coverage.  According to OPM officials, federal employees who participate in FEGLI  begin prefunding, or paying in advance for, Basic retirement coverage as  soon as they begin their FEGLI coverage. Prefunding for Basic coverage is  necessary because newly retired employees over age 65 who choose a 75  percent reduction in this coverage are no longer required to pay premiums  for the coverage they are receiving. With Optional coverage, except for  Option A, employees begin prefunding the cost of their retirement benefits  when they reach age 55 and continue to do so until they retire. Newly  retired employees who choose a 75 percent reduction in their Option A  coverage, and a 100 percent reduction in Options B and C, coverage no  longer pay premiums for the Optional coverage they are receiving. In  addition, life insurance coverage for people of retirement age or older can  be expensive. According to private sector insurance industry participants  we spoke with, the cost of postretirement benefits is quite high because as  employees age, the likelihood of the insurer being required to pay a claim  also increases. As a result, few private sector plans offer such benefits.  While OPM has stated that having flexible benefits, including life insurance  coverage in retirement, contributes to employee retention, insurance  industry participants with whom we spoke said that they have not seen any  evidence that postretirement coverage attracted or retained employees.", "In addition, for certain individuals, FEGLI Basic coverage may appear more  costly than private sector basic life insurance. First, FEGLI features level  premiums that may not be a part of some private individual policies. With  such a feature, monthly premiums remain the same over time instead of  increasing with age. Compared to a policy without such a feature, level  premiums are higher earlier in life and then become lower at a certain  point. If relatively younger federal employees compare FEGLI to private  individual coverage without level premiums, FEGLI coverage may appear  to be more costly, depending on their age. Second, because FEGLI is a  group life program, all individuals pay the same premiums regardless of  their health status, unlike individual coverage where premiums generally  depend on the health of the person being insured. As a result, if relatively  healthier federal employees compare FEGLI to private individual coverage,  FEGLI coverage could also appear more costly. Finally, FEGLI\u2019s  postretirement coverage, which increases FEGLI premiums but is not  generally part of private plans, also contributes to FEGLI\u2019s cost relative to  private sector alternatives that do not feature this coverage. The possibility  that FEGLI coverage may appear more costly than private sector  alternatives to relatively younger or healthier federal employees is mitigated  to some extent by the extra amount of coverage FEGLI provides federal  employees under age 45. However, in cases where FEGLI\u2019s premiums  exceed those for similar coverage in the private sector, federal employees  may conclude that FEGLI is more expensive and choose to opt out of the  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although FEGLI\u2019s Disclosures Cover Key Aspects of the Program, They Do Not Cover Some Important Features", "paragraphs": ["While FEGLI disclosures cover many key aspects of the program, they do  not cover certain program features that could affect an employee\u2019s  decision to purchase FEGLI coverage.

On a monthly basis,  premiums are moved from the FEGLI Fund which is held by the Treasury  Department, into a letter of credit account, which is administered by a  Federal Reserve Bank and from which MetLife can draw down funds to  pay claims. MetLife\u2019s OFEGLI, which is responsible for paying claims to  beneficiaries, draws money from the FEGLI Fund on a monthly basis  using the line of credit and transfers claims payments to beneficiaries. In  addition to its premium collection function, OPM officials said OPM is also  responsible for investing FEGLI Fund assets in government securities  and ensuring that investment income on program assets is taken into  account when determining program costs. Funds that flow through  FEGLI, according to these officials, ultimately begin with employee and  agency premiums and end with a payout to beneficiaries in the form of a  check or an RAA. Figure 2 illustrates the flow of FEGLI funds between  those endpoints, including being held in the FEGLI Fund.", "In addition to managing FEGLI resources, OPM officials said they monitor  and oversee MetLife\u2019s claims settlement processes by receiving and  reviewing weekly reports on claims activity. In addition to managing  processes for dispersing FEGLI funds, OPM officials said they receive  annual financial reports on claims and administrative costs that are used  to determine the timeliness of payments and, as noted earlier, help  predict future claims and other expenses.", "In addition to producing and updating FEGLI\u2019s Handbook, Program  Booklet, website and forms, OPM officials said that OPM also issues  FEGLI regulations, including the Life Insurance Federal Acquisition  Regulation (LIFAR), that guide the program\u2019s operations. The  regulations, for example, outline the types of Basic and Optional  insurance available through FEGLI, the amounts of FEGLI coverage that  the program offers, eligibility requirements, program costs, and  beneficiary designation. Additionally, the LIFAR describes the terms of  the contractual arrangement between OPM and MetLife under the FEGLI  program, including MetLife\u2019s receipt and administration of claims and the  calculation of administrative costs and profit levels. The LIFAR also  provides guidance on contract oversight, including requiring policies and  procedures to help ensure that FEGLI services conform to the contract\u2019s  quality requirements, and an OPM evaluation of MetLife\u2019s system of  internal controls. Additionally, the LIFAR requires that MetLife develop a  quality assurance program that includes procedures to address (1)  timeliness of claims payments to beneficiaries, (2) quality of services and  responsiveness to beneficiaries and OPM, and (3) detection and recovery  of fraudulent claims, among other things. Although FEGLI\u2019s statute  exempts the program from contractual competitive bidding, the LIFAR  also provides direction on contract modifications and circumstances that  would allow for contract termination. According to OPM officials, they fulfill  these requirements by monitoring consumer feedback, tracking the  timeliness of claims payments, and reviewing external audits of MetLife,  which include OFEGLI. These officials said that they have not received  any indication of problems with timeliness or responsiveness, or  indications of any other deficiencies.", "Although OPM has numerous administrative and oversight responsibilities  for FEGLI, MetLife, according to its officials, has a central role in several  key FEGLI financial and claims administration functions. First, officials  said that MetLife works with OPM on an annual basis to develop a  monthly premium amount. This premium is the amount made available to  MetLife to pay claims, MetLife\u2019s administrative expenses, and MetLife\u2019s  service charge. MetLife annually conducts a review of claims paid and  recommends a premium amount to OPM based on the projected level of  claims and expenses for the upcoming fiscal year. Officials noted that  OPM and MetLife then agree on a total annual premium level for FEGLI,  which OPM then uses to determine rates for employees and federal  agencies. Second, OPM officials said that MetLife plays a key role in  receiving life insurance claims from FEGLI beneficiaries, processing  these claims, and ensuring that beneficiaries receive their life insurance  settlements. On a daily basis, MetLife officials said that they determine  how much they need to withdraw from the letter of credit account to meet  expenses associated with beneficiaries\u2019 use of their RAAs.", "In addition, OPM officials said MetLife prepares weekly and annual  financial reports on its FEGLI claims that provide important information on  the flow of funds from the FEGLI Fund to MetLife and from MetLife to  beneficiaries. OPM reimburses MetLife for its administrative expenses for  FEGLI, including its claims and financial functions. OPM officials said that  most of these expenses are the result of MetLife\u2019s OFEGLI, through  which MetLife processes and pays claims. In 1997, according to MetLife  officials, OPM and MetLife entered into an agreement that capped  MetLife\u2019s direct administrative expenses for FEGLI at $6.1 million and  indirect expenses at 20 percent of that ceiling. This ceiling is adjusted  annually by the Urban Consumer Price Index. In addition to administrative  expenses, officials said that MetLife receives a service charge for  adjudicating and administering FEGLI claims. This service charge is  calculated using the profit analysis factors found in the LIFAR.

According to OPM officials, one of their key  responsibilities is to determine FEGLI\u2019s liability for current and future life  insurance coverage and to take steps to ensure that sufficient assets are  available to meet these potential liabilities. Various factors affect how  these liabilities are calculated, including changes in the mortality of  federal employees, federal salaries, and interest rates. OPM actuaries  said that they use these factors as part of an actuarial valuation model to  make annual estimates of FEGLI\u2019s current and future liabilities. The  actuaries then estimate the funds needed from premiums to cover these  liabilities and program expenses, taking into account interest on retained  funds and the FEGLI Fund balance. In addition, according to OPM  officials, OPM actuaries monitor and annually review the claims  experience for each FEGLI insurance coverage option, by age group and  gender, and make recommendations to OPM senior management on the  premium rates employees and their agencies should pay.", "According to OPM officials, the FEGLI program is adequately funded if  FEGLI revenues meet or slightly exceed program costs and the  program\u2019s assets meet or exceed its liabilities.

In particular, OPM reported in its 2010 annual report  that the program\u2019s liabilities as of September 30, 2010, were  approximately $43.9 billion and that its assets totaled $39.2 billion.  According to OPM officials, while the reported data would appear to  indicate that the program was underfunded, they believe FEGLI\u2019s  financing is adequate because the overall liability amount reported above  does not take into account employee contributions for optional insurance  coverage, which has the effect of making the liability appear to be larger  than it actually is. According to OPM, they take these funds into account  in other internal analyses, and these analyses show that the program\u2019s  assets sufficiently meet the program\u2019s liability when employee  contributions are considered.", "The legislation that created FEGLI intended the program to offer a low- cost insurance benefit to federal employees and their families.  Specifically, the statute that created FEGLI described the program as an  insurance benefit for federal employees that provides insurance at rates  OPM determines are generally consistent with the lowest basic premium  rates for new policies issued to large employers. Further, FEGLI\u2019s  legislative history suggests that the program\u2019s purpose is to provide low- cost group life insurance to federal employees. In addition, OPM\u2019s most  recent strategic plan calls for ensuring that available benefits, including  life insurance benefits, align with employees\u2019 needs.", "As we have seen, however, FEGLI has features\u2014some required by  statute\u2014that can make its coverage more expensive for federal  employees compared with the type of coverage generally offered by  private group life insurance programs. For example, as noted earlier,  FEGLI requires an employee contribution for Basic insurance, something  generally not required in private sector plans. In addition, the program  features a postretirement benefit that, although not generally found in  private sector plans, does increase the premiums that FEGLI participants  must pay. OPM officials told us that they periodically compare FEGLI to  other large group life insurance plans, primarily in terms of coverage  levels, and have concluded that the features and benefits FEGLI offered  are on par with those offered by private sector plans. In addition, OPM  officials noted that key FEGLI characteristics such as coverage levels, the  portion of the cost paid by federal employees, and the structure of Basic  premiums are determined by FEGLI\u2019s statute, and as a result, changing  the program can involve statutory changes that require congressional  action. They further noted that because of the program\u2019s size, the limited  number of OPM staff available to administer the program, the amount of  administrative work involved in making a change to the program, and the  potential need for the FEGLI statute to be changed, altering program  processes is not a simple task. OPM officials said that because of various  concerns, such as the length of time required for legislative changes,  inherent costs incurred with structural program modifications, and their  interest in preserving program continuity, requests for significant changes  are minimal and made only after careful consideration. However, OPM is  able to make changes to FEGLI premium rates paid by federal employees  and agencies, as well as other changes including options available to  beneficiaries for receiving claims payments. Nevertheless, OPM did not  appear to have a systematic or documented process, or requirements, for  comparing FEGLI with private sector plans. In addition, OPM did not have  a methodology or criteria with appropriate benchmarks or measures for  consistently comparing FEGLI benefits with those provided by the private  sector.

In addition, the  actuaries analyze the claims experience associated with each type of  coverage and age band and determine appropriate premium rates, which  may be higher or lower than the existing rates. OPM actuarial and  financial officials present the results of these analyses and any rate  change recommendations in an annual meeting with OPM management  that includes the FEGLI contracting officer, actuaries, financial staff, and  other OPM senior management. According to OPM officials, OPM senior  management then has the authority to decide whether to raise, lower, or  hold constant the rates that employees and agencies pay for FEGLI  insurance.

Industry participants cited  flexibility and a guaranteed interest rate as the primary benefits of RAAs.  For example, some said RAAs offer beneficiaries flexibility during a  difficult time and loss to determine how best to use or invest the life  insurance proceeds, which are often sizeable sums. While deciding how  to use the funds, beneficiaries with RAAs receive a guaranteed minimum  interest rate on their RAA account. According to MetLife officials, for  FEGLI, each beneficiary\u2019s minimum interest rate is based on when the  RAA was opened and is guaranteed for as long as the beneficiary  maintains the RAA. According to the same officials, the guaranteed  interest rates are 3.0 percent for RAAs opened before April 2003, 1.5  percent for RAAs opened April 2003 to April 2009, and 0.5 percent for  RAAs opened after April 2009. The officials noted that even the most  recent interest rate paid on RAAs is competitive compared to what  beneficiaries could currently earn on similar alternative investments. For  example, as of September 26, 2011, the best available rates for a money  market account ranged from .10 percent to 1.10 percent. In addition,  they said that RAAs provide beneficiaries the ability to access their funds  at any time, including the opportunity to withdraw either partial amounts or  the entire amount.", "Despite these benefits, RAA disclosures in general do not convey some  important information to consumers, including information on options  beneficiaries have for receiving their life insurance settlement funds. For  example, the disclosures do not clearly indicate that OPM considers life  insurance claims to be closed, and its relationship with beneficiaries  ended\u2014as it is with a lump-sum payment\u2014once a beneficiary chooses  an RAA as a settlement option. In addition, beneficiaries may not  understand that RAAs involve a separate contract with MetLife that is not  part of the FEGLI program and is regulated by states rather than the  federal government. Regulatory officials we interviewed from one state  said that consumer choice and product understanding is critically  important to consumers and that that state\u2019s law, in force since the mid- 1990s, requires companies to offer beneficiaries a choice of life insurance  settlement options at the time life insurance claims are submitted. The  same officials noted that RAAs cannot be the default life insurance  settlement vehicle in their state. Three other states\u2019 regulators were  concerned about how well beneficiaries understood RAAs and one of  these states had recently passed a bill that required RAA disclosures to  include information on settlement options available to beneficiaries.  Another part of the bill prevents insurance companies from offering RAAs  as their default settlement option. Regulatory officials from another of  these states said that their office had undertaken a regulatory review and  was developing guidance for insurance companies on using RAAs.", "In addition to concerns about RAA disclosures, some industry participants  and a federal regulator expressed concern about the kinds of protections  that apply to RAAs and how well beneficiaries understand them. For  example, they indicated that while RAAs are not insured by the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the use of drafts that closely  resemble checkbooks offered by banks could give the appearance that  FDIC insurance protects RAAs. Others noted that whether state guaranty  funds were adequate to fully protect those with RAAs is unclear. Industry  officials we spoke with noted that state guaranty funds typically protect  RAAs up to a limit of $300,000, although in some states that limit may be  as high as $500,000. An insurance industry expert explained that  beneficiaries who have RAA assets that exceed state guaranty fund limits  may not be fully protected. According to OPM, approximately 25 percent of  federal employees covered by FEGLI have insurance in force of $300,000  or more. Other officials noted that state guaranty fund protections are not  the same as FDIC insurance. Each FDIC-insured account is protected;  therefore, consumers with multiple accounts can be protected above the  $250,000 FDIC limit in the aggregate. Conversely, state guaranty funds  limit an individual\u2019s payout protection to the statutory ceiling so consumers  with multiple retained asset accounts are not protected beyond it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurance Industry Organizations Have Issued Guidance to Improve RAA Regulation", "paragraphs": ["In late 2010, NAIC and the National Conference of Insurance Legislators  (NCOIL) addressed concerns about RAAs by issuing guidance intended  to improve disclosures to consumers.

For example, under the bulletin, disclosures should clearly  state that choosing an RAA involves establishing a supplemental contract  with an insurance company that is distinct from the life insurance policy.  The bulletin also notes that the supplemental policy should also provide  clear disclosures of the rights of the beneficiaries and the obligations of  insurers. Other key provisions in the bulletin included making sure  disclosures explain  \uf0b7  available settlement options for beneficiaries,  \uf0b7  applicability of FDIC protections,  \uf0b7  applicable RAA fees charged by insurers,  \uf0b7  guaranteed interest rates associated with RAAs,  \uf0b7  provision and use of draft books,  frequency of financial statements to beneficiaries, and  \uf0b7  policies for inactive RAA accounts.", "Around the same time, NCOIL released its Beneficiaries\u2019 Bill of Rights, a  document which was intended to improve not only disclosures associated  with RAAs but also transparency and accountability. NCOIL\u2019s new  standards echoed many of NAIC\u2019s proposed improvements and also  included provisions that, if adopted, would require insurers to  refer beneficiaries to their state insurance departments if they had  further questions about RAAs,  immediately return to beneficiaries remaining RAA balances if  accounts became inactive during a 4-year period,  \uf0b7  make clear that any violation of NCOIL\u2019s Bill of Rights would  constitute a violation of states\u2019 unfair trade practices law,  identify any financial institution or entity that administers RAAs on the  insurer\u2019s behalf, and  report annually to state regulators on the number and dollar amount of  RAAs held, RAA structure and investment earnings, interest rates  paid to beneficiaries, and numbers and dollar amounts of RAAs that  go through state unclaimed property processes.", "Some states already have regulations in place that specifically address  RAAs and others have recently taken action to address concerns about  the accounts. For example, according to NAIC, as of August 2011, 26  states had RAA-related statutes that allowed insurance companies to  establish RAAs for beneficiaries and hold life insurance assets in these  accounts. In addition, according to NAIC, 22 states had RAA-specific  regulatory protections and disclosures, including many of the provisions  found in NAIC\u2019s model bulletin. According to NAIC, many states either  enacted or updated RAA regulations since the beginning of 2010. Figure  4 provides information on how states have approached regulating RAAs.", "While OPM recently revised and improved the FEGLI RAA disclosures  beneficiaries receive, the disclosures still lack some important  information.

FEGLI  disclosures now inform beneficiaries that they have settlement options  and include language stating that beneficiaries have an important choice  to make in choosing between a lump-sum check and an RAA and  indicating their choice on their claims form. In particular, the new form  explicitly states that MetLife offers a guaranteed minimum interest rate  that may be better or worse than the market\u2019s prevailing interest rate and,  unlike in the previous version, clearly informs beneficiaries that MetLife  may profit from RAAs. OPM further improved disclosures by more clearly  explaining that beneficiaries can access the total amount of their funds at  any time with no cost and by improving the information on applicable  protections. For instance, the disclosures now explicitly state that RAAs  are not bank accounts and are not insured by FDIC or any other federal  agency. They also explain that MetLife guarantees all RAA accounts,  including interest earned, and that this guarantee is backed by state  insurance guaranty associations.", "Despite OPM\u2019s improved disclosures, they continue to lack some  important information. In addition to failing to mention the aforementioned  separate RAA contract between FEGLI beneficiaries and MetLife, OPM\u2019s  revised disclosures  \uf0b7  do not tell beneficiaries how to identify and contact the proper state  department of insurance regulation should they have any questions or  concerns about their RAAs. FEGLI beneficiaries may not clearly  understand that OPM oversees all aspects of FEGLI prior to  settlement but that state regulators become responsible thereafter. In  the event that beneficiaries have questions or face issues with an  RAA, they may not know where to turn for regulatory assistance.  Further, there may be differences of opinion among regulators about  who is the responsible regulator, making such guidance even more  important to beneficiaries  \uf0b7  do not provide information on how to identify the relevant state  guaranty fund and its applicable limits, or where to find additional  information on a particular state\u2019s fund. According to the National  Organization of Life and Health Guarantee Associations, beneficiaries  whose RAA accounts contain more than their state guarantees may  be at risk of leaving some funds unprotected.", "It is important for beneficiaries to be able to identify the relevant state  insurance regulator and guaranty fund in case they have questions or  issues regarding their RAAs and associated guarantee fund protection.  However, identifying the appropriate regulator is challenging because  some regulators differed on what type of instruments RAAs are, as well  as who regulates them. For example, according to two state regulators  and NAIC officials, RAAs are supplemental insurance contracts between  beneficiaries and insurance companies. However, two other states\u2019  regulators classified them as settlement options. Yet another state\u2019s  regulator said that RAAs were both supplemental contracts and  settlement payouts of existing life insurance policies. States also differed  on the time frame for considering insurance contracts and settlements  settled. OPM officials said that FEGLI life insurance claims were satisfied  as soon as beneficiaries established RAAs, and two of the five state  regulators with whom we spoke shared that view. However, regulatory  officials we interviewed from one state said that the original insurance  contract was not satisfied until all funds were withdrawn from the RAA.  The state insurance regulators and some industry officials with whom we  spoke also differed on which state\u2019s regulator oversees a particular RAA  account and, as a result, which state\u2019s guaranty fund would apply. For  example, two states\u2019 regulatory officials and NAIC representatives said  that the relevant regulator would be the one from the state where the  beneficiary resided. However, two other states\u2019 officials said it would be  the state where the original group life insurance policy was issued, and  yet another state regulator as well as officials from the National  Organization of Life and Health Guaranty Associations said it would be  the state where the group life insurer was domiciled. A representative  from a life insurance industry association with whom we spoke said that  the appropriate regulator could be the one from the state where the  insurance contract was established, where the beneficiary resided, or  both.", "Without clarity on which state insurance regulator has jurisdiction over an  RAA held by a FEGLI beneficiary, or which state guaranty fund might  apply, beneficiaries may not know where to turn to find answers to RAA- related questions on the extent of protections applicable to their RAA. For  example, the underlying FEGLI policyholder (the federal government) is  located in Washington, D.C.; the RAA provider (MetLife) is domiciled in  New York; and federal employees and their beneficiaries can live  anywhere in the United States. Identifying which state has jurisdiction  over a MetLife RAA contract, and which state guaranty fund applies,  could be difficult, especially if the state regulators themselves might not  agree on the proper jurisdiction. And as we have seen, state guaranty  funds provide varying levels of protection. According to OPM officials,  determining the appropriate state regulator for RAAs is technically beyond  their purview because their involvement ends once the RAA is funded  with the FEGLI claim payment. However, OPM does work with MetLife to  create the disclosures that provide beneficiaries with information that  helps them determine whether or not they wish to select an RAA as their  settlement option. Information concerning the relevant state regulator and  guaranty fund would be important to have in deciding whether or not to  choose an RAA because it could determine the amount of protection  available to the beneficiary. In addition, it could also inform the beneficiary  of potential challenges in seeking regulatory assistance if, for example,  the beneficiary is located in one state but the relevant regulator is located  in a different state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Does Not Consider the Investment Income Earned on RAAs in Setting Premium Levels", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to some private insurers with whom we spoke, OPM does not  consider any of the income MetLife earns on FEGLI RAAs when  determining premium rates for FEGLI coverage.

While officials from two companies with  whom we spoke said that they considered RAA earnings when pricing  their overall group life insurance plans, other insurers suggested that  investment income from their RAA accounts was too small to affect their  rate-setting calculations.", "Because OPM contracts with MetLife for settlement services, RAAs  funded with FEGLI claims payments are established and operated by  MetLife. As a result, MetLife retains investment gains and losses earned  on these accounts, as do most private insurers. According to OPM  officials, because OPM considers a FEGLI claim to be fully paid when a  MetLife RAA is established, OPM has no connection to the RAA accounts  or any of their funds. In addition, OPM does not track any data related to  MetLife\u2019s FEGLI-based RAAs.

The same officials also said that the company must  meet costs and expenses associated with these RAAs, including the  payment of guaranteed interest rates to FEGLI beneficiaries, and that by  guaranteeing the minimum rates previously noted, MetLife has assumed  financial risk. The same officials noted that these guaranteed rates are  higher than most rates of return beneficiaries could currently receive  through a bank or other liquid investment vehicle. In addition, MetLife  would pay and has paid interest at a higher rate than the guaranteed  minimum rates in more favorable interest rate environments, and  according to officials, approximately 40 percent of FEGLI RAAs have  been open for 5 or more years. This higher retention percentage, they  said, may be partially due to advantageous rates MetLife is paying those  beneficiaries.

First, although FEGLI offers federal employees postretirement  coverage, a benefit not commonly found in private sector group plans,  FEGLI disclosures do not explain the effect of this benefit on premium  levels, particularly the fact that federal employees begin prepaying for this  coverage as part of their Basic insurance when they begin their  employment. As a result, employees may be unaware that their premiums  may be higher than those of group plans that do not offer such coverage.

For example, many private sector employers  no longer offer postretirement benefits in their group life plans because of  the cost. To help ensure that FEGLI premium rates are appropriate, OPM  officials said that OPM actuaries annually review and assess FEGLI\u2019s  claims experience across different plans and age groups, recommending  rate changes when they believe such changes are necessary. However,  OPM lacks documented processes for making such recommendations  and documenting management\u2019s disposition of any rate change  recommendations. Without a clear and consistent process for making,  reviewing, and implementing rate change recommendations, OPM risks  that needed changes may not be made and that the premiums charged to  federal employees may not reflect the coverage they are receiving.", "FEGLI now offers two settlement options\u2014a lump-sum check payment or  an RAA\u2014and it is important for beneficiaries to be able to choose the  option that best meets their needs and to know where to turn to resolve  any issues they might have. While RAAs may offer benefits that some  beneficiaries appreciate, such as certain flexibilities and a guaranteed  interest rate, they also have certain characteristics that need to be fully  disclosed. OPM has recently revised its disclosures to beneficiaries to  provide more information on RAAs, but the disclosures still do not contain  some important information. For instance, they do not explicitly state that  RAAs involve a new contract between beneficiaries and MetLife that is  regulated by states rather than the federal government and that involves  state-based protections with certain limitations. As a result, FEGLI  beneficiaries may be unaware that new contractual terms and conditions  govern their RAAs. They also may not fully understand how their RAAs  are protected and what the limitations of that protection might be. Finally,  the disclosures do not provide the information that beneficiaries need to  find the proper regulator should they have questions about their  accounts\u2014a problem that is complicated by the fact that the regulators  themselves may disagree over which one has jurisdiction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help better ensure that federal employees have all the information they  need when deciding whether to purchase life insurance through FEGLI,  we recommend that the Director of the Office Personnel Management  take steps to ensure that FEGLI disclosures include complete and  accurate information on key benefits and features, including the  program\u2019s postretirement coverage, composite rates, and level-premium  structure.", "To help ensure that FEGLI provides relevant benefits that meet the needs  of federal employees at a reasonable and appropriate cost, we  recommend that the Director of the Office of Personnel Management  develop and implement a more structured process for comparing FEGLI  with private sector group life insurance plans and for documenting OPM  actuaries\u2019 rate recommendations and any management decisions  concerning those recommendations.", "To help ensure that FEGLI beneficiaries are provided with information on  all relevant aspects of selecting an RAA as a FEGLI settlement option, we  recommend that the Director of the Office of Personnel Management  include more complete information on financial protections and regulatory  oversight in program disclosures, working as necessary with MetLife and  NAIC to determine the appropriate state regulator for beneficiaries and  their RAAs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On October 7, 2011, we provided a draft of the report to OPM for  comment.

In  addition, we reviewed the program\u2019s key policy documents, including the  FEGLI Handbook, FEGLI Program Booklet for Federal Employees, FEGLI  website, and the contract between the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). We  focused on how FEGLI provides life insurance coverage to federal  employees and their families and the cost of that insurance to federal  employees and their respective agencies. Interviews with OPM and  MetLife officials provided additional information on FEGLI operations,  including the program\u2019s coverage options; how the government, MetLife,  and reinsurers bear insurance risk; and how the Employees\u2019 Life  Insurance Fund\u2014FEGLI\u2019s main financial fund\u2014is used for paying life  insurance claims and other program costs. We reviewed data from OPM  annual financial reports and performance and accountability reports from  2000 to 2010 to analyze FEGLI\u2019s assets and liabilities. In addition, we  reviewed information in the U.S. Budget on FEGLI from fiscal years 2002  to 2012 to analyze FEGLI premiums, claims payments, and investment  income. We also reviewed MetLife financial statements to determine the  total dollar amount of MetLife\u2019s retained asset accounts (RAA) and the  total investment income MetLife derives from its RAA investments.  Because these are audited documents and financial statements, with  unqualified audit opinions, we found data from these documents and  summary statistics from OPM and MetLife to be reliable for the purposes  of this report. In addition, to determine how FEGLI\u2019s structure and  operations compare to large private sector group life insurance plans, we  compared FEGLI to plans offered by six large private sector group life  insurers. Our comparison focused on insurance coverage options,  processes for determining premiums, available settlement options, and  methods for establishing capital or surplus levels. We selected these  insurers based on various insurer characteristics including their group life  insurance market share, number of group life policies and certificates  issued, and whether or not they provided group life insurance to federal  employees. We also interviewed officials from the National Association of  Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the American Council of Life  Insurers (ACLI) to gain their perspective on group life insurance plans,  finances, and operations. For additional information on how private sector  group life plans are structured and the insurance they offer, we met with  insurance regulators and benefits administrators from the states of  California, Florida, New York, North Carolina, and Maryland. We selected  this sample of states because it is geographically diverse, includes states  of domicile for several large insurance companies that sell a significant  number of the industry\u2019s group life insurance policies, has a large number  of federal employees, and contains some states that have RAA  regulations and others that do not. In addition, we met with  representatives from two private companies with experience in insurance  brokerage, and human capital and benefits consulting.", "To describe and evaluate OPM\u2019s oversight of the FEGLI program, we (1)  reviewed FEGLI\u2019s authorizing statute and regulations, including the  LIFAR, (2) reviewed OPM\u2019s program monitoring, reporting, and other  oversight activities, (3) interviewed OPM and MetLife officials, and (4) met  with industry association representatives. We focused on the steps OPM  takes to periodically monitor and review FEGLI\u2019s financial condition, and  on OPM processes for overseeing MetLife functions for receiving,  adjudicating, and paying claims to FEGLI beneficiaries. In addition, to  identify possible regulatory and consumer protection issues with group life  insurance plans and settlement vehicles, we met with representatives  from NAIC, ACLI, and a consumer advocate from the Center for  Economic Justice. To determine how states generally regulate group life  insurance plans, we met with insurance regulators from the five states  described earlier and compared FEGLI oversight with state regulation of  private group life insurers and identified similarities and differences.", "To describe and evaluate the role of RAAs in FEGLI\u2019s settlement process,  we examined key OPM disclosures, including the FEGLI Handbook,  FEGLI Program Booklet for Federal Employees, FEGLI website, and  Strategic Plan, 2010-2015, and we interviewed OPM officials. To  understand the kinds of information beneficiaries receive on life insurance  settlement processes, we also reviewed MetLife\u2019s Welcome Kit for RAAs  and interviewed MetLife officials. We focused on (1) what RAAs are, how  they function, and how they are funded, (2) the kinds of RAA disclosures  OPM and MetLife provide and how clearly they help beneficiaries  understand their use, and (3) what RAA protections apply to FEGLI  beneficiaries. In addition, we examined how RAAs are regulated by  focusing on the activities and processes OPM and state regulators use to  oversee these accounts. With respect to state RAA oversight and to  determine what kinds of regulatory and consumer protection requirements  states have for insurance companies that offer RAAs, we chose a small  number of states as described earlier, some of which have RAA-specific  regulation, and others that do not. In addition, we compared FEGLI\u2019s use  of RAAs to their use in the private sector and looked for any similarities,  differences, and emerging issues. We also looked to the insurance  industry for any applicable best practices with respect to RAAs that might  be used to improve the FEGLI program. To better understand protections  associated with RAAs, we contacted officials from the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation, state regulators from our sample, and officials  from the National Organization of Health and Life Insurance Guaranty  Associations and the Center for Economic Justice. We also reviewed  information on RAA guidance from the National Conference of Insurance  Legislators.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2010 to November  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
