Public Law 105-85, enacted in November 1997, required the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a system to assess the medical condition of servicemembers before and after deployments. Following its September 2003 report examining Army and Air Force compliance with DOD's force health protection and surveillance policies for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Joint Guardian (OJG), GAO was asked in November 2003 to also determine (1) the extent to which the services met DOD's policies for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and, where applicable, compare results with OEF/OJG; and (2) what steps DOD has taken to establish a quality assurance program to ensure that the military services comply with force health protection and surveillance policies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall compliance with DOD's force health protection and surveillance policies for servicemembers that deployed in support of OIF varied by service, installation, and policy requirement. Such policies require that servicemembers be assessed before and after deploying overseas and receive certain immunizations, and that health-related documentation be maintained in a centralized location. GAO reviewed 1,862 active duty and selected reserve component servicemembers' medical records from a universe of 4,316 at selected military service installations participating in OIF. Overall, Army and Air Force compliance for sampled servicemembers for OIF appears much better compared to OEF and OJG. For example, (1) lower percentages of Army and Air Force servicemembers were missing pre- and post-deployment health assessments for OIF; (2) higher percentages of Army and Air Force servicemembers received required pre-deployment immunizations for OIF; and (3) lower percentages of deployment health-related documentation were missing in servicemembers' permanent medical records and at DOD's centralized database for OIF. The Marine Corps installations examined generally had lower levels of compliance than the other services; however, GAO did not review medical records from the Marines or Navy for OEF and OJG. Noncompliance with the requirements for health assessments may result in deployment of servicemembers with existing health problems or concerns that are unaddressed. It may also delay appropriate medical follow-up for a health problem or concern that may have arisen during or after deployment. In January 2004, DOD established an overall deployment quality assurance program for ensuring that the services comply with force health protection and surveillance policies, and implementation of the program is ongoing. DOD's quality assurance program requires (1) reporting from DOD's centralized database on each service's submission of required pre-deployment and post-deployment health assessments for deployed servicemembers, (2) reporting from each service regarding the results of the individual service's deployment quality assurance program, and (3) joint DOD and service representative reviews at selected military installations to validate the service's deployment health quality assurance reporting. DOD officials believe that their quality assurance program has improved the services' compliance with requirements. However, the services are at different stages of implementing their own quality assurance programs as mandated by DOD. At the installations visited, GAO analysts observed that the Army and Air Force had centralized quality assurance processes in place that extensively involved medical personnel examining whether DOD's force health protection and surveillance requirements were met for deploying/re-deploying servicemembers. In contrast, GAO analysts observed that the Marine Corps installations did not have well-defined quality assurance processes for ensuring that requirements were met for servicemembers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, many servicemembers  experienced health problems that they attributed to their military  service in the Persian Gulf. However, subsequent investigations into  the nature and causes of these illnesses were hampered by a lack of  servicemember health and deployment data.", "In response, the Congress enacted legislation in November 1997 requiring  the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a system for assessing the  medical condition of servicemembers before and after their deployment to  locations outside the United States and requiring the centralized retention  of certain health-related data associated with the servicemember\u2019s  deployment. The system is to include the use of pre-deployment medical  examinations and post-deployment medical examinations, including an  assessment of mental health and the drawing of blood samples. DOD was  also required to establish a quality assurance program to ensure  compliance. DOD has implemented specific force health protection and  surveillance policies. These policies include pre- and post-deployment  health assessments designed to identify health issues or concerns that may  affect the deployability of servicemembers or that may require medical  attention; pre-deployment immunizations to address possible health  threats in deployment locations; pre-deployment screening for  tuberculosis; and the retention of blood samples on file prior to  deployment and the collection of a post-deployment blood sample.", "In September 2003, we reported that the Army and Air Force, for  servicemembers deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom  (OEF) and Operation Joint Guardian (OJG), did not comply with DOD\u2019s  force health protection and surveillance policies for many active duty  servicemembers, including the policies that the servicemembers be  assessed before and after deploying overseas, that the services document  receipt of certain immunizations, and that health-related documentation  be maintained in a centralized location. We had previously reported in  May 1997 on several similar problems associated with the implementation  of DOD\u2019s deployment health surveillance policies for servicemembers  deployed to Bosnia in support of a peacekeeping operation.", "Concerned about the repercussions of the military services\u2019 failure to  comply with DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies and  the need to better understand the adverse health effects of war, you asked  us, in November 2003, to examine the military services\u2019 implementation of  DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies for  servicemembers\u2019 deployments to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi  Freedom (OIF). More specifically, we focused our work on the military  services\u2019 deployments to Southwest Asia for OIF to address the following  two questions:  1.  To what extent did the military services meet DOD\u2019s force health  protection and surveillance system requirements for servicemembers  deployed to Southwest Asia in support of OIF and, where applicable,  did compliance improve compared to OEF/OJG?  2.  What steps has DOD taken to establish a quality assurance program to  ensure that the military services comply with force health protection  and surveillance policies?", "To accomplish these objectives, we obtained the force health protection  and surveillance policies applicable to the OIF deployment from the  U.S. Central Command, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health Affairs, and the services\u2019 Surgeons General. For each service, we  identified those installations that had amongst the largest deployments or  redeployments of servicemembers during specified time frames. Because  of concerns about the reliability of overall personnel deployment data, we  obtained data from the selected installations on the universe of those  servicemembers who deployed or redeployed from the selected  installations. To test the implementation of these policies, we reviewed  samples or, in some instances, the entire universe of medical records for  servicemembers at seven military installations. In total, we reviewed  medical records of 1,328 active duty servicemembers\u2014including 750 Army  servicemembers, 270 Marine Corps servicemembers, 146 Air Force  servicemembers, and 162 Navy servicemembers. In addition, we reviewed  medical records for 409 Army reserve servicemembers and 125 Army  National Guard servicemembers.", "To provide assurances that the data were reliable and that our review of  the selected medical records was accurate, we requested the installations\u2019  medical personnel to reexamine those medical records that were missing  required health assessments or immunizations and adjusted our results  where documentation was subsequently identified. We also requested  installation medical personnel to check all possible sources for missing  pre- and post-deployment health assessments and missing immunizations.  We also examined, for all medical records within our review, the  completeness of the centralized records at the Army Medical Surveillance  Activity (AMSA), which is tasked with centrally collecting deployment  health-related information for all of the military services. Further, we  interviewed officials with the Office of the Deployment Health Support  Directorate within the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs, the offices of the services\u2019 Surgeons General, and the military  installations that we visited for medical records review regarding the  quality assurance processes established to ensure compliance with DOD  force health protection and surveillance policies.

Specifically, our review  disclosed problems with the Army and Air Force\u2019s implementation of  DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance requirements in the  following areas:    Deployment health assessments. Significant percentages of Army  and Air Force servicemembers were missing one or both of their pre-  and post-deployment health assessments and, when health assessments  were conducted, as many as 45 percent of them were not done within  the required time frames.", "Immunizations and other pre-deployment requirements. Based  on the documentation we reviewed, as many as 46 percent of  servicemembers in our samples were missing one of the  pre-deployment immunizations required, and as many as 40 percent  were missing a current tuberculosis screening at the time of their  deployment. Up to 29 percent of the servicemembers in our samples  had blood samples in the repository older than the required limit of  1 year at the time of deployment.", "Completeness of medical records and centralized data  collection. Servicemembers\u2019 permanent medical records at the Army  and Air Force installations we visited did not always include  documentation of the completed health assessments that we found at  AMSA and at the U.S. Special Operations Command. In one sample,  100 percent of the pre-deployment health assessments were not  documented in the servicemember medical records that we reviewed.  Furthermore, our review disclosed that the AMSA database was lacking  documentation of many health assessments and immunizations that we  found in the servicemembers\u2019 medical records at the installations  visited.", "We also wrote in our 2003 report that DOD did not have oversight of  departmentwide efforts to comply with health surveillance requirements.  There was no effective quality assurance program at the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs or at the Offices of the  Surgeons\u2019 General of the Army or Air Force that helped ensure compliance  with force health protection and surveillance policies. We believed that the  lack of such a system was a major cause of the high rate of noncompliance  we found at the installations we visited, and thus recommended that the  department establish an effective quality assurance program to ensure that  the military services comply with the force health protection and  surveillance requirements for all servicemembers. The department  concurred with our recommendation. \u201c(a) SYSTEM REQUIRED\u2014The Secretary of Defense shall establish a system to assess the  medical condition of members of the armed forces (including members of the reserve  components) who are deployed outside the United States or its territories or possessions  as part of a contingency operation (including a humanitarian operation, peacekeeping  operation, or similar operation) or combat operation.  \u201c(b) ELEMENTS OF SYSTEM\u2014The system described in subsection (a) shall include the  use of predeployment medical examinations and postdeployment medical examinations  (including an assessment of mental health and the drawing of blood samples) to accurately  record the medical condition of members before their deployment and any changes in their  medical condition during the course of their deployment. The postdeployment examination  shall be conducted when the member is redeployed or otherwise leaves an area in which  the system is in operation (or as soon as possible thereafter).  \u201c(c) RECORDKEEPING\u2014The results of all medical examinations conducted under the  system, records of all health care services (including immunizations) received by members  described in subsection (a) in anticipation of their deployment or during the course of their  deployment, and records of events occurring in the deployment area that may affect the  health of such members shall be retained and maintained in a centralized location to  improve future access to the records.  \u201c(d) QUALITY ASSURANCE\u2014The Secretary of Defense shall establish a quality assurance  program to evaluate the success of the system in ensuring that members described in  subsection (a) receive predeployment medical examinations and postdeployment medical  examinations and that the recordkeeping requirements with respect to the system  are met.\u201d", "As set forth above, these provisions require the use of pre-deployment and  post-deployment medical examinations to accurately record the medical  condition of servicemembers before deployment and any changes during  their deployment. In a June 30, 2003, correspondence with GAO, the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs stated that \u201cit would be  logistically impossible to conduct a complete physical examination on all  personnel immediately prior to deployment and still deploy them in a  timely manner.\u201d Therefore, DOD required both pre- and post-deployment  health assessments for servicemembers who deploy for 30 or more  continuous days to a land-based location outside the United States without  a permanent U.S. military treatment facility. Both assessments use a  questionnaire designed to help military healthcare providers in identifying  health problems and providing needed medical care. The pre-deployment  health assessment is generally administered at the home station before  deployment, and the post-deployment health assessment is completed  either in theater before redeployment to the servicemember\u2019s home unit or  shortly upon redeployment.", "As a component of medical examinations, the statute quoted above also  requires that blood samples be drawn before and after a servicemember\u2019s  deployment. DOD Instruction 6490.3, August 7, 1997, requires that a  pre-deployment blood sample be obtained within 12 months of the  servicemember\u2019s deployment. However, it requires the blood samples be  drawn upon return from deployment only when directed by the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. According to DOD, the  implementation of this requirement was based on its judgment that the  Human Immunodeficiency Virus serum sampling taken independent of  deployment actions is sufficient to meet both pre- and post-deployment  health needs, except that more timely post-deployment sampling may be  directed when based on a recognized health threat or exposure. Prior to  April 2003, DOD did not require a post-deployment blood sample for  servicemembers supporting the OEF and OJG deployments.", "In April 2003, DOD revised its health surveillance policy for blood samples  and post-deployment health assessments. Effective May 22, 2003, the  services were required to draw a blood sample from each redeploying  servicemember no later than 30 days after arrival at a demobilization site  or home station. According to DOD, this requirement for  post-deployment blood samples was established in response to an  assessment of health threats and national interests associated with current  deployments. The department also revised its policy guidance for  enhanced post-deployment health assessments to gather more information  from deployed servicemembers about events that occurred during a  deployment. More specifically, the revised policy requires that a trained  health care provider conduct a face-to-face health assessment with each  returning servicemember to ascertain (1) the individual\u2019s responses to the  health assessment questions on the post-deployment health assessment  form; (2) the presence of any mental health or psychosocial issues  commonly associated with deployments; (3) any special medications taken  during the deployment; and (4) concerns about possible environmental or  occupational exposures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services\u2019 Compliance with Force Health Protection and Surveillance Requirements for OIF Was Mixed, but Appears Better Than for OEF/OJG", "paragraphs": ["The overall record of the military services in meeting force health  protection and surveillance system requirements for OIF was mixed and  varied by service, by installation visited, and by specific policy  requirement; however, our data shows much better compliance with these  requirements in the Army and Air Force installations we reviewed  compared to the installations in our earlier review of OEF/OJG.

Similarly, the Navy installation we  visited was missing pre-deployment health assessments for about  24 percent of the servicemembers; however, we note that the  pre-deployment health assessments reviewed for Navy servicemembers  were completed prior to June 1, 2003, and may not reflect improvements  arising from increased emphasis following our prior review of the Army  and Air Force\u2019s compliance for OEF/OJG.", "At three Army installations we visited, we also analyzed the extent to  which pre-deployment health assessments were completed for those  servicemembers who re-deployed back to their home unit after  June 1, 2003.

These  time frames were established to allow time to identify and resolve any  health concerns or problems that may affect the ability of the  servicemember to deploy, and to promptly identify and address any health  concerns or problems that may have arisen during the servicemember\u2019s  deployment. For servicemembers that had completed pre-deployment  health assessments, we found that many assessments were not completed  on time in accordance with requirements. More specifically, we estimate  that pre-deployment health assessments were not completed on time for:    47 percent of the pre-deployment health assessments for the active  duty servicemembers at Fort Lewis;    41 percent of the pre-deployment health assessments for the active  duty servicemembers and for 96 percent of the Army National Guard  unit at Fort Campbell; and    43 percent of the pre-deployment health assessments at Camp Lejeune  and 29 percent at Camp Pendleton.", "For the most part, small percentages\u2014ranging from 0 to 5 percent\u2014of the  post-deployment health assessments were not completed on time at the  installations visited.

Based on the  documentation we reviewed, the estimated percent of servicemembers  receiving all of the required pre-deployment immunizations ranged from  52 percent to 98 percent at the installations we visited (see fig. 3).  The percent of servicemembers missing only one of the pre-deployment  immunizations required for the OIF deployment ranged from 2 percent to  43 percent at the installations we visited.

A tuberculosis screening is deemed \u201ccurrent\u201d if it  occurred within 1 year prior to deployment. Specifically, the Army, Navy,  and Marine Corps required servicemembers deploying to Southwest Asia  in support of OIF to be screened for tuberculosis within 12 months of  deployment. The Air Force requirement for tuberculosis screening  depends on the servicemember\u2019s occupational specialty; therefore we did  not examine tuberculosis screening for servicemembers in our sample at  Moody Air Force Base due to the difficulty of determining occupational  specialty for each servicemember.", "Although not required as pre-deployment immunizations, U.S. Central  Command policies require that servicemembers deployed to Southwest  Asia in support of OIF receive a smallpox immunization and at least one  anthrax immunization either before deployment or while in theater. For  the servicemembers in our samples at the installations visited, we found  that all of the servicemembers received at least one anthrax immunization  in accordance with the requirement. Only small percentages of  servicemembers at two of the three Army installations, the Air Force  installation, and the Navy installation visited did not receive the required  smallpox immunization.

Both the Air Force and Navy installations used  automated systems for recording servicemember in-theater visits to  medical facilities. While in-theater visits were documented in these  automated systems, we found that 20 of the 40 Air Force in-theater visits  we examined at Moody Air Force Base and 6 of the 60 Navy in-theater  visits we examined at the Naval Construction Battalion Center were not  also documented in the servicemembers\u2019 permanent medical records. In  contrast, the Army and Marine Corps installations used manual patient  sign-in logs for servicemembers\u2019 visits to in-theater medical providers and  relied exclusively on paper documentation of the in-theater visits in the  servicemember\u2019s permanent medical record.

The lack of  complete and accurate medical records documenting all medical care for  the individual servicemember complicates the servicemember\u2019s  post-deployment medical care. For example, accurate medical records are  essential for the delivery of high-quality medical care and important for  epidemiological analysis following deployments. According to DOD health  officials, the lack of complete and accurate medical records complicated  the diagnosis and treatment of servicemembers who experienced  post-deployment health problems that they attributed to their military  service in the Persian Gulf in 1990-91.

Five of our servicemember samples were  small enough to complete reviews of the entire universe of medical  records for the respective location. For the other locations, we drew  probability samples from the larger universe. In all cases, records that  were not available for review were researched in more detail by medical  officials to account for the reason for which the medical record was not  available so that the record could be deemed either in-scope or out-of- scope. For installations in which a sample was drawn, all out-of-scope  cases were then replaced with another randomly selected record until the  required sample size was met. For installations in which the universe was  reviewed, the total number in the universe was adjusted accordingly.  There were four reasons for which a medical record was unavailable and  subsequently deemed out-of-scope for purposes of this review:  1.  Charged to patient. When a patient goes to be seen in clinic (on-post  or off-post), the medical record is physically given to the patient. The  procedure is that the medical record will be returned following their  clinic visit.   2.  Expired term of service. Servicemember separates from the military  and their medical record is sent to St. Louis, Missouri, and therefore  not available for review.  3.  Permanent change of station. Servicemember is still in the military,  but has transferred to another base. Medical record transfers with the  servicemember.  4.  Temporary duty off site. Servicemember has left military  installation, but is expected to return. The temporary duty is long  enough to warrant medical record to accompany servicemember.", "There were a few instances in which medical records could not be  accounted for by the medical records department.

We also requested that installation medical  personnel check all possible sources for missing pre- and post-deployment  health assessments and immunizations. These sources included automated  immunization sources, including the Army\u2019s Medical Protection System  (MEDPROS), the Navy\u2019s Shipboard Non-tactical Automated Data  Processing Automated Medical System (SAMS), and the Air Force\u2019s  Comprehensive Immunization Tracking Application (CITA).

For servicemembers  in our samples, AMSA officials provided us with copies of deployment  health assessments and immunization data found in the AMSA database.  We analyzed the completeness of the AMSA database by comparing the  deployment health assessments and the pre-deployment immunization  data we found during our medical records review with those in the AMSA  database. To identify the completeness of servicemember medical records,  we then compared the data identified from the AMSA queries with the data  we found during our medical records review.", "To determine whether DOD has established an effective quality assurance  program for ensuring that the military services comply with force health  protection and surveillance policies, we interviewed officials within the  Deployment Health Support Directorate, the offices of the services\u2019  Surgeons General, and at the installations we visited for medical records  review about their internal management control processes. We also  reviewed quality assurance policies and other documentation for ensuring  compliance with force health protection and surveillance requirements.", "We took several steps to ensure the reliability of the data we used in our  review. DOD electronic lists of servicemembers who either deployed or  redeployed within certain time frames were used to generate random  samples for which primary data was then collected. It was our premise  that no systematic errors for inclusion or exclusion of cases in the  database existed and the randomness of the sample generated controlled  for those records selected for review. The final universe for which sample  size was based was adjusted to account for out-of-scope cases. In addition,  we took mitigating measures to (1) avoid relying exclusively on the  automated databases and (2) identify and resolve inconsistencies, as  described below:  Personnel Deployment Databases. Because of concerns about the  reliability of deployment data maintained by the Defense Manpower Data  Center, we requested, in consultation with officials at the Deployment  Health Support Directorate, personnel deployment data from the military  installations selected for medical records review. DOD officials believed  that the military installations were the most reliable sources for accurate  personnel deployment data because servicemembers are deployed from,  or redeployed to, these sites. However, we decided to be alert for  indications of errors as we reviewed servicemember medical records and  to investigate situations that appeared to be questionable.", "Automated Immunization Databases. Service policies require that  immunizations be documented in the servicemember\u2019s medical record. For  the most part, immunizations are documented on Department of Defense  Form 2766. The services also use automated immunization systems\u2014the  Army uses MEDPROS, the Air Force uses CITA, and the Navy/Marine  Corps use SAMS. We did not rely exclusively on either of these sources  (Department of Defense Form 2766 or automated immunization systems).  For servicemembers in our samples, we reviewed both the  servicemembers\u2019 medical records and queries of the services\u2019 automated  immunization system for each servicemember. If we found documentation  of the required immunizations in either source, we considered the  immunization documented because it was evident that the immunization  was given.", "AMSA Centralized Database.
