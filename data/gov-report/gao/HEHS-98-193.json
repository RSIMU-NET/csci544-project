Although these children work in all different industries, those working in agriculture as migrant or seasonal workers (those constantly on the move to stay employed or those who are only able to find intermittent employment) or whose parents work as migrant and seasonal workers may face economic, social, and educational challenges that distinguish them from children working in other industries.", "Over the years, commissions, farmworker advocates, and policymakers have commented on the conditions of hired agricultural workers. Although the exact number of workers in agriculture is difficult to estimate, the Commission on Agricultural Workers in 1992 reported that the United States had about 2.5 million hired agricultural workers. Other sources report that the majority of hired agricultural workers work in producing crops, such as fruits and vegetables, and in horticulture. Even though defining agriculture is difficult, it is generally acknowledged to be a high-hazard industry; in 1995, the incidence rate (the number of injuries and illnesses for every 100 workers) for agriculture was 9.7, higher than private industry\u2019s in general (8.1), and third in severity behind manufacturing (11.6) and construction (10.6).", "Many federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing laws that protect workers\u2014including children\u2014in agriculture. The Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal law that establishes child labor and other labor standards (for example, the minimum wage) governing employers engaged in interstate commerce. WHD is also responsible for enforcing the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA), which governs housing, transportation, and other work conditions for agricultural workers. In addition, state labor departments are responsible for enforcing their own child labor and other laws that apply to children and others working in agriculture. Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\u2014along with its state counterparts\u2014is generally responsible for enforcing safety and health standards for workers of all ages in all industries, although in 1997 Labor transferred some of OSHA\u2019s authority over agricultural employers\u2019 provision of temporary housing and field sanitation to WHD.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), are responsible for protecting agricultural workers from pesticide exposure.EPA\u2019s Worker Protection Standard, enforced by state agencies under the guidance of EPA, provides for various risk-reduction practices that cover all pesticide handlers and workers involved in cultivating and harvesting crops. This standard requires employers to follow instructions on pesticide labels that specify periods of restricted entry into fields after pesticides have been applied and the use of personal protective equipment by pesticide handlers when applying pesticides or for workers who must enter treated fields before the restricted entry time has expired.Employers must also provide other services, such as basic training on pesticide hazards, information about pesticides that have been applied, and emergency assistance for treating a worker\u2019s illness or injury. All agricultural employers, regardless of the size of their establishment, are required to provide these protective measures to their agricultural workers. Children are not distinguished from other workers. The standard largely excludes others who may be living on the farm premises who are not workers (such as family members of farm owners) or children of hired farmworkers who may be in the fields with their parents while the parents are working.", "Labor and the Department of Education also oversee billions of dollars in federal aid that helps educationally and economically disadvantaged children\u2014which includes migrant and seasonal children in agriculture. While the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has no enforcement authority over agricultural employers for labor or safety and health laws that affect children or other workers, it does oversee the collection of information about selected farm characteristics such as cultivated acreage and dollar sales. In addition, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), conducts independent research on work place safety and health issues.", "As we and others have noted in the past, federal wage and safety and health protections are typically less stringent for agricultural workers\u2014of all ages\u2014compared with those for workers in other industries and, in general, agricultural workers receive lower hourly wages than workers in many other industries. FLSA exempts small agricultural employers (defined as those employers who did not use more than 500 days of agricultural labor, which equals about seven full-time workers, in any calendar quarter of the preceding calendar year) from paying the minimum wage to their employees. In addition, agricultural employers of all sizes are not required by FLSA to pay their workers overtime. Agricultural employers are also exempt from most safety and health standards enforced by OSHA, and OSHA is prohibited by an appropriations rider from conducting inspections on certain small agricultural employers (those who employ 10 or fewer workers and provide no temporary housing for those workers), even if it receives a complaint about unsatisfactory working conditions from a worker or if a worker is fatally injured. In other industries, an OSHA inspector must respond to a complaint and investigate work place fatalities.", "Several recent initiatives specifically address conditions affecting children. Executive Order 13045, for example, created a high-level task force composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Education, and Labor and the Administrator of EPA, among others. The task force is responsible for recommending actions to the President to reduce risks to children. In addition, in documents prepared in compliance with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act), Labor\u2019s WHD introduced a 5-year enforcement effort targeted toward employers producing particular agricultural commodities with an emphasis on detecting violations of child labor law. EPA highlighted as a guiding principle its efforts to identify and assess environmental health risks, such as pesticides, that may affect children disproportionately and pledged to develop six centers to do such research. Finally, Education reported that its goal is to help all children meet challenging academic standards to prepare them for responsible citizenship and further learning\u2014as measured through improved high school attendance and graduation rates\u2014particularly for those students at the greatest risk of school failure, such as children in migrant and seasonal agriculture.", "In 1998, the President also announced a national Child Labor Initiative to fight abusive child labor and enhance educational opportunities for children working in agriculture as migrant and seasonal workers. In response to this initiative, Labor\u2019s WHD requested an additional $4 million in its fiscal year 1999 budget to increase the enforcement resources dedicated to detecting child labor violations in agriculture. Labor has also requested $5 million to develop a pilot program that would provide educational alternatives for migrant and seasonal agricultural child workers so they would stay in school. In its budget request, Education sought an additional $50 million for its Migrant Education Program (MEP) that would allow it to serve 70,000 to 100,000 more migrant children."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We were asked to (1) determine, given the data available, the extent and prevalence of children (defined as anyone under 18) working in agriculture, including their injuries and fatalities; (2) describe and analyze the federal legislative protections and those in selected states for children working in agriculture; (3) assess the enforcement of these laws as they apply to children working in agriculture; and (4) identify federal educational assistance programs and describe how they address the needs of children in migrant and seasonal agriculture, focusing on those aged 14 to 17. On March 20, 1998, we provided preliminary results of this work (see GAO/HEHS-98-112R).

We reviewed information and databases from the Departments of Labor, Agriculture, Commerce, HHS, and other government agencies, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor is responsible for several main sources of data, including the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, and the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. Labor\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy is responsible for the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS). HHS\u2019 NIOSH, a federal agency that conducts independent research on working conditions, sponsors the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities Surveillance System and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, major sources of occupational fatality and injury data. We also reviewed information from private entities, such as the National Safety Council, the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the National Farm Medicine Center, and various university studies.", "Although some of these sources had helpful information, we did not use all of them because of their methodological constraints or coverage limitations. For example, some estimates defined children as anyone younger than 22 years old. In other cases, the methodologies used for developing the estimates were based on so many assumptions that the reliability of the estimates was questionable. We decided to focus on those nationally representative data that provide broad coverage of work experience by age, including CPS, NAWS, Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities Surveillance System, and National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. We reviewed previously published data, extracted data from public use files, and obtained special computer runs from the responsible agencies for key data used in this report. We extracted relevant data within the constraints of sample size and privacy considerations.", "NAWS has been conducted by Labor\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy for about a decade. During that time the survey has evolved, making several major changes in the survey\u2019s subject matter. The primary use of NAWS data is for describing the employment and economic situation of hired farmworkers, and not, according to Labor analysts, for estimating national totals of farmworkers or their dependents. Any estimates of this population must be derived by applying NAWS proportions to independent estimates of total farmworkers such as the estimate developed by the Commission on Agricultural Workers in 1992.", "We obtained from Labor a preliminary public use file of data from the survey\u2019s inception in 1988 through 1996. Because of privacy considerations, the NAWS public use file did not contain all survey data available; it excluded personal identifiers and other information that could compromise confidentiality. Because the NAWS database has more complete information than we had in the public use file, we also requested several special tabulations of NAWS data from Labor. These tabulations help to complete the picture of the situation of hired farmworkers and their families, but often the data were too sparse to use.", "Although other relevant variables could be explored from NAWS, in many cases (such as ethnicity of the child or season of work), the subsamples were too small for drawing reliable inferences. For example, in one of its data collection cycles (winter), NAWS collected data from only 72 farmworkers under 18. NAWS has information about hours worked by young farmworkers during the winter data collection cycle from only 65 interviewees. When delineated by ethnicity, no category has as many as 50 cases, the minimum recommended by NAWS analysts as a basis for computations. Such a distinction could be important because foreign-born hired workers make up less than half of all young farmworkers overall but constitute three-quarters of the young farmworkers interviewed during the (combined) fall and winter data collection cycles, and the vast majority of foreign-born hired farmworkers were not enrolled in school."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analyzing the Legislative Protections for Children Working in Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["To describe and analyze the legislative protections for children in agriculture at the federal level and in three states\u2014California, Florida, and Vermont\u2014we obtained pertinent laws and reviewed key provisions covering children and others working in agriculture.

We reviewed the legislative history of FLSA, interviewed grower and labor representatives for their perspectives on the treatment of agricultural workers under the law, and discussed potential implications of any changes to the law. We also interviewed growers and their representatives, as well as farmworker advocates, for their views on the extent of child labor used in agriculture.", "We obtained additional information about protections at the state level for children working in agriculture and assessed how these laws were enforced. We selected three states\u2014California, Florida, and Vermont\u2014to discuss in detail states\u2019 views on child labor in agriculture, what their laws provide, and how particular local conditions and challenges affect the enforcement of state laws. We used several criteria for choosing these states. First, we reviewed state laws to determine which state laws covered children working in agriculture. We omitted those states (such as Texas) in which the laws did not cover children because selecting such a state would not have been useful. We then reviewed USDA data to identify those states ranked highest in the number of hired farmworkers and farms and interviewed farmworker advocates for their opinions on where problems with child labor in agriculture were most severe. Using these criteria, we identified California and Florida as key agricultural states as well as states that many believed faced several challenges in detecting illegal child labor in agriculture. We selected another state\u2014Vermont\u2014to provide a contrast in laws and experiences with those of Florida and California.

Most of these workers (about 116,000) were wage and salary workers (that is, hired farmworkers); about 24,000 were self-employed and 15,000 were unpaid family workers. Annual averages between 1992 and 1997 generally showed little change in the overall number of these workers. A second CPS estimate shows that in the past few years, about 300,000 of all 15- to 17-year-olds who worked at some point during the year (hired workers, self-employed, and family members) reported that they held an agricultural job the longest. This estimate comes from a yearly collection of work experience data and is distinguished from the point estimates mentioned above because it represents work experience for an entire year. The number who work at any time during the year is much higher than the number who work in any given week.", "CPS has limitations that probably underestimate the total number of children working in agriculture. For example, CPS collects labor force information only on individuals 15 and older; it does not collect information on workers 14 years old or younger. In addition, because CPS is a household survey that relies on address lists and for which most of the interviewing is done by telephone, certain groups are harder to interview. These could include migrants, those not living in established residences, those without ready access to telephones, and foreign-born or non-English-speaking individuals\u2014conditions that apply to many farmworkers.", "The Department of Labor\u2019s NAWS is an agricultural payroll-based survey conducted since 1988. Recent NAWS estimates indicate that, on average, about 128,500 14- to 17-year-old hired farmworkers were working in crop production from 1993 to 1996. These children make up about 7 percent of all hired farmworkers working on crops. Because of the small sample size, NAWS trend data must be interpreted carefully; however, these data show a slight increase in the number of child farmworkers from an earlier period, when about 5 percent of hired crop workers were 14 to 17 years old (about 91,000). About 70 percent of these young farmworkers are male. Moreover, NAWS data indicate that older children are more likely to work than younger children. Farmworkers interviewed for NAWS indicated that while few of their children under age 14 work, about 8 percent of their children aged 14 and 15 work, and 17 percent of their children aged 16 and 17 work, mostly at farm jobs.", "NAWS data also show a growing proportion of workers between 14 and 17 years old working away from their parents as unaccompanied minors. Recent NAWS estimates show them to total about 3 percent of all hired farmworkers (about 47,000) but more than a third of all 14- to 17-year-old farmworkers. This trend is consistent with the experiences of enforcement officials and farmworker advocates, who noted an increase in young men entering the country illegally without their parents to do agricultural work.", "Though NAWS collects detailed information about certain agricultural workers, it also has limitations. For example, NAWS focuses solely on hired crop farmworkers; thus, it includes no agricultural workers who are self-employed or unpaid family workers or those hired farmworkers working with livestock. In addition, NAWS interviews only workers 14 years of age and older. Furthermore, NAWS has an extremely complex sampling design and small sample sizes, which may lead to imprecise estimates for some individual variables such as school enrollment or employment levels for different ethnic groups of workers for different data collection cycles.

Sixteen states have no protections at all for children working in agriculture, and over half of the 34 states that do have protections for children working in agriculture allow them to work more hours per day or per week than children in other industries. For example, California allows exemptions for employers operating agricultural packing plants to employ 16- and 17-year- olds during any day when school is not in session for up to 10 hours per day during peak harvest seasons. Although these exemptions are only to be granted if they do not materially affect the safety or welfare of the children and are needed by the employer to prevent undue hardship, California labor officials said, after an initial inspection of the employer, they generally grant all requests for such exemptions. In addition, most of these states allow children in agriculture to work in hazardous occupations at younger ages than children in other industries.", "Compared with FLSA, about two-thirds of the 34 states allow children to work at about the same ages (12 to 14), although several allow younger children to work in agriculture. For example, Vermont has no lower age limitation for children working in agriculture outside of school hours. More protective than FLSA, most of these states limit the number of hours a child under 16 may work in agriculture.

Over 70 percent of these 34 states provide either the same or less protection as FLSA for agricultural child workers regarding the occupations they may perform.

If these agencies\u2019 data systems could identify the extent to which violations of these other laws involve children, enforcement efforts could be targeted to those employers or areas that systematically exploit working children.", "Citations issued by WHD to employers for not paying their workers the minimum wage may involve a substantial number of children. Minimum-wage violations occur when employer records reflect wages paid only to the parent when the work was actually performed not only by the parent, but also by a child. In addition, unaccompanied minors (which NAWS reported made up a significant portion of hired farmworkers between 14 and 17 years of age) may be especially susceptible to being paid less than the minimum wage because of their youth and lack of adult supervision and protection. NAWS reported that about 8 percent of 14- to 17-year-old hired farmworkers reported they do not receive the minimum wage. Although WHD found over 350 minimum-wage violations for agricultural employers in fiscal year 1997, WHD has no data on the number of citations, if any, issued for minimum-wage violations that involved children. If such data were available, it would not only better reflect children\u2019s involvement in all violations, but it might also reveal the extent to which agricultural employers may purposely exploit families and their children in this way or systematically prey on younger workers.", "In addition, other types of labor law violations most likely involve children. Last year, WHD found more than 900 MSPA violations (MSPA requires employers to provide promised wages, adequate housing conditions, and safe transportation). OSHA found over 175 violations of employers not providing hired farmworkers adequate housing conditions, but the extent to which the violations involve children under 18 is unknown. NAWS reported that over a quarter of farmworkers had children living with them and about a tenth of farmworkers interviewed said that at least occasionally they took children 5 years of age or younger to the fields with them when they worked. Moreover, NAWS data show that about 9 percent of young agricultural workers help to apply or otherwise work with pesticides, but they are less likely to have been trained in pesticide handling than older workers.

In another instance, a case that WHD headquarters data showed to be a violation was not a violation according to the local WHD office that investigated the case. Large discrepancies also existed between the historical number of inspections conducted by WHD in California and those recorded by California for TIPP. For example, 286 WHD inspections were conducted in agriculture in fiscal year 1997 compared with 455 TIPP inspections in calendar year 1997, even though WHD and California labor inspectors should be involved in all TIPP inspections.

If the databases were comparable, WHD could determine which violations have resulted in which penalties. WHD officials said the only way they could determine penalties for individual violations would be to manually review individual case files.

Second, the number of individuals who want to participate in these programs far exceeds the number that can be served. For example, funds for JTPA title II-C are available to serve only 5 to 10 percent of the eligible population.

Although basic, reliable data on the number of children working in agriculture, their duties, and the consequences to their health and safety are limited, available data indicate that these children tend to be at greater risk of serious injury and death than those employed in other industries. In addition, children hired to work in agriculture receive less protection under the law than children who work in other industries. Furthermore, weaknesses in enforcement and data collection procedures indicate that violations of child labor law may not be detected, or the violations reported may not accurately reflect the extent to which children are employed illegally. Moreover, although Labor and Education administer many programs that target educationally and economically disadvantaged children generally, we know little about whether those programs are helping children in migrant and seasonal agriculture overcome the serious educational challenges they face.", "Several changes could improve Labor\u2019s detection of illegal child labor in agriculture and thus improve the protection of these children\u2019s health, safety, and educational opportunities. The procedures WHD currently has for identifying a child\u2019s age and employment history do not account for potentially fraudulent or missing age documentation or ambiguous employment relationships, which are common to this industry. As a result, WHD inspectors probably miss potential violations of illegal child labor in agriculture. National guidance for inspectors that specifies what activities they should conduct to address these conditions would enable WHD to detect more violations. In addition, WHD and other enforcement agencies are not taking advantage of the procedures established to facilitate enforcement, such as referring potential cases, conducting joint inspections, or exchanging information. This situation results in confusion and lost opportunities for detecting potential violations. If WHD followed these procedures and, as required in some cases, ensured that systems provided information to determine whether such procedures were being followed, it would also bolster detection of illegal child labor in agriculture by more efficiently using resources.", "Labor has an excellent opportunity to improve its processes with its salad bowl enforcement initiative. The issuance of documented procedures that should be followed for adequately identifying children\u2019s ages and employment would ensure that inspectors act in a systematic, consistent way to detect illegal child labor. In addition, because a specific number of these inspections are to be conducted, WHD should be able to work with other federal and state labor agencies to conduct joint inspections, exchange information, and determine the best way to make sure these procedures are followed on an agencywide basis.", "We realize that establishing and following such procedures may affect the level of resources allocated to agriculture and child labor, resulting in a possible decrease in enforcement activity in other areas. Such tradeoffs, however, are inherent in establishing enforcement priorities, and Labor has already established the reduction of illegal child labor in agriculture as a key enforcement priority. The Secretary established this priority, which is indicated by the salad bowl enforcement initiative and by Labor\u2019s fiscal year 1999 requested budget increase to enhance enforcement in agriculture. In that respect, Labor already plans to increase its allocation of enforcement resources to agriculture and child labor; improved guidance to inspectors and emphasis on coordination would ensure more efficient use of those resources.", "WHD\u2019s reporting of violations involving children could also be improved. Methods used by WHD and others to collect data on enforcement actions understate the extent to which children are involved in the hundreds of other labor law violations, such as record-keeping and minimum-wage violations, that are detected each year. The lack of such data masks the true extent of labor law violations involving children. WHD\u2019s inability to identify the number of FLSA child labor record-keeping violations is mainly a data problem because WHD\u2019s data system does not identify any record-keeping violations, even though FLSA child labor record-keeping violations have a civil monetary penalty. WHD needs to establish a way to identify the number of child labor FLSA record-keeping violations detected each year to provide more complete information about the types of FLSA child labor violations as well as better reflect the level and type of child labor violations detected by WHD.", "Regarding the identification of other labor law violations involving children, WHD already looks for child labor in every inspection it conducts, and, according to WHD officials, inspectors will try to identify the ages of children on site and their conditions of work. Because these procedures are already in place, it would appear that for minimum wage and other labor laws under WHD\u2019s authority, WHD inspectors may be able to obtain age information. This kind of information would help Labor and policymakers better understand the extent to which labor law violations involve children. Such information, for example, could help evaluate the validity of the view held by many that some agricultural employers systematically target children to pay them less than the minimum wage or pay a family of workers wages that do not reflect the entire family\u2019s work. The availability of such information could also help WHD identify regulatory or enforcement actions to correct this problem. We recognize the collection of this information may cause additional work for inspectors and may result in other unanticipated difficulties. For that reason, we believe this data collection effort could be tested during salad bowl inspections. During these inspections, WHD inspectors could obtain information on violations involving any individuals under 18 to determine what resources would be needed in collecting such age information. After WHD has tested this procedure and determined the results of these activities, Labor could determine whether it would be worthwhile to collect such information for all agricultural inspections.", "Labor could also assess the impact of MSFWP on the educational opportunities of children in migrant and seasonal agriculture aged 14 to 17. Although the program serves children as young as 14, program administrators have traditionally focused on adults\u2019 employment needs, which has affected the program\u2019s ability and desire to serve children. Yet, the program may have a special role for serving children aged 14 to 17\u2014especially those who may not be in school, who may already be working, or who cannot be served by traditional education-related programs\u2014and, in fact, this program serves a substantial number of children and young adults. Local programs maintain data on participation, service provision, and outcomes for children in migrant and seasonal agriculture in this age range, but Labor collapses the data into broad age groupings (such as ages 14 to 22) when it collects the data. If Labor developed and analyzed information on youths aged 14 to 17, it would help resolve the disagreement about the program\u2019s role in serving this age group within its broad mandate of serving both youths and adults. If the data indicate that this program plays an important role in providing services to children, it will help decisionmakers determine the most appropriate program orientation for children and adults.", "Changes in enforcement and data collection procedures will improve the detection and reporting of illegal child labor in agriculture; however, our review indicates that protections provided by FLSA to children working as hired migrant and seasonal agricultural workers in today\u2019s modern agricultural environment may not be adequate. In addition, these protections may be inconsistent with the increased emphasis on the safety, health, and academic achievement of children. The rise in dominance of large agricultural producers and the associated decline in the number of small and family farms has created a new type of child labor on U.S. farms. These children or their parents work in agriculture on a migrant or seasonal basis, and, unlike in the past, most are not related through family or community ties with their employers. In addition, many young agricultural workers live independently of their families. Growing reliance on mechanization and pesticides has increased the safety and health hazards associated with agricultural work. Current laws allow children to work in agriculture at younger ages, for longer hours, and in more dangerous occupations than children working in other industries. As we have reported, children working in agriculture are more likely to have severe work-related injuries and work-related deaths than children working in other industries. Furthermore, they are less likely to be enrolled in school and less likely to be graduated from high school than other children. Given the changing character of the agriculture industry, the allowable working conditions for child agricultural workers may be contributing to the health, safety, and education problems that these children face."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Considering the evolutionary changes that are transforming the agricultural industry and the increased emphasis on the safety, health, and academic achievement of children, the Congress may wish to formally reevaluate whether FLSA adequately protects children who are hired to work as migrant and seasonal farmworkers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve Labor\u2019s detection and reporting of illegal child labor in agriculture, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary of Employment Standards to take the following actions: issue national enforcement procedures specifying the actions WHD inspectors should take during agricultural inspections when documentation for verifying a child\u2019s age is missing or potentially fraudulent or when existing documentation does not reflect a child\u2019s possible employment; take steps to ensure that procedures specified in the existing agreements among WHD and other federal and state agencies\u2014especially regarding referrals to and from other agencies, joint inspections, and exchange of information\u2014are being followed and, as required in some agreements, are being recorded and tracked; develop a method for identifying the number of record-keeping violations resulting from employers not having children\u2019s ages on file as required by FLSA; and test the feasibility of collecting data on the number of minimum-wage and other labor law violations that involve individuals under 18.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary of the Employment and Training Administration to develop and analyze data on MSFWP services and outcomes for children aged 14 to 17 to determine the number of these children served, the services provided, and the outcomes experienced by these children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of this report to USDA, EPA, the Departments of Labor and Education, and the states included in our review for comment. EPA, Education, and the states provided technical comments to improve the clarity and accuracy of the report, which were incorporated as appropriate. USDA concurred with our recommendations (see app. II).", "In its response, Labor concurred with the intent of our recommendation to issue national enforcement guidance specifying the actions WHD inspectors should take during agricultural inspections to verify a child\u2019s age or employment status (see app. III). Labor has, in fact, provided additional guidance on this matter on the regional level in at least two regions, and the Department said it will determine if additional guidance is needed. We believe this recently issued guidance includes the additional procedures necessary to better detect illegal child labor in agriculture. At this time, however, the guidance has only been distributed to particular WHD local offices. Although this represents a positive first step toward implementing our recommendation, we still believe that this guidance needs to be issued to all WHD inspectors so they can systematically and consistently take these actions to adequately detect illegal child labor in agriculture.", "Labor also concurred with our recommendation aimed at ensuring that coordination procedures specified in existing agreements with federal and state agencies are followed, recorded, and tracked. It said that WHD does have specific procedures for responding to and issuing case referrals and is now streamlining this process. As we reported, however, whether these procedures are followed is not always evident. Ideally, in streamlining these procedures and implementing this recommendation, WHD will focus on documenting adherence to these procedures to preclude the communication problems we detected among WHD and other agencies.", "Regarding our recommendations to develop a method for identifying the number of FLSA child labor record-keeping violations and to test the feasibility of collecting data on children\u2019s involvement in other violations, Labor acknowledged that such data may be beneficial but identified cost and the practicality of collecting such information as major issues requiring consideration. We agree that these are important issues, but given the Results Act environment that seeks to encourage data-driven measurable goals and objectives, the emphasis WHD has placed on detecting illegal agricultural child labor and WHD\u2019s efforts to revise its databases to better reflect enforcement activities and outcomes, we still believe that collecting this information\u2014even on a limited basis\u2014would enhance the agency\u2019s efforts to protect children from exploitation in the work place. In addition, the lack of data contributes to the general lack of information about the nature, magnitude, and dynamics of illegal child labor in the United States. Only WHD, as an enforcement agency tasked with protecting children, can collect these kind of data. Although NAWS may be useful for understanding some aspects of the child labor problem, its self-reporting nature and sampling limitations make it less appropriate for grasping issues concerning illegal employment of children.", "Labor did not directly comment on our recommendation to develop and analyze data on MSFWP services and outcomes for children aged 14 to 17 to determine the number of these children served, services provided, and outcomes achieved by these children. Labor said, however, that this information is included in the aggregated data collected on all participants aged 14 to 22. We recognize this, and, in fact, the inability to isolate information on children aged 14 to 17 is the main reason why we are making this recommendation. By combining the experiences of youths with adults, Labor cannot analyze the services provided to participants under 18.", "Labor also raised several issues related to our characterization of WHD\u2019s enforcement efforts. For example, it disagreed with our observation that the decline in enforcement resources devoted to agriculture resulted in fewer opportunities to find potential child labor violations. Instead, Labor asserted that no direct correlation exists between the decline in resources devoted to agricultural inspections and WHD\u2019s ability to detect potential child labor violations. Although we agree that detecting illegal child labor is not solely determined by the number of inspections conducted, we know from experience that when WHD targets particular commodities or employers with additional inspection resources, it has found a substantially larger number of violations\u2014as evinced by the ongoing salad bowl initiative and past child labor targeting efforts. Furthermore, Labor highlighted the additional resources it has requested for fiscal year 1999 to better detect illegal child labor in agriculture, which indicates Labor\u2019s belief that increased resources are important to detecting illegal child labor. Labor also provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
