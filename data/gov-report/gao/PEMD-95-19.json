As shown in table 1.1, the information produced by these activities is used for a variety of purposes, from supporting basic research on human nutritional needs to informing policy decisions about health, agriculture, and food programs.", "Table 1.2 lists specific activities managed by the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, which have major responsibilities for the five areas.

USDA gathers data on food and nutrient consumption through two national surveys\u2014the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII). In the past, NFCS has gathered nationally-representative information on the food consumption behavior of households and individuals. It provides detailed data on household costs for food. One of the major uses for these data is the development of the Thrifty Food Plan, which is the basis for calculating food stamp benefits. Implemented decennially, NFCS suffered from severe response rate problems (less than 40 percent) in 1987-88. As a result, the individual food consumption portion of the NFCS is expected to be dropped in the future.", "Since the mid-1980s, CSFII has supplemented NFCS by providing regular information on individual dietary intake. The data collected in its most recent implementation (1994-96) will be used to describe both general and low-income populations. The Diet and Health Knowledge Survey (DHKS), which collects data on dietary knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, is a follow-up to CSFII. Together, CSFII and DHKS are intended to inform policies relating to food production and marketing, food safety, food assistance, and nutrition education.", "The USDA activities focused on food composition and food supply are not surveys. For food composition, USDA gathers data from food industries and other sources on the nutrient content of foods.

Like NFCS and CSFII, NHANES collects data from a nationally-representative sample. However, NHANES\u2019 unique contribution is its use of physical examinations and clinical and laboratory tests as well as traditional survey methods to gather information. NHANES\u2019 data support research on the relationship between diet and health and inform health policy decisions, such as the promotion of cholesterol screening. After two earlier implementations in the 1970s, NHANES has just completed its third administration (1988-94).

Both PedNSS and PNSS rely on data from clinic records from publicly funded health, nutrition, and food assistance programs, primarily the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

The act established an Interagency Board, jointly chaired by USDA and HHS, to coordinate activities across the various agencies involved in nutrition monitoring. The Interagency Board was charged with developing a strategic plan that would establish a comprehensive nutrition monitoring and related research program. This plan\u2014known as the 10-year comprehensive plan\u2014was published in the Federal Register on June 11, 1993. It outlines a set of planning activities, including a general time frame and lead agencies for each activity. The activities are organized around six objectives, which are to \u2022 provide for a comprehensive NNMRRP through continuous and coordinated data collection; improve the comparability and quality of data across the NNMRRP; improve the research base for nutrition monitoring; \u2022 develop and strengthen state and local capacity for continuous and coordinated nutrition monitoring data collection that complements national nutrition surveys; improve methodologies to enhance comparability of NNMRRP data across federal, state, and local levels; and improve the quality of state and local nutrition monitoring data.", "In addition, an Advisory Council of experts from outside the federal government was created to guide the Interagency Board on scientific and technical matters.

These three variables were selected for both substantive and methodological reasons. Substantively, the selected elements provide the data that support the planning and evaluation of interventions that directly affect health, such as nutrition education and food assistance programs. A substantive argument could also be made for the inclusion of food composition data, which are used to translate the information on what foods are eaten into estimates of nutrient intake. However, because an earlier GAO project focused on the NNMRRP\u2019s food composition activities, we did not include this in our review.", "Methodologically, the three selected variables are linked because they rely on data obtained from individuals through surveys and physical examinations. In contrast, food composition information is based on chemical analyses of foods, and food supply is determined from macroeconomic data. Our focus on the components of the NNMRRP that rely on surveys facilitates the comparison of current and potential approaches to achieving a model program.", "To identify features of a model nutrition monitoring program, we used four sources: reviews of previous evaluations of federal nutrition monitoring activities, review of the objectives and related activities outlined in the 10-year comprehensive plan developed by the Interagency Board, consultation with expert advisers, and our survey of data users.", "These sources are detailed below, and supporting material is provided in appendix II.

Past evaluations by such groups as the National Academy of Public Administrators, the Joint Nutrition Monitoring Evaluation Committee, and the National Research Council identified several concerns about the federal nutrition monitoring program. Because these evaluations also informed the Interagency Board\u2019s development of its 10-year plan, we used them as the starting point for our identification of features of a model nutrition monitoring program. Our report, Nutrition Monitoring (GAO/PEMD-94-23), discusses these past evaluations and NNMRRP progress in addressing their recommendations. (Table II.1 in appendix II lists the criticisms identified in these evaluations and categorizes them by the features of a model program that they suggest.)", "The 10-Year Comprehensive Plan. As described above, the NNMRR Act required the Interagency Board to develop a plan for the program. The plan outlined six objectives, three with a federal focus and three emphasizing state and local monitoring, and listed 68 planned activities. These were reviewed for responsiveness to the model features suggested by the past evaluations. (See table II.2 in appendix II for examples of the 68 activities listed in the plan.)", "Consultation With Expert Advisers. To assist us at critical decision points in this project, we organized three panels. (The members of each panel are listed in appendix I.) The Core Policy Panel consisted of nationally-known experts in nutrition and nutrition monitoring policy. These panelists were consulted throughout the project. In addition, they helped us develop a framework of purposes for nutrition monitoring data that guided our survey of data users.", "The Methodology Panel included renowned experts in such fields as sampling, survey design, dietary assessment, and nutritional epidemiology.

Individual panelists were consulted later about specific issues related to their expertise.", "Through the process of reviewing materials and participating in panel meetings, the expert advisers generated several suggestions for possible changes to the NNMRRP, examples of which are given in table II.3 in appendix II. In addition, they reviewed a draft of this report.", "Suggestions From the Survey of Data Users. Our survey of users of nutrition monitoring data focused on primary users of 14 of the NNMRRP surveys and surveillance systems. Primary users were defined as those who directly access the data rather than use information that has already been processed and interpreted by others in reports and other documents. Since there is no single list of primary users of NNMRRP data, we obtained lists of known and potential data users such as people who had requested the data from NNMRRP agencies, attendees at nutrition-related workshops, state and local government officials working in nutrition, and members of associations for nutrition professionals.", "A major portion of the survey was dedicated to determining how the respondents used the data. We also asked whether changes are needed to better meet the respondent\u2019s information and data quality needs.

For example, researchers and program managers interested in food safety need detailed information on dietary intake, including specific brand names of the foods consumed. In contrast, a nutrition educator may place a higher priority on information about dietary knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. However, at a more general level, some common ideal characteristics can be identified. Focusing on this general level, we used the sources described in chapter 1 to identify a number of features of a model program. Table 2.1 lists these features and the sources that support them.", "All of the features identified are clearly important elements of a comprehensive nutrition monitoring program. However, we selected four characteristics as the focus of our review: (1) a coordinated set of activities that (2) provides data on a continuous basis, (3) supports inferences about important population groups, and (4) assists state and local monitoring activities. These features encompass other desired characteristics, respond to long-standing concerns about federal nutrition monitoring, and generate debate about how they can be achieved.", "The first criterion for selection was to focus on the most general concerns. With these features, other desirable characteristics can be considered even though they are not emphasized. Specifically, a mechanism for evaluating the NNMRRP\u2019s content and methods, including a review of the information needs of the data users, is described in chapter 3 as an element of a coordinated program. The theme of evaluating options in relation to the needs for data also underlies the discussion of the alternatives for the other features. Three other features\u2014the comparability of data over time, the collection of longitudinal data, and the timeliness of data release\u2014are related to the continuous collection of data and, as such, are considered briefly in chapter 4.", "The four features were also selected because they respond to long-standing criticisms of federal nutrition monitoring activities. Concerns about coordination, the continuity and timeliness of the data, the availability of information on subpopulations, and the role of states and localities were raised as early as 1977 by witnesses before a House subcommittee. In contrast, the concerns with response rates and the level of the data (individual or household) can be traced to the problems with the last NFCS (described in chapter 1), which USDA has taken steps to avoid in the future.", "The selected features are also not easily addressed; that is, there is debate about the best approach to achieving each feature. For example, some expert advisers stated that assistance to states and localities should focus on data analysis and interpretation, while others argued for a larger state and local role in data collection. Similarly, to provide information on subpopulation groups, national surveys could be supplemented by such means as the surveillance systems and oversampling or the national surveys could be abandoned and their resources dedicated to special studies of specific groups. In contrast to the debates about how best to achieve these and the other selected features, there has been consensus about the kind of dietary intake methodology that will be used by the NNMRRP surveys and ongoing research to improve these methods through automation and other means."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Selected Features", "paragraphs": ["An ideal federal nutrition monitoring program would have a coordinated set of activities that provides data on a continuous basis, covers important population groups, and supports state and local monitoring activities.

A continuous flow of data would ensure that the information on the nation\u2019s nutritional status was up-to-date and would also enable the tracking of dietary behavior and nutritional status over time. Information on population groups that are vulnerable or growing rapidly is needed to plan, manage, and evaluate programs intended to prevent or ameliorate nutritional problems. Because state and local governments are often the location of such programs, they need assistance in either interpreting available data or collecting their own information. The importance of these features is further explained in the following sections."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Coordinated Nutrition Monitoring Program", "paragraphs": ["The coordination of nutrition monitoring activities has implications for both the utility of the information produced and the costs of the program as a whole. The utility of the information is constrained when data from different data collection activities cannot be easily combined. For example, research on the relationship between diet and health could be strengthened if CSFII\u2019s data on dietary intake could be combined with NHANES\u2019 data on health and nutritional status. However, because of differences in the sampling designs and nutrition measures, combining the data from the two surveys is difficult and controversial. Similarly, poor integration of the data collected by the state-based surveillance systems with the national surveys presents a barrier to meaningful comparisons of state and national populations.", "To the extent that the lack of coordination results in unnecessary duplication, a fragmented system can also increase the costs of nutrition monitoring. For example, the current NNMRRP includes two surveys focused on dietary knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors\u2014one operated by USDA and the other by HHS. The Interagency Board plans to review these surveys for duplication. While some overlap can be useful as a quality check on data from different sources, unnecessary redundancy in the system uses resources that could be used for currently unmet data needs\u2014such as the need for information on specific subpopulations at risk for nutrition-related problems.", "The need for a coordinated system was supported by three of the four sources used to identify features of a model program. In addition to a general concern about the lack of coordination, past evaluations of federal nutrition monitoring have criticized the incompatibility of the data gathered by different enterprises. Specifically, these evaluations have called for compatible methods of assessing dietary intake, a core set of standardized measures for the major surveys, compatible sampling techniques in the national surveys, and integrated reporting. Another criticism related to coordination focused on the absence of a systematic process for determining the needs for nutrition monitoring data across the different data collection activities. Although needs are assessed for individual activities, no comprehensive assessment of needs in relation to the total system of activities has taken place.", "Coordination is also a major theme of the 10-year plan. Four of the six objectives discussed in the plan focus on coordinating data collection and improving the comparability of the data. Of the specific activities listed for each objective, some of those focused on coordination are: coordinating the planning for coverage, tracking, and reporting of findings from surveys and surveillance systems; identifying ways to increase comparability within a dietary method to improve the quality and usefulness of data; and establishing a mechanism for improved coordination among federal agencies that collect and use survey information about knowledge, attitudes, and behavior to assess gaps and duplications in existing surveys.", "The third source of support for the need for coordination comes from meetings of the advisory panels. The panelists noted that the different agencies involved in nutrition monitoring have different missions and priorities and, hence, coordination is difficult. Their major suggestions for improving coordination were to give coordination responsibility to a single lead agency, to coordinate from an interagency body with permanent staff and enforcement authority, to locate nutrition monitoring in statistical agencies within the user departments or within a central statistical agency, to centralize the congressional appropriations process for nutrition monitoring activities, and to ensure informed review of data collection plans by qualified staff at the Office of Management and Budget.", "Our survey queried respondents about changes to specific data collection activities, rather than the NNMRRP as a whole, so coordination was not a major theme of the comments provided by the data users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Continuous Collection of Data", "paragraphs": ["The Interagency Board defines continuous data as data collection that is \u201crepeated regularly and frequently.\u201d Two consequences follow when data are not regularly available. First, because the kinds of foods that are available and the eating patterns of the American people change rapidly, the data become outdated quickly. Compounded by delays between data collection and data release, long intervals between administrations of the surveys diminish the relevance of the data to the current situation and, hence, their utility in program planning and management. For example, if any of the policy changes currently being considered are implemented\u2014 such as the consolidation of food assistance programs\u2014up-to-date information at regular intervals before and after the change will be needed to monitor any positive or negative effects of such policy changes on the population.", "A second consequence of pauses in data collection is that potential efficiencies of a continuous survey operation are lost. Each implementation of a national survey requires extensive planning, including reviews of the needs of data users, development and testing of data collection procedures, and all the steps involved in approving a contract. An ongoing data collection operation could streamline some of these processes. In addition, when surveys are not in the field continuously or even at dependable intervals, they may attempt to meet as many of the needs of data users as possible when they are administered. For example, the low response rates of the 1987-88 NFCS have been partially attributed to the burden on survey respondents resulting from its attempt to obtain both household and individual data with one interview. In contrast, an ongoing survey could consist of a core set of questions and rotating modules of questions that address the needs of specific users.", "The continuous collection of data was a theme in all four of our sources for the features of a model program. Past evaluations of nutrition monitoring have called for the continuous collection and timely release of nutrition-related data. Although the 10-year plan does not list specific activities focused on the continuous collection of data, two of the plan\u2019s objectives indicate the Interagency Board\u2019s concern with the timeliness of the data collected at the federal and state and local levels. The expert advisers also emphasized the need for regularly available data and suggested the following mechanisms for the ongoing collection of the information: \u2022 continuous national nutrition surveys, \u2022 addition of nutrition-related modules to existing surveys, \u2022 reliance on program data that are already collected, and \u2022 collection of longitudinal data (that is, data collected from the same sample over time).", "Finally, responses to our survey of the users of nutrition data not only stated a desire for continuous data, but also indicated that data that are collected at regular and frequent intervals serve some important purposes. For example, data that are currently available on a regular basis have been used to measure progress toward the Healthy People 2000 objectives and to evaluate policies such as the fortification of infant formula."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Support for Reliable Inferences About Subpopulation Groups and Small Geographic Areas", "paragraphs": ["The need for continued and improved information on subpopulation groups and small geographic areas is supported by several arguments. First, information is needed on specific populations known to be at risk for nutrition-related problems, such as Native Americans or homeless persons, in order to identify their needs and develop and target assistance programs. Second, some subpopulations, including Hispanics and the elderly, are growing rapidly. Their dietary patterns or nutritional needs may be different from the population as a whole; thus, information about these groups is needed to monitor their needs and to understand their effect on estimates of the prevalence of various nutritional problems in the overall population. Finally, the samples for the three major NNMRRP surveys are designed to yield national estimates. However, much of the planning for health and nutrition programs is conducted at the state and local levels. Hence, states and localities also need information on nutrition-related indicators for their populations.", "For the reasons given above, past evaluations of federal nutrition monitoring have criticized the program for not covering specific population groups and geographic areas. Although none of the overall objectives of the 10-year comprehensive plan focus on the need for information on subpopulation groups, several of the activities do. For example, one planned action is to develop and implement a plan for improved coverage of groups at nutritional risk. Our advisory panels also discussed the importance of information on subpopulations, noting differences in the kinds of foods consumed in different regions of the country and by different ethnic and racial groups as well as differences in nutritional needs at different ages. Their suggestions for improving the availability of data on subpopulation groups and small geographic areas included different sampling strategies for different populations, contracts with states and localities to gather information on geographically-based populations, and indirect estimation to support inferences about subpopulation groups and small geographic areas.", "The availability of data on important subpopulations and states and localities was one of the changes to the current data collection activities requested by respondents to our survey of data users. The users also emphasized the importance of information on subpopulations by describing the uses supported by currently available data on subpopulation groups such as determining dietary needs of the elderly, assessing differences between blacks and whites in the effect of obesity on diabetes, informing policies on the fortification of infant and toddler foods, and targeting a blood pressure screening program to the Mexican-American population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assistance to States and Localities for Nutrition Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments are interested not only in the applicability of federal nutrition monitoring data to their jurisdictions, but also in having federal assistance in collecting and interpreting their own data. The major justification for the emphasis on state and local monitoring is the wide range of uses that states and localities have for nutrition data. The examples in table 2.2, drawn from responses to our survey of data users, illustrate the utility of existing NNMRRP data for state and local governments. While NNMRRP data collection systems meet some of the state and local needs for nutrition monitoring data, state and local officials have called for additional technical assistance in analyzing and interpreting existing sources of data and for federal support in collecting their own data.", "In addition to the support provided by the survey of data users, our other sources indicated the importance of building state and local capacity for nutrition monitoring. For example, past evaluations recommended assisting state and local nutrition monitoring activities.

Yet, historically, these needs have not been met by an integrated program with the capacity for evaluating data needs and making adjustments as those needs change. Instead, a fragmented system of activities developed over the decades as new needs for nutrition data were identified. For example, in the early 1930s, USDA developed its first national survey of household food consumption because data on the food supply provided no information about the distribution of food at the household and individual levels. Similarly, the nutrition component was added to the National Health Examination Survey in the early 1970s in response to a need for more information about hunger, and state-based surveillance systems were established in recognition of the primary role of states in providing services to populations at risk of nutritional problems.", "To address concerns about the lack of coordination across the agencies involved in nutrition monitoring, the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990 required the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to implement a coordinated program of nutrition monitoring. The act specified several tools: an Interagency Board, the development of a comprehensive plan for the program, a council of outside advisers, and an integrated budget.", "The Interagency Board created by the act has the difficult task of coordinating numerous data collection and analysis activities across several agencies that have traditionally had separate and distinct missions and operations. The Board has two chairpersons, one selected by the Secretary of Agriculture and one by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. For USDA, the chair is the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics. The HHS chair is the Assistant Secretary for Health. Membership on the Board includes representatives of various agencies in USDA and HHS, as well as the Bureau of the Census, Agency for International Development, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Environmental Protection Agency, among others. The Executive Secretary for the Board rotates between USDA and HHS every 2 years. To facilitate coordination, the Interagency Board established working groups focused on survey comparability, food composition, and federal-state linkages and information dissemination.", "The Secretaries and the Interagency Board were charged with developing a 10-year strategic plan, which was published in the Federal Register on June 11, 1993. The plan outlines a set of planning activities, including a general time frame and the lead agencies for each activity. The activities are organized around six objectives, listed in chapter 1 (see p. 14). The Interagency Board clearly recognizes the need for improved coordination since four of these objectives focus on either the coordination of the data collection activities or the comparability of the data.", "To advise the Board on the development and implementation of the NNMRRP, the act established the National Nutrition Monitoring Advisory Council. The members of the Council represent academic institutions and other interested parties drawn from outside the federal government. The act also required the Interagency Board to submit annually a coordinated budget for nutrition monitoring."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strengths", "paragraphs": ["Both the concern that preceded passage of the act and the structure it created appear to have improved communication and cooperation among the agencies.

Alternate sampling designs were evaluated using the criteria of (1) ability to satisfy the separate objectives of the two surveys, (2) benefits in overall costs or analytic power, and (3) feasibility, especially in terms of burden on the survey respondents. The draft report from the contractor on the project emphasized the compromises one or both surveys would have to make to link their sample designs. For example, while the combination of the NHANES and CSFII into a single survey could yield a rich database of information on diet and health, the likely increase in respondent burden could reduce response rates and response quality. Another alternative\u2014using linked samples for NHANES and CSFII\u2014could decrease CSFII\u2019s precision because NHANES\u2019 sampling design is determined by the survey\u2019s reliance on mobile examination centers to conduct physical exams of the respondents. The Interagency Board concluded that the two surveys should remain independent, although work on improving the comparability of the data should continue.", "As required by the act, the Interagency Board submits an annual budget for the NNMRRP to the Congress. The budget report includes costs allocated for data collection, related research, information dissemination and exchange, and technical assistance; however, these different types of costs are not distinguished. Instead, the funds dedicated to nutrition monitoring and related activities are reported only by agency, not by type of activity. The budget report for fiscal years 1994-96 indicated that a total of $157.7 million was dedicated to nutrition monitoring or related research in 1994. Of that, $30 million was reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (which has responsibility for the HHS surveys and state-based surveillance systems) and $9.3 million was reported by the Human Nutrition Information Service (which had responsibility for NFCS and CSFII). The remainder was accounted for by agencies whose primary involvement in nutrition monitoring is related research. For example, HHS\u2019 National Institutes of Health reported $25.9 million dedicated to NNMRRP activities and USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service accounted for $50.7 million.", "The budget report is useful in communicating to the Congress a general sense of the cost of the NNMRRP across agencies. However, funds for nutrition monitoring cannot always be disaggregated from other purposes of the data collection and research programs. As a result, the budget report contains only approximate amounts dedicated to nutrition monitoring and related research.

Without more concrete, measurable objectives, there is little accountability for the program because progress toward the objectives cannot be assessed. (Other examples of activities listed in the 10-year plan can be found in table II.2 in appendix II.)", "In addition, the plan did not describe how activities would be ranked by importance or addressed within current fiscal constraints. However, since the plan was published, the Interagency Board drafted an approach for ranking the 68 activities listed in the plan into three categories of priorities: (1) essential (mandatory, legislatively required), (2) necessary (critical but not mandatory), and (3) beneficial. An interagency implementation group, involving around 60 agency representatives, applied the approach. Twenty-five of the activities were ranked in the high-priority category, 33 were ranked as next most important, and only 10 were ranked as beneficial but not critical. While this is an important first step in setting priorities, the Interagency Board has not yet linked the top-ranked tasks to the costs and benefits of completing them. Such a framework could be used to understand the trade-offs in selecting one or another approach to each task.", "Since an assessment of the effectiveness of the different approaches to the objectives requires information on the uses of the data, another obstacle to the Interagency Board\u2019s implementation of a coordinated system is the absence of a comprehensive assessment of how nutrition monitoring data are used across the federal government and by data users in other settings.", "For example, although USDA and HHS held a joint workshop to assess the needs of users of dietary intake data in August 1994, the workshop included only representatives of federal agencies.", "Finally, the ability of the Interagency Board to coordinate the NNMRRP is limited by the lack of resources dedicated to coordination. The Interagency Board has no staff, although two people\u2014one from USDA and one from HHS\u2014have been given primary responsibility for organizing NNMRRP activities.

As indicated by the brief descriptions of each office provided in table 3.2, the coordination tools used by the White House offices are similar to those used by NNMRRP\u2019s Interagency Board, including interagency committees and working groups, development of plans, and review of budgets.", "One potential advantage of elevating the coordination of nutrition monitoring to a high-level central authority is the increased participation of high-level officials in coordination activities. This participation could, in turn, increase the ability of the coordinating body to establish priorities. Currently, some of the agencies participating in the Interagency Board are represented by administrators or directors, while other agencies are represented by staff members who have no authority to change agency activities or establish priorities. In contrast, the political visibility of a program under White House management could encourage agencies to send representatives in positions of authority, capable of establishing priorities and committing resources to support them.", "The political visibility that comes with the participation of a high-level central authority may also contribute to the effectiveness of the various coordination tools. For example, the Interagency Board compiles budgets obtained from each of the agencies involved in nutrition monitoring without reviewing them for consistency with the activities identified in the 10-year comprehensive plan. In contrast, the White House offices use the budget review process to bring activities of the agencies into line with overarching policy goals. For example, ONDCP can threaten to decertify an agency\u2019s drug budget if it is not consistent with the National Drug Control Strategy. Decertification has no practical ramifications, but it sends a politically important message about the priority given to drug control activities by the White House.", "An additional potential advantage of having a central authority provide coordination is that it can be a central location for assistance to all data users. For example, ONDCP has a Bureau of State and Local Affairs that works with state and local government agencies involved in drug control activities. The Bureau serves as a clearinghouse for information about state and local activities and uses conferences to increase communication with and among state and local officials. In addition, the Bureau can communicate the concerns of state and local governments and community groups to the federal agencies involved in drug control programs. For nutrition monitoring, such an office could provide a central contact point for users in a variety of settings, including federal, state, and local governments, food industry, and health care organizations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Although the increased political visibility of a high-level central coordination office may facilitate the development of priorities, it may also increase the potential for political pressure on the data collection and research.

Political influence on the scientific agenda is also a concern for OSTP, where priorities may change with changing administrations even if scientific issues remain the same.", "In addition, although White House offices have more influence over the budgets reported by the different agencies, the budgets developed for other programs that cut across agency jurisdictions share the limitation of the coordinated NNMRRP budget. Specifically, agency activities may serve multiple purposes, thus making it difficult to determine how much of the overall costs are dedicated to the interagency program. For example, Coast Guard patrol boats serve drug interdiction purposes, but are also used in search and rescue missions that are not related to drug control.", "Thus, the Coast Guard can only estimate the portion of its resources dedicated to supporting national drug control efforts. Ambiguity about the portion of a multipurpose program that serves the interagency purpose makes it difficult to monitor the costs of the program.", "Although central authorities like the White House offices are financed separately from the agencies they oversee, resource limitations persist.

Because they depend on program records, PedNSS and PNSS do not burden respondents the way surveys dependent on interviews do. The information is transmitted from the records of local health and nutrition programs to the state, which then forwards the records to HHS for analysis. Similarly, the data collected by the states for BRFSS are sent to HHS for processing. According to HHS officials, all three systems report data back to the states within a year and generally in less than 9 months. HHS has also helped states conduct their own analyses by distributing a standardized software package.", "Another strength of the state-based surveillance systems is that the data they collect are directly linked to program decisions. Although PedNSS and PNSS include only a few indicators of nutritional deficiencies and behaviors, they are selected to support state data needs for program planning and management.

PNSS collects information on anemia and behaviors associated with low-birthweight babies. BRFSS asks respondents to report on their consumption of fat, fruits, and vegetables. This focus limits the breadth of uses that can be supported by the data; however, as noted above, it also limits the burden placed on respondents.", "While the systems are currently limited in the amount of dietary data they collect, HHS is exploring other methods of gathering these data. For example, with HHS support, the University of Texas examined the use of bar code data to look at dietary patterns. They concluded that the technology is not yet ready for use, but through a partnership with food manufacturers could be a promising method for the future. In addition, with USDA, HHS is evaluating the feasibility of collecting additional dietary data in the clinics that provide the PedNSS and PNSS records.", "Another concern about surveillance systems is the quality and completeness of the data across the different states. For example, for PedNSS, error can be introduced by variations in practice in weighing infants, such as with or without the baby\u2019s winter clothes, or by clerical errors in entering the data in states that do not have automated data systems. PNSS, which attempts to collect a wider range of information than PedNSS, suffers from missing data on several variables, such as the pregnancy risk factors of smoking and alcohol consumption. However, HHS provides technical assistance to help states standardize their data collection procedures. In fact, by flagging biologically implausible values for the physical measures, HHS analyses of the surveillance data help identify clinics that may have poor procedures.", "The surveillance systems are also limited because, within the participating states, only certain groups of the population are covered. As described earlier, PedNSS and PNSS primarily provide information on mothers and children participating in the WIC program. As a result, data may not be available on other populations that are potentially at risk, such as homeless people or older children not eligible for WIC. In contrast, BRFSS has a wider target population, collecting data from randomly selected adults 18 years and over.

Screening is the process of asking questions at sampled households to identify whether they represent (or include representatives of) the subpopulation of interest. Screening adds to the costs of the survey because enough households have to be sampled and screened to identify the smaller number of households or individuals that meet the definition of the subpopulation. To reduce screening costs, oversampling is most effective for subpopulations that are geographically clustered or fairly well represented in the general population, such as persons with low income who are often clustered by neighborhood. In contrast, oversampling is not appropriate for groups that are few in number or geographically dispersed, such as pregnant women.", "A possible response to some of the limitations of oversampling is the use of multiple sampling frames. For some subpopulations, alternative frames or lists may be available that can be used in conjunction with the national sampling frame. Samples can be selected from both the subpopulation frame and the general population frame, and weighted estimates can then compensate for the fact that some group members could be selected from two different sources. For example, to oversample for the frail elderly, the elderly individuals identified in the sample drawn from the national sampling frame could be supplemented by samples drawn from lists of elderly who participate in congregate meals programs.

The survey instrument was translated into the idiomatic Spanish of each of the three Hispanic groups surveyed (Cuban-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Puerto Ricans) and an appropriate plan for reaching out to the respondents was developed. For example, unlike the regular NHANES, which relies primarily on press releases and the formal leaders (such as mayors) of the places they have sampled to communicate the importance of participation in the survey, HHANES used informal leaders (such as church leaders) and Spanish-language media. The opportunity to tailor a special survey to the population of interest is an advantage of the approach, but it can be complicated for a population whose members speak multiple distinct languages and have varying degrees of assimilation into the U.S. population.", "Although not demonstrated by HHANES, another advantage of a special study is the ability to study populations that are not appropriately studied through oversampling.

Both USDA and HHS have experience with indirect estimation. Since the early part of the century, USDA has had a program to develop indirect estimates of crop yields. Although some information is available from state surveys of nonprobability samples of farmers, the USDA program adjusts these less dependable estimates so that they aggregate to the more reliable regional and national estimates that are based on a survey of a national probability sample of farmers.
