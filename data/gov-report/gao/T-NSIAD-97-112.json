This work is done in both military depots and the private sector. DOD facilities and equipment are valued at over $50 billion. A large but unknown amount of government-owned depot plant equipment is used by private contractors\u2014many of them original equipment manufacturers of weapons or major systems and components.

Further, the already controversial debate is heating up over how various depot maintenance workloads should be allocated among the military depots, original equipment manufacturers seeking life-cycle management support to increase their shrinking workload base, and third-party repair vendors who would also like a larger share of this multibillion dollar business. In combination with these factors, the debate has been fanned by the implementation of base realignment and closure recommendations, proposals to privatize work in place, and by news of the success achieved by many private sector commercial activities in reducing their operations and support costs through outsourcing noncore activities.", "DOD\u2019s depot system employs about 76,000 DOD civilian personnel, including laborers, highly trained technicians, engineers and top-level managers.

This same measure was used in the BRAC process to identify the potential for consolidating like workloads to improve capacity utilization and reduce redundancies. However, DOD normally measures excess capacity by an analysis that constrains facility and equipment availability by the availability of trained personnel and the organization of work stations, assuming an 8-hour workday, for 5 days a week. A maximum potential capacity utilization between 75 and 85 percent is generally considered an efficient operating level. Using maximum potential capacity measurements, DOD is predicted to have excess capacity in fiscal year 1999 of about 50 percent.

The Navy completed the closures in about 3 years versus the 6-year period allowed under the BRAC legislation. And through a combination of workload consolidations, interservicing actions, and outsourcing noncore workloads, the Navy reduced its projected operating rate by about $10 per hour.

The Louisville, Kentucky, Detachment of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, a depot recommended for closure by the 1995 BRAC Commission, supported the overhaul and remanufacture for naval surface ship gun and missile systems. In analyzing the cost of privatizing the Louisville workload in place versus transferring it to another depot, the Navy estimated that the contract alternative would cost more on an annual recurring basis and the one-time cost of transferring the workload to another depot would be prohibitive. However, we found the Navy\u2019s analyses understated the annual savings of transferring the workloads to other underused facilities and overstated the one-time transfer costs.", "Our analysis shows a one-time cost of $243 million and an annual savings of $59 million by transferring the workload. The annual savings would offset the one-time cost in about 4 years.

Plans for implementing the 1995 BRAC recommendations are still evolving.", "Nonetheless, based on the actions taken thus far, the Army is not effectively downsizing its depot maintenance infrastructure to reduce costly excess capacity. We reported in September 1996 that tentative plans for allocating some workloads from realigned depots to remaining depots will likely achieve some reduction in excess capacity and savings at two remaining depots. However, tentative plans to privatize workloads in place or retain workloads in facilities that were to be downsized or closed will increase excess capacity in the Army depots, from 42 to 46 percent over the next 3 years.", "This increase is caused by several factors including: (1) a forecasted decrease in future year depot-level workload; (2) the Army\u2019s tentative decision to establish a government-owned, contractor-operated facility at Letterkenny for maintenance of the Paladin combat vehicle and tactical missile; and (3) the Defense Depot Maintenance Council\u2019s decision supporting the Air Force plan to delay the transfer of the ground communications-electronics workload from the Sacramento depot to the Tobyhanna depot. We recommended that DOD reassess this delay, which is costing the Army about $24 million annually.", "On March 13, 1997, the Council approved the Air Force\u2019s proposal for a 3-year workload transfer beginning in 1998 with the transfer of 20 percent of the workload in the first year, and 40 percent in each of the next 2 years with full operational capability at the Tobyhanna Depot in 2001.

Despite major force structure reductions and significant excess capacity in the Air Force depot maintenance system, none of the Air Force\u2019s five large, multicommodity logistics centers or their maintenance depots were recommended for closure during the first three BRAC rounds. These five depots have about 57 million direct labor hours of capacity to accomplish about 32 million direct labor hours of work, leaving about 26 million hours of excess capacity\u2014or about 45 percent. Additionally, the Air Force military depots\u2019 workloads are projected to decline to about 20 million direct labor hours of work in 1999. At this workload level, the Air Force depots would have about 65 percent unused capacity. Although depots at the Sacramento and San Antonio centers were identified for closure during the 1995 BRAC process, the executive branch, citing readiness, up-front costs, and potential effects on the local community, indicated that these workloads should be privatized-in-place or in the local communities.", "In December 1996, we reported that if the remaining depots do not receive additional workloads they are likely to continue to operate with significant excess capacity and to become more inefficient and expensive as workloads continue to dwindle due to downsizing and privatization initiatives. Our analysis indicates that redistributing 8.2 million direct labor hours of work from the closing Air Force depots to the three remaining depots would (1) reduce the projected excess capacity in 1999 from about 65 percent to about 27 percent, (2) lower the hourly rates by an average of $6 at receiving locations by spreading fixed cost over a larger workload, and (3) save as much as $182 million annually as a result of economies of scale and other efficiencies. This estimate was based on a workload redistribution plan that would relocate only 78 percent of the available hours to Air Force depots. Table 2 provides an overview of the savings achievable through consolidation and increased use of capacity in the remaining three Air Force depots.", "According to management officials at the three remaining centers, it would cost about $475 million to absorb all of the Sacramento and San Antonio workload.

Initially, the Air Force pursued a prototype approach to privatization with three Sacramento workloads, hydraulics, electric accessories, and software, and two San Antonio workloads, C-5 aircraft paint/depaint and fuel accessories. However, shortly after the Defense Depot Maintenance Council approved the prototypes on February 1, 1996, DOD began to question this approach because of industry and community group desires to have larger segments of work competed.", "Consequently, on August 16, 1996, the Air Force Materiel Command announced it had revised its plans and created larger packages of work for competition. The Command\u2019s planners project that with the current 60-40 limitation, about $600 million of the two centers\u2019 $1.6 billion workload will be available to transfer to the private sector. Within this constraint, the Command believes it can privatize all of the Sacramento workload as a single package and San Antonio\u2019s C-5 workload as a separate package. The Air Force\u2019s current approach is to hold a public-private competition for the C-5 package first and then compete the Sacramento workload, excluding the BRAC-directed transfer of ground communication-electronics workload to Tobyhanna Army Depot. The San Antonio Air Logistics Center anticipates a later public-private competition for $240 million of the $700 million San Antonio engine workload. The Command is studying other San Antonio workloads for public-private competitions, if the 60-40 limitation is raised or eliminated. If there is no relief from 60-40 legislation, the Air Force in 1998 must begin moving large workloads and workers to other DOD depots. By 2001, this move would involve 5.6 million labor hours and more than 4,000 people making it comparable to one Air Force depot.", "Title 10 U.S.C. 2469 requires a public-private competition when outsourcing depot-level workloads valued at over $3 million. In structuring the competition, the Air Force responded to industry concerns that previous public-private competitions had favored the public depots. We have previously reported that private sector firms won about 57 percent of the public-private competitions between 1985 and 1993. These awards amount to about 44 percent of the total competitive award dollars in the competitions.", "In the interest of addressing concerns from both industry and public competitors, the Air Force held joint industry-depot conferences to solicit and discuss competition issues. The Air Force considered these issues and structured its competition procedures and evaluation criteria to reflect these concerns. For example, the Air Force\u2019s C-5 request for proposal requires the public offeror to depreciate any newly acquired capital assets over the life of the contract. Private sector offerors, on the other hand, are allowed to choose the method of depreciation they will use. Also, the Air Force has precluded the public competitors from partnering with the private sector. The solicitation provides for the selection of the public or private sector entity that offers the lowest total evaluated cost.

Recommended for closure by the 1993 BRAC Commission, the Air Force decided to privatize the workload in place. In December 1995, the Air Force awarded a contract for the repair and overhaul work to Rockwell International Corporation, Autonetics Electronic Systems Division, Anaheim, California, which was subsequently purchased by The Boeing Company in August 1996. The facility and workload were in transition between January and August 1996. A local reuse authority assumed control of the Newark facility when it closed, and has been in negotiation with the contractor over the terms of a lease agreement.", "After the transition period and 3 months of contractor performance during fiscal year 1997, the system program managers at the Ogden and Oklahoma City Air Logistics Centers noted that program funds were being expended faster than anticipated and the most significant contributing factor appeared to be the excessive amount of material ordered. Ogden and Oklahoma City system managers were investigating this condition at the same time we initiated a follow-up to determine the cost impact of the Newark privatization.

The report estimates that the most probable increase will be close to $6.7 million\u2014a 17 percent higher cost. We reviewed the Air Force analysis and found that this figure does not reflect increased material usage by the contractor. The contractor has ordered significantly higher quantities of material than were used by the organic depot for comparable workloads. While the contractor\u2019s material usage report does not clearly indicate whether actual consumption has increased along with increased material orders, we observed that the increased material orders are consistent with increased usage of government-furnished material experienced with other contracts of a similar type. Further, a lack of accountability over government-furnished material has hindered attempts to reconcile actual material consumption, and is a condition we identified in our review of other depot maintenance contracts. Given the evidence of increased material orders, we believe the $6.7 million Air Force Materiel Command estimate is more likely to represent the low end of the cost range.", "The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center analysis is not yet completed. We collected cost data from Oklahoma Air Logistics Center and Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command to compute an estimate of fiscal year 1997 organic and contract costs to repair the aircraft guidance workload currently on contract at BGRC. Based on that data, we estimate that the cost for repairing Oklahoma City managed aircraft guidance items will likely be between $6.5 million to $10 million more for fiscal year 1997 than the organic depot alternative.
