As states increased workers\u2019 compensation benefits following the National Commission\u2019s report, an issue arose as to whether benefits were so high that incentives for injured employees to return to work might be impaired. Workers\u2019 compensation program analysts are reluctant to take a position on what the \u201ccorrect\u201d level of workers\u2019 compensation benefits should be, leaving that matter to the judgment of legislators. According to a 1985 Workers Compensation Research Institute report, legislatures in many states must walk a fine line between benefits that are high enough to provide adequate income, but not so high as to discourage an employee\u2019s return to work when he or she is no longer disabled.", "In addition to discussions about the appropriateness of workers\u2019 compensation programs\u2019 benefit levels, some observers have made the point that beneficiaries with long-term or permanent disabilities who were injured early in their careers may have lost promotions or other opportunities to increase their pay relative to the compensation benefits they may be currently receiving.", "Under FECA, workers\u2019 compensation benefits for those who are totally disabled are 66-2/3 percent of wages for workers without dependents and 75 percent of wages for workers with one or more dependents.

In estimating replacement rates for beneficiaries with a spouse, we assumed that their spouses did not have taxable income. If spouses had income, replacement rates could be higher. The presence of a spouse\u2019s income results in a higher effective rate of tax on the income earned by the beneficiary returning to work.

In computing federal income taxes, we assumed that beneficiaries who received augmented FECA benefits had one dependent and that the dependent was a spouse. In 1997, each exemption claimed was worth $2,650 in computing taxable income. Replacement rates would have decreased by about 1.5 percent for each additional exemption.

Labor added that in general it might have been more useful if we had offered some estimates based on likely combinations of assumptions and that varying assumptions one by one, while it illustrated an impact or tendency, was probably misleading when applied universally to all cases.", "In view of the time constraints we faced when we started this assignment, we chose to develop take-home pay replacement rates based on a methodology that was similar to those that had been used in other workers\u2019 compensation studies, such as those conducted by the Workers Compensation Research Institute. We agree with Labor that it may have been possible to develop a more refined estimate of the overall replacement rate had we used other sources of information to make additional assumptions about FECA beneficiaries. We also agree that had we developed and analyzed likely combinations of other assumptions, we could have presented different estimates of take-home pay replacement rates. However, we believe that our methodology provided a useful overall replacement rate estimate that was based on reasonable assumptions.

In any event, the alternative replacement rate estimates suggested by Labor may or may not reflect FECA beneficiaries\u2019 actual replacement rates. For example, regarding marital status, we assumed that all beneficiaries who received the augmented dependent benefit had a spouse because the automated database did not distinguish between beneficiaries who were married or unmarried. Although the presence of spousal income would influence replacement rates, income of other dependents generally would not. Because an unknown number of beneficiaries may not have had a spouse, but rather a dependent such as a child or parent, we chose not to estimate the amount of income that may be associated with an unknown number of spouses. Recognizing that this would tend to understate our replacement rate calculations, we supplemented our primary analysis with examples of how changes in assumptions on spousal income would affect our replacement rate calculations, but we did not intend that the examples be applied universally to all cases.", "Labor also provided several other suggestions for expanding our analysis.

To limit the number of states for which we needed to make these calculations, we limited our replacement rate analyses to about 75 percent of the 30,057 beneficiaries selected.

We therefore made several calculations to estimate the current value of beneficiaries\u2019 take-home pay. First, we recomputed beneficiaries\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation benefits to reflect benefits received at the time of injury by reducing their June 1997 benefits by the amount of periodic cost-of-living allowances they received. Second, based on this recomputation of benefits received at the time of injury and whether they had at least one dependent as of June 1997, we calculated employees\u2019 pay before their injury based on either the 66-2/3 or 75 percent benefit level. Third, by increasing employees\u2019 pay at the time of injury by average federal pay comparability increases authorized since then, we calculated the current value of beneficiaries\u2019 pay at the time of injury. Fourth, from this amount, we made deductions for retirement benefit contributions; federal income taxes; and, where applicable, state income taxes in computing the current value of beneficiaries\u2019 take-home pay. Lastly, we compared current FECA benefits received to these take-home pay amounts to determine take-home pay replacement rates.", "Postal Service, blue-collar, and certain other federal employees are in pay plans that differ from the general schedule plan that covers most federal civilian workers. In computing the current value of workers\u2019 pay before the injury, we used OPM information on average federal pay comparability increases applicable to the general schedule because OWCP\u2019s automated databases did not contain sufficient information to identify either the occupations of over two-thirds of the beneficiaries we analyzed or the pay plans of beneficiaries.", "From OWCP and OPM information, we determined FECA benefit levels, the presence or absence of dependents, whether the beneficiary resided in a state with an income tax, and beneficiaries\u2019 estimated pay at the time of injury. However, to develop our estimates of take-home pay replacement rates, we also needed to make assumptions regarding beneficiaries\u2019 retirement and Medicare contributions, numbers of exemptions, amounts of itemized deductions (if taken), and spousal income. Changing the assumptions would change the estimated ratio of FECA benefits to take-home pay. The assumptions we made in calculating take-home pay replacement rates for our principal analyses follow. While information was not readily available to support different assumptions, we used different assumptions about numbers of exemptions, income tax deductions, and spousal income to illustrate how they could influence take-home pay replacement rates.", "Retirement and Medicare contributions. We assumed that all beneficiaries participated in CSRS and Medicare and that total deductions for these programs were 8.45 percent. Our profile information indicated that a high percentage of FECA beneficiaries on the long-term rolls were over 55 years old or were injured many years ago. Because the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) was not established until 1986, we assumed that most beneficiaries would have been CSRS participants.", "Under both CSRS and FERS, deductions for retirement and Medicare benefits totaled 8.45 percent. Under CSRS, deductions in 1997 were 7 percent for retirement benefits and 1.45 percent for Medicare benefits. Under FERS, deductions were 6.2 percent for Social Security retirement benefits, 0.8 percent for a FERS annuity, and 1.45 percent for Medicare benefits. However, under FERS, the 6.2 percent contribution for Social Security retirement benefits applied to only the first $65,400 of pay in 1997. Thus, take-home pay under our assumptions would be understated for the relatively small number of FECA beneficiaries whose 1997 pay was over $65,400 and who were in FERS. In these cases, replacement rates would be lower.", "Exemptions (dependents). In those cases in which FECA beneficiaries received augmented FECA benefits of 8-1/3 percent, the database did not indicate the exact number of dependents because the benefit is the same whether the beneficiary had one or more dependents. We assumed that such beneficiaries had only one dependent and that the dependent was a spouse. We made this assumption based on the average age of the beneficiaries analyzed and to simplify our tax and take-home pay calculations. In cases where there is more than one dependent, and therefore more exemptions for tax purposes, take-home pay would be higher and the replacement rate would be lower. Appendix II, table II.6 shows the effects of different exemption assumptions on take-home pay replacement rates. Because few beneficiaries were injured and added to the long-term rolls after they were 65 years old, we did not consider whether additional exemptions for age or blindness may have applied in computing take-home pay.", "Itemized deductions. In our computations of federal and state income taxes, we used federal and state standard deduction amounts for both single and married beneficiaries except in cases where state taxes could have exceeded federal standard deduction amounts. In these cases, our computations of federal income taxes used itemized deductions based on state income tax amounts rather than standard deduction amounts. To support our use of the standard deduction for computing income taxes, we used 1995 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information on tax filers who itemized deductions to show that lower income tax filers generally did not itemize deductions. Appendix II, table II.4 shows how the use of different itemized deduction amounts in computing federal income taxes would reduce take-home pay replacement rates. Appendix II, figure II.5 shows the range of take-home pay replacement rates by amount of pay for single and married beneficiaries claiming different deduction amounts.", "Spousal income. We assumed that if a FECA beneficiary received the dependent benefit, the dependent was a spouse. For our principal analyses, we assumed the spouse had no income. If spouses did have income, the beneficiaries\u2019 effective take-home pay replacement rates would have been higher. Examples of the effect of spousal income on take-home pay replacement rates are shown in appendix II, figure II.4.", "In estimating federal income taxes for our principal analyses, we generally computed taxable income by deducting amounts for federal standard deductions (i.e., $4,150 for a single individual or $6,900 for a couple filing a joint return) and exemptions (i.e., $2,650 for each exemption) from beneficiaries\u2019 gross pay adjusted to 1997 levels and applied 1997 federal income tax rates. Because over 25 percent of the FECA beneficiaries analyzed were single and because the average age of all beneficiaries analyzed was 61, we did not consider the effects of earned income tax credits in computing federal income taxes. If we had considered this credit for eligible FECA beneficiaries, effective take-home pay replacement rates would have been lower.", "In computing take-home pay for FECA beneficiaries who resided in states with an income tax, we took into account amounts the states allowed for standard deductions, spousal exemptions, and, where appropriate, other deductions or tax credits that were based on gross income in computing state income taxes. We obtained information on 1997 state income tax rates, exemptions, and standard deductions from the Research Institute of America\u2019s All States Tax Handbook and individual state\u2019s income tax forms and instructions. The residents of some states could be subject to county or city income taxes. However, we did not attempt to identify and take these types of taxes into consideration in computing FECA beneficiaries\u2019 take-home pay because it would have been time consuming and expensive to do so. If applicable, deductions for these taxes from pay would serve to increase take-home pay replacement rates.", "Our comparison of FECA benefits with the current value of take-home pay did not take into consideration beneficiaries\u2019 projected salary growth that might have resulted from merit pay increases or promotions had they not been injured.

Likewise, Labor noted that our replacement rate of 79.3 percent based on a single person who was paid $20,000 and whose itemized deductions were three times the standard deduction amount would not be reflective of the norm for that group because most single people with pay of $20,000 would not be itemizing deductions.
