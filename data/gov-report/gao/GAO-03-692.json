In response to concerns that data in its old information system did not accurately reflect the condition of facilities, BIA acquired a new system, called the Facilities Management Information System (FMIS). GAO was asked to determine whether FMIS addresses the old system's weaknesses and meets BIA's management needs, whether BIA has finished validating the accuracy of data entered into FMIS from the old system, and how well the quality control measures are working for ensuring the accuracy of new data being entered into the system from individual schools."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FMIS is designed to address the previous data system's shortcomings and appears to have the capability to meet BIA's management needs if the data that are entered into FMIS are correct and timely. The old system was hard to use and did not readily provide data for maintenance and repair efforts. FMIS's design appears to overcome these weaknesses. For example, FMIS has features that help facility managers make data more consistent, as well as tools for helping managers develop cost estimates for maintenance and construction projects. BIA's contractor has been correcting the data that were transferred to FMIS from the previous system, but issues such as software compatibility problems between the contractor's system and FMIS have delayed entry of some of the data for more than 1 year. BIA officials say that these problems are being addressed. They said the delay has not affected their ability to prioritize or fund repair and construction projects, and our review of the data indicated that most newly identified deficiencies will not need to be addressed for 2 to 5 years. Our review of data from 14 BIA schools and observations during site visits disclosed no instances in which these data problems resulted in an unsafe learning environment for children. Most measures for controlling the quality of new data BIA employees are entering into the system for individual schools are not working well. BIA has established a multilevel review process and training programs to help ensure that such data entries are complete and accurate, but BIA's contractor, in reviewing data at the end of this process, continues to find that nearly half of the proposed data entries coming through the system are inaccurate and incomplete. Data entries from one-third of 102 schools that entered data show a 100-percent error rate.

During fiscal year 2002, BIA\u2019s budget for operating, maintaining,  constructing, and repairing its school facilities was nearly $348 million.  For many years, BIA and tribal employees have been tracking the  condition of their school facilities using an automated information system.  Tribal Indian education organizations and BIA have had longstanding  concerns that the information system was inadequate for managing school  facilities and did not accurately reflect how many buildings are in good  condition or disrepair. As a result, BIA did not have accurate and complete  information to determine how much annual funding is needed at each  school site for heating, lighting, and other operating expenses, as well as  how much current and future funding is needed at each site for making  repairs and capital improvements, such as patching a roof or upgrading a  fire alarm system.", "Recognizing the need to address these concerns, BIA is now in its third  year of implementing a new Facilities Management Information System  (FMIS) to replace its old information system. Prior to implementing FMIS,  however, and to ensure that this new system met BIA\u2019s management  needs, BIA hired a consulting firm to identify weaknesses with the old  system and recommend improvements for designing a new one. Once the  new system was designed and BIA was prepared to implement it, BIA  hired an engineering firm to validate all of the data to be transferred from  the old system into FMIS to ensure that the data were accurate and  complete. To maintain the integrity of these data over time, BIA also  introduced various quality control measures for helping ensure that facility  management staff would accurately enter new data into FMIS. Because of  concerns about the quality of the data in the former system, the Congress  directed us to conduct a review in this area. After discussions with  cognizant congressional committees and several Indian education  organizations about the information that would be most helpful, we  focused our efforts on (1) whether BIA\u2019s new facilities management  information system addresses the former system\u2019s shortcomings and  meets BIA\u2019s needs for managing school facilities; (2) the status of BIA\u2019s  effort to validate the accuracy and completeness of the data being  transferred from the old system into FMIS; and (3) how well BIA\u2019s quality  control measures are working to ensure that new data entered into FMIS  are accurate and complete.", "To conduct our review of BIA\u2019s new information system, we reviewed the  studies that evaluated BIA\u2019s old information system and determined the  extent that BIA\u2019s new system implements recommendations.

BIA  operates 64 of the schools directly while the others are operated by tribes  through separate grant or contract agreements.  We previously reported on  issues related to the condition of BIA school facilities in 1997 and 2001.", "BIA\u2019s Office of Facilities Management and Construction (OFMC) is  responsible for overseeing FMIS. At both BIA-operated and tribal-operated  schools, it is the responsibility of the facility managers to enter data about  the inventory and condition of their schools into the system. Prior to  acceptance into FMIS, these draft data entries are reviewed and approved  by facility managers at BIA agency and regional offices respectively,  before final review and approval by a BIA contractor and BIA\u2019s central  office.", "For 22 years BIA relied on its Facility Construction Operations and  Maintenance (FACCOM) system to maintain inventory data for its annual  O&M program, as well as \u201cbacklog\u201d data that reflect repairs and  improvements needed outside of the annual maintenance program to  improve the facilities\u2019 condition now and in the future. These data assist  BIA in monitoring the status of facilities repair and new construction  projects and identifying funding needs for O&M and renovation.

In 1995, BIA  entered into a contract with Anteon Corporation, a system developer, to  design the new management information system. Relying on government  standards, BIA worked with Anteon Corporation to design the new  system and address FACCOM\u2019s shortcomings. In 1999, BIA contracted  with an engineering firm, Applied Management Engineering, Inc. (AME), to  conduct a survey at all school sites in order to validate the schools\u2019  condition data and to verify the presence of buildings and their use.  According to BIA officials, after AME validated each school\u2019s inventory  and condition data, and BIA approved it, the data were accepted into  FMIS.", "From fiscal years 1995 through 2002, BIA spent nearly $12.5 million to  develop and begin implementing FMIS. These costs include about   $8 million for contractor expenses and over $2.6 million for BIA in-house  expenses, which covered the design of FMIS and ongoing technical  support. During fiscal years 1999- 2003, BIA spent about $13 million for the  AME contract covering the validation of inventory and condition data and  other engineering support activities. To operate FMIS, BIA expects to  spend about $1.7 million annually through fiscal year 2006 for contractor  expenses and about $250,000 for in-house expenses. In fiscal year   2007, BIA hopes to move to an annual steady rate of about $750,000 for  contractor costs and about $250,000 for in-house costs.

FMIS is a Windows-based  system that provides a point-and-click feature, which makes it easy to  navigate the system without having to remember codes. This is important  for FMIS users, because some facility managers have little prior exposure  to computers. Facility managers we interviewed at the school sites and  agency and regional offices said that compared to FACCOM, FMIS is  better and easier to use. One facility manager in Arizona said FMIS is  easier to use because the system automatically sends messages to him  when changes are made to the data, allowing him to instantly see when  updates have been made to his school\u2019s data. Another facility manager in  Arizona said FMIS\u2019s automated functions, such as drop-down menus,  make it user friendly. Finally, according to BIA officials, FACCOM was  only accessible by about 3-4 percent of facility managers, which did not  include facility managers located at the schools. FMIS is designed to be  accessible by all of BIA\u2019s facility managers, including those at the school  sites, via an Internet connection. Although most of the facility managers  we visited at the schools said FMIS was better compared to FACCOM,  many had been unable to access FMIS at school sites since December of  2001 due to a court order that shut down access to BIA\u2019s Internet site.  These facility managers had to travel to agency or regional offices to enter  data or had to forward data to these offices for data entry.", "FMIS is also designed to help BIA employees improve the accuracy of the  data, in part through automated mechanisms that help facility managers  consistently describe the category and rank of backlog entries and the  funding needed to address them. One difficulty under FACCOM was that  entries listed in the backlog were often categorized incorrectly with  inflated priorities, making it difficult to determine which projects needed  immediate attention. To address this problem, FMIS is designed to restrict  who can enter safety deficiencies, which are given first priority for  funding. In addition, FMIS is designed to only accept entries that have  been reviewed and approved by three different levels of BIA management  and the contractor. Further, BIA refined the definitions of how backlog  items should be categorized and ranked to help facility managers use the  definitions consistently. The definitions now include nine categories and a  ranking system for determining the priority of the items entered into the  backlog (see table 1). These nine categories describe whether the  deficiency at the school affects safety and endangers students\u2019 lives;  violates an environmental, disability, or energy standard; is a maintenance  or capital improvement item; or requires an emergency repair. In addition,  the system ranks items using a scale from one through three\u2014with one  describing the most severe deficiency. The backlog entries ranked as a   \u201c1\u201d will most likely be funded first because they are the highest priority.

In  conducting this effort, AME visited each school and collected inventory  data using a standardized, industry-based approach to help ensure that  information on all facilities is uniformly collected and recorded. AME  completed the first phase of this effort in 2000, when it visited each school  to verify and update the inventory data listed in the FACCOM before its  transfer to FMIS in that year, according to a BIA official. This phase, which  focused on the more general aspects of the inventory, was aimed at such  matters as identifying which buildings were still in use, the use of the  facility, and who owns it. AME completed the second phase of the  improvement effort in February 2003. This second phase, which took  longer than the first phase, involved a more extensive measurement of the  buildings and updated the drawings of floor space, grounds, infrastructure,  and utility lines.

At our request, AME officials provided  revised square footage data for more than 90 buildings (such as classroom  buildings, dormitories, multipurpose buildings, and offices) at 13 different  schools. Overall, the revised measurements for these buildings decreased  the total square footage by about 3 percent, but the range in increases and  decreases at each school varied significantly. For 9 of the schools the  decrease in square footage ranged from less than 1 percent to more than  13 percent; increases for the remaining 4 schools, ranged from less than   1 percent to almost 18 percent.

However,  whether this corrected inventory data will be transferred to FMIS in time  for making fiscal year 2004 funding decisions is uncertain. BIA may yet  face some implementation problems as it moves into the final months of  putting this information in place. For example, during 2002, BIA attempted  to run the O&M funding formula using the existing FMIS inventory data for  the first time and experienced problems with the data and software. While  the agency has had a year to work out these problems, introduction of the  updated inventory data may hold its own unforeseen problems.

However, FMIS also includes entries  for capital improvements that will need to be addressed beyond 5 years to  upgrade specific building components such as replacing lighting and  power systems, siding, and carpeting as well as future construction to  replace, renovate, and add buildings to accommodate program needs.  Accurate and up-to-date backlog data are important because FMIS  contains formulas that use these data to allow BIA to make informed  decisions not only about which projects are in greatest need of attention,  but also how much money is needed to fund them each year. As of  October 2002, for example, BIA schools had a backlog of unfunded repairs  and improvements with an estimated cost over $640 million (see table 3);  FMIS shows that almost two-thirds of this amount may be needed within  the next 5 years.", "AME currently validates the backlog for each school in a 3-year cycle.  During its first review, in 1999, AME conducted a 100-percent validation of  the backlog data prior to transferring that data from the old FACCOM  system to the new FMIS backlog module. In that review, AME updated the  backlog data by confirming entries already in the system, updating the  costs estimated to conduct the work, deleting entries for duplicate items  or completed work, and identifying new entries. Results of the validation  effort, as shown in table 4, increased the backlog by more than   $265 million; almost 28 percent of the total backlog of $960 million that  existed in 1999.", "AME has since started the second review of each school, which consists of  updating this information for a certain percentage of the facilities each  year. AME updated 20 percent of the facilities in each year 2001 and  2002. For 2003, AME is on track to increase the percentage of facilities  reviewed each year to 34 percent to comply with recent changes in the  law. These updates involve visually inspecting the architectural,  structural, mechanical, and electrical components of each facility to  determine if action is still needed and to update the estimated costs. In  addition, AME identifies new deficiencies, including the extent to which  handicapped accessibility requirements are met, and verifying estimated  costs.", "Our review of some updates conducted during fiscal year 2002 indicates  that AME\u2019s reviews will continue to result in substantial changes in  backlog data. We obtained data for 14 of the schools reviewed between  February and April 2002. For the 14 schools, the AME update resulted in  a net increase of almost $11 million (see table 5) in the unfunded FMIS  backlog of more than $39 million, an increase of about 28 percent. Part of  the change involved modifications to deficiencies already in the backlog  inventory, such as revising cost estimates and deleting projects that had  been completed or no longer needed but were still listed in the backlog as  ongoing. However, a large part of the change involved adding new  deficiencies to the backlog. In all, there were almost 650 new backlog  entries, and more than 75 percent of these entries were for deficiencies  identified at school facilities and dormitories, where children are the  primary occupants. For example, there were more than 200 entries for  dormitories with an estimated cost of almost $4 million. None of these  entries were for urgent or safety deficiencies that needed immediate  attention; most were maintenance deficiencies that will need attention  over the next 2 to 5 years, such as repairing lighting and plumbing systems,  carpeting, and ceilings.", "While the contractor\u2019s field assessments are proceeding on schedule, there  have been significant delays in incorporating the 2002 updated backlog  data into FMIS. In fiscal year 2001, the first year of the updates, the  contractor assessed the condition of 39 schools and transferred the data  from its information system to the FMIS without problems, according to  BIA and contractor officials. However, officials said that in fiscal year  2002, the untimely transfer of data from the field assessments to the  contractor\u2019s information system and software compatibility problems  between the contractor\u2019s information system and FMIS delayed the update  of backlog data for 33 schools for over a year. These implementation  problems occurred for such reasons as the following:    BIA added a new function to the FMIS, which took 6 months to  implement, rather than the 2 months that they had planned, according  to a BIA official. This new function involved using the FMIS, for the  first time, to generate the O&M funding amounts to be distributed to  the various schools.", "A change to the backlog category and ranking system in FMIS created  duplicate entries that took time to resolve. In the 2002 assessments,  some deficiencies that were already in the system were recategorized,  and when the update was transferred to FMIS a duplicate entry was  created instead of overwriting the old entry. According to BIA and  contractor officials, this software compatibility problem has largely  been addressed. As of April 2003, data for 27 of the 33 schools had been  entered into FMIS.", "A BIA official told us that delays in introducing these updates into the  FMIS backlog could have some impact on their ability to prioritize or fund  repair and capital improvement projects, but not a significant impact for  two reasons. First, the deficiencies that receive the highest points in the  project ranking system are safety deficiencies, which are identified and  updated in an annual safety inspection by BIA\u2019s safety officers and not  AME. Second, the most critical deficiencies at the schools were identified  in the first assessment in 1999, and during this second assessment, AME is  finding very few deficiencies that would be funded within 1 to 2 years that  were not already in the system. However, one official acknowledged that  since the FMIS ranks the schools for major repair and capital  improvement projects based on the points applied to each deficiency, if  AME\u2019s assessment indicated an increase in the severity of a deficiency and  that change was not reflected in the system, that school could be ranked  lower than if the data were up to date.", "Our site visits to 8 BIA-funded schools did not disclose any instances  where serious problems were not being addressed. While facilities  management staff and school principals pointed out problems with their  facilities, we did not observe that the children were in an unsafe learning  environment with obvious safety or repair issues.

Among the facilities  management staffs in the agency and regional offices that we interviewed,  most had an engineering background or had significant experience in  facilities management and they were aware that maintaining accurate and  complete data in the FMIS was important. However, facilities managers we  interviewed at two regional offices each had a different view about their  role in the review process. One said that it was important that the backlog  entries are consistent and that two staff had been designated to review the  FMIS entries from the schools and agencies in the region before being sent  on to the central office for review by the contractor.

BIA officials acknowledged that a  user manual to provide this type of guidance was lacking and should be  developed. BIA officials said developing the FMIS training has been a  challenge because the facilities management staffs have different levels of  knowledge about computers\u2014for some facility managers, FMIS training  was their first exposure to using a computer. The training programs were  developed to meet the needs of this diverse group of users, according to  the contractor that developed and provides the training.

The kind of detail that is needed to successfully enter a  deficiency can be seen in an example involving the repair of a leaking roof.  To adequately estimate the cost for this repair, information is needed  about the size of the area that needs repair or replacement, the  composition of the roof (such as asphalt shingles or tile), and other  associated components (such as whether skylights or gutters are present  and whether they also need to be replaced).

First, we reviewed the needs assessment studies conducted by  independent contractors to identify old system weaknesses and the  recommendations made for addressing the system problems. We then  reviewed the FMIS documentation to determine whether the system  addressed weaknesses identified in the needs assessment. In addition, we  conducted interviews with some of the contractors hired by BIA to build  and implement the system.
