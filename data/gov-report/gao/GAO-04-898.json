Still, participation was poor, with just 5,390 questionnaires returned from the three test sites--France, Kuwait, and Mexico. Moreover, because of the low response levels, obtaining those questionnaires proved to be quite expensive--around $1,450 per response, which is far costlier on a unit basis than the 2000 Census. Although the two are not directly comparable because the 2000 Census included operations not used in the overseas test, the 2000 Census cost around $56 per household. Further, boosting the response rate globally might not be practical. On the domestic front, during the 2000 Census, the Bureau spent $374 million on a months-long publicity campaign that consisted of television and other advertising that helped yield a 72-percent return rate. Replicating this level of effort on a worldwide basis would be difficult, and still would not produce a complete count. Ensuring a smooth overseas count could also stretch the Bureau's resources. For example, at each test site the Bureau encountered various challenges that needed to be resolved such as French privacy laws. Moreover, managing a complex operation from thousands of miles away also proved difficult. The approach used to count the overseas population in the 2004 test--a voluntary survey that largely relies on marketing to secure a complete count, lacks the basic building blocks of a successful census. The Bureau has done some initial research on alternatives, but all require more extensive review. Given that the Bureau already faces the difficult task of securing a successful stateside count in 2010, having to simultaneously count Americans abroad would only add to the challenges facing the Bureau."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although more than four million American citizens are believed to reside  abroad, the precise number of overseas Americans is unknown.

However, in recent years, the Bureau\u2019s  policy of excluding private citizens from the decennial census has been  called into question.  For example, advocates of an overseas census claim  that better demographic data on this population group would be useful for  a variety of policy-making and business purposes, and would better  represent their unique interests in Congress.  Moreover, in January 2001,  Utah sued the Bureau\u2019s parent agency, the U.S. Department of Commerce,  claiming that it lost a congressional seat because the 2000 Census excluded  the state\u2019s 11,000 Mormon missionaries and other private citizens living  abroad.  According to the Congressional Research Service, Utah would  have gained a congressional seat had an additional 855 people been  included in the state\u2019s apportionment totals.  Utah\u2019s suit, however, was  unsuccessful.", "As we noted in our May 2004 report on this issue, counting Americans  abroad as an integral part of the 2010 Census would be a monumental task  that would introduce new resource demands, risks, and uncertainties to an  endeavor that was already facing a variety of difficulties.   Specific  challenges include policy questions such as who should be counted and  how should the data be used, as well as logistical difficulties such as  ensuring a complete count and verifying U.S. citizenship.", "To assess the practicality of counting overseas Americans, the Bureau held  a test enumeration from February through July 2, 2004, in France, Kuwait,  and Mexico.

The key part of this effort, the  enumeration, took place from February 2004 through July 2, 2004, in  France, Kuwait, and Mexico.  To promote the overseas census test the  Bureau relied on third parties\u2014American organizations and businesses in  the three countries\u2014to communicate to their members and/or customers  that an overseas enumeration of Americans was taking place and to make  available to U.S. citizens either the paper questionnaire or Web site  address.", "Currently, the Bureau is processing and analyzing the overseas  questionnaire data and plans to complete an evaluation of the test results in  early 2005.

The Bureau has requested additional funds for fiscal year 2005 to  plan for further testing scheduled for 2006.  The Bureau also plans to  include overseas testing in the 2008 dress rehearsal if it were to receive the  necessary funding.", "In May 2004 we reported on the design of the overseas enumeration test  and concluded that because of various methodological limitations, the test  results will only partially answer the Bureau\u2019s key research objectives  concerning feasibility (as measured by such indicators as participation and  number of valid returns), data quality, and cost.  Further, we noted that the  Bureau should not decide on its own whether or not to enumerate  Americans overseas, and in fact would need congressional guidance on  how to proceed.  As shown in figure 1, the key decisions facing Congress in  this regard include, in addition to the threshold question of whether  American residing overseas should be counted, how the data should be  used and whether to enumerate this population group as part of the  decennial census.", "We also recommended that if further testing were to occur, that the Bureau  resolve the shortcomings of the design of the 2004 test and better address  the objectives of an overseas enumeration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As agreed with your offices, our objectives for this report were to assess  (1) whether the Bureau implemented the test consistent with its design,  and (2) the initial lessons learned from the test results and their  implications for future overseas enumerations.

In addition,  to a more limited extent, we interviewed officials from third party  organizations in Kuwait via the telephone or e-mail.  We judgmentally  selected these organizations because they had agreed to display census  promotional materials and, in some cases, had also agreed to do one or  more of the following activities: make available paper copies of the census  questionnaire, publish information in a newsletter, post a link to a Web site,  send outreach e-mail to members, and/or create speaking opportunities to  discuss the census.

The  Bureau\u2019s experience in the 2000 Census highlights the level of effort that  was needed to raise public awareness about the census and get people to  complete their forms.  For the 2000 decennial, the Bureau spent $374  million on a comprehensive marketing, communications, and partnership  effort.  The campaign consisted of a five-part strategy conducted in three  waves beginning in the fall of 1999 and continuing past Census Day (April 1,  2000).  The effort helped secure a 72-percent return rate.  Specific elements  included television, radio, and other mass media advertising; promotions  and special events; and a census-in-schools program.  Thus, over a period  of several months, the American public was on the receiving end of a  steady drumbeat of advertising aimed at publicizing the census and  motivating them to respond.", "The Bureau also filled 594 full-time partnership specialist positions.  These  individuals were responsible for mobilizing support for the census on a  grassroots basis by working with governmental entities, private companies,  and religious and social service groups, and other organizations.", "Replicating this level of effort on a worldwide basis would be impractical,  and still would not produce a complete count.  Indeed, even after the  Bureau\u2019s aggressive marketing effort in 2000, it still had to follow-up with  about 42 million households that did not return their census forms.

In fact, just the opposite  would be true.  Because of the inevitability of country-specific problems,  rather than conducting a single overseas count based on a standard set of  rules and procedures (as is the case with the stateside census), the Bureau  might end up administering what amounts to dozens of separate  censuses\u2014one for each of the countries it enumerates\u2014each with its own  set of procedures adapted to each country\u2019s unique requirements.  The time  and resources required to do this would likely be overwhelming and detract  from the Bureau\u2019s stateside efforts.", "For example, during the overseas test, the Bureau found that French  privacy laws restrict the collection of personal data such as race and ethnic  information.  However, these data are collected as part of the decennial  census because they are key to implementing a number of civil rights laws  such as the Voting Rights Act.", "Addressing France\u2019s privacy laws took a considerable amount of  negotiation between the two countries, and was ultimately resolved after a  formal agreement was developed.  The Bureau issued and posted on its  Web site an advisory that informed Americans living in France that it was  not mandatory to respond to the questionnaire, the only recipient of the  collected data is the Census Bureau, the data will be kept for one year, and  the respondent has a right to access and correct the data collected.  The  Bureau was able to collect race and ethnic data\u2014generally a prohibited  practice without the respondents\u2019 permission\u2014only after it received  special approval from a French government agency.  Initially, however, it  looked as if the Bureau might have to redesign the census form if it wanted  to use it in France.", "In Kuwait, delivery of the census materials was delayed by several weeks at  the beginning of the test because they were accidentally addressed to the  wrong contractor.  Ultimately, the U.S. Embassy stepped-in to accept the  boxes so that the enumeration could proceed.  In Mexico, there was some  initial confusion on the part of Mexican postal workers as to whether they  could accept the postage-paid envelopes that the Bureau had provided to  return the paper questionnaires for processing in the United States.", "Because of the small number of countries involved in the test, the Bureau  was able to address the various problems it encountered.

Specific activities the organizations could  perform included displaying promotional materials and paper versions of  the census questionnaire, publishing information in a newsletter, and  posting information on their Web sites.  Although the public relations firm  appeared to go to great lengths to enlist the participation of these various  entities\u2014soliciting the support of hundreds of organizations in the three  countries\u2014the test revealed the difficulties of adequately overseeing a  contractor operating in multiple sites overseas.", "For example, the public relations firm\u2019s tracking system indicated that  around 440 entities had agreed to perform one or more types of  promotional activities.  However, our on-site inspections of several of these  organizations in Paris, France, and Guadalajara, Mexico, that had agreed to  display the census materials and/or distribute the questionnaires,  uncovered several glitches.  Of the 36 organizations we visited that were  supposed to be displaying promotional literature, we found the information  was only available at 15.   In those cases, as shown in figure 3, the materials  were generally displayed in prominent locations, typically on a table with  posters on a nearby wall.", "Five of these 15 organizations were also distributing the census  questionnaire, but the forms were not readily accessible.", "However, at 21 sites we visited, we found various discrepancies between  what the public relations firm indicated had occurred, and what actually  took place.  For example, while the firm\u2019s tracking system indicated that  questionnaires would be available at a restaurant and an English-language  bookstore in Guadalajara, none were available.  In fact, the owner of the  bookstore told us that no one from the Census Bureau or the public  relations firm had contacted her about displaying materials for the  overseas test.", "At the University of Guadalajara, although the tracking system indicated  that an official had been contacted about, and agreed to help support the  census test, that official told us no one had contacted him.  As a result,  when boxes of census materials were delivered to his school without any  explanatory information, he did not know what to do with them, and had to  telephone the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara to figure out what they were  for.", "Likewise, in Paris, we went to several locations where the tracking system  indicated that census information would be available.  None was.   In fact,  at some of these sites, not only was there no information about the census,  but there was no indication that the organization we were looking for was  at the address we had from the database.", "The results of the overseas test point to the difficulties of overseeing the  contractor\u2019s performance.  As census materials were made available at  scores of locations across the three test countries, it would have been  impractical for the Bureau to inspect each site.  The difficulty of  supervising contractors\u2014and any field operation for that matter\u2014would  only be magnified in a global enumeration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Design of the Overseas Census Lacks the Building Blocks of a Successful Census", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau\u2019s experience in counting the nation\u2019s population for the 2000  and earlier censuses sheds light on some of the specific operations and  other elements that together form the building blocks of a successful head  count  (see fig. 4).", "While performing these activities does not necessarily guarantee a cost- effective headcount, not performing them makes a quality count far less  promising and puts the entire enterprise at risk. The current approach to  counting overseas Americans lacks these building blocks, as most are  infeasible to perform on an overseas population.  Each is discussed in  greater detail below.", "Mandatory participation:  Under federal law, all persons residing in  the United States regardless of citizenship status are required to  respond to the decennial census.  By contrast, the overseas enumeration  test was conducted as a voluntary survey where participation was  optional.  The Bureau has found that response rates to mandatory  surveys are higher than the response rates to voluntary surveys.  This in  turn yields more complete data and helps hold down costs.", "Early agreement on design:  Both Congress and the Bureau need to  agree on the fundamental design of an overseas census.  Concurrence  on the design helps ensure adequate planning, testing and funding  levels.  Conversely, the lack of an agreed-upon design raises the risk that  basic design elements might change in the years ahead, while the  opportunities to test those changes and integrate them with other  operations will diminish.  Under the Bureau\u2019s current plans, after the  2006 test, the Bureau would have just one more opportunity to test its  prototype for an overseas enumeration\u2014a dress rehearsal in 2008.  Any  design changes after 2008 would not be tested in a real-world  environment.", "The design of the census is driven in large part by the purposes for  which the data will be used.  Currently, no decisions have been made on  whether the overseas data will be used for purposes of congressional  apportionment, redistricting, allocating federal funds, or other  applications.  Some applications, such as apportionment, would require  precise population counts and a very rigorous design that parallels the  stateside count.  Other applications, however, could get by with less  precision and thus, a less stringent approach.", "As we noted previously, Congress will need to decide whether or not to  count overseas Americans, and how the results should be used.  The  basis for these determinations needs to be sound research on the cost,  quality of data, and logistical feasibility of the range of options for  counting this population group.  Possibilities include counting  Americans via a separate survey, administrative records such as  passport and voter registration forms, and/or records maintained by  other countries such as published census records and work permits.", "The Bureau\u2019s initial research has shown that each of these options has  coverage, accuracy, and accessibility issues, and some might introduce  systemic biases into the data.  Far more extensive research would be  needed to determine the feasibility of these or other potential  approaches.  Once Congress knows the tradeoffs of these various  alternatives, it will be better positioned to provide the Bureau with the  guidance it needs to go beyond research and conduct field tests of  specific approaches. The Bureau can conduct the research, or it can  contract it out.  Indeed, the National Research Council of the National  Academy of Sciences has conducted a number of studies on the  decennial census, including a review of the 2000 Census and an  examination of reengineering the 2010 Census.", "A complete and accurate address list:  The cornerstone of a  successful census is a quality address list.  For the stateside census, the  Bureau goes to great lengths to develop what is essentially an inventory  of all known living quarters in the United States, including sending  census workers to canvass every street in the nation to verify addresses.   The Bureau uses this information to deliver questionnaires, follow up  with nonrespondents, determine vacancies, and identify households the  Bureau may have missed or counted more than once.  Because it would  be impractical to develop an accurate parallel address list for overseas  Americans, these operations would be impossible and the quality of the  data would suffer as a result.", "Ability to detect invalid returns:  Ensuring the integrity of the census  data requires the Bureau to have a mechanism to screen out invalid  responses.  Stateside, the Bureau does this by associating an  identification number on the questionnaire to a specific address in the  Bureau\u2019s address list, as well as by field verification. However, the  Bureau\u2019s current approach to counting overseas Americans is unable to  determine whether or not a respondent does in fact reside abroad.  So  long as a respondent provides certain pieces of information on the  census questionnaire, it will be eligible for further processing.  The  Bureau is unable to confirm the point of origin for questionnaires  completed on the Internet, and postmarks on a paper questionnaire only  tell the location from which a form was mailed, not the place of  residence of the respondent.  The Bureau has acknowledged that  ensuring such validity might be all but impossible for any reasonable  level of effort and funding.", "Ability to follow up with non-respondents:  Because participation in  the decennial census is mandatory, the Bureau sends enumerators to  those households that do not return their questionnaires.  In cases  where household members cannot be contacted or refuse to answer all  or part of a census questionnaire, enumerators are to obtain data from  neighbors, a building manager, or other nonhousehold member  presumed to know about its residents.  The Bureau also employs  statistical techniques to impute data when it lacks complete information  on a household.  Thus, by the end of each decennial census, the Bureau  has a fairly exhaustive count of everyone in the nation.  As noted above,  because the Bureau lacks an address list of overseas Americans, it is  unable to follow up with nonrespondents or impute information on  missing households.  As a result, the Bureau will never be able to obtain  a complete count of overseas Americans.", "Cost model for estimating needed resources:  The Bureau uses a  cost model and other baseline data to help it estimate the resources it  needs to conduct the stateside census.  Key assumptions such as  response levels and workload are developed based on the Bureau\u2019s  experience in counting people decade after decade.  However, the  Bureau has only a handful of data points with which to gauge the  resources necessary for an overseas census, and the tests it plans on  conducting will only be of limited value in modeling the costs of  conducting a worldwide enumeration in 2010.", "The lack of baseline data could cause the Bureau to over- or  underestimate the staffing, budget and other requirements of an  overseas count.  For example, this was evident during the 2004 overseas  test when the Bureau estimated it would need around 100,000 Spanish- language questionnaires for the Mexican test site.  As only 35 Spanish- language questionnaires were returned, it is now clear that the Bureau  could have gotten by with printing far fewer questionnaires for Mexico.    However, the dilemma for the Bureau is that its experience in the 2004  overseas test cannot be used to project the number of Spanish-language  questionnaires it would need for Mexico or other Spanish-speaking  countries in 2010.  Similar problems would apply to efforts to enumerate  other countries.", "Targeted and aggressive marketing campaign:  The key to raising  public awareness of the census is an intensive outreach and promotion  campaign.  As noted previously, the Bureau\u2019s marketing efforts for the  2000 Census were far-reaching, and consisted of more than 250 ads in 17  languages that were part of an effort to reach every household, including  those in historically undercounted populations.  Replicating this level of  effort on a global scale would be both difficult and expensive, and the  Bureau has no plans to do so.", "Field infrastructure to execute census and deal with problems:   The Bureau had a vast network of 12 regional offices and 511 local  census offices to implement various operations for the 2000 Census.   This decentralized structure enabled the Bureau to carry out a number  of activities to help ensure a more complete and accurate count, as well  as deal with problems when they arose.  Moreover, local census offices  are an important source of intelligence on the various enumeration  obstacles the Bureau faces on the ground.  For example, during the 2000  Census, the Bureau called on them to identify hard-to-count population  groups and other challenges, and to develop action plans to address  them.  The absence of a field infrastructure for an overseas census  means that the Bureau would have to rely heavily on contractors to  conduct the enumeration, and manage the entire enterprise from its  headquarters in Suitland, Maryland.", "Ability to measure coverage and accuracy:  Since 1980, the Bureau  has measured the quality of the decennial census using statistical  methods to estimate the magnitude of any errors.  The Bureau reports  these estimates by specific ethnic, racial, and other groups.  For  methodological reasons, similar estimates cannot be generated for an  overseas census.  As a result, the quality of the overseas count, and thus  whether the numbers should be used for specific purposes, could not be  accurately determined."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The 2004 test of the feasibility of an overseas enumeration was an  extremely valuable exercise in that it highlighted the numerous obstacles  to a cost-effective count of Americans abroad as an integral part of the  decennial census.  Although more comprehensive results will not be  available until the Bureau completes its evaluation of the test early next  year, a key lesson learned is already clear:  The current approach to  counting this population group\u2014a voluntary survey that largely relies on  marketing to ensure a complete count\u2014would be costly and yield poor  results.  The tools and resources the Bureau has on hand to enumerate  overseas Americans are insufficient for overcoming the inherent obstacles  to a complete count, and it is unlikely that any refinements to this basic  design would produce substantially better results, and certainly not on a  par suitable for purposes of congressional apportionment.", "What\u2019s more, the Bureau already faces the difficult task of carrying out a  cost-effective stateside enumeration in 2010.  Securing a successful count  of Americans in Vienna, Virginia, is challenging enough; a complete count  of Americans in Vienna, Austria\u2014and in scores of other countries around  the globe\u2014would only add to the difficulties facing the Bureau as it looks  toward the next national head count.   As a result, we believe that any  further tests or planning activities related to counting Americans overseas  as part of the decennial census would be an imprudent use of the Bureau\u2019s  limited resources.", "That said, to the extent that Congress desires better data on the number  and characteristics of Americans abroad for various policy-making and  other nonapportionment purposes that require less precision, such  information does not necessarily need to be collected as part of the  decennial census, and could, in fact, be acquired through a separate survey  or other means.  To help inform congressional decision making on this  issue, including decisions on whether Americans should be counted and  how the data should be used, it will be important for Congress to have the  results of the Bureau\u2019s evaluation of the 2004 overseas census test.  Equally  important would be information on the cost, quality of data, and logistical  feasibility of counting Americans abroad using alternatives to the decennial  census.  Once Congress knows the tradeoffs of these various alternatives, it  would be better positioned to provide the Bureau with the direction it  needs so that the Bureau could then develop and test an approach that  meets congressional requirements at reasonable resource levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Given the obstacles to a cost-effective count of overseas Americans as part  of the decennial census and, more specifically, obtaining data that is of  sufficient quality to be used for congressional apportionment, Congress  may wish to consider eliminating funding for any additional research,  planning, and development activities related to counting this population as  part of the decennial headcount, including funding for tests planned in 2006  and 2008.
