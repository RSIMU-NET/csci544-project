In 1966, OMB issued Circular A-76, which established federal policy for the government\u2019s performance of commercial activities and set forth the procedures for studying them for potential contracting. In 1979, OMB issued a supplemental handbook to the circular that included cost comparison procedures for determining whether commercial activities should be performed in-house, by another federal agency through an interservice support agreement, or by the private sector. OMB updated this handbook in 1983 and again in March 1996.", "The March 1996 Revised Supplemental Handbook clarified numerous areas, including the application of the A-76 cost comparison requirements. The handbook\u2019s introduction describes a wide range of options government officials must consider as they contemplate reinventing government operations. They include \u201cthe consolidation, restructuring or reengineering of activities, privatization options, make or buy decisions, the adoption of better business management practices, the development of joint ventures with the private sector, asset sales, the possible devolution of activities to state and local governments and the termination of obsolete services or programs.\u201d The introduction also explains that \u201cin the context of this larger reinvention effort, the scope of the Supplemental Handbook is limited to conversion of recurring commercial activities to or from in-house, contract or interservice support agreement performance.\u201d", "Where A-76 cost comparison procedures apply, the initial step is to develop a performance work statement describing what is needed to perform the activity. That statement is used as the technical performance section of a solicitation for private-sector offers. The government also develops a management plan that describes the most efficient organization for in-house performance of the activity described in the performance work statement. The cost of performance by the government in accordance with the most efficient organization is compared to the cost proposed by the private-sector source selected pursuant to the solicitation. The activity will be converted to performance by the private sector if the private sector\u2019s offer represents a reduction of at least  10 percent of direct personnel costs or $10 million over the performance period. Further information about the A-76 process is included in  appendix I.", "In addition to A-76, the Department of Defense (DOD) must consider the effect of 10 U.S.C. 2461 when it plans changes to an industrial or commercial type function performed by its civilian employees.  Section 2461, as amended by the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, Public Law 105-261, requires an analysis of the activity, including a comparison of the cost of performance by DOD civilian employees and by a contractor, to determine whether contractor performance could result in a savings to the government. It also requires DOD to notify Congress of the analysis and to provide other information prior to instituting a change in performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process of Deactivating 38th EIW Involves Multiple Actions", "paragraphs": ["The 38th EIW is an active component Air Force unit with a wartime support mission that has been greatly diminished since the end of the Cold War. Deactivation of the 38th EIW will involve multiple actions to realign the wartime mission and reassign other peacetime roles.", "The 38th EIW provides engineering and installation (E&I) services in support of the Air Force\u2019s communications needs. It supports flight facilities, intrusion detection, ground radio, wideband/satellite systems, local area networks, cable/fiber optic distribution systems, switching systems, and other communications systems. The 38th EIW is an Air Force Materiel Command unit headquartered at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, with squadrons at Keesler AFB, Mississippi; Kelly AFB, Texas; and McClellan AFB, California. In addition, an active duty military advisor is stationed at each of the 19 ANG units\u2014units that also provide engineering and installation services. Currently, the 38th EIW consists of 2,343 personnel (1,358 military and 985 civilian) at these bases and various ANG locations. Table 1 shows the active component military and civilian personnel authorized for the 38th EIW at each location.", "The squadrons at Keesler, Kelly, and McClellan AFBs are composed primarily of military personnel. About a third of the total EIW authorized personnel (726 military and 40 civilian) perform installation services. The remainder of the military and civilian personnel perform engineering; logistics; and other support functions.", "The 19 ANG units noted above have 2,314 authorized guard personnel: they perform peacetime installation services as part of their training. Further, the Air Force relies on the private sector to provide E&I services using approximately 40 different indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts.", "The 38th EIW\u2019s structure was premised on its cold war mission of reconstituting damaged fixed communications systems (radars, phone lines, cables, etc.) at overseas bases. However, under the new Air Expeditionary Force concept, existing military forces will go into bare bases and use tactical, or mobile, communications gear. Consequently, the need to repair these fixed communications is reduced and there is greater reliance on tactical communications.", "Based on the reassessment of its wartime mission requirements and the Quadrennial Defense Review process (which recommended DOD improve the efficiency and performance of support activities by reengineering), the Air Force decided that the wartime E&I mission could be transferred to the ANG. At the same time, the Air Force would retain a minimal active-duty capability, provided by a new rapid response squadron at Keesler AFB. Since there will no longer be a need for the 38th EIW to supply the Air Force\u2019s peacetime E&I needs in order to maintain wartime skills, the Air Force no longer has a requirement to maintain the large E&I infrastructure of the 38th EIW.", "As currently proposed, the deactivation of the 38th EIW would eliminate 1,200 of its 1,358 military positions and 552 of its 985 civilian positions. After the wing is deactivated, the remaining 158 military personnel and 433 civilian personnel will be reassigned to existing or new organizations, located principally at Tinker and Keesler AFBs.

These commands may acquire such services from (1) contracts, (2) the ANG E&I units, or (3) the rapid response squadron at Keesler, based on availability.

According to the Air Force, A-76 does not apply to its plan because the deactivation of the 38th EIW does not constitute a conversion of the performance of an activity by civilian DOD employees as envisioned under the circular. The Air Force\u2019s changed wartime requirements have caused it to propose a realignment of the responsibilities and missions of the 38th EIW. Consequently, the original function of the 38th EIW has been fundamentally altered and the need for civilian employee support is significantly reduced. We find the Air Force\u2019s conclusion that A-76 does not apply to be reasonable.", "The Air Force made a reasonable judgment in deciding that its deactivation of the 38th EIW and the restructuring of the delivery of E&I services is not subject to the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2461 since the plan does not constitute a change from performance of a particular workload by DOD civilian employees to private sector performance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Air Force Plan Does Not Constitute an A-76 Conversion", "paragraphs": ["The handbook does not provide detailed guidance as to what constitutes a conversion of a commercial activity for purposes of A-76. Between 1979 and 1994, DOD conducted over 2,000 competitions using the A-76 process. Most of these involved activities, such as groundskeeping, laundry, and food service, where the conversions proposed were straightforward exchanges of a government employee workforce for a contractor workforce to perform a particular service. An agency must base its judgment about whether A-76 applies on the individual facts of each initiative. As each case usually involves a unique situation, an agency has the discretion to determine the applicability of A-76 to its particular initiative as long as the agency has exercised its judgment reasonably.", "The handbook introduction explains that a commercial activity is a process resulting in a product or service that may be obtained from the private sector and that some management initiatives, such as \u201creengineering,\u201d \u201cprivatization,\u201d or \u201crestructuring,\u201d involving such activities are beyond conversions and are not subject to the cost-comparison requirements of A-76. Therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the guidance to mean that A-76 conversions are not intended to encompass every initiative that results in the loss of civilian government jobs. Further, the handbook provides that it is not to apply to the conversion of activities performed by uniformed military personnel.", "The Air Force plan to deactivate the 38th EIW and transfer its E&I activities to other organizations within the Air Force or to the ANG is a comprehensive change to the missions and responsibilities of the 38th EIW. The Air Force has decided that the 38th EIW\u2019s wartime mission should be transferred to the ANG. As a result, it appears that the Air Force no longer has a requirement to maintain a large, centralized E&I infrastructure to train personnel to meet this mission. The peacetime E&I work was performed by the 38th EIW, in large part, to maintain its skills and capabilities to perform its wartime mission. This included a large civilian workforce performing peacetime E&I work to support the wartime mission of the uniformed military personnel. Now that this wartime mission has been transferred to the ANG, which does not need this civilian support, there is no longer a requirement to maintain the infrastructure.", "The type of E&I work being impacted by the Air Force plan would generally fit within the definition of commercial activity for A-76 purposes. However, the Air Force plan is not simply a changeover of this commercial activity from performance by civilian employees to private sector workers. In fact, the majority of positions affected are uniformed military personnel, which are not subject to A-76. Of 1,358 military personnel assigned to the 38th EIW, only 158 will remain. The civilians in the 38th EIW were primarily performing commercial E&I activities to provide continuity during contingencies and support for military personnel to enhance their wartime skills. Absent the military requirement, the E&I services could have been supplied by contract with the private sector.", "Under the restructuring, civilian positions will be lost and the different Air Force units could meet some of their new responsibilities by obtaining E&I services through contractors. However, this is an incidental result of a plan that primarily involves the reassignment of uniformed military personnel and the transfer of their responsibilities to other organizations. The civilian performance of the commercial E&I activity was essentially an adjunct of the military mission. The civilians who remain will be reassigned to different organizations and locations. Thus, we find reasonable the Air Force decision that its plan to change the wartime mission of the 38th EIW is not the type of management initiative that is subject to A-76."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Plan Does Not Constitute Change in Performance of a Function Under 10 U.S.C. 2461", "paragraphs": ["We believe that the Air Force made a reasonable judgment in deciding that its deactivation of the 38th EIW and the restructuring of the delivery of E&I services which that necessitates is not subject to the requirements of section 2461 since the plan does not constitute a change from performance of a particular workload by DOD civilian employees to private-sector performance.", "Section 2461 requires that before any commercial or industrial type function is changed from performance by DOD civilian employees to private-sector performance, DOD must report to Congress and perform an analysis showing that private sector performance will result in a savings to the government over the life of the contract.

The estimated contract costs were based on existing negotiated contract rates for an equivalent level of effort. The analysis showed that most of the recurring savings would result from engineer and installer manpower cuts and unit operations and maintenance reductions. Also, the business case analysis found that the Air Force will realize an estimated one-time savings of $33 million, of which $28 million is due to the cancellation of planned Base Realignment and Closure construction projects associated with the future realignment of Kelly AFB and the closure of McClellan AFB. (These construction projects were planned at other bases in order to accommodate the E&I workload being transferred from the squadrons at McClellan and Kelly AFBs as the result of 1995 base realignment and closure decisions.)

The solid lines indicate the process used when the government issues an IFB, requesting firm bids on the cost of performing a commercial activity. This process is normally used for more routine commercial activities, such as grass-cutting or cafeteria operations, where the work process and requirements are well defined. The dotted lines indicate the additional steps that take place when the government wants to pursue a negotiated, \u201cbest value\u201d procurement. While it may not be appropriate for use in all cases, this process is often used when the commercial activity involves high levels of complexity, expertise, and risk.", "Most Efficient Organization (MEO) activities Additional steps required for request for  proposals (RFP)", "The circular requires the government to develop a performance work statement. This statement, which is incorporated into either the IFB or RFP, serves as the basis for both government estimates and private sector offers. If the IFB process is used, each private sector company develops and submits a bid, giving its firm price for performing the commercial activity. While this process is taking place, the government activity performs a management study to determine the most efficient and effective way of performing the activity with in-house staff. Based on this \u201cmost efficient organization,\u201d the government develops a cost estimate and submits it to the selecting authority. The selecting authority concurrently opens the government\u2019s estimate along with the bids of all private sector firms. According to OMB\u2019s A-76 guidance, the government\u2019s in-house estimate wins the competition unless the private sector\u2019s offer meets a threshold of savings that is at least 10 percent of direct personnel costs or $10 million over the performance period. This minimum cost differential was established by OMB to ensure that the government would not contract out for marginal estimated savings.", "If the RFP\u2014best value process\u2014is used, the Federal Procurement Regulations and the A-76 Supplemental Handbook require several additional steps. The private sector offerors submit proposals that often include a technical performance proposal, and a price. The government prepares an in-house management plan and cost estimate based strictly on the performance work statement. On the other hand, private sector proposals can offer a higher level of performance or service.", "The government\u2019s selection authority reviews the private sector proposals to determine which one represents the best overall value to the government based on such considerations as (1) higher performance levels, (2) lower proposal risk, (3) better past performance, and (4) cost to do the work. After the completion of this analysis, the selection authority prepares a written justification supporting its decision. This includes the basis for selecting a contractor other than the one that offered the lowest price to the government. Next, the authority evaluates the government\u2019s offer and determines whether it can achieve the same level of performance and quality as the selected private sector proposal. If not, the government must then make changes to meet the performance standards accepted by the authority. This ensures that the in-house cost estimate is based upon the same scope of work and performance levels as the best value private sector offer. After determining that the offers are based on the same level of performance, the cost estimates are compared. As with the IFB process, the work will remain in-house unless the private offer is (1) 10 percent less in direct personnel costs or (2) $10 million less over the performance period.", "Participants in the process\u2014for either the IFB or RFP process\u2014may appeal the selection authority\u2019s decision if they believe the costs submitted by one or more of the participants were not fair, accurate, or calculated in the manner prescribed by the A-76 handbook.
