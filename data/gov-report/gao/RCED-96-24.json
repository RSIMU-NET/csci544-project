In 1962, manufacturers began to install safety belt anchorages at the factory, making it easier for car dealers or owners to add safety belts later.

These studies showed that using safety belts generally reduced the rates of both fatalities and serious injuries by 50 to 75 percent in crashes involving motor vehicles. The studies also showed that state laws on safety belt use reduced both fatalities and serious injuries by 5 to 20 percent, even though the use of belts was relatively low during the periods in which these studies were performed. Most studies that addressed hospital costs reported that the crash victims who had used belts averaged 60 to 80 percent lower hospital costs than those who had not used belts.

Under the initial federal efforts, safety belts were required to meet minimum standards. Since few occupants of vehicles voluntarily used manual safety belts, DOT issued a rule in 1984 mandating that passive restraints\u2014automatic safety belts and airbags\u2014be phased in beginning with 1987 model year cars. Under the rule, the installation of passive restraints could be avoided if states representing two-thirds of the U.S. population enacted satisfactory laws mandating safety belt use. This provision focused attention on mandatory use laws and prompted automobile manufacturers and others to provide funding and support for such laws. The first state law mandating safety belt use was enacted in New York in 1984; by 1986, a total of 22 states and the District of Columbia had such laws in effect.", "Since DOT\u2019s data showed little increase in safety belt use between 1987 and 1990, the Congress acted in 1991 to again focus attention on increasing the use of safety belts. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (P.L. 102-240) included financial incentives\u2014grants and penalties\u2014to encourage the states to enact basic safety belt laws and increase belt use. ISTEA provided for grants for up to 3 years to those states that had laws mandating safety belt use and that achieved minimal levels of belt use. The grants totaled $12 million per year for fiscal years 1992 through 1994.

Our work was requested by the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Transportation and Related Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations.", "To conduct our work, we visited NHTSA\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., the agencies responsible for highway traffic safety programs in 10 states (California, Colorado, Idaho, Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina), and the seven NHTSA regional offices with responsibility for the 10 states. We judgmentally selected the 10 states to include a cross section of state safety belt programs. In making our selections, we considered whether a state\u2019s survey on safety belt use had been approved by NHTSA, whether the state had a law on safety belt use involving primary or secondary enforcement, the fine the state assessed for noncompliance with the law, the state\u2019s reported rate of safety belt use (so that we selected states with relatively high and low use), and the period in which the state\u2019s last survey on safety belt use had been conducted. At NHTSA and the state agencies, we obtained and reviewed pertinent documents and discussed activities concerning safety belts with officials. More specifically, at the various locations, we obtained and reviewed pertinent documents, including NHTSA\u2019s Regional Action Plans and the states\u2019 Highway Safety Plans, which described the state\u2019s strategies for increasing the use of safety belts and provided information on past successes; reviewed materials developed for public information and education campaigns and for community-based traffic safety programs; discussed with state officials what the federal government is currently doing to increase safety belt use, what is and is not working well, and what changes are desirable; reviewed appropriate laws and regulations and other relevant documents; reviewed the methodologies NHTSA used to calculate the rate of seat belt analyzed the methodologies used in state surveys to determine whether the states were consistent in how the surveys were planned and conducted; and reviewed NHTSA\u2019s guidelines on the state surveys of safety belt use to determine the extent to which the guidance provides for consistent surveys.", "Also, as requested, we met with the Canadian officials responsible for implementing safety belt programs to learn what strategies Canada had used to achieve that country\u2019s reported 90-percent rate of safety belt use.", "We provided DOT with a draft of our report for review and comment.

For example, DOT had a goal of 70-percent belt use by the end of 1992 and reported belt use in 1992 to be 62 percent. DOT\u2019s current goal is to reach a rate of 75-percent belt use nationwide by 1997. Using two different methodologies, NHTSA has estimated the rate of safety belt use nationwide in 1994 to be either 67 or 58 percent.", "NHTSA recognized that its methodology for estimating the 67-percent nationwide rate of belt use was not precise because it relied on individual state surveys that did not measure belt use consistently. For example, 22 states surveyed only passenger cars, while 20 states surveyed cars, light trucks, and vans. Also, some states counted belt use by drivers only, while others included use by other passengers as well. During October and November 1994, NHTSA conducted a nationwide survey to gather more detailed data on the use of restraints. This survey found a nationwide use rate of 58 percent\u201463 percent in passenger cars and 50 percent in light trucks. The rate in light trucks is important because these vehicles now constitute about 40 percent of the new vehicles sold. Given NHTSA\u2019s estimates of a 58-percent or 67-percent nationwide rate of belt use in 1994, significant progress must be made to meet DOT\u2019s goal of a nationwide rate of 75-percent belt use by 1997."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NHTSA\u2019s Data Indicate Increases in Safety Belt Use", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA has used various methodologies for estimating the rates of safety belt use, and all show substantial increases since the early 1980s. NHTSA\u2019s data indicate that the increase has been gradual from one year to the next with two exceptions. First, the largest increase occurred during 1985-86 when the first state safety belt laws went into effect. The second largest increase occurred during 1991-93 when ISTEA provided financial incentives for the states to enact safety belt laws and NHTSA initiated new programs with state enforcement agencies. The estimates indicate relatively small increases in belt use before 1985, from 1987 through 1990, and between 1993 and 1994. Figure 2.1 shows the changes in safety belt use nationwide since the early 1980s relative to the number of state laws on safety belt use.", "Measures of safety belt use over time have been available from a variety of sources, such as data about the occupants of vehicles involved in crashes, telephone surveys, and surveys of belt use that NHTSA performed until 1991 in 19 cities. For reasons discussed below, the various sources show very different rates of belt use. However, as figure 2.2 shows, all of the data sources show a substantial increase in belt use since the early 1980s. In addition, the indicators show larger increases during periods of increased federal and state emphasis on safety belt programs.", "These other sources show different but not necessarily more reliable use rates than those generally quoted by NHTSA and shown in figure 2.1. From 1982 to 1991, NHTSA used a survey that sampled belt use in 19 cities as an indicator of the nationwide rate of belt use. These surveys were useful for tracking changes in use rates in the particular cities included in the study, but the results from the sample cities could not be statistically extrapolated to metropolitan areas not in the sample or to any nonmetropolitan area. A telephone survey has been conducted almost every year since 1983, and the results show higher belt use than NHTSA has reported. This higher result is understandable because other studies have shown that respondents to telephone surveys tend to report higher use than is actually observed.", "Data about the occupants of vehicles involved in crashes indicate belt use rates both higher and lower than NHTSA\u2019s two reported estimates, but these different results can be explained logically. NHTSA\u2019s Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) contains data only from crashes in which someone died. Belt use by the victims in these crashes tends to be low because people who use belts tend to be injured or uninjured rather than killed, so they are more likely to be reported, not in FARS, but in NHTSA\u2019s General Estimates System (GES) as involved in a crash resulting in injury or property damage only. In addition, the belt use reported in the GES data is higher because the data generally come from statements made by the vehicles\u2019 occupants, who tend to tell police officers that they were complying with belt use laws. This tendency is particularly evident in crashes involving property damage only and no apparent injury.", "While the rates of safety belt use from the federal data on crashes are of limited value in estimating belt use nationwide, they can be useful for NHTSA and the states in evaluating the reasonableness of the use rates shown in the state surveys. The results of the state surveys can be expected to be higher than the FARS results and lower than the GES results for each state for the reasons explained above. NHTSA has developed a model that uses FARS data to predict actual belt use, and these results have been compared with the results from state surveys. While the model does not consider all of the relevant differences among the states, NHTSA officials told us that these comparisons of estimates of safety belt use from the state survey data and FARS generally support the reasonableness of the results of the state surveys.", "Figure 2.2 also demonstrates the importance of changes in the surveys\u2019 methodology and the effects such changes can have on the results of an analysis. Figure 2.1 shows NHTSA\u2019s analysis of nationwide rates of belt use between 1983 and 1994. According to NHTSA, the sources of the information were the 19-city survey from 1983 through 1990 and the state surveys from 1991 through 1994. Figure 2.2 shows that there were 2 years\u20141990 and 1991\u2014in which the rates from both the 19-city survey and the state surveys were computed. The state surveys, using a different methodology, showed results 4 percentage points higher in 1990 and 8 percentage points higher in 1991 than the 19-city survey showed. As a result, a substantial portion of the 10-percentage point increase shown in figure 2.1 between 1990 and 1991 was caused by the change in the surveys\u2019 methodology. Although NHTSA may have used the best available data for those years, the change in methodology is an important factor to consider when analyzing the trend."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "67-Percent Belt Use Rate for 1994 Is Not Reliable", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA\u2019s estimate of a 67-percent nationwide rate of safety belt use for 1994 is not reliable because the rate is based on state surveys that used different methodologies that do not consistently measure belt use. For example, 22 states surveyed only passenger cars, while 20 states surveyed cars, light trucks, and vans; the other states surveyed two of the three vehicle categories. Five states measured belt use by drivers only, and the others measured use by drivers and occupants of the vehicles\u2019 right front seat; no state surveyed belt use by the occupants of the rear seats. The methodologies used for the state surveys also varied in selecting observation locations and in weighting the results. Some states exempted sparsely populated areas from their sampling plans, while others considered all geographic areas eligible for sampling. Also, some states conducted annual surveys, while others did not.", "NHTSA estimated the 67-percent nationwide rate of safety belt use for 1994 by using 34 state surveys conducted in 1994, 16 surveys conducted before 1994, and information on belt use from Wyoming\u2019s crash data. NHTSA calculated the nationwide use rate by taking each state\u2019s most recent rate and weighting the rate by each state\u2019s population as a proportion of the total U.S. population. In our opinion, this methodology does not provide a reliable estimate of the nationwide rate of safety belt use because it relies on state surveys that use very different methodologies. NHTSA has acknowledged that the state surveys on safety belt use differ in design. However, NHTSA pointed out that 28 states\u2014representing over 70 percent of the U.S. population\u2014conducted probability-based observational surveys. Nevertheless, the agency also said that the remaining states conducted surveys in which their observation sites, while usually adequate in number, were not randomly selected. As a result, no confidence intervals can be calculated from these survey results.", "In our May 1992 report, we found that statewide data on safety belt use was questionable. NHTSA analysts had told us that the statewide rates of safety belt use provided by the states were generally not based on probability sampling techniques that would provide statistically valid estimates. The states had used a variety of methods that differed in reliability. The states\u2019 data on the rate of belt use were particularly important at that time because ISTEA provided for grants to the states on the basis of these rates. Funds were allocated to the states during fiscal years 1992-94 in part on the basis of the rates of safety belt use as measured by the state surveys.", "To improve the quality of the data in the state surveys, in June 1992 NHTSA finalized guidelines for state observational surveys of belt use. These guidelines allowed the states substantial latitude in designing and carrying out the surveys. Although the guidelines were very flexible and NHTSA helped the states conform with the guidelines, only 28 states received NHTSA\u2019s approval of their survey methodology. NHTSA officials said that some additional states might be performing a survey that either conforms to the guidelines or nearly conforms, but these states did not need NHTSA\u2019s approval of their survey plan. Since the grants are no longer available, there is no financial incentive for the states to have their survey plan conform with NHTSA\u2019s guidelines. \u201cAvailable state estimates of safety belt use cannot be used to produce a national estimate. Review of the designs of all states that have conducted state-level surveys of occupant restraint systems has confirmed that results across states are not comparable and cannot be used to produce a national estimate.\u201d", "We agree with the contractor\u2019s comments. However, NHTSA officials said that the lack of consistency among the state surveys does not preclude using the surveys to develop a reasonable annual estimate of belt use nationwide.

Data were collected by observing traffic at about 4,000 randomly selected sites in 25 states during October, November, and December 1994. NOPUS was used to estimate the nationwide rate of belt use and to obtain detailed data on (1) belt use by vehicle type and the occupant\u2019s age and gender and (2) the misuse of belts.", "The initial results from NOPUS were released by NHTSA in early 1995 and showed an overall nationwide rate of safety belt use of 58 percent for 1994. These results indicate, among other things, that the drivers tend to use safety belts more frequently than the passengers in the right front seat and that belt use is higher in the western United States than in the rest of the country. The NOPUS\u2019 breakout by vehicle type showed an overall rate of 63-percent belt use for the occupants of passenger cars and a 50-percent rate of use for the occupants of light trucks. This breakout for light trucks is particularly important because these vehicles make up about 40 percent of the new vehicles sold. NHTSA recently estimated that annually 3,600 occupants of light trucks die and 54,000 are injured because they do not use safety belts. This disparity in belt use rates between the occupants of passenger cars and light trucks indicates that special emphasis and targeted programs may be needed to increase belt use in light trucks. Part of the disparity could relate to the fact, discussed in chapter 4, that several states\u2019 laws on belt use do not cover the occupants of light trucks.", "NHTSA officials believe that NOPUS\u2019 findings generally support the estimates of the nationwide rate of belt use calculated from the state surveys but agree that comparing the rates in the NOPUS and the state surveys is difficult. NHTSA plans to conduct another NOPUS survey if funds become available, but the agency plans to continue using the state surveys to annually estimate the nationwide rate of belt use. The 67-percent weighted average from the state surveys and the 58-percent rate from NOPUS both fall within the range of estimates of belt use based on other data.

They also stated that in the absence of a primary enforcement law, the most effective way to increase safety belt use was a secondary enforcement law combined with active community involvement in law enforcement and public education and information activities aimed at increasing the use of safety belts. Figure 3.1 shows that the 3 states with primary enforcement laws we visited significantly increased belt use after adopting such a law. Of the 10 states we visited, the average belt use of the 3 states with primary enforcement was about 20 percentage points higher than the average belt use of the 6 states with secondary enforcement.", "Figure 3.2 shows that the six states with secondary enforcement laws we visited experienced increases in safety belt use after adopting such a law.

According to state officials, one of the most successful ways to reach the public is by involving community groups in programs aimed at increasing safety belt use.", "The ability of primary enforcement laws to increase safety belt use is best illustrated by California\u2019s upgrade of its law mandating safety belt use from a secondary enforcement law to a primary enforcement law. In November 1992, California reported a rate of safety belt use of 70 percent. At that time, California\u2019s secondary enforcement law had been in place for about 7 years. On January 1, 1993, California implemented a primary enforcement law, resulting in an increase in safety belt use of 13 percentage points for a statewide rate of 83 percent in late 1993, according to the results of a state survey. California officials actively publicized this change in the law. A survey of some California drivers conducted during March through September 1993 found that 90 percent of those surveyed knew that they could be stopped for violating a belt law alone and 75 percent felt that the law was being strictly enforced. California increased only slightly the number of citations issued during this period. Therefore, NHTSA officials believe that the change to a primary enforcement law is the primary reason for the significant increase in belt use.", "Primary enforcement laws increase safety belt use, but sustained and increased safety belt use can be better achieved when these laws are supported with enforcement and public education and information activities. North Carolina provides an example of how these activities, when associated with a primary enforcement law, can dramatically increase safety belt use. Before implementing its primary enforcement law in October 1985, North Carolina had a rate of safety belt use of 24 percent. During a 15-month period when only warnings were issued to violators, the reported rates of safety belt use ranged from 41 to 49 percent. On January 1, 1987, citations began to be issued for not using a belt, and the reported rate of belt use quickly increased to 78 percent. However, after a few years, state surveys showed that the rate of belt use had dropped back to 60 percent.", "In September 1993, North Carolina embarked on a multiyear campaign\u2014\u201cClick It or Ticket\u201d\u2014to further increase safety belt use and reduce related injuries and fatalities. This intensive enforcement and publicity campaign is credited with increasing North Carolina\u2019s reported rate of safety belt use by 15 percentage points in 3 months\u201465 to 80 percent\u2014and with achieving North Carolina\u2019s current rate of 81 percent. The campaign featured increased and highly visible enforcement through the use of safety belt checkpoints. These activities were publicized locally, and the message provided to the public was that activities to enforce the safety belt law were the major focus of local law enforcement agencies during the first 4 weeks of the program. This highly visible program was also directly endorsed by North Carolina\u2019s governor, who cited the high costs society pays for individuals who do not use their safety belts. State officials report that in its first 6 months, the \u201cClick It or Ticket\u201d campaign saved 45 lives, prevented 320 disabling injuries, and saved more than $51 million in health care and other costs.", "New York has also used enforcement and public education and information activities to sustain and increase the rate of safety belt use that the state achieved after it passed the nation\u2019s first law mandating safety belt use on December 1, 1984. Before the passage of this law, New York\u2019s rate of safety belt use was estimated to be 16 percent. Within 6 months, the state\u2019s reported rate of belt use increased to 57 percent. New York now reports a belt use rate of 72 percent. This gain was primarily due to the emphasis placed on enforcing the law through police training and an increase in the number of citations issued. New York has also used public information campaigns and special workshops on restraints for children.

Today, 38 states and the District of Columbia have secondary enforcement laws, which allow a vehicle\u2019s occupants to be ticketed for not using safety belts after they have been stopped for another violation. The success of secondary enforcement laws depends on how well the states work with law enforcement agencies to encourage enforcement and reach out to community members to educate and inform them about the laws and the importance of using safety belts. The states\u2019 efforts to strengthen laws on restraints for children also contribute to increasing adults\u2019 use of safety belts.", "For the six states with secondary enforcement laws that we visited, the laws contributed greatly to increasing the rates of safety belt use. Also important were aggressive enforcement and public education and information activities. For example, Idaho was able to increase its reported rate of belt use by 24 percentage points\u2014from 35 percent in June 1990 to 59 percent in September 1993\u2014through an increased emphasis on education and enforcement at the local level. Idaho used some of its highway safety funds to provide grants to the local law enforcement agencies that administered these programs. These agencies provided the community with information and education on safety belts and child restraints, and trained law enforcement officers on the use of restraints and the need for increased enforcement. To receive these grants, the enforcement agencies were required to have a policy of writing one safety belt citation for every five citations for hazardous violations. This approach greatly increased the number of citations issued for safety belt violations and resulted in a statewide rate of belt use of 61 percent in 1994.", "New Jersey was also able to increase its rate of safety belt use substantially through increased enforcement activities. From 1990 to 1991, New Jersey doubled the number of safety belt citations issued, resulting in a reported increase of 18 percentage points\u2014from 50 percent to 68 percent\u2014in its rate of safety belt use. New Jersey also was very active in public information and education, including a \u201c101 Days of Summer\u201d publicity campaign that emphasized why it was important to use safety belts and activities connected with \u201cBuckle Up America Week.\u201d New Jersey\u2019s safety officials are attempting to upgrade the state\u2019s safety belt law to a primary enforcement law because they believe this change could immediately increase the state\u2019s rate of safety belt use by up to 12 percentage points. New Jersey reported a current rate of safety belt use of 64 percent.", "Other states with secondary enforcement laws we visited have not experienced the level of increase in use rates that Idaho and New Jersey have. Colorado, for example, reported an increase in its use rate to 51 percent from 18 percent when it implemented its law on July 1, 1987, but has not been able to make substantial progress since that time. As of January 1995, Colorado reported a use rate of 54 percent. However, the state believes its rate will likely increase as its many activities are implemented. For example, the state is training law enforcement officers to enforce the safety belt law and is conducting a \u201cDrive Smart Colorado\u201d campaign that assists community leaders in developing strategies and programs to ensure the safety of the traveling public. Also, Colorado recently amended its law on restraints for children to increase the age of the children covered by the law from 4 to 16.", "New Hampshire, which has no law on mandatory belt use, shows how having a law on restraints for children and aggressive public information and education about that law can contribute to increased adult use of safety belts. In 1984, New Hampshire found that only 16 percent of drivers were using safety belts. Since then, the largest reported annual increase in New Hampshire\u2019s rate of safety belt use by adults\u2014from 37 percent in 1988 to 50 percent in 1989\u2014coincided with an increase in the age of the children covered by the law on restraints for children from up to age 4 to up to age 12. This change in the law provided New Hampshire with the opportunity to educate and inform the public about the child restraint law and the consequences of not using safety belts and then being involved in a traffic accident. In September 1994, New Hampshire reported a rate of safety belt use by adults of 54 percent. State officials said that this latest increase can be attributed to another change in the child restraint law (effective Jan. 1, 1994), which requires children up to age 4 to be restrained in a proper restraint system\u2014a car seat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The states that are most successful in increasing their rates of safety belt use have comprehensive programs that include mandatory primary enforcement laws that are visibly and aggressively enforced.

Additionally, 3,600 occupants of light trucks and multipurpose vehicles die and 54,000 are injured unnecessarily because they do not use safety belts. NHTSA estimated that these deaths and injuries cost society $20 billion annually in medical costs, lost productivity, and other injury-related expenses. Most of these costs are borne by society in the form of tax-supported programs and insurance premiums.", "In response to a mandate in ISTEA, NHTSA analyzed data from seven states to determine the benefits of medical care for crash victims and who pays for that care. This Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES) project linked statewide data from police reports on motor vehicle crashes with computerized data from emergency medical services, hospital emergency departments, hospital discharges, and other activities so that the costs of the medical treatment of people injured in traffic crashes could be tracked. CODES obtained data on about 880,000 vehicle drivers for various periods between 1990 and 1992 in the seven states. The final report is expected to be provided to the Congress in February 1996.", "The preliminary data from CODES indicates there is a direct relationship between safety belt use and the medical costs resulting from traffic crashes. The average charges for all drivers (including those not hospitalized) in the CODES study who were involved in crashes was $562 for those not using safety belts and $110 for those using belts. Thus, those drivers using safety belts averaged 80 percent lower charges. For crash victims who were actually admitted to hospitals, the average charges were $13,937 for those not using safety belts and $9,004 for those using belts, which indicates a 35-percent reduction in hospital charges when safety belts were used.", "The data from CODES are consistent with the data from other studies. Our May 1992 report on the effectiveness of safety belts presented the results from eight studies containing data on the effectiveness of safety belts in reducing hospital charges. All the studies showed that hospital costs were lower for the vehicle occupants using safety belts than for the occupants not using belts. The victims who used belts had average hospital costs that were from 27 to 87 percent lower than those of the victims who did not use belts; most of the studies showed costs between 60 and 80 percent lower. Stated another way, most of the studies showed the hospital costs for the crash victims who did not use belts to be 2-1/2 to 5 times the cost for the victims who used belts. The studies also provided data showing that safety belts reduce other costs related to injuries in traffic crashes, such as ambulance costs or insurance claims costs for personal injury. While the studies discussed in that report indicated a higher rate of temporary and permanent disability for the victims who did not use belts, the data on such long-term effects were generally not available. Unfortunately, none of the studies captured information on the level of income replacement resulting from providing disability or welfare benefits to victims who did or did not use belts.", "CODES and other studies have shown that society pays a large part of the costs of medical treatment for those injured in traffic crashes. Preliminary data from CODES show that the public paid 16 percent of these costs through such programs as Medicare and Medicaid. About 69 percent was paid by private insurance, which spread the cost to all who pay insurance premiums. At the time the victims were discharged from the hospital, only 15 percent of the charges were classified as paid by others, generally \u201cself payers.\u201d NHTSA pointed out in its draft report that these self payers often are unable to pay their bills, and the cost of providing this care is ultimately passed on through higher charges for those who do pay.", "CODES data show that the general public may pay a larger portion of the costs than some of the earlier data showed. NHTSA published a report in January 1992 that used data from five states to estimate the costs of hospital care for people injured in motor vehicle crashes in 1990 and the sources of payment of those costs. Those data show that 29 percent was paid by government sources, 52 percent by insurance, and 19 percent by others. Five studies of hospital costs that we reviewed for our May 1992 report also collected data on medical payments for crash victims. Among the victims who did not use belts, from 8 to 28 percent were covered by Medicare or Medicaid, from 41 to 55 percent were covered by insurance, and the remaining 22 to 49 percent were considered self payers. Some costs not covered by public programs or insurance ultimately will not be paid by the injured person or the person\u2019s family, so a portion of the costs to self payers will be paid by other sources of funding for the hospitals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Efforts Have Increased Belt Use, but State Laws Are Not Comprehensive", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has recognized the benefits of safety belts and has been requiring their installation and encouraging their use since the mid-1960s.

NHTSA has also initiated national campaigns for public information and awareness and has assisted in state and local campaigns to increase safety belt use. In addition, the states receive federal funding to help them implement highway safety programs. About $170 million was requested for fiscal year 1996 for assistance to the states under the federal highway safety program. DOT encourages the states to use the funds in support of program areas that are national priorities.

To varying degrees, the states have used NHTSA\u2019s public information materials and have joined in the federal promotional campaigns.", "NHTSA has encouraged the states to strengthen their safety belt laws. However, most state laws provide for secondary enforcement and minimal fines for violations, cover only occupants of the vehicles\u2019 front seat, and often exempt the occupants of light trucks. Our May 1992 report concluded that stronger and more comprehensive laws were needed and that society could save billions of dollars annually through increased safety belt use. As discussed in chapter 3 of this report, the most effective state laws have strong enforcement provisions and cover all occupants of passenger cars, light trucks, and vans. Since our 1992 report, nine states have enacted new laws on belt use, but these laws are similar to the earlier laws\u2014generally providing for secondary enforcement and relatively low fines. Overall, little progress has been made recently in getting the states to adopt stronger and more comprehensive safety belt laws.", "As table 4.1 shows, most state laws cover the occupants of the front seat only, and some exempt the occupants of light trucks and/or vans. Ten states provide for primary enforcement, and 39 states (including the District of Columbia) provide for secondary enforcement. Only 11 state laws cover the occupants of rear seats, and 7 state laws exempt the occupants of light trucks and vans. Only 4 states assess fines for violations of belt use laws that exceed $25, and 13 states assess fines of $10 or less, including 2 states that do not assess any fine.", "Although 49 states (including the District of Columbia) now have laws on safety belt use, compared with 42 in 1991, the laws could be stronger and more comprehensive.

While California and Louisiana have enacted a primary enforcement law since 1991, Mississippi and Wisconsin have changed from primary to secondary enforcement.

This provision transfers up to 3 percent of a state\u2019s federal-aid highway funds to the state\u2019s highway safety programs. Under current law, in 1996 only Maine and New Hampshire will be subject to the safety belt penalty, which is estimated at about $1.6 million for each state.", "ISTEA requires the states to have laws on mandatory safety belt use to avoid the penalty, but it does not require primary enforcement or state fines for nonuse of belts. Also, the act applies only to the occupants of passenger vehicles\u2019 front seats and defines passenger vehicles to exclude vehicles constructed on a truck chassis. As a result, state laws do not have to include the occupants of passenger cars\u2019 rear seats or any occupants of pickup trucks or many vans, even though over 10,000 occupants of such vehicles die each year in crashes.", "While the number of deaths resulting from crashes of light trucks and vans might be sufficient reason for focusing greater attention on increasing belt use in these vehicles, other data also point to this need. Recent data on crashes show that occupants killed in light trucks were ejected at twice the rate of occupants of passenger cars. NHTSA officials told us that safety belts are very successful in preventing such ejections. NHTSA estimated that annually 3,600 occupants of light trucks die and 54,000 are injured because they do not use safety belts. Also, a 1994 national survey of belt use showed an overall rate of 63-percent use for occupants of passenger cars and 50 percent for occupants of light trucks.

A recent nationwide public opinion poll of 1,000 people by McKeon and Associates found strong support for safety belt laws. A large majority opposed any weakening or repeal of the laws. These results support findings in individual states. For example, California reported widespread public knowledge about and compliance with the state\u2019s recent primary enforcement law.

NORP involved a 6-year strategy in two phases. Phase I was a short-term strategy during late 1989 and all of 1990 that included centralizing the development of training and briefing materials and the delivery of those materials through coordinating committees in each jurisdiction. Phase II, covering 1991-95, involved coordinating, in each jurisdiction, intensive campaigns for enforcement and awareness as well as efforts to reduce the number of exemptions from the laws on safety belt use.", "The province of Newfoundland\u2019s experience illustrates how the Canadian strategy has worked. The province enacted its law on mandatory safety belt use in 1982. In 1989, the rate of belt use was observed to be 64 percent. In 1990, Newfoundland adopted demerit points for violations of the law, and belt use increased to 84 percent. The demerit system assesses 2 points for most driving infractions, including nonuse of belts, and the accumulation of 12 points in a 2-year period results in suspension of the license. As public awareness campaigns and enforcement programs continued in 1991, belt use increased to 91 percent. One of the strategies recommended by NORP was the issuance of at least 4,000 citations for safety belt violations per year per million population; the rate for 1991 in Newfoundland was 12,525. In 1992, Newfoundland removed many of the exemptions in its belt use law, and the rate of use reached almost 95 percent. The rate remained above 95 percent during 1993 and 1994. This high level of belt use was maintained despite a decrease in the number of citations issued per million population from 12,525 in 1991 to 507 in 1993.
