CMS officials consider the completed short-stay hospital reviews to be a success based on anecdotal feedback from providers.

Improper  payments include payments made in error, such as payments that should  not have been made; payments made in incorrect amounts, including  overpayments and underpayments; and payments for claims that were  not properly documented. Certain services in the Medicare fee-for-service  program had higher improper payment rates, such as home health  services, which had an estimated improper payment rate of 42 percent  and represented an estimated $7.7 billion in improper payments, also as  reported in fiscal year 2016.

MACs\u2014in addition to processing and paying  Medicare claims\u2014conduct education efforts intended to improve billing  practices for the Medicare program. These efforts are in addition to  CMS\u2019s own education for providers on proper billing. MACs\u2019 provider  outreach and education (which we hereafter refer to as provider  education) departments play a significant role in these efforts. There were  8 MACs that operated in 1 or more of the 20 total jurisdictions across the  United States at the time of our review. Although the costs associated  with a MAC\u2019s provider education department account for a small portion  of a MAC\u2019s total costs, CMS cites provider education department efforts  as an important way to help lower the improper payment rate. According  to CMS, the fundamental goal of the provider education departments is to  reduce the rate of improper payments by giving Medicare providers the  information they need to understand the Medicare program, such as  coverage and payment rules, and bill properly. For example, MACs\u2019  provider education departments may distribute written guidance via email  to educate providers on billing Medicare for physical therapy services or  host a webinar to improve billing for Medicare radiology services.  Providers can also be referred to the provider education department for  education by MACs\u2019 medical review departments. The medical review  department may deny certain claims and refer certain providers to the  provider education department for education if it finds errors in the  providers\u2019 billing documentation.", "MACs also conduct probe and educate reviews as part of a CMS strategy  to determine the extent to which providers understand recent policy  changes for certain areas vulnerable to improper billing as identified by  CMS and to help providers improve billing in these areas.

These  reports are intended to identify risks to Medicare and describe the  planned interventions meant to ensure proper payments and address  these risks. We reviewed 14 IPRS reports that covered 18 of 20  jurisdictions. The submission dates for the IPRS reports we reviewed  ranged from November 2015 to July 2016, based on variations in MACs\u2019  contract years. We analyzed these reports to identify areas vulnerable to  improper billing\u2014often referred to as prioritized problem areas\u2014that were  common among the majority of MAC jurisdictions. We also analyzed  these reports to determine the extent to which MACs listed specific  provider education department efforts focusing on each of these areas  vulnerable to improper billing. We reviewed CMS\u2019s statements of work for  the MACs, which outline the functions CMS expects the MACs to perform,  including a brief description of what is expected from MACs\u2019 provider  education departments. We also reviewed the chapter of CMS\u2019s Medicare  Contractor Beneficiary and Provider Communications Manual related to  the provider education department, which further outlines CMS\u2019s  expectations for MACs\u2019 provider education department efforts.  Additionally, we interviewed CMS officials, MAC officials from each of the  8 MACs that collectively serve all 20 jurisdictions nationally, and 9  selected provider associations representing medical billers or specialties  with both high and low improper payment rates, regarding MACs\u2019 provider  education department efforts and CMS\u2019s oversight of these efforts. We  also reviewed relevant federal standards for internal control in the federal  government related to information and communications and the control  environment.", "To examine the extent to which CMS measured the effectiveness of the  MAC probe and educate reviews in reducing improper billing, we  interviewed CMS officials about efforts they have undertaken to do so.  We also reviewed relevant federal standards for internal control related to  risk assessment and monitoring. To determine whether the results of the  probe and educate reviews identified a resulting decrease in improper  billing, we analyzed data CMS collected from the MACs about their  reviews to better understand the extent of improper billing that existed  before, during, and after the first completed probe and educate review. To  date, CMS has required MACs to conduct two probe and educate  reviews: a review of short-stay hospital claims, which has been  completed, and a review of home health claims, which is ongoing. For  both types of reviews, we analyzed the number of providers requiring  review due to improper billing\u2014including the change in the number of  providers requiring review over the course of the reviews for the short- stay hospital reviews, the number of claims reviewed, and the denial rates  for claims reviewed. The short-stay hospital review data was for fiscal  years 2014 and 2015 and the preliminary home health review data was  for fiscal year 2016. To assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed it to  identify missing information and discrepancies, and interviewed CMS  officials regarding the processes for collecting and verifying it.

These  efforts are designed to educate many providers at the same time or  individual providers via one-to-one education. Attendance at provider  education department events is voluntary on the part of the providers.  MACs are required to report their provider education department efforts  monthly into the Provider Customer Service Program Contractor  Information Database that CMS oversees and maintains.

These reviews  are resource intensive, because they involve manual review of associated  medical records by trained medical review staff. Because of the resources  involved, manual reviews are done infrequently in the Medicare program,  with less than 1 percent of all Medicare claims receiving manual review.  Following the first round of review, providers are informed of their results  and those who billed and documented a specified percentage of claims improperly are offered voluntary one-to-one education to learn why each  claim was approved or denied.

CMS should explicitly require that A/B, DME, and HH+H MACs work  together to educate referring providers on documentation  requirements for DME and home health services.  3.
