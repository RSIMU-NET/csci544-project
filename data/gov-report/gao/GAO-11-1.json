However, as GAO previously reported, the agencies have faced challenges in obtaining sufficient information to manage these contracts and assistance instruments. As part of our third review under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, as amended, GAO assessed the implementation of the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) and data reported by the three agencies for Afghanistan and Iraq for FY 2009 and the first half of FY 2010 on the (1) number of contractor and assistance personnel, including those providing security; (2) number of personnel killed or wounded; and (3) number and value of contracts and assistance instruments and extent of competition for new awards. GAO compared agency data to other available sources to assess reliability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the three agencies designated SPOT as their system for tracking statutorily required information in July 2008, SPOT still cannot reliably track information on contracts, assistance instruments, and associated personnel in Iraq or Afghanistan. As a result, the agencies relied on sources of data other than SPOT to respond to our requests for information. The agencies' implementation of SPOT has been affected by some practical and technical issues, but their efforts also were undermined by a lack of agreement on how to proceed, particularly on how to track local nationals working under contracts or assistance instruments. The lack of agreement was due in part to agencies not having assessed their respective information needs and how SPOT can be designed to address those needs and statutory requirements. In 2009, GAO reported on many of these issues and recommended that the agencies jointly develop a plan to improve SPOT's implementation. The three agencies reported to GAO that as of March 2010 there were 262,681 contractor and assistance personnel working in Iraq and Afghanistan, 18 percent of whom performed security functions. Due to limitations with agency-reported data, caution should be used in identifying trends or drawing conclusions about the number of personnel in either country. Data limitations are attributable to agency difficulty in determining the number of local nationals, low response rates to agency requests for data, and limited ability to verify the accuracy of reported data. For example, a State office noted that none of its Afghan grant recipients provided requested personnel data. While agency officials acknowledged not all personnel were being counted, they still considered the reported data to be more accurate than SPOT data. Only State and USAID tracked information on the number of contractor and assistance personnel killed or wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan during the review period. State reported 9 contractor and assistance personnel were killed and 68 wounded, while USAID reported 116 killed and 121 wounded. Both agencies noted that some casualties resulted from nonhostile actions. DOD still lacked a system to track similar information and referred GAO to Department of Labor data on cases filed under the Defense Base Act for killed or injured contractors. As GAO previously reported, Labor's data provide insights but are not a good proxy for the number of contractor casualties. DOD, State, and USAID obligated $37.5 billion on 133,951 contracts and assistance instruments with performance in Iraq and Afghanistan during FY2009 and the first half of FY2010. DOD had the vast majority of contract obligations. Most of the contracts were awarded during the review period and used competitive procedures. State and USAID relied heavily on grants and cooperative agreements and reported that most were competitively awarded. While DOD and State did not comment on the draft report, USAID commented on the challenges of implementing SPOT and provided revised personnel data that GAO reviewed and included in the report. In response to GAO's 2009 report, DOD, State, and USAID did not agree with the recommendation to develop a plan for implementing SPOT because they felt ongoing coordination efforts were sufficient. GAO continues to believe a plan is needed to correct SPOT's shortcomings and is not making any new recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State (State), and  the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have relied  extensively on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan to provide a wide range  of services, such as security, transportation, and base operations.

Among these, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  (NDAA for FY2008) directed DOD, State, and USAID to sign a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding contracting in Iraq and  Afghanistan, including maintaining common databases of information on  contracts and contractor personnel. The three agencies signed an initial  MOU in July 2008 that designated the Synchronized Predeployment and  Operational Tracker (SPOT) as their system of record for the statutorily  required information. With the passage of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (NDAA for FY2010), Congress  expanded the requirement to cover grants, cooperative agreements, and  their associated personnel.

The agencies primarily obtained these data from  surveys of or reports from their contractors and assistance instrument  recipients. We assessed the reported data by comparing them to other  available sources. Based on these comparisons, we concluded that  caution should be exercised when using the agency-provided data on  contractor and assistance personnel to draw conclusions about either  the actual number in Iraq or Afghanistan for any given time period or  trends over time. However, we are presenting the reported data along  with their limitations as they establish a rough order of magnitude for  the number of personnel working under contracts and assistance  instruments in the two countries during our 18-month review period.", "For the number of contractor and assistance personnel killed or  wounded during our review period, we analyzed State and USAID data  that were based on reports submitted by contractors and assistance  instrument recipients. We could not independently verify the  completeness of the numbers State and USAID reported to us, but we  are reporting them as they provide insight into the numbers killed or  wounded during our review period. DOD did not collect and could not  provide these data. In addition, we analyzed Department of Labor data  on Defense Base Act (DBA) cases for incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan  during fiscal year 2009 and the first half of fiscal year 2010.  Specifically, we reviewed all 213 DBA case files pertaining to  contractor deaths to determine, for example, whether the case was the  result of a hostile incident.

Data were  provided from the government\u2019s system for tracking information on  contracting actions as well as agency-specific databases and manually  compiled lists of contract and assistance actions. Although we found a  small number of errors in some of the datasets, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable to identify the minimum number of  active or awarded contracts and assistance instruments and the  associated obligation amounts, as well as the extent of competition,  based on our reliability assessments, interviews with agency officials,  and verification of some reported data.", "A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is included in  appendix I.

The NDAA for FY2008 required the databases to track the following, at a  minimum:  for each contract that involves work performed in Iraq or Afghanistan,   a brief description of the contract,   its total value, and    whether it was awarded competitively; and  for contractor personnel working under contracts in Iraq or  Afghanistan,   total number employed,   total number performing security functions, and   total number killed or wounded.", "In July 2008, DOD, State, and USAID signed an MOU in which they agreed  SPOT would be the system of record for the statutorily required contract  and personnel information. SPOT is a Web-based system initially  developed by the U.S. Army to track detailed information on a limited  number of contractor personnel deployed with U.S. forces. The MOU  specified that SPOT would include information on DOD, State, and USAID  contracts with more than 14 days of performance in Iraq or Afghanistan or  valued at more than $100,000, as well as information on the personnel  working under those contracts. Each agency further agreed to ensure that  data elements related to contractor personnel, such as the number of  personnel employed on each contract in Iraq or Afghanistan, are entered  into SPOT accurately. Although the law only directs the agencies to track  aggregate data, SPOT is currently configured in a manner that tracks  individuals by name and records information such as the contracts they  are working under, deployment dates, blood type, and next of kin. The  agencies agreed that contract-related information, such as value and  extent of competition, are to be imported into SPOT from the Federal  Procurement Data System \u2013 Next Generation (FPDS-NG), the federal  government\u2019s system for tracking information on contracting actions. Also,  per the MOU, DOD is responsible for all maintenance and upgrades to the  system, but the agencies agreed to negotiate funding arrangements for any  agency-unique requirements.", "Since the signing of the July 2008 MOU, the requirements of section 861  have been amended. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2009 specified additional matters to be covered in the  agencies\u2019 MOU to address criminal offenses committed by or against  contractor personnel. Additionally, the NDAA for FY2010 amended the  original requirements by redefining \u201ccontract in Iraq and Afghanistan\u201d to  include grants and cooperative agreements and redefining \u201ccontractor\u201d for  these purposes to include grantees and cooperative agreement  recipients. The NDAA for FY2010 also revised the minimum threshold for  tracking contracts, task and delivery orders, grants, and cooperative  agreements from 14 days of performance in Iraq or Afghanistan to 30 days.

Specifically:    USAID and State policies limited the extent that local national  personnel were entered into SPOT. Following the passage of the  NDAA for FY2008, USAID and State developed agency-specific policies  regarding SPOT\u2019s implementation. However, in some instances these  policies limited the extent to which local nationals were required to be  entered into the system. USAID\u2019s April 2009 contract and assistance  policy specified only that contractor and assistance personnel  deployed to Iraq must be registered in SPOT. The policy explicitly  excluded Iraqi entities and nationals from being entered into SPOT,  until a classified system is established. It was not until July 2010 that  USAID directed that its contractor and assistance personnel working  in Afghanistan be accounted for in SPOT. The policy notes that  procedures will be provided separately for entering information on  Afghan nationals into SPOT, but as of September 2010, such  procedures have not been developed. As a result of these policies,  information on local nationals working under USAID contracts and  assistance instruments in Iraq and Afghanistan is still not being  tracked in SPOT. State\u2019s assistance policy directs that U.S. and third  country nationals working under grants must be entered into SPOT.  While the policy specifies that local nationals should be entered into  the system, State officials told us that agency staff can use their  discretion to determine whether local national personnel working  under grants are entered into SPOT. In contrast, State requires all U.S.  citizens, third country, and local nationals working under its contracts  to be entered into SPOT. In explaining why their policies make  exceptions for local nationals, officials from USAID and State cited  security concerns. USAID officials told us that they held off entering  Iraqi or Afghan nationals into SPOT because identifying local nationals  who work with the U.S. government by name could place those  individuals in danger should the system be compromised. Similarly,  State officials cited concern for the safety of these individuals should  SPOT, with its detailed personnel information, be compromised.", "Practical limitations hindered the agencies\u2019 ability to track  local national personnel. Even when local national personnel are  required to be entered into SPOT, agency officials have explained that  such personnel are particularly difficult to track, especially in  Afghanistan, and as a result, their numbers in SPOT are not a close  representation of their actual numbers. This is primarily due to  practical limitations the agencies encountered, including:    Many local nationals working under contracts and assistance  instruments are at remote locations and their numbers can  fluctuate daily. DOD officials in Iraq and Afghanistan explained  that this is especially true for construction projects, where the  stage of construction and season can affect the total number of  personnel working on a project. For example, DOD officials in  Afghanistan told us that at one project site the number of local  national personnel working fluctuated anywhere from 600 to 2,100.  Further, DOD contracting officials told us in some instances it  could be weeks before they are notified that local national  personnel are no longer working on a particular project. This has  limited the ability to track, in real time, the status of these  personnel in SPOT. Also, for personnel working at remote  locations, the ability of U.S. government officials to verify the  completeness of information in SPOT is hindered by security  conditions that make it difficult for them to visit regularly, and they  cannot use their limited time on site to verify personnel  information.", "Local nationals working under DOD, State, or USAID contracts and  assistance instruments rarely need SPOT-generated letters of  authorization (LOAs) because they are not accessing U.S. facilities  or using U.S. government services. In contrast, U.S. and third  country nationals typically need a SPOT-generated LOA, for  example to even enter Iraq or Afghanistan, and, therefore, are more  likely to be entered into SPOT. As we have previously reported, the  need for a SPOT-generated LOA has served as the primary factor  and incentive for ensuring that personnel have been entered into  the system.", "Information necessary for entering personnel into SPOT may not  be available. DOD, State, and USAID officials told us some local  national contractors are hesitant or simply refuse to submit  information on their personnel because of safety concerns.  Additionally, some information required for SPOT data fields, such  as first and last names and date of birth, may not exist or be  known. This is particularly true in Afghanistan, where it is common  for local nationals to have only one name and know only their  approximate year of birth.", "Limited access to reliable internet connections in Iraq and  Afghanistan inhibit local firms\u2019 ability to enter personnel  information into SPOT. Since SPOT is a Web-based system that  requires internet access for extended periods of time to input  detailed personnel information, agency officials noted that this is a  major impediment to the widespread use of SPOT in both  countries.", "Contractors and assistance recipients have not kept SPOT  updated. Although the agencies have increasingly required their  contractors and assistance recipients to enter personnel information  into the system, there has been little emphasis placed on ensuring that  the information entered into SPOT is up to date. Specifically,  contractors and assistance recipients have not consistently closed the  accounts of their personnel once they have left Iraq or Afghanistan. As  a result, SPOT does not accurately reflect the number of contract and  assistance personnel in either country, and in some cases the numbers  may be overstated. SPOT program officials told us that in March 2010  they began periodically reviewing SPOT to close out the accounts of  any personnel who either did not actually travel to Iraq or Afghanistan  or whose estimated deployment ending date was 14 days overdue.  Based on this review, in April 2010 alone, they identified and closed  the accounts of over 56,000 such personnel who had been listed in  SPOT as still being deployed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personnel Performing Security Functions", "paragraphs": ["Although SPOT was designated as a system for tracking the number of  personnel performing security functions, it cannot be used to reliably  distinguish personnel performing security functions from other  contractors. SPOT program officials explained that the number of security  personnel working under contracts and assistance instruments for the  three agencies can be identified using multiple methods, all of which have  limitations and yield different results, as shown in table 1. However, in  acknowledging the limitations of these methods, the officials noted that  they are developing guidance that better explains the different methods  and the results they yield. The three methods used to count security  contractors include:    The common industry classification system identifies the types of  goods and services the firm provided under the contract. However,  by using this contract classification system to calculate the number of  security contractors, other personnel working on the security contract  but not performing security functions, such as administrative and  support staff, would be included in the count.", "Job titles are to be entered into SPOT by employers for each  individual. SPOT program officials identified five job titles that they  include in counts of security personnel. These officials acknowledged  there is a risk that an employee providing security services may have a  job title other than one of those five and, therefore, would not be  included in the count.", "The weapon authorization data field in SPOT identifies personnel  who have been authorized to carry a firearm. Employers of armed  security contractors are required to enter this information into SPOT  as part of DOD\u2019s process to register and account for such personnel in  each country. However, USAID officials in Iraq explained that  security personnel working under the agency\u2019s contracts and  assistance instruments receive authorization to carry firearms from the  Iraqi government, not DOD, and are not identified in SPOT as having a  weapons authorization. Further, some contractors performing security  functions are not authorized to carry weapons and would, therefore,  not be included in a count using this method. Conversely, some  personnel who are not performing security functions have been  authorized to carry weapons for personal protection and would be  included in the count.", "Regardless of the method employed to identify personnel in SPOT, it  appears that not all personnel performing security functions are being  captured in the system. For example, based on an analysis of SPOT data,  no more than 4,309 contractor personnel were performing security  functions for DOD in Afghanistan during the second quarter of fiscal year  2010. In contrast, DOD officials overseeing armed contractors in  Afghanistan estimated the total number of DOD security contractors in  Afghanistan for the same time period was closer to 17,500."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personnel Killed or Wounded", "paragraphs": ["With regard to tracking personnel who were killed or wounded while  working on contracts and assistance instruments in Iraq and Afghanistan,  SPOT was upgraded in January 2009 so that contractors could update the  status of their personnel in the system, including whether they were killed  or wounded. However, officials from the three agencies informed us they  do not rely on SPOT for such information because contractors and  assistance recipients generally have not recorded in SPOT whether  personnel have been killed or wounded. This is evidenced by the fact that  when we compared information in SPOT to DBA insurance case data  provided by Labor on 213 contractors who had been killed in Iraq or  Afghanistan during our review period, only 78 of the contractors were in  SPOT and, of these, only 9 were listed as having been killed.

The officials explained that they are  coordinating with FPDS-NG officials to determine when the link can be  established. Further, while the MOU was updated in April 2010 to cover  assistance instruments, the revised MOU did not address how assistance  instrument information, such as value and competition, would be entered  into SPOT as such information is not available through FPDS-NG. USAID  and State officials informed us they do not plan to directly link SPOT and  the systems that currently track their respective assistance instruments.  They explained that this is due in part to the fact that both agencies are  implementing new tracking systems. Without such links the agencies will  have to manually enter assistance information into SPOT. In addition,  although SPOT was upgraded in 2009 to allow users to include information  on whether the contract or assistance instrument was awarded using  competitive procedures, the system is not a reliable source for this  information as it is generally not being entered.

At a March 2010 congressional hearing, officials from the  three agencies testified that they would modify how SPOT tracked  personnel. Specifically, they explained the system would be modified to  allow users to enter the aggregate number of personnel working on a  particular contract or assistance instrument, as opposed to requiring each  individual to be entered by name. The proposed modification was  primarily in response to USAID\u2019s concerns that the cost and resources  needed to enter all of the currently required data outweigh the benefits of  having detailed information as well as to alleviate security concerns over  entering personal information on local nationals into SPOT. However, as  of September 2010, SPOT still does not allow users to enter aggregate  personnel data, as the agencies have disagreed on who will pay for the  modification and what approach to take. DOD estimated that it would cost  as much as $1.1 million to reconfigure the system to allow aggregate data  to be entered and stored. Since the modification would be made to address  USAID\u2019s concerns, DOD officials noted that in accordance with the MOU,  USAID should cover the cost. However, USAID officials informed us that  the modification would not solely benefit USAID as State and even DOD  components have expressed interest in having SPOT track aggregate  personnel information. State began conducting preliminary tests on an  approach that would upload into SPOT groups of unique records assigned  to each local national instead of individual names and associated personal  data. In August 2010, DOD and State officials indicated that they had  successfully uploaded the first batch of records into SPOT using this  method. Although USAID\u2019s preferred approach would have users directly  enter the total number of U.S., third country, and local nationals working  under each contract or assistance instrument, USAID officials recently  indicated the agency would begin testing State\u2019s approach as a low-cost  solution.", "The lack of agreement on how to proceed with SPOT\u2019s development and  implementation can be partly attributed to the fact that the agencies  designated it as their system of record for meeting statutory requirements  without first identifying their information needs. SPOT program officials  acknowledged that they were unaware of the informational needs of the  contracting commands\u2014required users of SPOT\u2014or whether the  commands had any uses for the detailed data contained in the system.  Further, the agencies do not have a shared understanding of the value of  tracking detailed data, particularly since the level of detail required for all  contractor and assistance personnel in SPOT is greater than what is  statutorily required. For example, senior USAID contracting and  assistance officials told us the agency had no plans to use the detailed  information tracked in SPOT as a tool for managing and overseeing its  contracts and assistance instruments. They further noted SPOT is being  implemented only because the agency is statutorily required to have a  system for tracking such information. Even within agencies there is not  consensus on the need for detailed information on all contractor and  assistance personnel. For example, while DOD policy requires all  contractor personnel to be individually entered into SPOT, several senior  DOD officials we met with in Iraq and Afghanistan stated that they do not  see the benefit of collecting detailed information on all individuals,  especially local nationals working at remote locations, given the  challenges associated with collecting such information and the likelihood  of it being incomplete or inaccurate. However, SPOT program officials we  met with explained that while they recognize that the benefits of the  information collected through SPOT will vary throughout organizations,  they are working to identify other potential users of SPOT data. For  example, they noted that some users find detailed personnel information  valuable, such as base commanders who could use the system to obtain  insight as to who is on their installations. Senior officials from DOD, State,  and USAID agreed that the agencies should obtain an understanding of  their respective informational needs and ensure that a system is in place to  collect that information at the appropriate level of detail.

Of the personnel  reported by the three agencies, 88 percent were contractors and the  remaining 12 percent worked under assistance instruments.

We determined that caution should be exercised when  identifying trends or drawing conclusions about the number of contractor  and assistance personnel in either country based on the data the agencies  reported to us. Several factors, many of which are similar to the challenges  with SPOT, hindered the agencies\u2019 ability to collect accurate and reliable  personnel data, including difficulty obtaining information on the number  of local nationals, low response rates to agency surveys, and limited ability  to verify the accuracy or completeness of the personnel data reported.  Despite such limitations, the officials characterized the data reported to  them and provided to us as the best data available on the number of  contractor and assistance personnel in the two countries.", "DOD Contractor Personnel  As of the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, DOD reported to us that there  were 95,461 contractor personnel in Iraq and 112,092 contractor personnel  in Afghanistan (see table 2 and also app. II for additional DOD contractor  personnel data). Of that total, approximately 14 percent were reported to  be performing security functions. DOD reported that it had no personnel  working under grants or cooperative agreements in either country during  our review period. The contractor personnel numbers were obtained  through the U.S. Central Command\u2019s (CENTCOM) quarterly census.  CENTCOM initiated its quarterly census of contractor personnel in  June 2007 as an interim measure until SPOT was fully implemented, and  for our reporting period, DOD continued to use the census to count the  number of DOD contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. The census  is dependent on contractor firms reporting their personnel data to DOD  components, which then compile the data and report them to CENTCOM  at the end of each quarter.", "According to DOD officials, the quarterly census remains the most reliable  source of contractor personnel data. However, DOD officials overseeing  the census acknowledged that the census numbers represent a rough  approximation of the actual number of contractor personnel who worked  in either country. These officials told us that because of how the data were  collected and reported by the various DOD components, it was difficult to  compile and obtain a more precise count of contractor personnel.  Specifically, there are several factors that hindered DOD\u2019s ability to collect  accurate and reliable data, including difficulty in counting local nationals  and an inability to validate the data. As military operations increase in  Afghanistan, efforts to obtain an accurate count of the contractor  workforce may be more complicated than in Iraq, because DOD\u2019s  contractor workforce in Afghanistan consists of more local nationals than  in Iraq, and data on local nationals are more difficult to obtain than data  on U.S. citizens and third country nationals. The reasons cited\u2014 fluctuating numbers and work at remote locations\u2014are similar to those  cited for why it is challenging to ensure that local nationals are entered  into SPOT. DOD officials in both Iraq and Afghanistan explained that  security conditions limit their ability to conduct site visits to remote  locations and added that while at sites their focus is primarily on assessing  the status of a project, as opposed to checking on the number of personnel  working.", "Moreover, the challenges associated with CENTCOM\u2019s quarterly census  were heightened by the transition to an automated census. In the second  quarter of fiscal year 2010, DOD began to transition from the manually  compiled CENTCOM census to eventual reliance on SPOT. In doing so,  DOD used a SPOT-populated census template\u2014called SPOT-Plus\u2014as an  interim step. Although the DOD official responsible for the SPOT program  has stated that CENTCOM\u2019s manual census was cumbersome, resource  intensive, and provided only a snapshot in time, DOD officials  implementing SPOT-Plus stated that it was even more cumbersome and  resource intensive. In particular, the SPOT-Plus process required reporting  units to manually provide data on contracts and contractor personnel\u2014as  was the case with the manual census\u2014but the number of census data  fields increased from 18 to over 50.", "Although DOD issued instructions to facilitate the initial transition from  the quarterly census to SPOT-Plus, the process did not go as well as  anticipated. CENTCOM officials told us that in some cases reporting units  responded to the second quarter census by using an older census  spreadsheet that was not populated with SPOT data or did not respond at  all. DOD officials stated that in some instances there was confusion as to  who should compile and verify the contract and contractor personnel data  and the task was mistakenly delegated to DOD organizations that were not  privy to or responsible for that information. Furthermore, since the second  quarter SPOT-Plus template did not provide a way to differentiate the  numbers of private security contractors from the total, CENTCOM had to  subsequently request that reporting units provide this information in a  separate section of the SPOT-Plus template. CENTCOM and SPOT  program officials stated that many of the challenges experienced with the  second quarter SPOT-Plus census have since been addressed. SPOT  program officials now estimate that the transition from the census to  SPOT will be completed no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.", "There continue to be considerable discrepancies between the contractor  counts obtained through the census and SPOT (see table 3). In some  instances, DOD contractor personnel numbers in SPOT may be  overreported, and in others, underreported. For example, in comparing  SPOT-reported data to census data at the end of the second quarter of  fiscal year 2010, we found that SPOT included almost 18,000 more  personnel working in Iraq than the census. Conversely, SPOT did not  include more than 70,000 personnel working in Afghanistan who were  included in the census. Further, DOD officials from one service  component in Afghanistan told us SPOT contained data on  4,200 contractor personnel who worked on their contracts, but their  census submission to CENTCOM showed there were over  40,000 personnel working on their contracts for the same period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State and USAID Contractor and Assistance Personnel", "paragraphs": ["As of the end of the fiscal year 2010 second quarter, State reported  11,236 personnel working under contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan and an  additional 8,074 working under assistance instruments, while USAID  reported 12,229 contractor personnel and 23,539 assistance personnel in  the two countries.

In some instances, State has contracted  directly for personnel to perform security services, for example, to guard  the embassies in Baghdad and Kabul. Additionally, State and USAID  contractors and assistance recipients have subcontracted for security  services to protect their personnel and facilities.", "State and USAID took similar approaches to provide us with the numbers  of contractor and assistance personnel for fiscal year 2009 and the first  half of 2010. Although State now requires contract personnel and some  grant personnel to be entered into SPOT, to respond to our request, State\u2019s  bureaus generally relied on manually compiled surveys\u2014with at least one  bureau supplementing its response with SPOT data. Similarly, USAID  relied on a combination of periodic surveys and data obtained through  quarterly reports submitted by the agency\u2019s contractors and assistance  recipients. However, State officials informed us that their contractors  and assistance recipients are not required to provide such reports a nd,  therefore, response rates to requests for personnel numbers are low. For  example, officials with one State office noted that none of its Afghan grant  recipients provided personnel numbers. In contrast, USAID officials in Iraq  indicated that they regularly receive personnel numbers from all of their  contractors and assistance recipients, while USAID officials in Afghanistan  we spoke with stated they generally receive responses from about  70 percent of their contractors and assistance recipients. We identified  several contracts and assistance instruments for which personnel  information was not provided. For example, we identified a State contract  to design and build offices and housing in Afghanistan with obligations  totaling $234 million for which personnel numbers were not reported. In  another example, we identified four USAID cooperative agreements for a  program promoting food security in Afghanistan with total obligations of  $144 million for which information on the number of personnel working  on the agreement was not provided.", "Agency officials acknowledged several additional challenges in providing  us with complete data on their contract and assistance personnel in Iraq  and Afghanistan. First, not all local nationals working on State and USAID  contracts and assistance instruments were included in the numbers they  provided to us. As with SPOT, local nationals were not always captured in  personnel counts because it was either not feasible or too difficult to  obtain accurate information. In addition, State and USAID officials stated  that they have limited ability to verify the accuracy or completeness of the  personnel data provided. State officials in Iraq and Afghanistan informed  us that they have no visibility into the extent to which contractors use  subcontracted employees and generally are not able to track the numbers  of subcontract personnel. However, USAID officials in Iraq explained that  they have instituted measures to review the reported data to improve  accuracy.", "Although agency officials acknowledged that not all contractor and  assistance personnel were being tracked over the course of our review  period, they still considered the data provided to our requests for  personnel information to be more accurate than SPOT. Reflective of their  policies regarding SPOT\u2019s use and challenges associated with collecting  data through SPOT, there are significant discrepancies\u2014both in terms of  under- and overreporting\u2014between the numbers in SPOT and what was  reported to us by State and USAID. For example, as of the end of the  second quarter of fiscal year 2010, there were 7,077 fewer State contractor  and assistance personnel in SPOT than were reported to us. In fact, SPOT  did not include any of the 5,741 personnel working under assistance  instruments in Afghanistan that State reported to us. The discrepancies for  USAID were also notable, given that during our review period USAID did  not require the use of SPOT in Afghanistan or for Iraqi nationals.

However, the system does not differentiate between direct-hire  government civilians and contractors and does not include data on local or  third country nationals. Additionally, some individual components within  the department receive reports on killed or wounded contractor  personnel, but such reports are not consistently tracked in a readily  accessible or comprehensive manner. For example, contracting officials in  Afghanistan explained that they receive serious incident reports, which  include information on incidents in which personnel were killed or  wounded, submitted by their private security contractors. A DOD official  in Afghanistan knowledgeable on the matter cautioned though that the  reports most likely understate the actual number of contractor casualties,  as not all contractors submit reports as required.", "Absent a reliable system for tracking killed or wounded contractor  personnel, DOD officials referred us to Labor for data on cases filed under  DBA for killed or injured contractors\u2014as they have for our prior reports.

Tracking Iraqi  and Afghan nationals who work under contracts and assistance  instruments presents unique challenges, not only in terms of obtaining  aggregate numbers, but especially in terms of obtaining the detailed  information currently required by SPOT. The still unresolved issue of how  local nationals will be tracked reliably in SPOT reflects a lack of  consensus among and even within the agencies about the value and use of  such data beyond fulfilling a statutory requirement.", "With SPOT not yet fully implemented, the agencies have relied on other  methods of collecting data that have their own shortcomings to respond to  our requests for required information, and in some cases, data were not  provided. Last year, we recommended that the agencies develop a joint  plan with associated time frames to address SPOT\u2019s limitations, but  agency officials believed that a plan was not needed and their ongoing  coordination efforts were sufficient. However, our work since then  demonstrates that their ongoing efforts alone were not sufficient to ensure  that statutory requirements are met. Over the past year, SPOT\u2019s  implementation has continued to be undermined by a lack of agreement  among the agencies on how to proceed and how best to meet their  respective data needs to fulfill statutory requirements and improve  oversight and management of contracts and assistance instruments. Until  the agencies individually assess their own data needs given the relative  challenges and benefits of tracking detailed information on contracts,  assistance instruments, and associated personnel and collectively agree on  how to best address those needs while meeting statutory requirements, as  we have previously recommended, they are not in a position to determine  how best to move forward.

Once the  agencies have agreed on how to proceed, having a plan with defined roles  and responsibilities and associated time frames can help hold the agencies  accountable and ensure timely implementation.

Based on our analyses and discussions  with agency officials, we determined that caution should be exercised  when using the agency-provided data on contractor and assistance  personnel to draw conclusions about either the actual number in Iraq or  Afghanistan for any given time period or trends over time. However, we  are presenting the reported data along with their limitations as they  establish a rough order of magnitude for the number of contractor and  assistance personnel during our period of review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Killed or Wounded Contractor and Assistance Personnel", "paragraphs": ["To address our third objective, we analyzed USAID and State data on the  number of contract and assistance personnel killed or wounded in Iraq  and Afghanistan during the period of our review.

Nevertheless, we are  providing them as they provide insight into the number of contractor and  assistance personnel who were killed or wounded during our period of  review. DOD did not collect and could not provide such data. After  informing us that they did not have a reliable system for tracking killed or  wounded personnel, DOD officials referred us to use the Department of  Labor\u2019s (Labor) Defense Base Act (DBA) case data.", "We analyzed data from Labor on DBA cases arising from incidents that  occurred in Iraq and Afghanistan in fiscal year 2009 and the first half of  fiscal year 2010. We obtained similar DBA data from Labor for our  previous reports, for which we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes, when presented with appropriate caveats. We  reported in 2009 that DBA data are not a good proxy for determining the  number of contractor and assistance instruments personnel who were  killed or wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, but they do provide insights  into the number killed or wounded, common causes of death, and whether  claimants died from hostile or nonhostile actions. We reviewed the entire  population of fatality case data reported by Labor that occurred during our  review period, which totaled 213, to determine information such as the  circumstances of the incident resulting in death and the nationality of the  individual killed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracts and Assistance Instruments", "paragraphs": ["To address our fourth objective, we obtained data from DOD, State, and  USAID on the number of active or awarded contracts, grants, and  cooperative agreements with performance in Iraq and Afghanistan during  fiscal year 2009 and the first half of fiscal year 2010, the amount of funds  obligated on those contracts and assistance instruments during our review  period, and the extent to which new contracts, grants, and cooperative  agreements were competitively awarded. We also interviewed agency  officials to discuss the reported data. The agencies provided data from  FPDS-NG, agency-specific databases, and manually compiled lists of  obligations and deobligations. We determined that the data each agency  reported were sufficiently reliable to determine the minimum number of  active or awarded contracts and obligation amounts, as well as the extent  of competition, based on prior reliability assessments, interviews with  agency officials, and verification of some reported data to information in  contract files.", "We took steps to standardize the agency-reported data. This included  removing duplicates and contracts and assistance instruments that did not  have obligations or deobligations during our review period. DOD provided  us with 36 separate data sets, State provided 11, and USAID provided 12.  The reported data included multiple contract numbering conventions for  each agency. We reformatted each data set and combined them to create a  single, uniform list of contracts, orders, assistance instruments, and  modifications for each agency. We excluded the base contracts under  which orders were issued. This was done, in part, because such contracts  do not have obligations associated with them as the obligations are  incurred with the issuance of each order. We also excluded other contract  vehicles such as leases, sales contracts, and notices of intent to purchase,  as these instruments do not include performance by contractor personnel  in Iraq or Afghanistan. In addition, we also excluded voluntary  contributions, property grants, and participating agency service  agreements from our assistance data, as these types of instruments do not  include performance by assistance personnel in either country. For all  contracts and assistance instruments within our scope, we summed the  reported obligations for each contract, order, and assistance instrument  for fiscal year 2009 and the first half of fiscal year 2010. Some contracts  and assistance instruments had obligations in both fiscal year 2009 and the  first half of fiscal year 2010, so the number of active contracts, grants, and  cooperative agreements for the entire 18-month period was lower than the  combined number of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements that  were active in each fiscal year.", "We reviewed 52 State and 36 USAID assistance files as part of our data  reliability assessment of agency-specific databases.

From USAID\u2019s Electronic Procurement and Information  Collection System, we randomly selected 39 assistance files that were  active during fiscal year 2009 and reviewed 36 of these files in either Iraq  or Afghanistan.
