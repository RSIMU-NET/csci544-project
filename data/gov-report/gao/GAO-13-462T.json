In addition, the government's existing strategy documents do not always incorporate key desirable characteristics GAO has identified that can enhance the usefulness of national strategies. Specifically, while existing strategy documents have included elements of these characteristics--such as setting goals and subordinate objectives--they have generally lacked other key elements. These include milestones and performance measures to gauge results; costs of implementing the strategy and sources and types of resources needed; and a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of federal entities. For example, although federal law assigns the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) responsibility for oversight of federal government information security, OMB recently transferred several of these responsibilities to DHS. This decision may have had practical benefits, such as leveraging additional resources and expertise, but it remains unclear how OMB and DHS are to share oversight of individual departments and agencies.

Such  legislation could clarify the respective responsibilities of OMB and DHS,  as well as those of other key federal departments and agencies.", "In commenting on a draft of the report, the Executive Office of the  President agreed that more needs to be done to develop a coherent and  comprehensive strategy on cybersecurity but did not believe producing  another strategy document would be beneficial. Specifically, the office  stated that remaining flexible and focusing on achieving measurable  improvements in cybersecurity would be more beneficial than developing  \u201cyet another strategy on top of existing strategies.\u201d We agree that  flexibility and a focus on achieving measurable improvements in  cybersecurity is critically important and that simply preparing another  document, if not integrated with previous documents, would not be  helpful. The focus of our recommendation is to develop an overarching  strategy that integrates the numerous strategy documents, establishes  milestones and performance measures, and better ensures that federal  departments and agencies are held accountable for making significant  improvements in cybersecurity challenge areas. The Executive Office of  the President also agreed that Congress should consider enhanced  cybersecurity legislation that addresses information sharing and baseline  standards for critical infrastructure, among other things.", "In summary, addressing the ongoing challenges in implementing effective  cybersecurity within the government, as well as in collaboration with the  private sector and other partners, requires the federal government to  define and implement a coherent and comprehensive national strategy  that includes key desirable elements and provides accountability for  results. Recent efforts, such as the 2012 cross-agency priorities and the  executive order on improving cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, could  provide parts of a strategic approach. For example, the executive order  includes actions aimed at addressing challenges in developing standards  for critical infrastructure and sharing information, in addition to assigning  specific responsibilities to specific individuals that are to be completed  within specific timeframes, thus providing clarity of responsibility and a  means for establishing accountability. However, these efforts need to be  integrated into an overarching strategy that includes a clearer process for  oversight of agency risk management and a roadmap for improving the  cybersecurity challenge areas in order for the government to make  significant progress in furthering its strategic goals and lessening  persistent weaknesses.", "Chairmen Rockefeller and Carper, Ranking Members Thune and Coburn,  and Members of the Committees, this concludes my statement.
