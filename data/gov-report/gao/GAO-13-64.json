To encourage families to save for college, earnings from 529 plans--named after section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code--grow tax-deferred and are exempt from federal income tax when they are used for qualified higher education expenses. In fiscal year 2011, the Department of the Treasury estimated these plans represented $1.6 billion in forgone federal revenue. Managed by states, over one hundred 529 plan options were available to families nationwide as of July 2012. The number of 529 plan accounts and the amount invested in them has grown during the past decade. GAO was asked to describe (1) the percentage and characteristics of families enrolling in 529 plans, (2) plan features and other factors that affect participation in 529 plans, and (3) the extent to which savings in 529 plans affect financial aid awards. GAO analyzed government data, including the SCF. This survey's 529 plan data are combined with Coverdells, so the SCF estimates used in the report include both 529 and Coverdell data. GAO also analyzed National Postsecondary Student Aid Study data; conducted interviews with federal and state officials, industry and academic experts, and state and institutional higher education officials; reviewed 529 plan and Department of Education documents; conducted a literature review; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A small percentage of U.S. families saved in 529 plans in 2010, and those who did tended to be wealthier than others. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), less than 3 percent of families saved in a 529 plan or Coverdell Education Savings Account (Coverdell)--a similar but less often used college savings vehicle also included in the SCF. While the economic downturn may have reduced income available for education savings, even among those families who considered saving for education a priority, fewer than 1 in 10 had a 529 plan (or Coverdell). Families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets of those without. They also had about 3 times the median income and the percentage who had college degrees was about twice as high as for families without 529 plans (or Coverdells).", "States offer consumers a variety of 529 plan features that, along with several other factors, can affect participation. Some of the most important features families consider when choosing a 529 plan are tax benefits, fees, and investment options, according to experts and state officials GAO interviewed. These features can vary across the state plans. For example, in July 2012, total annual asset-based fees ranged from 0 to 2.78 percent depending on the type of plan. 529 plan officials and experts GAO interviewed said participation is also affected by families' ability to save, their awareness of 529 plans as a savings option, and the difficulty in choosing a plan given the amount of variation between plans. Selected states, however, have taken steps to address these barriers. For example, to address families' ability to save, particularly for low-income families, some states have adopted plans that include less risky investments, have low minimum contributions, and match families' contributions.", "Savings in 529 plans affect financial aid similarly to a family's other assets. For federal aid, a family's assets affect how much it is expected to contribute to the cost of college. If the amount of those assets exceeds a certain threshold, then a percentage is expected to be used for college costs. For example, for students who are dependent on their parents, the percentage of parental assets, including savings in 529 plans, that the family may be expected to contribute ranges from 2.64 to 5.64 percent. Many states and selected institutions also treat 529 plan savings the same as other family assets. However, a few states provide them with special treatment, such as exempting those funds from their financial aid calculation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["While median family income decreased between 2005 and 2011, college  tuition and fees increased at an average annual rate of 6 percent, more  than double the rate of inflation. As families look for ways to prepare for  these rising costs, their options include saving in advance; paying for  expenses at the time they occur out-of-pocket and/or through grants and  scholarships; or financing the cost through educational loans that they  repay at a later date. Loans have become an increasingly popular option  to cover these costs. However, with college loan balances now  estimated at $914 billion, more than total credit card debt, financing a  large portion of college costs potentially creates a future financial burden  for students and their families. To encourage people to save for college  expenses in advance, Congress, in 1996, added section 529 to the  Internal Revenue Code, which authorized state qualified tuition programs,  otherwise known as 529 plans. These plans are available in two forms\u2014 prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans. In prepaid tuition plans,  participants buy tuition credits or certificates on behalf of a designated  beneficiary, who can use them for qualified higher education expenses.  College savings plans allow for contributions to an account for the  purpose of paying a designated beneficiary\u2019s qualified higher education  expenses. As of July 2012, more than one hundred 529 plan options have  been developed and are managed by states and the District of Columbia.

We reported, in 2012, that higher income households are more likely to have 529 plans and tend to benefit  more from these tax preferences because of their higher marginal tax  rate.

As seen in table 2, there is variation among states in both  administrative and investment fees. Such variation occurred even among  states with similar administrative structures. For example, among three of  the states we reviewed where most administrative functions were  conducted in-house, one state charged administrative fees of between  0.44 percent and 0.46 percent of the balance annually, another charged  between 0.15 percent and 0.20 percent, and a third charged no  administrative fees, instead covering operational costs and salaries  through an annual state appropriation.

For advisor-sold funds, sales loads also  varied, ranging from 0 percent to 5.75 percent, in part based on the fund  class.

In terms of payment options and costs, two states we  interviewed offered prepaid plans by academic periods or units that can  be used to pay for future tuition costs with the option of paying in lump  sum or through a monthly payment program. According to state officials,  the cost of these prepaid plans is generally determined by forecasting  future tuition and fees at different types of schools (4-year, community  college, etc.), given a number of actuarial assumptions on tuition inflation  and anticipated investment return. One state, for example, offered a  contract to cover four years of college costs for a child currently under  age five at a lump sum of $56,600 and another state offered a similar  contract for just under $66,500.

Officials  from one state added when a family\u2019s budget shrinks or the economy is  uncertain, families reduce college rather than retirement savings.  Furthermore, a few industry representatives said families should consider  using other tax-deferred savings vehicles where funds could be used for  multiple purposes, such as retirement and education. The states we  selected to review have adopted strategies to expand participation among  lower income families who may have limited resources to allocate  towards savings, including offering matching programs, low minimum  initial contributions, and less risky investment options.", "For example, in 2011 a family of 4 earning less than $44,700 would qualify, according  to plan documentation. dollar for dollar, up to $400 annually per beneficiary for up to 4  years. In addition to increasing participation, officials from one  state plan noted that the matching program can also help  minimize student loans and reduce the amount students will have  to work while in school. An ongoing experiment conducted by the  Center for Social Development also found a positive impact on the  number of 529 plan accounts for families who were automatically  enrolled in a state-owned 529 account with a matching program in  one state. In addition to participating in the automatically opened  account, families in the treatment group were offered an additional  $100 to open a private account. These families opened private  529 accounts at a higher rate (17 percent of families with a match  compared to 2 percent of those in the control group without the  incentives), and deposited more into those accounts. While  matching programs may have positive results, two states we  reviewed reported challenges with funding and awareness. One  state\u2019s program had not been authorized since 2008 and officials  in another state said their enrollment remained low despite being  open to all participants because the state\u2019s 529 marketing budget  was eliminated.", "Low or No Minimum Initial Contributions: Low or no minimum  initial contributions and fee waivers may also help increase  participation among low-income families, according to state  officials and others we interviewed. Nationally, minimum initial  contributions range from $10 to $5,000, according to our analysis  of CSPN data; however, the majority of states require an initial  contribution of $25 or less. Two states allow participants to open  an account with any amount. Officials in one state reported that  keeping the initial deposit amounts low can also help facilitate one  of their main goals: to help spur the mental commitment and habit  to save.", "Less Risky Investment Options: Officials from many states we  reviewed said they offer investment options that pose less risk to  the investor, which can appeal to low- to moderate-income  families. One state, for example, partnered with two local banks to  provide a FDIC-insured option to target families who might  otherwise save in the bank\u2019s savings account. According to an  official from the plan\u2019s banking partner, clients with more assets  often use financial planners and are aware of 529 plans, while the  FDIC-insured option was designed for those without financial  planners and who use the bank\u2019s more traditional products.", "According to state officials, most of the states we reviewed are not  tracking participant\u2019s demographic information such as income, however,  making the success of these efforts for low-income families difficult to  assess.", "Second, in addition to insufficient income, some families may not save  because they procrastinate or underestimate the true cost of college,  according to officials from most of the states we reviewed. Some parents  may not budget money to save for college due to a lack of understanding  about what college really costs or they become overwhelmed and do  nothing, officials at one state 529 plan said. To address these challenges,  selected state 529 plans have adopted financial literacy programs and  marketing strategies emphasizing the importance of saving even a small  amount early and often. To target families with younger children, two  states provide materials to parents of newborns through the hospital or  direct mail and two states work with elementary schools to distribute  materials on the states\u2019 529 plans. Some states also establish  contribution deadlines linked to certain benefits, such as discounted  enrollment, or provide incentives to families who contribute during certain  times of the year. To prevent families from feeling overwhelmed about  college costs, one state has focused its marketing on saving a small  amount each month, $25, to help reduce the student\u2019s future debt,  instead of focusing on the total cost of college.", "Sallie Mae, August 2010. impact of a difficult economic climate, constraints on endowments, and  tighter budgets. In response, many of the states we reviewed have  attempted to address misconceptions about the financial aid process. For  example, one state lists common myths about 529 plans on its website,  explaining that approximately 60 percent of federal financial aid comes in  the form of loans, a debt the family must repay. The site encourages  families to save even in small amounts to offset the amount of debt the  family will incur.", "For those who are saving for college, awareness that 529 plans exist as a  savings option is a challenge to participation, according to officials in most  of the states we reviewed. In addition, among parents who are saving for  college, one study found that almost half are unfamiliar with 529 plans. An  additional 4 percent volunteered that they had never heard of the plan or  did not know what it was. financial planners, according to many state officials we interviewed;  therefore, awareness may be a particular challenge for low-income  families who generally do not have access to such resources. Further,  some state officials and industry representatives we interviewed  encountered families with misperceptions about how 529 plans work,  such as not understanding they can invest in plans outside their home  state or use savings at any college or university. For example, officials  from two states reported families mistakenly believe prepaid plans can  only be used at an in-state institution.", "Sallie Mae, August 2010. marketing and communication difficult, according to officials we  interviewed in two states. Marketing officials from one state told us  consumers requested more information on 529 plans, but it was difficult to  communicate information about the complex plans in a simple, consumer- friendly way. Officials in another state noted that plan complexity and a  lack of clear information can discourage families from researching and  enrolling in a plan.", "Many state officials and some academic experts and industry  representatives reported that simplifying the information available to  consumers might keep families from feeling overwhelmed. Because  MSRB rules do not apply to state issuers when they market their direct- sold 529 plans, CSPN developed a set of disclosure principles to help  states provide consistent information. The voluntary principles contain  recommendations to help consumers understand plans and compare  various features, such as fees, tax issues, and risk. While disclosures  have been helpful, according to one expert who consults with a number of  states, there is room for improvement: disclosures could be more rigorous  in ensuring that consumers are informed of less-costly options within a  state if they exist and should cover information on prepaid plans, which is  currently not standardized. When comparing direct-sold disclosure  documents across states we reviewed, we found that the five states  generally adhered to the CSPN disclosure principles and contained  consistent information a consumer could compare. Three states,  however, were missing some information that could be helpful to  consumers, such as information on the risk of state tax law changes and  a statement that 529 plans should only be used to save for qualified  higher education expenses.", "The structure of federal and state tax benefits, a primary incentive for  some 529 plan investors, can also affect participation as they may not be  as helpful to low-income families, according to some academic experts,  industry representatives, and state officials we interviewed. Low-income  families with low or no tax liability see less benefit from federal tax  benefits and may see no benefit from nonrefundable state tax credits  provided to 529 plan investors. According to a 2009 Treasury report,  families saving in 529 plans may need to carefully consider whether their  child will go to college because the penalty incurred if the funds are not  used for qualified education expenses may outweigh the tax benefits for  low-income families. In addition, Treasury noted most states do not  extend tax benefits to residents investing in out-of-state plans, limiting  competition. As a result, families have a strong incentive to choose their  home state plan even if other plans offer preferable investment choices.  In 2009, Treasury recommended states eliminate this \u201chome-state bias\u201d  to provide more investment options to consumers, more intense  competition between plans, and potentially lower fees. According to an  annual report from one state that extends its tax benefits to residents who  invest in other states\u2019 plans, doing so, when other states do not, puts the  home state plan at a competitive disadvantage. State officials explained  that this policy results in other plans marketing their products in the state.  Residents, therefore, may be unaware of their home state plan\u2019s benefits,  according to the report.", "Finally, the fact that account holders may change their investment option  only one time per year may affect participation in 529 plans, according to  state officials and some industry representatives we interviewed. Officials  from one financial services company advocated removing any limits on  changing investment choices beyond those imposed by the financial  services company sponsoring the fund, as is the case with 401(k) plans  and individual retirement accounts. Another industry representative  observed some 529 plan participants changing their account beneficiary  solely because it would allow them to change their investment options.  However, the representative cautioned that participants should not  change their investment options too frequently; many experts advocate  that investors are best served by sticking with a long-term investment  plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Savings in 529 Plans Affect Financial Aid the Same as Other Assets", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Savings in 529 Plans Are Treated Similarly to Other Assets That Are Included When Calculating the Expected Family Contribution", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which savings in 529 plans, or other investments, affect  how much a family is expected to contribute to the cost of college\u2014the  federal expected family contribution (EFC)\u2014generally depends on the  family\u2019s amount of assets.

Officials at two institutions said they did not consider  savings in 529 plans beyond how they are already reported by the family  on the FAFSA. An official at a third institution said the school does not  collect any additional information on savings in 529 plans beyond what is  requested on the FAFSA even though the school requires families to fill  out the PROFILE form and uses an institutional methodology to award its  financial aid. The remaining institutional officials said they collect  additional family financial information when calculating student aid, but  consider savings in 529 plans similarly to the family\u2019s other assets.

Regardless of the perceived effect 529 plan savings  may have on financial aid, some of the officials we interviewed said they  encourage families to save for college because much of the aid they may  be offered could be in the form of loans, so saving will generally be in the  student\u2019s long-term financial interest."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As currently designed, 529 college savings plans benefit a small  percentage of U.S. families. In general these families tend to be wealthier  than others. It is not clear whether the $1.6 billion in federal tax  expenditures that these plans represent strategically targets limited  federal resources. Although 529 plans do help some families save for  college, families with less income and who are uncertain about whether  their children will attend college may have less incentive to invest  resources in 529 plans than in other forms of savings. In addition, the tax  benefits attractive to a higher-income family do not offer as much benefit  to a family with lower tax liability.", "Questions about who benefits from this tax expenditure occur in an  environment of long-term fiscal challenges and difficult choices about how  the federal government allocates limited resources. Reviewing 529 plans  in conjunction with the other billions of dollars in federal educational  assistance provided through tax expenditures, credits, and deductions  could help Congress determine whether this program is meeting its goals.  Similar to GAO\u2019s prior work on higher-education related tax expenditures,  our analysis of 529 college savings plans was not able to address all  questions that could inform future policy choices regarding 529 plans. For  example, what is the purpose of the federal tax benefits provided through  529 plans? Are the goals and objectives clearly defined and measurable?  Who is the target population for 529 plans and does the current structure  provide appropriate incentives for that population?

To answer these research objectives,  we analyzed government data; interviewed state 529 plan officials from  select states as well as industry representatives and academic experts;  reviewed plan documents and analyzed industry data; conducted a  literature review; interviewed federal, state, and institutional financial aid  officials; and reviewed Department of Education (Education) and Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) documents as well as relevant federal laws,  regulations and guidance.", "We assessed the reliability of the data we used by reviewing  documentation, interviewing knowledgeable officials, and conducting  electronic testing on relevant data fields.

The 2010 SCF, 2007-2008 NPSAS, and 2010 SOI were the most  recent data available at the time of our engagement, so to ensure  consistency in reporting we adjusted all dollar amounts from previous  years\u2019 data to 2010 dollars.", "Each of these three data sources (SCF, NPSAS, and SOI) are based on  probability samples and estimates are formed using the appropriate  estimation weights provided with each survey\u2019s data. Because each of  these samples follows a probability procedure based on random  selections, they represent only one of a large number of samples that  could have been drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus  2.5 percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.  Unless otherwise noted, all percentage estimates based on the SCF,  NPSAS, and SOI have 95 percent confidence intervals that are within 5  percentage points of the estimate itself, and all numerical estimates other  than percentages have 95 percent confidence intervals that are within 5  percent of the estimate itself.", "For our analysis of the percentage and characteristics of families who  held 529 plans, we relied primarily on restricted data from the 2010 SCF.  SCF is a triennial survey sponsored by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) to provide detailed  information on the finances of U.S. households. The SCF sample of 6,492  households represented approximately 118 million households in 2010. It  collects detailed financial characteristics on an economically dominant  single individual or couple (married or living as partners) in a household,  which we refer to as a family for the purposes of this report. For our  analysis, we aggregated financial information so that, unless otherwise  noted, all SCF estimates are for the family rather than the individual  survey respondent. We did not restrict our analysis to families with  children, in part, because 529 plans can be used for nearly anyone,  including one\u2019s child, grandchild, niece, nephew, and oneself. However,  about 88 percent of families with 529 plans or Coverdell Education  Savings Accounts (Coverdells), a similar education savings vehicle, had  children 25 years of age or younger living with them. Our estimates for  529 plans included Coverdells because Federal Reserve officials said  respondents did not always distinguish between the two account types;  therefore, we did not separate these responses because of data reliability  concerns. However, the officials indicated that a larger share of the SCF  respondents reported having 529 plans than Coverdells. Further, using  SOI data, we estimate that in 2010 approximately 85 percent of tax filers  who took a distribution from either a 529 plan or a Coverdell reported  distributions from a 529 plan while 14 percent reported distributions from  a Coverdell and 1 percent reported distributions from both. We wrote an  analysis program that the Federal Reserve ran using their restricted SCF  dataset to separate information on Medical Savings Accounts and Health  Savings Accounts, which had been included in the 2010 public dataset  with 529 plans and Coverdells. Federal Reserve officials modified some  resulting information to protect the privacy of survey respondents, for  example by rounding dollar amounts.", "Using SCF, we generated estimates on the percentage and  characteristics of families enrolled in 529 plans or Coverdells and of  families not enrolled in these plans. We examined family characteristics  such as wealth (financial assets), income, education, and race or  ethnicity. To calculate financial assets, we used the methodology the  Federal Reserve uses to produce variables for its published Bulletin  articles. This methodology included assets held in checking, savings, and  brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks, bonds,  life insurance, retirement accounts, and other vehicles such as 529 plans.  Assets held in retirement accounts included those in defined contribution  plans (e.g. a 401(k), individual retirement account, or thrift savings plan)  as well as in traditional pensions or defined benefit plans. To calculate  income, we used the family\u2019s self-reported total income. To report the  family\u2019s highest educational attainment, we reviewed the education of  each respondent and his or her partner or spouse and included whichever  was higher. We reported information on the respondent\u2019s race or  ethnicity, which does not necessarily indicate the race or ethnicity of other  family members.", "We used 2007-2008 NPSAS data to develop a similar demographic  profile for college students and generate other estimates on college costs  and financial aid amounts. NPSAS is a comprehensive study by  Education that examines how students and their families pay for higher  education. It includes nationally representative samples of 113,535  undergraduates, 12,585 graduate students, and 1,581 first-professional  students enrolled any time between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008. The  NPSAS data are based on administrative records and student interviews,  and NPSAS includes survey results from both students who received  financial aid and those who did not. While we used NPSAS to develop a  demographic profile for college students similar to the one we developed  for the general population using SCF, families with 529 plans are not  directly comparable to families of college students. For example, while  our estimates using SCF are for all families (including families with  children in college, with children not in college, and with no children), our  estimates for families using NPSAS are exclusively for families with a  current college student. In NPSAS, families include the student and the  student\u2019s parents (if the student is dependent) or the student\u2019s spouse  and dependents (if the student is independent). Further, the population of  NPSAS students\u2019 families is not the same as the population of families  with a child in college because a family may have more than one student  in college in a given year. Consequently students\u2019 family characteristics  derived from NPSAS are not directly comparable to family characteristics  based on the SCF, though for the purposes of our report we use similar  terminology to describe them. Similar to our analysis of SCF, we  generated estimates of the characteristics of college students\u2019 families\u2014  education, and race or ethnicity. To report income, we  including income,calculated the total income of (1) the student\u2019s parents (if the student was  dependent) and (2) the student and the student\u2019s spouse (if the student  was independent). To report the family\u2019s highest educational attainment,  we reviewed the education of each student\u2019s mother and father and  included whichever was higher. We also reported information on the  student\u2019s race or ethnicity, which does not necessarily indicate the race or  ethnicity of other family members. We also developed separate estimates  for students who are considered either dependent on their parents or  independent for financial aid purposes.", "We also used NPSAS to generate other estimates related to the cost of  college and amount of financial aid awards. First, we estimated the  median annual cost of attendance at 4-year public and private non-profit  institutions. This included tuition and fees, room and board,  transportation, and personal expenses, though the estimate is valid only  for students who attended one institution. Second, we estimated the  percentage of students who received grants and loans, as well as the  median amount of these grants and loans and the percent and amount of  college expenses remaining. Third, we generated estimates for the  proportion of students who filled out the Free Application for Federal  Student Aid (FAFSA) and, for those who did fill out the FAFSA, the  proportion who met certain criteria to have assets excluded from the  federal expected family contribution (EFC) and the proportion whose  assets affected the EFC. Finally, we calculated the percentage of  students who received state and institutional financial aid.", "We also analyzed 2007-2010 taxpayer data from SOI to determine the  extent to which taxpayers used distributions from 529 plans for qualified  education expenses and how the tax savings from these plans were  distributed across income levels. The SOI individual tax return file is a  stratified probability sample of income returns filed with the IRS. The SOI  sample of 308,583 returns represented approximately 143 million tax  returns filed for 2010. We combined data from the SOI individual tax file  with information from the Form 1099-Q. A 529 plan must file a Form  1099-Q with the IRS and the account owner or beneficiary each time a  taxpayer receives a distribution from a 529 plan account. This form  includes information on the amount of the distribution and the earnings (or  loss) on the distribution. When taxpayers receive a Form 1099-Q, they  must determine if the distribution was used for qualified education  expenses. If the distribution, or any portion of it, was nonqualified, the  earnings portion is subject to taxes and, in some cases, a penalty. The  taxpayer determines the amount of taxes and penalty owed on the  nonqualified distribution by completing Form 5329, which is contained in  the individual tax return file. By combining information from the 1099-Q  with information in the individual tax return file, we identified the  percentage of taxpayers who reported nonqualified distributions that were  subject to a penalty. We also used SOI data to estimate the tax savings  by using the National Bureau of Economic Research\u2019s (NBER) TAXSIM  Model, a microsimulation model of U.S. federal and state income tax  systems. TAXSIM calculates estimated liabilities under U.S. federal and  state income tax laws from actual tax returns that have been prepared for  public use by the Statistics of Income Division of the IRS.

Specifically, we compared whether the state  documents contained eleven elements outlined in the principles,  including: a summary of key features, an assessment of the individual  summary features, a statement of any guarantee by the state issuer or  the state, information on state tax treatment and other benefits,  information that the state offers more than one plan, fee descriptions, and  investment risks, among others. These elements were chosen based on  discussions with states and experts who identified plan fees, tax benefits,  and investment options as some of the most important features  consumers consider when choosing whether or not to participate in a 529  plan. In addition to recording whether states have disclosed the  information listed above, we assessed whether any information was  missing, where the information was located in the document, and any  other observations about the ability to find and understand plan  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed studies conducted by academics, researchers, industry  representatives, and federal agencies on why families choose to  participate in 529 plans and what features might serve as barriers or  incentives. We identified literature published since 2006, when Congress  passed the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-250, which  made permanent the tax-exemption on 529 plan distributions used for  qualified education expenses. Our review included scholarly/peer  reviewed material, government reports, hearings and transcripts,  trade/industry articles, association/nonprofit/think tank publications, and  working papers. We searched information sources such as EconLit,  ProQuest, ERIC, PolicyFile, WorldCat, ECO, PapersFirst, ArticleFirst, and  Academic OneFile. These online sources are nationally recognized  databases that index and abstract research literature. We selected search  terms to capture literature that specifically addressed 529 plans, college  savings plans, qualified state tuition programs, and prepaid tuition. Of the  32 studies we identified, 12 studies met the following criteria: 1) included  information on plan features in specific states, 2) addressed the  consequences for consumers of choosing one type of 529 plan over  another, 3) identified barriers or incentives for consumers to choose 529  plans, 4) included data collected by states on plan participation, and/or, 5)  included information on plan disclosures to consumers. All studies cited in  the report were reviewed by at least two GAO analysts. Studies that  included statistical methods were reviewed by a GAO statistician and  social science analyst.

To select the state financial aid offices, we used  information from a 2009-2010 survey by the National Association of State  Student Grant and Aid Programs to identify states that indicated they  used a financial aid formula other than the federal methodology in their  primary needs analysis and/or provided special treatment for state 529  plans. For report consistency, we selected the same states selected for  529 plan site visit locations to the extent possible (i.e., where the data  supported the selection based on the criteria). We interviewed  representatives in the following state financial aid offices: Louisiana Office  of Student Financial Assistance, Michigan Office of Scholarships and  Grants, New York Higher Education Services Corporation, Pennsylvania  Higher Education Assistance Agency, Utah Higher Education Assistance  Authority, and State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.", "We also selected six institutions from the states whose financial aid  offices were selected for interviews. To obtain a national perspective on  institutional financial aid and determine the best method for selecting the  individual institutions, we interviewed representatives at several financial  aid organizations including the Association of Private Sector Colleges and  Universities, the College Board, the National Association of Student  Financial Aid Administrators, the National Association of Independent  Colleges and Universities, and the American Association of Community  Colleges. In these interviews, some officials said that schools with larger  endowments were likely to require families to provide additional  information, such as that required on the College Board\u2019s PROFILE  application, to award their institutional financial aid. We matched the  2012-2013 College Board\u2019s list of institutions that use the PROFILE  application with Education\u2019s 2009-2010 Integrated Postsecondary  Education Data System to calculate endowment amounts per student at  public and private non-profit four-year institutions. We also reviewed the  list of schools that participate in the Private 529 Consortium and selected  at least one school that was also part of this group. One state did not  have an institution that used the PROFILE application so we reviewed  websites of postsecondary schools in that state to identify a school that  collected data in addition to the FAFSA. We interviewed representatives  at the following institutions: Xavier University of Louisiana, University of  Michigan, St. Lawrence University, Swarthmore College, University of  Utah, and University of Richmond."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Free Application for Federal Student Aid, 2012-2013", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": ["Michelle Sager, Acting Director, Education, Workforce, and Income  Security Issues, 202-512-6806 or sagerm@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Gretta Goodwin (Assistant  Director), Amy Anderson, Rachel Beers, and Laura Henry contributed to  all aspects of this report.
