Resistance occurs naturally but is accelerated by inappropriate antibiotic use in people, among other things. Questions have been raised about whether agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have adequately assessed the effects of antibiotic use and disposal on resistance in humans. GAO was asked to (1) describe federal efforts to quantify the amount of antibiotics produced, (2) evaluate HHS's monitoring of antibiotic use and efforts to promote appropriate use, (3) examine HHS's monitoring of antibiotic-resistant infections, and (4) describe federal efforts to monitor antibiotic disposal and antibiotics in the environment, and describe research on antibiotics in the development of resistance in the environment. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials, conducted a literature review, and analyzed antibiotic sales data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies do not routinely quantify the amount of antibiotics that are produced in the United States for human use. However, sales data can be used as an estimate of production, and these show that over 7 million pounds of antibiotics were sold for human use in 2009. Most of the antibiotics that were sold have common characteristics, such as belonging to the same five antibiotic classes. The class of penicillins was the largest group of antibiotics sold for human use in 2009, representing about 45 percent of antibiotics sold. HHS performs limited monitoring of antibiotic use in humans and has implemented efforts to promote their appropriate use, but gaps in data on use will remain despite efforts to improve monitoring. Although HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors use in outpatient healthcare settings, there are gaps in data on inpatient antibiotic use and geographic patterns of use. CDC is taking steps to improve its monitoring, but gaps such as information about overall antibiotic use will remain. Because use contributes to resistance, more complete information could help policymakers determine what portion of antibiotic resistance is attributed to human antibiotic use, and set priorities for action to control the spread of resistance. CDC's Get Smart program promotes appropriate antibiotic use; CDC has observed declines in inappropriate prescribing, but it is unclear to what extent the declines were due to the program or to other factors. CDC's program has been complemented by efforts by the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, such as supporting studies to develop tests to quickly diagnose bacterial infections. Gaps in CDC's monitoring of antibiotic-resistant infections limit the agency's ability to assess the overall problem of antibiotic resistance. There are data gaps in monitoring of such infections that occur in healthcare facilities; CDC does not collect data on all types of resistant infections to make facilitywide estimates and the agency's information is not nationally representative. CDC can provide accurate national estimates for certain resistant infections that develop in the community, including tuberculosis. Although CDC is taking steps to improve its monitoring, these efforts will not allow CDC to accurately assess the overall problem of antibiotic resistance because they do not fill gaps in information. Without more comprehensive data, CDC's ability to assess the overall scope of the public health problem and plan and implement preventive activities will be impeded. Federal agencies do not monitor the disposal of most antibiotics intended for human use, but they have detected them, as well as antibiotics for animal use, in the environment, which results partly from their disposal. EPA and DOI's United States Geological Survey have examined the presence of certain antibiotics in environmental settings such as streams. Studies conducted by scientists have found that antibiotics present in the environment at certain concentrations can increase the population of resistant bacteria."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To better control the spread of resistance, GAO recommends that CDC develop and implement strategies to improve its monitoring of (1) antibiotic use and (2) antibiotic-resistant infections.

The eventual emergence and spread of bacterial infections  that are resistant to antibiotics, however, has jeopardized these gains  because infections that were once easy to cure with antibiotics are  becoming difficult, if not impossible, to treat. Some bacterial infections,  such as certain types of pneumonia and gonorrhea that are acquired in the  community, have developed resistance to almost all currently available  antibiotics. Furthermore, the bacterial infections that contribute most to  human disease are also those in which antibiotic resistance is most  common, such as respiratory tract infections and infections acquired in  hospitals. Although not all infections acquired in hospitals are resistant to  antibiotics, individuals with resistant infections are more likely to have a  poor prognosis and to remain in the hospital for a longer time, resulting in  greater medical costs.", "While the development of antibiotic resistance is not new, as resistance is  a natural biological phenomenon and can occur when any antibiotic is  present, it is accelerated by a variety of factors including the inappropriate  use of antibiotics in the absence of a bacterial infection and the prolonged  use of antibiotics to treat patients who are critically ill. Antibiotic-resistant  bacteria that are present in the human body can be spread to others. In  addition, antibiotic-resistant bacteria that occur in the environment, either  from natural causes or their discharge into soil or bodies of water, may  spread their resistance to other bacteria.", "Scientists, public health officials, and clinicians agree that antibiotic  resistance has become a national and global health challenge. While there  are various causes of antibiotic resistance\u2014including the use of  antibiotics in humans and animals\u2014the actual scope of the overall  problem is not clear and there is uncertainty about the relative  contributions of each cause. Recommendations for government action to  address antibiotic resistance have been made by various organizations and  scientific experts, including a task force made up of federal agencies, and  there is agreement that, among other things, improved surveillance of  antibiotic use and antibiotic-resistant infections is needed to adequately  understand antibiotic resistance and implement effective strategies to help  control this complex problem. Further, a congressional committee and  others have made recommendations to increase the geographic coverage  of existing federal agency surveillance to address concerns such as gaps in  the ability to track and monitor certain antibiotic-resistant infections, such  as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).", "Questions have been raised as to whether federal agencies, including the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have adequately  assessed the relationship among the volume of antibiotics produced for  human use, the human use of antibiotics, the presence of antibiotics in the  environment, and the problem of antibiotic resistance.

We purchased 2009 national sales data for antibiotics  from IMS Health to estimate the volume of antibiotics produced in the  United States for human use. IMS Health provided us the total volume of  antibiotics, in kilograms, that were sold, based on all antibiotic drugs that  were included in the Red Book Advanced database, as of April 2010. We  converted the total volume from kilograms to pounds. To further describe  the antibiotics that were sold in 2009, we classified the total volume of  antibiotics by antibiotic class, the route of administration (e.g., oral), and  the types of pharmacies that purchased antibiotics (e.g., chain store  pharmacy). To assess the reliability of IMS Health data, we reviewed  existing information about the data and interviewed officials  knowledgeable about the data to assess their completeness.

We also reviewed agency documents that summarize trends in  antibiotic use, based on the surveys. We interviewed HHS officials with  responsibility for the surveys about the strengths and limitations of each  survey and how the agency uses the collected data to monitor antibiotic  use. To evaluate HHS\u2019s efforts to monitor antibiotic use, we compared  HHS\u2019s data collection and monitoring activities with broad guidelines for  monitoring antibiotic use, which we identified by reviewing relevant HHS  documents and expert organization (e.g., World Health Organization)  guidelines.

We also reviewed relevant federal laws  under which EPA may have responsibility to regulate disposal of certain  antibiotics and to monitor certain antibiotics in drinking water, as well as  a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consumer guidance document  describing recommended disposal practices for unused drugs. We  interviewed officials from the Pharmaceutical Research and  Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to learn about the drug disposal  practices that are commonly used by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Antibiotics work by killing or slowing the growth of bacteria and they are  not effective against nonbacterial infections, such as those caused by  viruses. Antibiotic resistance is the result of bacteria changing in ways that  reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of antibiotics to cure infection.  Antibiotic use forces bacteria to either adapt or die in a process known as  \u201cselective pressure.\u201d Selective pressure means that when an antibiotic is  used, some bacteria will be killed by the antibiotic while other bacteria  will survive. Bacteria are able to survive, in part, because they have certain  genetic material that allows them to avoid the effects of the antibiotic. The  surviving bacteria will multiply and pass on to future generations their  genetic material that is coded for resistance to antibiotics. Any use of  antibiotics\u2014appropriate and inappropriate\u2014creates selective pressure  among bacteria.

For the purposes of this report, the disposal of antibiotics refers  to the discard of unused antibiotics by consumers, companies, and others.  Common disposal methods for individual consumers include throwing  unused antibiotics in the trash, flushing them down the toilet, and pouring  them down the drain. According to EPA officials, healthcare facilities and  pharmacies often return unused or expired drugs to contracted  companies, known as reverse distributors, for manufacturer credit. The  reverse distributor is then instructed by the manufacturer to return the  unused drug to the manufacturer, or in most cases, the reverse distributor  is instructed to dispose of the drugs. The unused drugs are then most  likely incinerated as solid waste, subject to state and local environmental  regulations. The federal guidelines on how consumers should properly  dispose of their unused drugs, including antibiotics, recommend that  consumers dispose of their unused drugs either by returning them through  a drug take-back program, where available, or by mixing them with coffee  grounds or kitty litter and throwing them in the household trash.", "Unused antibiotics intended for human use may enter the environment  through various pathways such as sewage systems and landfills, depending  upon the method of disposal and other factors. Unused antibiotics enter  sewage systems after they are flushed down the toilet or poured down the  drain. Unused antibiotics that enter the sewage system then flow to  wastewater treatment plants where, if not removed during the treatment  process, they are released into the environment, such as in rivers and  streams, as wastewater effluent. In addition, some areas may use onsite  septic systems to treat wastewater and in these systems wastewater is  discharged below the ground\u2019s surface. Unused antibiotics that are  disposed of in the trash could enter the environment if landfills were to  leak. Although modern landfills are designed with liners and systems to  limit this process by rerouting leachate, that is, liquid generated in  landfills, to wastewater treatment plants, the antibiotics that are contained  in the leachate may ultimately enter the environment. This can occur if  antibiotics are not removed during the wastewater treatment process. In  general, wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove low  concentrations of drug contaminants, such as antibiotics.", "In addition, antibiotics that have been used by humans to treat infections  can also enter the environment. Most used antibiotics enter the sewage  systems after they are ingested and excreted by individuals because  antibiotics are not fully absorbed by the human body. Like unused  antibiotics that enter the sewage systems, used antibiotics flow from  sewage systems to wastewater treatment plants and may be released into  the environment as wastewater effluent or biosolids.

While the module will allow  facilities in NHSN to monitor their own antibiotic use, the data will not  provide the agency with information about the prevalence of inpatient  antibiotic use because NHSN is not based on a nationally representative  sample of facilities.", "To improve CDC\u2019s monitoring of antibiotic use in outpatient settings, CDC  officials told us that they are finalizing a contract with a private data  vendor to obtain 5 years of national data on antibiotic prescribing in  outpatient settings by antibiotic drug, county, and type of provider.  According to CDC officials, these data will help the agency understand  relationships between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in certain  geographic areas. CDC officials further stated that these data would help  guide the agency\u2019s prevention efforts. With preliminary data on outpatient  prescriptions for the antibiotic subclass of fluoroquinolones, CDC has  shown wide variation in prescribing across states. Further, CDC plans to  increase the size of the NAMCS sample at least fourfold in 2012, which  would allow CDC to produce antibiotic prescribing rates for some states  that year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC\u2019s Get Smart Program Promotes Appropriate Antibiotic Use to Providers and Patients", "paragraphs": ["CDC\u2019s Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work (Get Smart) program  promotes appropriate antibiotic use, which is aimed specifically at  healthcare providers, patients, and parents of young children. CDC  launched its Get Smart program in 1995 with the overall goal of reducing  the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance. The program is primarily  focused on upper respiratory infections because, according to CDC, such  infections account for over half of all antibiotics prescribed by office- based physicians. The Get Smart program works with partners, such as  certain health insurance companies, to develop and distribute educational  materials. With the goal of educating healthcare providers and the public,  the Get Smart educational materials are aimed directly at these  populations. For example, the Get Smart program supported the  development of an online training program for healthcare providers to  improve their knowledge and diagnosing of middle ear disease. The Get  Smart program developed and launched a national media campaign in  2003, in partnership with FDA, to provide a coordinated message on  appropriate antibiotic use to the public and this message has been  disseminated through print, television, radio, and other media. For  example, CDC developed a podcast for parents of young children,  available on CDC\u2019s Web site, to communicate its message. In the podcast,  a pharmacist counsels a frustrated mother about appropriate antibiotic  use and symptomatic relief options for her son\u2019s cold. Some materials are  aimed at healthcare providers with the goal of educating their patients; for  example, the Get Smart program developed a prescription pad for  symptoms of viral infections. Healthcare providers can use the  communication tool to acknowledge patient discomfort and recommend  strategies to their patients for the relief of symptoms associated with viral  illnesses\u2014without prescribing an antibiotic unnecessarily. The  prescription sheet includes the Get Smart logo and provides information  for patients about the appropriate use of antibiotics to treat bacterial  infections.", "CDC has continued to update and expand its materials for the Get Smart  program. For example, CDC officials stated that the agency has expanded  its educational materials by partnering with Wake Forest University to  develop a curriculum for medical students related to appropriate antibiotic  prescribing, and the impact of antibiotic use and its inappropriate use on  antibiotic resistance, and the agency has developed a continuing education  course for pharmacists. CDC officials told us that pharmacists serve as  one of the most important health care professionals in promoting  appropriate antibiotic use, for example by educating patients about the  importance of taking antibiotics exactly as directed. In November 2010,  CDC launched another Get Smart program, called Get Smart for  Healthcare.

For  example, using NAMCS and NHAMCS data, CDC found about a 26 percent  decline in the number of courses of antibiotics prescribed per 100 children  younger than 5 years old for ear infections between 1996-1997 and 2006.  Further, CDC reported about a 53 percent decrease in the antibiotic  prescription rate for the common cold among all persons between 1996- 1997 and 2006. A similar trend in antibiotic prescribing among children  has also been observed with data from the National Committee for Quality  Assurance (NCQA). NCQA monitors trends in antibiotic prescribing for  the purpose of comparing the performance of healthcare plans. NCQA  monitors the percentage of children 3 months to 18 years of age who were  diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection and did not receive an  antibiotic prescription within 3 days of the office visit, and this measure  has shown improvement (i.e., percentage increases in appropriate  treatment) between 2003 and 2008.", "The measures that CDC uses to evaluate the effectiveness of the Get Smart  program do not necessarily reflect the effect of the program because they  do not capture information about individuals who were exposed to the Get  Smart program, compared to those who were not. As a result, it is unclear  if the declines in the inappropriate antibiotic prescribing were due to  exposure to Get Smart messages and educational materials or from other  factors, such as efforts to measure healthcare performance with antibiotic  prescribing indicators (e.g., NCQA measures) or the recommended use of  influenza vaccines among young children, since 2004. CDC officials told  us that they believe the NCQA measures have helped to improve  appropriate antibiotic prescribing by improving knowledge of treatment  guidelines by physicians and practitioners. In addition, reducing the  number of cases of influenza among children is likely to have contributed  to declines in inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions because antibiotics  are often prescribed in patients with influenza symptoms. The measures  that CDC uses to evaluate the effectiveness of the Get Smart program also  do not allow CDC to determine, for example, whether declines in  inappropriate antibiotic prescribing are attributable to a decrease in  demand for antibiotics by patients, or to improved adherence to  appropriate prescribing guidelines by healthcare providers. The measures  are further limited because they do not allow CDC to determine whether  the observed declines are consistent across the United States or are due to  decreases in certain geographic areas.", "CDC officials told us that they rely on other indicators to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the Get Smart Program, such as interest in CDC\u2019s Get  Smart Web site and media materials. According to these officials, studies  examining the impact of educational materials, including Get Smart  materials, further demonstrate the effectiveness of the Get Smart program.  For example, CDC officials cited a study in Massachusetts where  educational materials, including Get Smart materials, were distributed to  physicians and their patients in several communities. Findings indicate  that in communities where educational and promotional materials about  appropriate antibiotic use\u2014including Get Smart materials\u2014were  distributed, antibiotic prescribing rates for children declined. Declines  were also observed in communities where these educational and  promotional materials were not distributed. These findings indicate that  factors other than educational and promotional materials focused on the  appropriate use of antibiotics may also have led to declines in  inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.

NIH-funded studies focus on establishing appropriate antibiotic treatment  courses, using off-patent antibiotics to treat infections, and developing  rapid diagnostic tests to help healthcare providers choose an appropriate  antibiotic for treatment. For example, in 2009, NIH began funding a  clinical trial to determine whether the standard 2-week antibiotic  treatment course for children with urinary tract infections can remain  effective if shortened, thereby decreasing the likelihood of antibiotic  resistance and preserving the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. In  2007, NIH awarded two 5-year contracts to study whether off-patent  antibiotics such as clindamycin and a combination of the drugs  trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole can be used to treat certain skin  infections instead of the more recently developed antibiotics, such as  Linezolid and Vancomycin, in order to preserve the newer drugs\u2019  effectiveness. Further, since 2002, NIH has supported the development of  a new test to rapidly diagnose TB. It currently takes up to 3 months to  accurately diagnose TB and to determine its resistance to antibiotics,  according to NIH officials. Findings from a recent clinical trial study  reported that, within 2 hours, the new test can diagnose a TB infection and  determine if it is resistant to the antibiotic rifampin, which is commonly  used to treat TB. NIH officials stated that the test is being recommended  by the World Health Organization for the early diagnosis of TB and NIH is  currently supporting research to improve the test and expand its  capabilities.", "Research on the development of vaccines for bacterial and viral infections  is also part of NIH\u2019s research agenda to decrease the inappropriate use of  antibiotics, according to an NIH official. An NIH official stated that the  agency has funded the discovery and development of several  staphylococcal vaccine candidates, for example, through investigator- initiated grants. In addition, an NIH official told us that NIH conducted  preclinical animal studies that provided data for the development of a  multivalent staphylococcal vaccine candidate, which allowed the  candidate to advance to clinical testing. NIH also supports the  development of vaccines for viral infections. According to an NIH official,  decreasing the occurrence of influenza infections with influenza vaccines  may decrease the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Many healthcare  providers inappropriately treat viral respiratory infections with antibiotics,  so preventing influenza reduces the opportunities for unnecessary  antibiotic treatment.", "FDA activities also complement CDC\u2019s efforts to promote the appropriate  use of antibiotics in humans. According to an FDA official, the agency  collaborated with CDC on certain Get Smart activities, such as developing  an appropriate antibiotic use message for the national media campaign,  and amended its drug labeling regulations in 2003 to require that all oral or  intravenous antibiotics for human use include additional information on   their appropriate use. FDA\u2019s labeling requirement is intended to  encourage physicians to prescribe antibiotics only when clinically  necessary and to encourage them to counsel their patients about the  proper use of such drugs and the importance of taking them exactly as  directed.

EPA generally requires public water systems to  monitor certain contaminants for which there are national primary  drinking water regulations\u2014standards limiting the concentration of a  contaminant or requiring certain treatment. EPA has not promulgated any  drinking water regulation for an antibiotic. EPA is required to identify and  publish a list every 5 years of unregulated contaminants that may require  regulation, known as the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL). EPA  generally uses this list to select contaminants for its periodic regulatory  determinations, by which the agency decides whether to regulate a  contaminant, but contaminants may remain on the CCL for many years  before EPA makes such a decision. Erythromycin is the only antibiotic  on the third CCL list (CCL 3)\u2014the current CCL that was published in  October 2009.

(See table 5.) These studies  were generally designed to determine whether certain contaminants,  including antibiotics, were entering the environment and as a result, some  study sites were selected based on being susceptible to contamination.  For example, the study examining the presence of antibiotics, and other  contaminants, in streams in 30 states was designed to determine whether  these contaminants were entering the environment. Therefore, USGS  purposely selected study sites susceptible to contamination by humans,  industry, and agricultural wastewater.", "In all five studies antibiotics were found to be present. For example,  erythromycin was detected in multiple samples tested in four studies and  ciprofloxacin was detected in three studies. According to EPA and USGS  officials, the antibiotic concentrations detected in streams, groundwater,  and untreated drinking water are low relative to the maximum  recommended therapeutic doses approved by FDA for most antibiotics. In  contrast, antibiotics were found in relatively higher concentrations in  sewage sludge. For example, the maximum concentration level of  ciprofloxacin that was detected in streams or untreated drinking water  sources was .03 micrograms per liter of water. In comparison,  ciprofloxacin was detected in sewage sludge sampled from large publicly  owned treatment plants at concentrations ranging from 74.5 to 47,000  micrograms per kilogram of sewage sludge. The maximum  recommended therapeutic dose for ciprofloxacin is about 13,000  micrograms per kilogram of weight.

The results of this study were  inconclusive as to whether low antibiotic concentration levels, such as  levels measured at or below 1.7 micrograms per liter of water, led to an  increase in the population of resistant bacteria.

Another of these four studies found that chlortetracycline was  associated with an increase in the population of resistant bacteria, but  only at concentration levels over 1000 times higher than those that have  been detected in streams across the United States. According to USGS  officials, scientists generally agree that the population of resistant bacteria  would increase in water if the concentration levels of antibiotics that are  present were to reach the minimum level that is known to induce  antibiotic resistance in a clinical setting. USGS officials further stated  that higher concentrations of antibiotics have been found, for example, in  waters near to pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in countries  outside of the United States.", "Results for the 10 studies examining antibiotic resistance in soil-related  environments, such as soil and sediment, were more mixed, and we  cannot draw comparisons between concentration levels tested in these  studies and those that have been found in such environments across the  United States. Seven of the 10 studies found evidence to support an  association between the presence of antibiotics and an increase in the  population of resistant bacteria due to selective pressure, and the  association existed at all concentration levels studied. No association  existed among the antibiotic concentration levels in the other 3 studies.

Monitoring the use of antibiotics in humans and  preventing their inappropriate use, such as prescribing an antibiotic to  treat a viral infection, is critically important because the use of antibiotics  for any reason contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic  resistance. Establishing patterns of antibiotic use is necessary for  understanding current\u2014and predicting future\u2014patterns of antibiotic  resistance. Monitoring overall antibiotic use in humans, including in  inpatient and outpatient healthcare settings, is also needed to evaluate the  contribution of such use\u2014relative to other causes, such as animal use\u2014to  the overall problem of antibiotic resistance. Such information could help  policymakers set priorities for actions to control the spread of antibiotic  resistance.", "CDC is collecting data on antibiotic use and the occurrence of resistance,  but the agency\u2019s data sources have limited ability to provide accurate  national estimates and do not allow it to assess associations between use  and resistance. CDC does not monitor the use of antibiotics in inpatient  settings\u2014where antibiotic use is often intensive and prolonged and thus,  the risk of antibiotic resistance is greater\u2014although the agency believes  such information would help it target and evaluate its own prevention  efforts to reduce the occurrence of resistance. Although the agency  collects annual data in the United States about the use of antibiotics in  outpatient settings, the data do not allow CDC to assess geographic  patterns of use in those settings. Similarly, CDC\u2019s monitoring of antibiotic- resistant infections does not allow the agency to assess the overall  problem of antibiotic resistance because of gaps in the data it collects.  Without more comprehensive information about the occurrence of cases  of antibiotic-resistant infections and the use of antibiotics, the agency\u2019s  ability to understand the overall scope of the public health problem, detect  emerging trends, and plan and implement prevention activities is impeded.  Further, the lack of comprehensive information about antibiotic-resistant  infections and antibiotic use, and the most effective ways to reduce  inappropriate prescribing, impedes CDC\u2019s ability to strategically target its  resources directed at reducing the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant  infections.", "CDC is attempting to address the gaps in its data on antibiotic use in  humans and on antibiotic-resistant infections by obtaining additional data,  but it is not clear whether the steps it is taking will result in more  comprehensive information from which the agency could assess the public  health impact of antibiotic resistance.

Bacteria compete with each other  for resources, such as nutrients, oxygen, and space, and those that do not  compete successfully will not survive. Most bacteria that are present in  humans, such as those found on the skin and in the intestines, are  harmless because of the protective effects of the human immune system,  and a few bacteria are beneficial. However, some bacteria are capable of  causing disease. For example, Escherichia coli O157\u2014which can be found  in the feces of animals, such as cattle, and can transfer to people through  contaminated undercooked meat\u2014produce a toxin that causes severe  stomach and bowel disorders, and death in some cases. In addition, the  same bacteria that may cause disease in one individual may not cause  disease in another. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a  bacterium that is often found in the noses and throats of healthy persons  without causing disease, but it can also cause mild illness, such as sinus  infections, as well as life-threatening infections such as meningitis.  Furthermore, when the immune system is weakened, infection may be  caused by certain bacteria that would not generally result in an infection  in a healthy human.", "Like other living things, as bacteria grow and multiply, they also evolve  and adapt to changes in their surroundings. Bacteria adapt to their  surroundings through selective pressure, which is created by, among other  things, the presence of antibiotics. Selective pressure means that when an  antibiotic is introduced into a bacterial environment, some bacteria will be  killed by the antibiotic while other bacteria will survive. Bacteria are able  to survive because they have certain genetic material that is coded for  resistance\u2014allowing them to avoid the effects of the antibiotic. The  surviving bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics will multiply and quickly  become the dominant bacterial type. Bacteria that are susceptible to the  effects of antibiotics may become resistant to such antibiotics after  acquiring resistant genetic material from bacteria that are resistant  through horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the movement  of genetic material between bacteria, and can occur within a species of  bacteria and can sometimes occur between certain species of bacteria.  Close proximity between bacteria, which allows certain genetic material  to be shared, can facilitate gene transfer.", "The movement of antibiotic-resistant bacteria around the world is  accelerated because of international travel and global trade. Individuals  can contract bacterial strains\u2014that is, distinct types of bacteria\u2014that are  resistant to antibiotics abroad during travel, whether as active infections  or as unaffected carriers, and then spread such strains to others at home.  The bacterial strains in different parts of the world may also contain  different resistance genes than bacterial strains found domestically. For  example, in 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported  that three bacterial strains included a resistance gene identified for the  first time in the United States. The emergence of the resistance gene was  traced to patients who had received recent medical care in India. Further,  international trade of food and livestock may accelerate the movement of  antibiotic-resistant bacteria because food and livestock also carry resistant  bacterial strains that can be contracted by humans through consumption.", "To determine whether bacteria are resistant, tests are performed that  measure the susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to particular antibiotics.  The test results can predict the success or failure of an antibiotic  treatment, and thus, guide healthcare providers\u2019 choice of antibiotics to  treat bacterial infections. The test results include a numeric value, which  is then interpreted according to established ranges.

However, a study that examined  household use of certain antiseptic products did not show an association  between their use and the development of antibiotic resistance.
