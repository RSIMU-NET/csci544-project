We have noted how these problems amount to bad business practices and that aspects of the Medicare program must be modernized in today\u2019s highly competitive health care market. Today, I\u2019d like to summarize these findings and outline several basic steps that would lead to a better managed, less costly health care program. high-utilization areas. Finally, the Congress needs to give HHS the flexibility to make prompt price adjustments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is the nation\u2019s largest single payer for health care. In 1995, it spent an estimated $177 billion, or 12 percent of the federal budget, on behalf of more than 37 million elderly and disabled people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that, under current program law, program spending will almost double in the next 6 years to an estimated $332 billion by 2002. Approximately 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries obtained services on an unrestricted fee-for-service basis; that is, patients chose their own physicians or other health care providers, with bills sent to the program for payment. This set-up mirrored the nation\u2019s private health insurance indemnity plans, which prevailed until the 1980s.", "Since then, many changes have taken place in the financing and delivery of health care. Large health care purchasers have used leverage on hospitals and other providers to obtain lower prices. Private payers, including large employers, use an aggressive management approach to control health care costs. HCFA is Medicare\u2019s health care buyer. HCFA\u2019s pricing of services and controls over utilization have been carefully prescribed by interrelated statute, regulation, and agency policy.", "HCFA contracts with about 70 companies\u2014such as Blue Cross and Aetna\u2014to handle claims screening and processing and to audit providers. Each of these commercial contractors works with its local medical community to set coverage policies and payment controls in addition to those that have been established nationally by HCFA. As a result, billing problems involving waste, fraud, and abuse are handled, for the most part, at the contractor level. This arrangement was prompted when the program was established in the mid-1960s by concerns that the federal government, which lacked extensive claims processing expertise and experience, would prove incapable of providing service comparable to that of private insurers. means that insurance companies responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of Medicare claims are also, through the medical networks they own, billing the program. At a time when the volume of Medicare claims has exceeded 800 million a year, Medicare is being billed increasingly by entrepreneurial entities rather than by medical professionals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Categories With Fastest Growth Rates Coincide With Those Least Managed in Medicare", "paragraphs": ["Although growth rates for inpatient hospital and physician services have moderated since the 1980s, Medicare spending remains high. Combined spending for these services amounted in 1994 to $120 billion\u2014nearly three-fourths of total Medicare spending. The sheer size of these categories means that each percentage point of growth represents hundreds of millions of dollars.", "Smaller categories of services, however, have displayed much more rapid growth through the 1990s, helping to drive total Medicare spending to double-digit inflation. Home health agency (HHA) and skilled nursing facility (SNF) services each grew at an average annual rate of 28 percent from 1990 through 1996.", "Private insurers and employer purchasers have sought to stem such health cost escalation by shifting from their role as passive payers to become more prudent managers of health care costs. Some 90 percent of health plans\u2014from fee-for-service to managed care\u2014actively manage costs through price competition and negotiation and utilization monitoring techniques. By contrast, Medicare\u2019s reimbursement policies and claims payment activities have not been adapted to the contemporary marketplace and today\u2019s demands for fiscal discipline in public programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SNF and HHA Categories Illustrate Cost Consequences of Unmanaged Health Services", "paragraphs": ["The home health and SNF spending categories, in particular, illustrate the damaging effects of reimbursement policies that fail to incorporate effective pricing and utilization management techniques."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Monitoring of HHA Payments", "paragraphs": ["In the case of home health services, for example, Medicare pays HHAs on the basis of costs but uses few tools to determine whether the costs are reasonable. Also, physicians are not required to see the patients for whom they sign plans of care and are not held accountable if they approve inappropriate levels of service. Medicare does not require HHAs to provide beneficiaries or physicians with information on the home health services billed on their, or their patients\u2019, behalf. The Medicare contractors, moreover, pay 97 percent or more of home health claims without review.Even when reviews are done, Medicare claims processing contractors rarely visit HHAs or beneficiaries to verify the actual and appropriate provision of services. One consequence of such neglect is the escalation of visits per Medicare beneficiary, which rose an average of about 20 percent a year from 1989 to 1994.", "In July 1995 we reported that the largest privately held HHA in the United States, which was being investigated for fraud, obtained 95 percent of its total revenues from Medicare. Current and former employees told us medical records were altered and forged to ensure continued or prolonged home health care visits. Services were provided to patients who were not homebound\u2014for example, one who routinely drove a vehicle to go grocery shopping and one who walked a few blocks alone daily to eat at the local senior citizens\u2019 center. services provided across geographic areas and provider types. For example, in 1993 patients in southeastern states received on average more than twice as many visits as patients in northwestern states. Furthermore, diabetics received an average of about twice as many visits from proprietary HHAs as from voluntary or government-run agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Monitoring of SNF and Ancillary Service Payments", "paragraphs": ["Skilled nursing facilities represent another area in which Medicare\u2019s unguarded reimbursement policies have been exploited. In this setting, a population with extensive health care needs grouped together at a single location offers unscrupulous providers the opportunity for volume billing, and Medicare often does not look for warnings of egregious overutilization or rapid increases in billings. Under Medicare\u2019s provisions for reimbursement, providers can bill Medicare directly, without the SNF or attending physician affirming whether the items were necessary or provided as claimed. In other words, medical equipment suppliers, providers of rehabilitation therapy, and providers of X rays and other diagnostic tests can determine levels of services and bill Medicare with little or no oversight. In addition, Medicare\u2019s automated systems do not capture data in a way that would practically allow them to flag indications of improbably high charges or levels of services at individual facilities. This is in part because the data are not organized to report which beneficiaries are in nursing homes.", "In January of this year we reported that a wide array of provider types\u2014including physicians, optometrists, psychiatrists, laboratories, and medical equipment suppliers\u2014have fraudulently or otherwise inappropriately billed Medicare for services and supplies furnished to nursing facility residents. The wrongdoing has generally focused on billing Medicare for unnecessary or undelivered services, or misrepresenting a service to obtain reimbursement. The investigations we reviewed probed activities in over 40 states, with many providers operating in multiple states. reasonable. This is particularly pertinent to rehabilitation therapy, services that account for 30 percent of SNF costs. Specifically, Medicare places no absolute dollar limits on reimbursements for occupational or speech therapy, and charges for therapy services are not linked through billing codes to the amount of time spent with patients or the treatment provided. In other words, Medicare has no easy way to limit the amount it will pay for occupational or speech therapy or to determine whether a charge is for 15, 30, or 60 minutes of treatment. Absent any benchmarks, and with limited resources available for auditing, it is largely infeasible for Medicare contractors to judge whether therapy providers have overstated their costs.", "Last year we reported that Medicare had been charged as much as $600 for an hour of therapy services. HCFA has acknowledged the problem and recently estimated that implementing salary equivalency guidelines for speech and occupational therapy, in conjunction with adjusting other salary guidelines, could save $1.4 billion over the next 6 years. To date, however, the salary guidelines have not been established. Although occupational therapists in SNFs earn on average $23 per hour, we recently found in one contractor\u2019s files that more than 25 percent of submitted charges for one unit (undefined) of occupational therapy exceeded $195, and some approached $1,500 per unit.", "Under Medicare rules for reimbursing SNFs, the problem of overpaying for rehabilitation therapy services becomes compounded. That is, Medicare pays SNFs a portion of their overhead expenses, based on the percentage of their total Medicare-related business. The higher the Medicare-related payments to rehabilitation agencies (or other outside contractors), the more Medicare business an SNF can claim, and the higher the percentage of its overhead that can be charged to the program. Further, as noted by the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC), SNFs may cite high use of ancillary services, such as therapy, to justify an exemption from routine service cost limits, thereby increasing their payments for routine (bed, board, nursing) services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medicare\u2019s Response to Long-Standing Problems Too Slow to Be Effective", "paragraphs": ["Allowing payment problems to continue unchecked results in billions of dollars of unnecessary spending. HCFA has been aware of the rehabilitation therapy overcharging problem since 1990. In 1993 HCFA began studies to develop averages for therapists\u2019 salaries. Its most recent analysis is expected to be completed some time this summer. Given the usual time involved in the federal notification and publication requirements for changing Medicare prices, salary equivalency guidelines\u2014which are key to Medicare\u2019s determination of reasonable costs\u2014are unlikely to be implemented before the middle of 1997 at the earliest.", "This situation is consistent with HCFA\u2019s past experience of taking years to adjust excessively high payment rates. It took almost 3 years to lower the price of an item it paid up to four times more for than consumers paid at the local drug store. HCFA can adjust prices that are inherently unreasonable, but its authority to do so is very limited and involves a complex set of procedures that take a long time to complete. Because of the time and resources involved, HCFA only occasionally uses this process. In an August 1995 report, we showed that Medicare paid higher than the retail prices for 44 types of surgical dressings. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, however, even the unwieldy inherent reasonableness authority to change these prices was effectively eliminated. Before 1987, individual Medicare contractors had the authority to adjust prices to reflect local market conditions using a publication and notification process that could be completed in less than 90 days. In a letter to a congressional subcommittee, the HHS Inspector General last year characterized as \u201cabsurd\u201d the situation limiting HCFA\u2019s ability to make timely adjustments to payment levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Program Overdue for Change", "paragraphs": ["Because of strict statutory constraints and its own burdensome regulatory and administrative procedures, HCFA is slow to address overpricing and overutilization problems. As we reported to the Congress last September, many of the tools Medicare\u2019s contractors use to manage their commercial insurance plans are not authorized for use in the Medicare program.", "In stark contrast to private payers, HCFA and its contractors generally cannot use such utilization controls as prior approval or case management to coordinate and monitor expensive services and specialist care; encourage the use of \u201cpreferred providers\u201d\u2014those who meet utilization, price, and quality standards; or negotiate with select providers for discounts, promptly change prices to match those available in the market, or competitively bid prices.", "Not surprisingly, Medicare\u2019s ability to emphasize cost efficiency in its dealings with suppliers, physicians, and institutions that habitually provide excessive services is limited, and for certain services Medicare pays higher prices than its private sector counterparts. (See app. I for details on commonly used private sector strategies and their applicability to Medicare. See also chapter 11 of the Physician Payment Review Commission\u2019s (PPRC) 1996 Annual Report to Congress.)", "The recognition that Medicare needs to change its role from largely a claims processor to prudent manager is beginning to take shape in HCFA itself as well as in pending legislation passed by the House of Representatives last month. For example, HCFA has planned, among several new initiatives, a demonstration testing the concept of competitive bidding for certain supplies, such as oxygen, hospital beds, and urological and incontinence products; an improvement on earlier case management experiments by which primary care physicians would, for example, provide comprehensive management for beneficiaries with specific diagnoses, such as diabetes, hypertension, or congestive heart failure, for which Medicare would reimburse them with a bundled, capitated payment as is currently done on a monthly basis for end-stage renal disease patients; and a demonstration in selected locations that allows beneficiaries to join preferred provider organization health plans, which are not currently available under Medicare. program dollars. In particular, HCFA would have the authority to contract directly with companies specializing in utilization review and fraud detection to monitor and adjudicate claims. In essence, HCFA could contract with the companies best suited to perform medical, utilization, and fraud reviews; audit cost reports; revisit payment decisions and recover overpayments; provide education on payment integrity and benefit quality assurance issues; and provide more specific guidance on coverage of medical equipment and supplies. Increased flexibility and an accompanying assured funding stream, such as that proposed in this legislation, would significantly enhance HCFA\u2019s ability to curb overutilization and inappropriate billings.", "Despite these initiatives, however, important tools would still be unavailable to the Medicare program. For example, HCFA uses profiling\u2014that is, statistical analyses\u2014to identify \u201coutlier\u201d providers whose practice patterns differ markedly from those of their peers. While the private sector is free to use profiling results to provide financial rewards or penalties (in the form of exclusion from preferred provider networks), HCFA lacks the authority to do so. In addition, HCFA and its contractors have no viable statutory authority to require prior approval of select procedures. Most important, HCFA does not have the authority needed to promptly correct overpricing problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The problems facing Medicare confront private insurers as well, but they are equipped with a larger and more versatile inventory of health care management strategies than HCFA currently has. These strategies may not be deployable in every aspect, but in general they suggest ways to make Medicare more cost effective. Commercial contractors, which play a key role in administering Medicare, routinely employ management-of-care approaches in their capacity as private insurers. If they applied similar approaches to Medicare, the government might be able to avoid spending substantial sums unnecessarily.", "1. The Congress should enact funding and contractor reform provisions similar to those contained in H.R. 3103. Such reforms would give HCFA the flexibility to hire the private sector expertise necessary to apply the best health cost management practices. 2. HCFA needs to target Medicare\u2019s high-cost, high-utilization areas for running demonstrations to apply such strategies as the use of case management and companies specializing in utilization review. For example, HCFA could identify, as the focus of the demonstrations, geographic areas with particularly high home health or SNF costs per Medicare beneficiary. 3. The Congress should give HHS the flexibility to make prompt adjustments to fee schedules when overpriced services and supplies are identified. For example, Medicare should be able to reduce fee schedule prices for surgical supplies within 90 days, similar to what was customary before OBRA 1987.", "We have included as appendix II a list of GAO recommendations recently made to correct specific Medicare payment problems.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
