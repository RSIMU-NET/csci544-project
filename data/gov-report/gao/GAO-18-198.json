This report examines: (1) trends in mobile wireless outages reported to FCC since 2009 and (2) actions federal agencies and industry have taken since 2013 (after Hurricane Sandy) to improve wireless network resiliency, among other objectives. GAO analyzed wireless outage data from 2009 to 2016 (4 years before and after Hurricane Sandy); reviewed FCC, DHS, and industry documents; and interviewed stakeholders who represented a variety of perspectives, such as industry, public safety, and consumer groups.

During this time, the number of outages substantially increased from 189 to 1,079 outages, with most of the increase occurring from 2009 to 2011. FCC officials said this increase was due in part to growth in wireless customers and wireless infrastructure. Almost all outages attributed to a physical incident were due to an accident, such as damage to a cable due to a digging error (74 percent) or a natural disaster (25 percent). However, outages due to a natural disaster had a longer median duration (ranging from 19 to 36 hours), which was more than twice as long as outages caused by an accident. Power failures and failures in other providers' networks also play a role in wireless outages attributed to physical incidents. For instance, carriers reported that 87 percent of wireless outages attributed to a physical incident were due to a failure in another provider's network on which they rely.", "Since 2013, federal agencies and industry have taken actions to improve the resiliency of wireless networks. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FCC charter federal advisory committees that have examined resiliency issues and potential solutions, such as sharing infrastructure during emergencies. FCC also proposed a rule that would disclose how individual wireless carriers' networks performed during emergency events. In response, an industry coalition announced an initiative\u2014the Wireless Network Resiliency Cooperative Framework\u2014whereby carriers agreed to allow roaming on each other's networks and aggregated statistics to be published on how networks performed during emergency events. This initiative prompted FCC to not adopt its proposed rule. FCC said it would engage with industry about the framework's implementation and use, but FCC has limited formal plans to oversee or spread knowledge of the framework:", "FCC developed a plan to track the completion of initial implementation tasks outlined in the framework, but this plan does not include steps to track or evaluate any outputs or outcomes from the framework.", "FCC and industry documents describe broad goals for the framework, such as advancing information sharing during and after emergency events, but neither FCC nor industry has set any specific measures to help determine whether the framework achieves these broad goals.", "Although some public safety officials and other stakeholders GAO contacted were not aware of the framework, FCC did not have plans to actively communicate information about the framework to these audiences.", "More robust measures and a better plan to monitor the framework would help FCC collect information on the framework and evaluate its effectiveness.

In recent years, major  storms have caused outages in mobile wireless networks, severely  impairing safety communications when they were most needed. For  example, several major hurricanes made landfall in the United States in  August and September 2017, damaging wireless network infrastructure  and causing power outages that led to localized wireless outages. This  included Hurricane Irma\u2014which caused extreme damage in the U.S.  Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Florida, among other states\u2014and  Hurricane Maria that severely affected infrastructure including wireless  networks in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Further, according to the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC), about 70 percent of calls to  911 are made from wireless devices. The private sector owns and  operates the nation\u2019s wireless networks as well as other communication  networks and is primarily responsible for managing and protecting these  assets. However, the federal government plays a role in promoting  wireless network resiliency\u2014that is, the ability to prepare for and adapt to  changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions.  FCC is the federal regulatory agency for communications and its mission  includes promoting the safety of life and property through the use of radio  communications. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is  responsible for coordinating the federal effort to promote the security and  resilience of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, which includes the  communications sector, and also serves as the lead agency for  coordinating and prioritizing security and resiliency activities in the  communications sector. Further, communications networks are especially  important due to the enabling functions they provide across all critical  infrastructure sectors; the loss of communications facilities could have  cascading effects on other critical infrastructures due to  interdependencies among sectors.", "You asked us to review efforts that have been taken since Hurricane  Sandy in late 2012 to improve the resiliency of mobile wireless networks  as well as options that federal agencies could take to enhance wireless  resiliency following natural disasters and other physical incidents. This  report examines: (1) trends in mobile wireless outages attributed to  physical incidents since 2009 as reported to FCC, (2) the actions federal  agencies and industry have taken since 2013 to improve wireless network  resiliency, and (3) options that federal agencies could take to improve  network resiliency and their advantages and disadvantages. This report  focuses on the physical risks facing wireless networks; in other words, the  potential for an unwanted effect from an incident on a network\u2019s  infrastructure such as towers, antennas, and switches. Therefore, we did  not examine cyber risks facing wireless networks.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed data submitted by wireless  carriers to FCC\u2019s Network Outage Reporting System (NORS) on wireless  outages that occurred from 2009 through 2016 (that is, to cover 4 years of  data before and after Hurricane Sandy). In particular, we determined the  total number and causes of wireless outages that were reported as  having occurred during that time period and identified the share of all  wireless outages attributed to a physical incident. We analyzed other  characteristics of wireless outages such as location, duration, and  whether the failure occurred in another company\u2019s network. We took  several steps to assess the reliability of NORS data, such as reviewing  FCC documentation and interviewing agency officials responsible for  collecting and analyzing NORS data, and found the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of describing trends in wireless outages.", "We also reviewed reports and documents from FCC, DHS, and the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); federal advisory  committees and partnership councils that cover wireless network  resiliency; and industry. We interviewed officials from FCC, NIST, and  several DHS component agencies responsible for protecting and securing  the communications infrastructure, as well as representatives from 24  stakeholders, selected to ensure we covered different perspectives.  Stakeholders included five wireless carriers and two owners of other  wireless network infrastructure, seven industry associations, three  consumer groups, five state and local government officials, one  partnership council, and one representative from academia. We selected  wireless carriers and owners of other wireless network infrastructure to  ensure variety in company size and industry role. We selected state  agencies to include states directly affected by two events in 2016\u2014 flooding in Louisiana and Hurricane Matthew\u2014for which industry had  implemented elements of the framework at the time we began our review.

Mobile wireless networks comprise several components  and provide coverage based on dividing a large geographic area into  smaller areas of coverage known as \u201ccells.\u201d Each cell contains a cell  site\u2014a base station equipped with an antenna\u2014to receive and transmit  radio signals to mobile devices within its coverage area. (See fig. 1.) The  cell sites are often located on a tower, rooftop, or other structure to  provide coverage to a wide area. For a mobile device to transmit and  receive signals, it must be within range of a cell site antenna. In many  areas, a mobile device is able to transmit and receive signals from  multiple cell sites. Each cell site is linked to a base station controller that  manages communications between the cell site and the mobile switching  center (e.g., routes and hands over calls). The mobile switching center  then directs voice and data traffic to landline phones, other cell phones  via a carrier\u2019s network, or the Internet. Backhaul facilities provide  transport for this voice and data traffic, and backhaul can be provided  over fiber optic or copper cables or wirelessly via microwave facilities.", "According to FCC, there are four \u201cnationwide\u201d mobile wireless carriers\u2014 AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint\u2014with networks that cover most of  the United States. The industry also includes dozens of other carriers,  many of which provide service in a specific, sometimes rural, geographic  area. According to an FCC report on the wireless industry, most  consumers in the United States have the ability to choose among multiple  carriers with wireless network coverage in their area, and wireless  carriers typically compete on price, network quality, and the availability of  mobile devices with innovative features. Federal law states that FCC  must take into account whether its actions will encourage competition in  mobile wireless networks. Some wireless carriers own a portion or all of  the structures that host cell sites, but wireless carriers mostly lease space  from independent companies that own or operate a majority of the towers  and other structures that host cell sites.", "Mobile wireless networks face several kinds of risks that could affect the  network\u2019s physical components, resulting in disrupted service or an  outage. Government reports generally identify three types of physical  risks facing wireless networks:", "Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, and  earthquakes.", "Manmade events, such as terrorist attacks and damage associated  with theft or another malicious act.", "Accidents, such as cable damage due to digging or locating errors  and damage associated with a vehicle accident.", "The potential effects related to these physical risks include damage to  wireless network components that requires wireless carriers and other  providers to make repairs or replace equipment to restore service. For  example, flooding, which can occur with a hurricane or heavy rain, could  damage the cable or other equipment submerged in water. Wildfires can  damage network components like antennas and backhaul facilities  (including fiber optic and copper lines and microwave towers) as well as  equipment in buildings if the buildings are damaged or destroyed.", "In addition to physical risks, wireless networks face risks stemming from  their dependence on other sectors and providers. One key dependency  identified by several government and industry reports is the reliance on  commercially provided electricity, referred to in this report as commercial  power. Several components\u2014including the mobile switching center,  antennas at cell sites, and consumer devices\u2014may rely on commercial  power. Therefore, loss of electric power may result in a loss of wireless  communications. Another key dependency for wireless networks is  backhaul used to get data from an end user to a major network. Wireless carriers can provide backhaul but typically obtain it from another  communications provider, such as a local telephone company or cable  company. An outage in the backhaul network can cause an outage that  affects one or more cell sites or a portion of the wireless network. FCC  has reported that the loss of backhaul service is a major cause of a cell  site\u2019s unavailability, which can lead to wireless outages. Also important is  having clear roads and highways, as wireless carriers\u2019 personnel or  contractors need to be able to access cell sites to repair or replace  equipment, or deliver fuel for generators that are sometimes located at  cell sites.", "Resilience is the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions  and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions, according to  Presidential Policy Directive 21. Owners and operators of wireless  networks can take a variety of actions to manage different risks, including  various physical risks, according to the Communications Sector-Specific  Plan. These actions can be designed to achieve different aims,  including to prepare for incidents, like creating and exercising disaster recovery  reduce a specific vulnerability, like elevating or moving a mobile  switching center in a flood-prone area to a higher location; mitigate the consequences of an incident, like installing backup  power\u2014using batteries with a limited supply of power or generators  that run on diesel or other fuel sources\u2014to support continued wireless  service during a commercial power outage; or enable efficient response and restoration following an incident, such  as deploying portable cell sites on trucks and other equipment after an  incident to provide wireless communications when the network  experiences an outage or a significant disruption.", "FCC, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, is  charged with regulating interstate and international communications  throughout the United States, which means that FCC regulates wireless  networks and carriers, among other responsibilities. It develops and  administers policies and rules to advance the security and reliability of the  nation\u2019s communications infrastructure; this responsibility includes,  among other topics, network resiliency, public safety communications,  and communications infrastructure protection. FCC administers two  web-based outage-reporting systems to help it oversee network reliability  and resiliency:", "NORS: Carriers are required to report details about service  disruptions or outages (e.g., cause, location, and duration) to their  communications systems that meet specified thresholds set forth in  regulation. FCC uses NORS data to monitor trends in  communications outages and to try to identify and address any  shortcomings or issues going forward.", "Disaster Information Reporting System (DIRS): Carriers can  voluntarily report on the status of communications infrastructure  during an emergency event in DIRS. For example, wireless carriers  report daily on the number of cell sites, by county, that are out of  service by reason (e.g., power outage, physical damage). FCC  activates DIRS in response to an event and then uses these data to  track network restoration during and after an emergency event.", "DHS also plays a role in wireless network resiliency as the lead agency  for coordinating and prioritizing security and resilience activities for the  communications sector. Presidential Policy Directive 21 establishes  national policy to strengthen the security and resilience of critical  infrastructure and states that the federal government shall work with  critical infrastructure owners and operators to do so. DHS\u2019s Office of  Cybersecurity and Communications, within the National Protection and  Programs Directorate, leads this coordination for the communications  sector as the sector-specific agency, and this office works with the  Communications Sector Coordinating Council and the Communications  Government Coordinating Council to set goals, objectives, and activities  for the sector. During a national emergency or disaster, DHS also  coordinates response efforts for communications systems in its role as  the coordinator for Emergency Support Function #2 \u2013 Communications  (ESF-2). Specifically, two DHS components\u2014the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) and Office of Cybersecurity and  Communications\u2014lead the federal government\u2019s work to support the  restoration of communications infrastructure, coordinate response efforts,  and facilitate the delivery of information to emergency-management  decision makers. DHS has direct access to FCC\u2019s NORS and DIRS  data to support its work. Other DHS components also have  responsibilities related to wireless network resiliency. For example, the  Science & Technology Directorate conducts research in the area of  wireless and other communications network resiliency, although its focus  is on communications for the public-safety community.", "Within the Department of Commerce, NIST also plays a role in promoting  network resiliency by sponsoring the Community Resilience Panel.  According to NIST, the Community Resilience Panel is sponsored by  NIST and co-sponsored by other federal agencies to promote  collaboration among stakeholders to strengthen the resiliency of  infrastructure that communities rely on, including communications  infrastructure.

The number of outages  increased substantially during the first few years of this period and then  was relatively stable, which mirrored the trend for all wireless outages.  According to FCC officials, the increase in reported outages was due to  increases in both the number of wireless customers and wireless  infrastructure over this period, as well as due to FCC\u2019s outreach to  wireless companies to clarify the thresholds for which carriers are  required to report wireless outages to help ensure that carriers were  consistently and fully reporting outages.

For example, when FCC activated DIRS reporting for all  counties in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in response to  Hurricane Maria in September 2017, FCC suspended NORS reporting  requirements for those counties. As a result, FCC officials said that  NORS data can undercount the number of wireless outages due to  natural disasters. For a large natural disaster, however, FCC still can  receive NORS reports for wireless outages outside the DIRS reporting  area that are due to the natural disaster.", "Hurricane Irma   In September 2017, Hurricane Irma made  landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in Florida,  having previously tracked near Puerto Rico  and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The hurricane  produced sustained winds of nearly 115 miles  per hour as it made landfall in Florida. In the  days that followed, the hurricane\u2019s impact was  felt over the southeastern United States, with  nearly 16 inches of rain falling over portions of  Florida and high winds observed in five states.  The President issued disaster declarations  covering portions of Puerto Rico, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, Florida, and Georgia.   The damage from Hurricane Irma\u2014both  damage to wireless network infrastructure and  damage resulting in power outages\u2014created  wireless service disruptions and outages in  certain impacted areas. In particular, over half  of cell sites were out of service for 3 or more  consecutive days in five counties in Puerto  Rico and in two counties in the U.S. Virgin  Islands, according to data from wireless  carriers reported to FCC. Within a week, only  6 percent of cell sites were out of service in  reporting counties in Puerto Rico, but a  majority of cell sites remained non-operational  in the U.S. Virgin Islands; in one county, St.  John, 90 percent of cell sites remained out of  service a week and a half after landfall. In  southern Florida, three counties had more  than half of cell sites out of service for 4  straight days. The number of out-of-service  cell sites decreased over time, so that less  than 20 percent of cell sites were out of  service in these counties within a week.  Looking more broadly across all counties for  which FCC collected data in Florida, Georgia,  and Alabama, about 13 percent, 2 percent,  and 1 percent of cell sites in the reporting  area were out of service 4 days after  Hurricane Irma\u2019s landfall, respectively. cause and contributing factor fields. Looking across cause fields,  wireless outages citing an accident were most common, particularly from  2010 to 2016, as shown in figure 3. Wireless outages citing a natural  disaster were less common, although there were several spikes in the  number of outages citing a natural disaster.

From 2009 to 2016, the  annual median duration of wireless outages attributed to accidents  ranged from 8 hours to 16 hours, compared to natural disasters, which  ranged from 19 to 36 hours. Due to this longer duration, wireless  outages attributed to natural disasters have a greater impact on the public  as it is left without key means of communication for longer periods of time.

These weekly calls sustain  relationships and promote readiness that can be leveraged to  coordinate a response to an emergency incident, according to DHS  and FCC officials and members of the Communications Sector  Coordinating Council. During an incident, NCC reports that it holds  these calls on a daily basis to understand the status of wireless and  other networks\u2014along with FCC outage data and other information  collected from carriers\u2014and to support industry response efforts.

While  communities have started to use the guide, NIST officials said it is too  soon to measure or point to specific outcomes attributable to the  Community Resilience Panel\u2019s work.", "Post Hurricane Sandy hearings and proposed rule: In 2013, FCC held  field hearings on network reliability and continuity. The goals of the  hearings were to improve network resiliency, improve restoration,  empower the public, and unleash technological solutions. The two  hearings included a wide range of panelists including representatives  from FCC and FEMA, state and local agencies, consumer groups,  wireless carriers, and other communications providers. Following the  hearings, FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to promote  transparency to the public on how wireless carriers compare in  keeping their networks operational during emergency events.  Specifically, FCC\u2019s proposed rule would publicly report the number  and percentage of each carrier\u2019s cell sites that remained operational  during an emergency event to enable consumers to compare wireless  carriers when purchasing service. Based on our review of  comments, public safety and consumer groups tended to support the  proposed rule while industry expressed concerns, in particular, that  the public reporting in the proposed rule would not accurately portray  the service available during an emergency or be a useful measure to  help consumers choose among wireless carriers. FCC decided not to  issue a final rule, stating in December 2016 that a voluntary industry  approach, described below, provided a more appropriate path to  improve network resiliency.", "We asked stakeholders about the results of the actions taken by FCC and  DHS, and across the 24 stakeholders we interviewed, there was no  consensus regarding needed improvements in DHS and FCC guidance,  coordination, or research on wireless resiliency. Seven stakeholders  said they did not think there were any gaps or needed improvements from  FCC, and six stakeholders said they did not think there were any gaps or  needed improvements from DHS. Although most stakeholders identified a  need for further federal agency action, they tended to identify dissimilar  actions. However, the three state and two local agencies we interviewed  noted that more real-time data on wireless outages would help aid their  efforts to respond to an incident, which we discuss further below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voluntary Industry Framework Aims to Improve Wireless Network Resiliency, but FCC Has Limited Plans to Monitor This Framework", "paragraphs": ["In April 2016, an industry coalition consisting of CTIA, a wireless industry  association, and five wireless carriers announced the Wireless Network  Resiliency Cooperative Framework (framework) in response to FCC\u2019s  2013 notice of proposed rulemaking on wireless network resiliency. The  framework is a voluntary initiative designed to advance wireless service  continuity and information sharing during and after emergencies by  enhancing coordination and communication, both among carriers and  between carriers and government.", "The framework has five elements; some elements are specific to disaster  response while other elements focus on preparedness and education.  Industry has taken steps related to all five elements of the framework, as  described in table 1. Furthermore, CTIA representatives told us they have  ongoing meetings with representatives from the public-safety community,  the outcome of which they expected to be a series of best practices  concerning planning before disasters, addressing coordination during and  after emergencies, and developing education and awareness strategies in  fall 2017. The threshold to trigger the response elements is when DHS  activates ESF-2 and FCC activates DIRS. At the time of our review, four  events\u2014Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 and hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria in late 2017\u2014had met the threshold to trigger the  response elements. Prior to the three events in 2017, FCC officials and  three stakeholders we interviewed told us it was too soon to know the  effectiveness or results of the framework.", "FCC is responsible for administering policies to improve resiliency, which  include monitoring actions taken by industry, and federal standards for  internal control state that management should establish and operate  monitoring activities, evaluate and document the results of ongoing  monitoring, and then identify changes that either have occurred or are  needed. Federal standards for internal control also state that agencies  should define objectives clearly and that objectives should be in specific  and measurable terms that allow for the assessment of performance.", "In December 2016, FCC said it would continue to engage with industry on  the implementation and use of the framework, and FCC has taken some  steps to monitor the framework\u2019s implementation. Specifically, FCC  developed a plan to track certain tasks related to the framework in August  2017. This plan  tracks the completion of initial tasks related to the framework, such as  tracking industry\u2019s publication of best practices to enhance municipal  preparedness and resiliency, and confirming the five signatory  wireless carriers\u2019 commitment to the framework, and notes that FCC will update its emergency response documents to  ensure that the documents reflect the framework and include  checklists to validate that carriers take these actions during  emergency events (e.g. instituting roaming, providing mutual  assistance).", "In August 2017, FCC also issued a public notice inviting carriers beyond  the five signatory wireless carriers to sign on to the framework.", "However, we found FCC\u2019s plan does not include any steps to document  and assess the effect of the framework on the resiliency of wireless  networks. In particular, FCC\u2019s plan does not track any outputs or  outcomes over time that speak to the results of the framework, such as  the number of roaming requests made and fulfilled during an emergency  event. FCC\u2019s plan to monitor the framework is still new. According to  FCC officials, FCC did not decide what division would lead its monitoring  of the framework until August 2017 because it needed to determine which  division should have responsibility for the framework. Since the plan  was created, FCC has met with industry groups and individual carriers to  gather additional information and has updated its plan with this  information to track implementation tasks.", "Overall, by monitoring the outputs and outcomes of the framework, FCC  could determine where further changes are needed to help ensure that  wireless networks are resilient. In 2016, FCC reported that the framework  could produce benefits such as bolstering FCC\u2019s situational awareness  and providing consumers with a means to hold carriers accountable for  service continuity during emergency events. Yet, seven stakeholders we  interviewed, including wireless carriers, said the framework largely  codified actions that carriers already generally take to prepare for and  respond to an emergency event. In addition, comments submitted to FCC  in 2016 were split on whether the framework represented a sufficient path  forward, and some stakeholders noted specific issues that they believed  could limit the effectiveness of the framework, for example:", "Four stakeholders we interviewed\u2014an industry association, local  agency, state agency, and consumer group\u2014cited the lack of federal  agency enforcement or monitoring.", "Two industry associations stated in joint comments that there was no  assurance that all carriers would conduct adequate testing to enable  roaming under disasters.", "A local agency said in comments that the threshold to trigger the  response elements was too high; as such, carriers would not be-  obligated to implement the elements for more local events.", "Therefore, monitoring the outputs and outcomes of the framework would  help FCC understand the effect of industry formalizing these actions in  the framework.", "Furthermore, although FCC and industry documents that describe and  endorse the voluntary framework include broad goal statements, there  are no specific measures for what the framework hopes to achieve. As a  result, FCC lacks specific and measurable terms to monitor the effect of  the framework. The CTIA- and carrier-released public summary of the  framework said it aims to advance wireless service continuity and  information sharing during and after emergencies and disasters, as well  as help consumers be better prepared for future disasters. FCC, when  endorsing the framework, said it was a reasonable approach to achieve  FCC\u2019s stated goals for the 2013 proposed rule, including promoting  availability of wireless mobile services in the event of natural disasters  and increasing provider transparency around wireless resiliency. FCC  officials told us they have not discussed possible measures to monitor the  effect of the framework with industry participants. As the creators of the  framework, industry participants could provide insight into such  measures. However, FCC officials acknowledged that it will be important  to determine what the results of the framework have been in light of the  2017 hurricanes, and that developing measures to assess industry\u2019s  efforts under the framework would be beneficial.", "In addition, FCC has not communicated the framework to all state and  local public-safety officials and wireless carriers, potentially limiting its  effectiveness. At the time of our review, CTIA and the signatory wireless  carriers had released a high-level summary of the framework but no  additional documentation on the scope of wireless carriers\u2019 obligations  under the framework. Based on our interviews, we found that  knowledge of the framework was not widespread. Six stakeholders we  interviewed, including representatives of state agencies we interviewed  and a non-signatory wireless carrier, were either unaware of the  framework or unaware of whether industry had taken actions on any  elements of the framework since its announcement. For example, a state  emergency manager in one state affected by Hurricane Matthew was  unaware of the framework and that FCC, based on one element of the  framework, had posted daily status updates on wireless service following  the hurricane. This manager noted that those updates would be useful for  response efforts.", "Federal standards for internal control state that federal agencies should  externally communicate necessary, quality information to achieve the  agency\u2019s objectives and that open communication can also help enable a  federal agency to obtain information from external parties. Among the stated objectives of FCC is to advise and assist public safety entities on  wireless communications issues and to develop and administer policy  goals and plans to promote reliable communications for public safety and  disaster management. Moreover, one of FCC\u2019s current strategic  objectives is to promote access to effective public-safety communications  services used by government as well as all consumers in need. To  address this and other objectives, FCC stated that it will facilitate  discussions and share information among key constituencies. FCC uses  several mechanisms and standing forums to share information and  educate constituencies. For example, FCC gives presentations about  FCC activities at conferences on public safety communications that  include state and local officials. In addition, FCC participates in the  regular conference calls hosted by DHS\u2019s NCC through which  government and industry exchange information and the Network  Reliability Steering Committee\u2019s public quarterly meetings, as noted  above.", "Without greater awareness of the framework, state and local public safety  officials may continue to be unaware of tools or other improvements  available through the framework that could help them prepare for or  respond to an emergency, such as the posting of daily updates on the  number of out-of-service cell sites or best practices that could aid  resilience. Also, smaller and rural (non-signatory) wireless carriers might  be unaware of commitments made by the signatory carriers, such as  committing to roaming under disasters that could benefit them and the  citizens they serve during an emergency event but may require entering  into and testing a roaming arrangement. By actively communicating  information about the framework, FCC could also increase the likelihood  of receiving information from industry or state and local public-safety  officials about any implementation issues or positive results from the  framework. In August 2017, FCC created a website that summarized the  framework and, as noted above, issued a public notice inviting additional  carriers to sign on to the framework. Only two carriers, as of October  2017, beyond the carriers involved in creating the framework publicly  informed FCC of their intent to participate in the framework. As of October  2017, FCC officials told us they did not have additional plans to promote  awareness of the framework, but noted that it would be important to  inform relevant stakeholder groups about the framework, especially those  who might remain unaware of it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Cited Advantages and Disadvantages for Options Aimed at Improving Wireless Network Resiliency", "paragraphs": ["We identified options that federal agencies could take to further improve  wireless network resiliency based on agency reports, federal advisory  committee recommendations, peer-reviewed literature, and other reports.

In 2007, FCC adopted a requirement for  wireless carriers to provide 8 hours of backup power at cell sites. That  requirement was vacated after the Office of Management and Budget  disapproved the rule\u2019s information collection requirements. In contrast,  nine stakeholders we interviewed were more positive about the feasibility  of guidance. Further, FCC created the Broadband Deployment Advisory  Committee in January 2017 to provide recommendations on how to  accelerate broadband deployment.

For example, by setting performance  standards or requiring wireless carriers to disclose their efforts to improve  resiliency, consumers could compare the performance or practices of  wireless carriers. However, some of these options would require defining  specific parameters, whether a metric or the specific information to  disclose, and seven stakeholders we interviewed noted this could be  difficult given factors such as the variation in carriers\u2019 wireless networks  and the pace of technological change.

Although FCC stated that this voluntary framework would  have many benefits, neither industry nor FCC has identified any specific,  measurable objectives that could be used to determine whether the  framework meets its broad goals, and FCC has limited plans to monitor  the framework\u2019s implementation and use. Absent sufficient monitoring,  including identifying specific, objective measures for the framework, FCC  lacks information on the framework\u2019s outcomes and overall effectiveness;  such information could help FCC identify whether it needs to take steps to  address challenges or take other action to further promote wireless  network resiliency. Furthermore, FCC does not have any plans to actively  communicate information about the framework to public safety officials  and industry representatives.

We chose this timeframe to cover  4 years of data before and after Hurricane Sandy. Communications  providers, including wireless carriers, are required in regulation to submit  outage reports in NORS for network service disruptions that reach certain  thresholds. Given our focus on wireless outages, we examined reports in  NORS for outages (1) that were reported by wireless companies that  identified themselves as either a wireless carrier or Voice over Internet  Protocol (VoIP) provider and (2) that were cited, as the reason the  outage was reportable, a reporting requirement applicable to a wireless  carrier or VoIP provider in 47 C.F.R.

FCC provides carriers a list of categories from  which they select a root cause, direct cause, and contributing factor(s) for  an outage. Using these FCC categories, we created three new categories  for natural disasters, accidents, and manmade events (see table 6). We  based these three new categories on the description and categorization  of physical risks in FCC and DHS reports, including the Communications  Sector-Specific Plan.", "To understand the distribution of causes across all wireless outages in  our time frame, we focused primarily on the root cause for each wireless  outage. However, we also examined the root and direct cause reported  for each outage to better understand the multiple factors that may have  led to an outage and to understand wireless network dependencies (e.g.,  power, backhaul). Finally, we examined the number of outages, by month  and by year, for which a wireless carrier reported a physical event as the  root cause, direct cause, or contributing factor to better understand the  total number of outages related to a physical incident during our time  period.", "We also analyzed other characteristics of wireless outages such as  location, duration, and whether the failure occurred in another company\u2019s  network. To examine location, we focused on three NORS fields\u2014city,  state, and description of location\u2014to identify a city(ies) and state for each  outage, and then we determined the latitude and longitude for each  outage. We also examined NORS data in conjunction with two other data  sets. First, data on events for which FCC activated its Disaster  Information Reporting System (DIRS) or \u201cDIRS-lite\u201d to understand any  correlation between wireless outages and major physical incidents.  Second, data from CTIA\u2019s annual wireless survey on the number of  wireless subscribers and other measures of wireless networks\u2019 size to  understand any correlation between wireless outages and the size of the  wireless industry.", "To assess the reliability of NORS data, we reviewed FCC\u2019s data glossary  and other FCC documentation on the NORS data system and data  elements.
