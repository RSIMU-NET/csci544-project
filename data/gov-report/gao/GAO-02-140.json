This report addresses the first  three questions listed above, as they pertain to the Olympic and Paralympic  Games held in the United States.  Specifically, this report identifies the  reported total direct cost of planning and staging the Winter Olympic  Games held in 1980 at Lake Placid, NY; the Winter Olympic Games and  Paralympic Games planned for 2002 at Salt Lake City, UT; the Summer  Olympic Games held in 1984 at Los Angeles, CA; and the Summer Olympic  Games and Paralympic Games held in 1996 at Atlanta, GA. This report also  identifies, to the maximum extent possible, total direct government funding  and support at the local, state, and federal levels in the United States for  each of these games.  Additionally, this report focuses on how the direct  federal funding and support were used, and it identifies all of the reported  federally sponsored projects and activities for each of the Games.

In addition, the federal government provided about $179 million (50  percent) in funding and support.  According to the Department of  Commerce report, of the $179 million in federal funding and support,  Congress specifically designated about $96 million for Olympic-related  projects, and the remaining approximately $83 million was approved and  provided through the normal funding procedures of the departments of  Defense, Transportation, Commerce, Energy, the Interior, and Justice.

Specifically, the federal government helped finance the ski jumps, speed  skating oval, skating arena, winter sports arena, luge run, parking facilities,  dressing rooms, and storage facilities.  The federal government also  provided housing and infrastructure support projects for the athletes,  trainers, and coaches, such as the temporary and permanent buildings  erected on a 55-acre site near Lake Placid used to house the athletes  participating in the Games. These facilities were also used for security  operations.  The remaining direct federal funding and support were used  for safety- and security\u2013related activities, which accounted for about $23  million (13 percent); transportation projects, such as highway, airport, and  railway improvements, which accounted for about $16 million (9 percent);  and staging-and-operations activities during the Olympic events, which  accounted for about $13 million (7 percent).

The Department of Transportation  plans to spend this amount in part to provide a temporary spectator  transportation system.  This system will consist of Salt Lake City transit  buses and drivers and borrowed transit buses and drivers from other cities  across the United States, bus maintenance, construction and operation of  park-and-ride lots, and loading and unloading facilities.  In addition, the  Department of Transportation is planning to provide an additional $25  million, of the total $27 million allocated for venue construction, to support  the building and construction of access roads to certain venues for the  Games.

According to this official, Los Angeles  voters passed a charter amendment in November 1978 prohibiting any  capital expenditure by the city on the Olympic Games that would not, by  binding commitment, be reimbursed. As noted in our September 2000  report, Los Angeles city officials believed that the host cities for Olympic  Games held before 1984 often overextended themselves by trying to  complete state-of-the-art Olympic venues and related capital improvement  projects.  Such actions, in their view, pushed those host cities into debt that  remained long after the Games.  As a result, city officials decided that they  (1) would not undertake any new construction or capital improvements  specifically for the Olympic Games and (2) would encourage spectators to  use the transit or bus systems in place at the time or simply to drive their  cars to the events.", "Figure 5 also shows that the approximately $78 million in federal funding  and support represented about 11 percent of the total cost for projects and  activities related to the Games.

Similar to previous Olympic Games, ensuring adequate safety and security  was a primary concern of federal officials at the Games in Atlanta.

About $68  million (36 percent) of the $193 million in federal expenditures was used  for venue construction and staging operations during the Olympic events.   For example, approximately $18 million was used to construct the  Whitewater Rapids Venue, and approximately $5 million was used for the  pre-trial and Olympic Whitewater Rapids events operations during the  Games.
