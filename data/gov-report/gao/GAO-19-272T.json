For example, the schedule did not contain a work  breakdown structure that defines the work, activities, and resources  necessary to accomplish implementation. Moreover, half of all the  remaining activities are missing logic that shows which activities must  finish prior to the start of other activities. In addition, the schedule  contains an invalid critical path, meaning that the schedule does not  present the amount of time that key activities could be delayed before  such delays affect VA\u2019s estimated implementation date.

In  addition, there were activities with duplicate names, which could make  communication difficult between VA teams, particularly between team  members who are responsible for updating and integrating multiple  schedules.", "VA\u2019s project schedule minimally meets the best practice of  sequencing activities. There are issues with missing dependencies,  dangling activities, summary links, constraints and lags that affect the  schedule meeting this best practice. Specifically, of the remaining  activities, 55 percent have missing logic, over 12 percent are  dangling, 42 percent have date constraints and 4 percent have leads  assigned. When activities are not correctly linked, the program cannot  use the integrated master schedule (IMS) to identify disconnects or  hidden opportunities and cannot otherwise promote efficiency and  accuracy or control the program by comparing actual to planned  progress. When this happens, the schedule will not allow a sufficient  understanding of the program as a whole, and users of the schedule  may lack confidence in the dates and the critical path.", "VA\u2019s project schedule minimally meets the best practice of  assigning resources. While the schedule contains \u2018Task Owner\u2019  assignments, the Task Owner information has no effect on the  durations or forecasted start and finish dates of detailed activities.  Information on resource needs and availability in each work period  assists the program office in forecasting the likelihood that activities  will be completed as scheduled. If the current schedule does not allow  insight into the current or projected allocation of resources, then the  risk of the program\u2019s slipping is significantly increased.", "VA\u2019s project schedule minimally meets the best practice of  verifying the schedule is traceable horizontally and vertically.

We were unable to determine the relationship between  lower-lever activities in the project schedule and higher-level activities  and milestones in the management briefs provided to us. Specifically,  we could not map the activities in the briefs to activities in the  schedule. This inconsistency also prevented the verification of dates  between the project schedule and higher-level management  documents, even with documents that were provided from the same  month as the October schedule.", "Products and outcomes were not easily traced through the  sequencing of effort in the project schedule. In both cases the  schedule did not respond appropriately to \u201cshocks\u201d; that is, greatly  increasing the durations of some activities to increase the overall time  required to complete the project did not affect the dates of key  milestones. The duration increase of each activity did not affect the  overall time line because the activity in question had a constraint that  would not allow the project to appropriately extend.", "VA\u2019s project schedule minimally meets the best practice of  updating the schedule using progress and logic. Date anomalies,  such as planned dates in the past or actual dates in the future, were  found. The schedule was not current as of the date delivered to GAO.  While officials report that they update the schedule regularly, a  schedule narrative document does not accompany the schedule  update that would detail changes to the current schedule and describe  information such as the status of key milestone dates, changes in  network logic, and a description of the current critical path(s).", "VA\u2019s project schedule minimally meets the best practice of  maintaining a baseline schedule. Officials said that the baseline  schedule is the basis for performance measurement. But while  baseline start and baseline finish dates were provided in the initial  schedule, its activities were too high level, obfuscating the calculation  of detail variances in subsequent schedules. There is also no  evidence of a schedule basis document, which would include a  general overview of the purpose of the schedule, other key basis  information such as an overview of assumptions, rationale for  durations specific to the CMR schedule, and required software  settings. There is also no evidence of performance measuring.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
