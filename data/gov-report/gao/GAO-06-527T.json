Nevertheless, fiscal year 2005 data reported by 24 major agencies, compared with data reported for the previous 2 fiscal years, show that these agencies have made steady progress in certifying and accrediting systems, although they reported mixed progress in meeting other key statutory information security requirements. For example, agencies reported that only 61 percent of their systems had tested contingency plans, thereby reducing assurance that agencies will be able to recover from the disruption of those systems with untested plans. Federal entities can act to improve the usefulness of the annual FISMA reporting process and to mitigate underlying information security weaknesses. OMB has taken several actions to improve FISMA reporting--such as requiring agencies to provide performance information based on the relative importance or risk of the systems--and can further enhance the reliability and quality of reported information. Agencies also can take actions to fully implement their FISMA-mandated programs and address the weaknesses in their information security controls.

Agencies need to  implement strong user identification and authentication controls.  \u25cf  User access rights and file permissions. The concept of \u201cleast  privileged\u201d is a basic underlying principle for security computer  systems and data. It means that users are only granted those access  rights and file permissions that they need to do their work. Agencies  would benefit from establishing the concept of least privilege as the  basis for all user rights and permissions.  \u25cf  Network services and devices. Sensitive programs and information  are stored on networks, which are collections of interconnected  computer systems and devices that allow users to share resources.  Organizations secure their networks, in part, by installing and  configuring networks devices that permit authorized requests and  limit services that are available. Agencies need to put in place  strong controls that ensure only authorized access to their  networks.  \u25cf  Audit and monitoring of security-related events. To establish  individual accountability, monitor compliance with security policies,  and investigate security violations, it is crucial that agencies  implement system or security software that provides an audit trail  that they can use to determine the source of a transaction, or to  monitor the activities of users on the agencies\u2019 systems. To detect  and prevent unauthorized activity, agencies should have strong  monitoring and auditing capabilities.", "In addition to electronic access controls, other important controls  should be in place to ensure the security and reliability of an  agency\u2019s data.  \u25cf  Software change controls. Counteracting identified weaknesses in  software change controls would help agencies ensure that software  was updated correctly and that changes to computer systems were  properly approved. Software change controls ensure that only  authorized and fully tested software is placed in operation. These  controls -- which also limit and monitor access to powerful  programs and sensitive files associated with computer operations -- are important in providing reasonable assurance that access  controls are not compromised and that the system will not be  impaired. These policies, procedures, and techniques help to ensure  that all programs and program modifications are properly  authorized, tested, and approved. Failure to implement these  controls increases the risk that unauthorized programs or changes  could be -- inadvertently or deliberately -- placed into operation.  \u25cf  Segregation of duties. Agencies have opportunities to implement  effective segregation of duties to address the weaknesses identified  in this area. Segregation of duties refers to the policies, procedures,  and organizational structure that help to ensure that one individual  cannot independently control all key aspects of a process or  computer-related operation and thereby conduct unauthorized  actions or gain unauthorized access to assets or records. Proper  segregation of duties is achieved by dividing responsibilities among  two or more individuals or organizational groups. For example,  agencies need to segregate duties to ensure that individuals cannot  add fictitious users to a system, assign them elevated access  privileges, and perform unauthorized activities without detection.  Without adequate segregation of duties, there is an increased risk  that erroneous or fraudulent transactions can be processed,  improper program changes implemented, and computer resources  damaged or destroyed.  \u25cf  Continuity of operations. The majority of agencies could benefit  from having adequate continuity of operations planning. An  organization must take steps to ensure that it is adequately prepared  to cope with the loss of operational capabilities due to earthquake,  fire, accident, sabotage, or any other disruption. An essential  element in preparing for such catastrophes is an up-to-date, detailed,  and fully tested continuity of operations plan. To ensure that the  plan is complete and fully understood by all key staff, it should be  tested, including surprise tests, and test plans and results  documented to provide a basis for improvement. Among the aspects  of continuity planning that agencies need to address should be: (1)  ensuring that plans contain adequate contact information for  emergency communications; (2) documenting the location of all  vital records for the agencies and methods of updating those  records in an emergency; (3) conducting tests, training, or exercises  frequently enough to have assurance that the plan would work in an  emergency. Losing the capability to process, retrieve, and protect  information that is maintained electronically can significantly affect  an agency\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission.  \u25cf  Physical security. Physical security controls are important for  protecting computer facilities and resources from espionage,  sabotage, damage, and theft. These controls restrict physical access  to computer resources, usually by limiting access to the buildings  and rooms in which the resources are housed. With inadequate  physical security, there is increased risk that unauthorized  individuals could gain access to sensitive computing resources and  data and inadvertently or deliberately misuse or destroy them.", "In summary, through the continued emphasis of information  security by Congress, the administration, agency management, and  the accountability community, the federal government has seen  improvements in its information security. However, despite the  advances shown by increases in key performance measures,  progress remains mixed. If information security is to continue to  improve, agency management must remain committed to the  implementation of FISMA and the information security management  program it mandates. Only through the development of strong IT  security management can the agencies address the persistent, long- standing weaknesses they face in information security controls.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
