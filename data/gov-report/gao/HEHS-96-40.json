Furthermore, most research on training programs has focused on short-term effects\u2014the year or two immediately following completion of training.", "Enacted in 1982, title II of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) has been the cornerstone of federal employment training programs, providing block grants to state and local governments to administer these federally funded programs. JTPA supports job training for individuals facing barriers to employment and needing special training to obtain productive employment. Under recent legislative proposals to consolidate multiple federally funded training programs, states would have the flexibility to design and implement a statewide approach to job training based on the concept of one-stop career centers. As states design and implement their approaches to job training, lessons learned from JTPA can help in reallocating training dollars and in setting performance standards.", "Because of concerns about the long-term impact of job training programs, you asked us to (1) ascertain the long-term earnings of participants in JTPA-sponsored programs and to compare their earnings with those of nonparticipants and (2) calculate the long-term employment rates for these JTPA participants and to compare their employment rates with those of nonparticipants. For this study, we defined long-term earnings and employment rates as the annual earnings and employment rates achieved in the fifth year after applying for JTPA training.", "To develop this information, we merged data from the National JTPA Study (NJS) with annual earnings records from the Social Security Administration (SSA). Participants in the NJS were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (allowed to enroll in JTPA training) or the control group (not allowed to enroll in JTPA training for 18 months). We calculated the average earnings and employment rates of four target groups (adult men, adult women, male youths, and female youths) for 5 years after their acceptance into the study. We considered a 5-year period sufficient to provide meaningful data on the long-term effects of JTPA training.", "Because of the NJS\u2019 inherent design problems, we cannot unequivocally use our findings to draw conclusions about JTPA\u2019s effectiveness. For example, the participating areas were neither randomly selected nor necessarily representative of JTPA training nationally. Moreover, not everyone assigned to the treatment group enrolled in or completed JTPA training. Also, many control group members received some training services from other sources. Nevertheless, the NJS had some design advantages, such as random assignment of applicants for JTPA training, that made the data appropriate for our study.", "Appendix I has further information on the NJS and SSA data sets and our statistical results.

In fiscal year 1995, JTPA title II-A and II-C programs received approximately $1.6 billion in funding.", "JTPA training programs annually provide employment training for specific occupations and services, such as job search assistance and remedial education, to roughly one million economically disadvantaged individuals. Training is provided in local service delivery areas (SDA) through service providers, such as vocational-technical high schools, community colleges, proprietary schools, and community-based organizations. The program objectives are to increase earnings and employment and to reduce welfare dependence for participants of all ages. During the NJS, participation in JTPA involved roughly 3 to 4 months of training at an average cost of about $2,400 per participant.", "In 1986, Labor commissioned the NJS to evaluate the impact of JTPA on adults and youths because previous findings on the effects of job training programs had been hampered by poor data and statistical problems. The NJS randomly assigned persons who sought JTPA services, and were eligible for them, to a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group was offered JTPA training, and the control group was not. The study was intended to ensure that the two groups would not differ systematically in any way except access to the program, so any subsequent differences in outcomes could be attributed solely to JTPA.", "The study included over 20,000 eligible participants who applied for JTPA services between November 1987 and September 1989 in 16 local SDAs.

Second, a substantial minority of the control group members chose to participate in some alternative, non-JTPA training programs.

Labor comments that our report understates the gross returns to JTPA training. Furthermore, Labor implies that these gross returns calculations compare favorably with the returns to college education.", "Our objective, as clearly stated in the report, was not to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of JTPA training, but rather to determine and compare the long-term effects of JTPA training. In fact, because we did not calculate the gross return to JTPA participants the report cannot have understated or overstated the values. Such calculations were not within the scope of this report. While it may be true that these returns are favorable, we have no basis to judge the favorability of the gross returns to training. 2. Labor states that the report does not acknowledge favorable aspects of this study. Specifically, Labor cited that (1) all four target groups had higher earnings in the fifth year after assignment; (2) both adult treatment groups had higher earnings than their respective control groups in each of the 5 years following assignment; and (3) for male youths, a positive trend exists, and the fifth-year earnings exceed those of the control group by over 10 percent.", "Contrary to Labor\u2019s comment, we did note many of these favorable program outcomes in our report. We stated that adult male treatment group members had higher earnings than adult male control group members and presented similar findings for the other three target groups. We further stated that adult male treatment group earnings exceeded control group earnings in each of the 5 years and reported similar information for adult women. Also, we noted the positive trend for earnings of male youths. We did not note the percentage difference for male youths in the fifth year because we did not report percentage comparisons for any of the target groups. 3. Labor states that if the training impacts are accumulated over time during the 5-year follow-up period, the net benefits outweigh the costs.", "As we stated in comment 1, our objective was not to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of JTPA training, but rather to determine and compare the long-term effects of JTPA training. While it may be true that the net benefits outweigh the costs, we have no basis to judge this because such calculations were beyond the scope of this report. 4. Labor states that the increase in standard errors is primarily responsible for the decline in statistical significance of the estimated impacts.", "While Labor is correct in stating that the standard errors were greater in the fifth year, it is not accurate to attribute a decline in statistical significance to either the estimated training effects or to the standard errors. The test statistics used for our significance tests are determined by the ratio of the estimates to their standard error, and attributing the lack of significance solely to either component of these ratios is inappropriate. 5. Labor states that our conclusion requires assessing the total impact of JTPA and the overall cost and benefits. The Department states that we overemphasize the importance of year-by-year significance tests in questioning the program\u2019s usefulness in improving participants\u2019 long-term earnings prospects by stressing the insignificant effect of JTPA in the fifth year.", "We agree with Labor that year-by-year significance tests have limited value in assessing the total impact of JTPA and the overall cost and benefits. Furthermore, our year-by-year significance tests provide statistical evidence that adult treatment group members achieved higher earnings for several years following assignment to JTPA training. While other evidence covering the 5-year period might be found to better highlight the positive effects of JTPA training, we chose to address the question of whether the fifth-year earnings of those assigned to participate in JTPA differed significantly from the fifth-year earnings of those not assigned to participate in JTPA. 6. While acknowledging that the observed earnings differences between the four target groups were not statistically significant in the fifth year, Labor asserts that the odds that all four differences would be positive purely by chance is 6.25 percent.", "This implies that an accumulation of not statistically significant observations provides more compelling empirical evidence than the actual significance test for any one group. While the probability (not odds) that all four not significant fifth-year earnings differences would be positive purely by chance might be low, our research question is whether a significant earnings difference occurred for each target group. 7. Labor comments that the report does not report the standard errors. Labor states that the report should include confidence intervals for the estimates, sample sizes, and standard errors and specify significance levels for the estimates.", "We have made several additions to tables in appendix II in response to this comment. We have added the sample size, the size of the treatment and control groups, the standard errors, and a reminder that the significance level chosen is 5 percent for the tables in this appendix. Since we have not presented point estimates of the earnings effects, we did not calculate confidence intervals for these estimates. Technical readers of our report can construct such estimates and the associated intervals from the information in the appendix II tables. 8. Labor claims that the report treats figures that are not significant as zero.", "We do not report any training effect as zero. The magnitude of the earnings differences, whether significant or not, is discussed in the report and is easily calculated from the tables in appendix II. 9. Labor states that statistical significance is not a knife edge of yes or no but a continuum.", "The level used for tests of statistical significance may be chosen from a broad range (or continuum) of values. Although different researchers may choose to use different values for the significance level, choosing a significance level before analyzing any data is common practice. Once this level has been chosen, statistical hypothesis testing very much involves a yes or no decision. Either the data reject the null hypothesis of no training effect at the set significance level or not. We follow these commonly accepted procedures for hypothesis testing, and our convention is to set the significance level for such tests at 5 percent. 10. Labor also states that the report should discuss the results, the probability values, and changes in the significance levels.", "Our report does discuss the results as well as whether the earnings and employment effects were significant and whether this significance changed over time. Although we do not present the probability values, technical readers of our report can calculate them using the information in the appendix II tables. 11. Labor takes issue with our statement that complications (not all treatment group members received training and some control group members did receive training) precluded our attributing earnings differences solely to JTPA training. It claims that these complications led us to understate the effect of training, implying that the earnings differences observed, along with perhaps some further overlooked earnings effects, can be attributed to JTPA.", "We clearly state that these complications preclude solely attributing the earnings effects to JTPA training. However, we have no evidence that these factors led to an understatement of the effect of JTPA training. In the first place, a short delay can occur before an assignee can begin a training program. In some of these cases, individuals find and accept employment instead of reporting for training. To the extent that these individuals are more fully employed and may earn more than they might have if they had attended JTPA training, our estimate may actually overstate the effect of training. Second and more importantly, if those who attend training are in some way more motivated than those who do not attend, it would be difficult to separate any increase in earnings due to training from the increase in earnings due to this motivation. At a minimum, we would need to identify which control group members were motivated to attend training to draw such inferences. 12. Labor recommends adjusting the comparison by effectively removing treatment group members who did not enroll in training.", "We chose to compare only those assigned to JTPA training with those not assigned to training to take full advantage of the original random assignment design. As we stated in comment 11, we would have needed to identify which control group members were motivated to attend training to justify removing the treatment group members who did not attend training. Since we could not take all the necessary steps to fully implement Labor\u2019s suggestion, we chose not to make that or any other adjustments. 13. Labor comments that we will be providing the Department\u2019s contractor with access to Social Security data for additional analysis, including examining the results for subgroups.", "We would like to clarify the details of this arrangement in light of the sensitive nature and confidentiality of individual earnings records. When we began our work, Labor was also planning to evaluate the long-term impact of JTPA training on earnings. Both our and Labor\u2019s evaluation (contracted out to Westat, Inc.) planned to use Social Security earnings records to supplement the information collected through the NJS. In the spirit of cooperation, Labor requested and we agreed to provide aggregated earnings data to the Department, which will submit computer programs to us; we will in turn run the programs and provide the output to Labor. Only aggregated information, such as means and standards deviations, will be reported. No data will be released that could be traced to individuals, nor will we provide Labor or its contractor with individual earnings records. 14. Labor suggests that we include earnings and employment information for the third of the sample for whom only 4 years of follow-up data were available.", "We did not include this group in our analysis since we could not report on their earnings or employment 5 years after training. As such, any additional information provided would not address the question of whether JTPA had a long-term effect on the earnings or employment outcomes of the treatment group. 15. Labor states that we should explain that our employment measure is not the definition that is generally reported in government statistics and is not comparable to figures reported in Current Population Survey (CPS) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports.", "Our employment rate differs from measures reported in CPS and BLS reports but is appropriate for our purposes. Our employment rate is the number employed divided by all who were in the treatment or control group, which includes those workers who may have dropped out of the labor force. Since these workers presumably applied for training because they intended to keep working, we believe that all workers should be included in the denominator of the measure. Our measure also counts as employed everyone who worked during the year, even if they might have been unemployed for some portion of the year. As such, our measure may overstate the instantaneous employment outcomes of both the treatment and control groups relative to figures reported in CPS and BLS reports. 16. Labor states that Social Security data are subject to considerable revisions in the first year of availability. It believes this calls into doubt fifth-year estimates for adult men, adult women, and male youths.", "While data are often subject to revision, we have no reason to suspect that the data for those assigned to training in 1988 are materially less reliable than for those assigned to training in 1987. The fifth year (1993) of earnings data for those assigned to training in 1988 was extracted from SSA records in March 1995. An SSA official responsible for updates and revisions to SSA earnings data said that we could expect the accuracy and completeness of our extract to exceed 99 percent. 17. Labor states that we fail to recognize the limited relevance of our findings to current job programs.", "While we agree that our evaluation has limitations, we disagree that it has little relevance to current job programs. We make it quite clear that our analysis is not nationally representative of JTPA training. Additionally, we cite many flaws associated with the design and implementation of the original NJS that limit our analysis. However, no evidence exists to suggest that job training funded by JTPA and administered at the state and local level has changed so dramatically since 1989 that our findings are not relevant to the current program.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
