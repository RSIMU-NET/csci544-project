In 2011, the program provided about $113 billion in insurance coverage for over 1 million policies. Program costs include subsidies to pay for part of farmers\u0092 premiums. According to the Congressional Budget Office, for fiscal years 2013 through 2022, the program costs\u0097primarily premium subsidies\u0097will average $8.9 billion annually.", "GAO determined the (1) effect on program costs of applying limits on farmers\u0092 premium subsidies, as payment limits are set for other farm programs, and (2) extent to which USDA uses key data mining tools to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in the program. GAO analyzed USDA data, reviewed economic studies, and interviewed USDA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["If a limit of $40,000 had been applied to individual farmers\u0092 crop insurance premium subsidies, as it is for other farm programs, the federal government would have saved up to $1 billion in crop insurance program costs in 2011, according to GAO\u0092s analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data. GAO selected $40,000 as an example of a potential subsidy limit because it is the limit for direct payments, which provide fixed annual payments to farmers based on a farm\u0092s crop production history. Had such a limit been applied in 2011, it would have affected up to 3.9 percent of all participating farmers, who accounted for about one-third of all premium subsidies and were primarily associated with large farms. For example, one of these farmers insured crops in eight counties and received about $1.3 million in premium subsidies. Had premium subsidies been reduced by 10 percentage points for all farmers participating in the program, as recent studies have proposed, the federal government would have saved about $1.2 billion in 2011. A decision to limit or reduce premium subsidies raises other considerations, such as the potential effect on the financial condition of large farms and on program participation.", "Since 2001, USDA has used data mining tools to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse by either farmers or insurance agents and adjusters but has not maximized the use of these tools to realize potential additional savings. This is largely because of competing compliance review priorities, according to GAO\u0092s analysis. USDA\u0092s Risk Management Agency (RMA), which is responsible for overseeing the integrity of the crop insurance program, has used data mining to identify farmers who received claim payments that are higher or more frequent than others in the same area. USDA informs these farmers that at least one of their fields will be inspected during the coming growing season. RMA officials told GAO that this action has substantially reduced total claims. The value of identifying these farmers may be reduced, however, by the fact that USDA\u0092s Farm Service Agency (FSA)\u0097which conducts field inspections for RMA\u0097does not complete all such inspections, and neither FSA nor RMA has a process to ensure that the results of all inspections are accurately reported. For example, RMA did not obtain field inspection results for about 20 percent and 28 percent of these farmers, respectively, in 2009 and 2010. As a result, not all of the farmers RMA identified were subject to a review, increasing the likelihood that fraud, waste, or abuse occurred without detection. Field inspections were not completed, in part because FSA state offices are not required to monitor the completion of such inspections. In addition, RMA generally does not provide insurance companies with FSA inspection results when crops are found to be in good condition, although USDA\u0092s Inspector General has reported this information may be important for followup. Past cases have revealed that some farmers may harvest a high-yielding crop, hide its sale, and report a loss to receive an insurance payment. Furthermore, RMA has not directed insurance companies to review the results of all completed FSA field inspections before paying claims that are filed after inspections show a crop is in good condition. As a result, insurance companies may not have information that could help them identify claims that should be denied."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To reduce crop insurance program costs, Congress should consider limiting premium subsidies for individual farmers, reducing subsidies for all farmers, or both.

USDA agreed with encouraging the completion of field inspections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federally subsidized crop insurance, which farmers can purchase to help  manage the risk inherent in farming, has become one of the most  important programs in the farm safety net. Under the federal crop  insurance program, farmers can choose various levels and types of  insurance protection: they can insure against losses caused by poor crop  yields, declines in crop prices, or both, for each insurable crop they  produce. In 2011, the crop insurance program provided about $113 billion  in insurance coverage for about 264 million acres of farmland, for over 1.1  million policies. The federal government\u2019s crop insurance costs include  subsidies to pay for (1) part of a farmer\u2019s crop insurance premiums, which  averaged about 62 percent of the total premiums in 2011, and (2)  administrative and operating expenses (administrative expenses)\u2014 provided on behalf of farmers\u2014to insurance companies to cover their  expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance policies. The amount of  subsidies\u2014for premiums and administrative expenses\u2014is not limited for  individuals or legal entities.", "The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, for fiscal years 2013  through 2022, the federal government\u2019s crop insurance costs will average  $8.9 billion per year. The cost of the federal crop insurance program has  come under increased scrutiny because of the nation\u2019s budgetary  pressures, particularly when farm income is at record-high levels. For  2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that 2011 net  farm income was a record $98.1 billion. For 2012, USDA estimates that  net farm income will decline to $91.7 billion\u2014still the second highest level  on record. In addition, according to USDA, the top 5 earnings years for  the past 3 decades have occurred since 2004, attesting to the recent  profitability of farming. Furthermore, farmland values, another measure of  farm prosperity, increased by 85 percent from 2003 through 2011.", "We and others have reported over the years on the risks for fraud, waste,  and abuse in the crop insurance program and recommended ways to  minimize these risks, including examining data on crop insurance claims  to identify potential abuses. For example, in 2005, we reported on crop  insurance fraud cases investigated by USDA that resulted in criminal  prosecutions. These cases showed that the farmers, sometimes in  collusion with insurance agents and others, falsely claimed weather  damage and low production to receive crop insurance payments. Several  of these cases also demonstrated the importance of having USDA\u2019s Farm  Service Agency (FSA), which administers many farm programs, and Risk  Management Agency (RMA), which administers the federal crop  insurance program, work together to identify and share information on  questionable farming practices and activities. In part to improve  compliance with, and the integrity of, the crop insurance program,  Congress enacted the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (ARPA).  This act provided RMA and FSA with new tools for monitoring and  controlling program abuses. Among other things, it required the Secretary  of Agriculture to use data mining\u2014a technique for extracting knowledge  from large volumes of data\u2014to administer and enforce the crop insurance  program. Following USDA\u2019s written procedures, developed pursuant to a  requirement in ARPA, RMA provides FSA with a list of farmers who have  received payments for anomalous claims\u2014that is, claims that are higher  or more frequent than others in the same area and that match RMA  scenarios of fraud, waste, or abuse. Under the written procedures, staff in  FSA county offices are to inspect the fields of the listed farmers and  report the inspection results to RMA.", "USDA also administers an array of other farm programs to support farm  income, assist farmers after disasters, and conserve natural resources.  Unlike the crop insurance program, these other farm programs generally  have statutory income and payment limits that apply to individual farmers  and legal entities, including corporations, estates, and trusts. For  example, USDA provides about $5 billion in fixed annual payments\u2014 called direct payments\u2014to farmers based on a farm\u2019s crop production  history. However, a person or legal entity with an average adjusted gross  farm income (over the preceding 3 tax years) exceeding $750,000 is  generally ineligible for direct payments. In addition, for direct payments,  the annual payment is generally no more than $40,000 per person or  legal entity. In anticipation of the next farm bill, farm groups have made  proposals that would result in having crop insurance become the  centerpiece of the federal farm safety net, with support through traditional  commodity programs playing a significantly reduced role.", "In this context, you asked us to identify additional opportunities for  reducing the cost of the crop insurance program. Our objectives were to  determine (1) the effect on program costs of applying limits on farmers\u2019  federal crop insurance subsidies, as payment limits are applied to other  farm programs, and (2) the extent to which USDA has used key data  mining tools to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in the crop  insurance program.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed eligibility standards, such as  adjusted gross income limits and payment limits, in the provisions of the  Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 farm bill); other  statutes; and USDA regulations. We also interviewed FSA and RMA  officials regarding eligibility standards and payment limits. To determine  the distribution of crop insurance subsidies among farmers who  participate in the program, we analyzed RMA data for 2010 and 2011 on  the number and percentage of farmers receiving various levels of  subsidies and the locations of farmers who received higher subsidies. We  selected $40,000 as an example of a potential subsidy limit because it is  the payment limit for direct payments, which is one of the largest  components of the farm safety net. We also reviewed USDA and others\u2019  studies that examined participation in the crop insurance program and  premium subsidies. In addition, we reviewed USDA data on the financial  condition of farms of different sizes. To address the second objective, we  interviewed officials at RMA headquarters and RMA\u2019s six regional  compliance offices to determine RMA\u2019s current uses of data mining  results, including data mining related to farmers with anomalous claim  payments, as well as insurance agents and adjusters who had anomalous  losses in comparison with their peers in the same geographic area. In  addition, we analyzed 2009 and 2010 data on FSA\u2019s completion of field  inspections, pursuant to RMA\u2019s data mining list of farmers with  anomalous claim payments. We also interviewed officials at FSA  headquarters and five FSA state offices\u2014California, Colorado, Florida,  North Dakota, and Texas\u2014to obtain information about field inspection  processes and obstacles to the completion of these inspections. We  selected FSA\u2019s North Dakota office because of its high completion rate of  field inspections (96 percent) for 2009 and 2010 and large number of  requests for field inspections (378). We selected the other four state  offices because, over the 2-year period, they had low completion rates of  field inspections (less than 33 percent) and at least 80 requests for field  inspections.

The federal government has played an  active role in helping to mitigate the effects of these risks on farm income  by promoting the use of crop insurance. RMA has overall responsibility for  administering the federal crop insurance program, including controlling  costs and protecting against fraud, waste, and abuse. RMA partners with  15 private insurance companies that sell and service the federal  program\u2019s insurance policies and share a percentage of the risk of loss  and opportunity for gain associated with the policies.", "Through the federal crop insurance program, farmers insure against  losses on more than 100 crops. These crops include major crops\u2014such  as corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat, which accounted for three-quarters  of the acres enrolled in the program in 2011\u2014as well as nursery crops  and certain fruits and vegetables. For the purposes of this report, we  generally refer to participants in the federal crop insurance program as  participating farmers.", "Most crop insurance policies are either production-based or revenue- based. For production-based policies, a farmer can receive a payment if  there is a production loss relative to the farmer\u2019s historical production per  acre. Revenue-based policies protect against crop revenue loss resulting  from declines in production, price, or both. The federal government  encourages farmers\u2019 participation in the federal crop insurance program  by subsidizing their insurance premiums and acting as the primary  reinsurer for the private insurance companies that take on the risk of  covering, or \u201cunderwriting,\u201d losses to insured farmers. A common  measure of crop insurance program participation is the percentage of  planted acres nationwide for major crops that are enrolled in the program.", "In addition, the federal government pays administrative expense  subsidies to insurance companies as an allowance that is intended to  cover their expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance policies. In  turn, insurance companies use these subsidies to cover their overhead  expenses, such as payroll and rent, and to pay commissions to insurance  agencies and agents. Companies also incur expenses associated with  verifying\u2014adjusting\u2014the amount of loss claimed. These expenses  include, for example, loss adjusters\u2019 compensation and their travel  expenses to farmers\u2019 fields. The financial relationships among the federal  government, private insurance companies, agents, and farmers are  illustrated in figure 1.", "For 2011, the federal government\u2019s subsidy costs were about $7.4 billion  for crop insurance premiums and about $1.3 billion for administrative  expenses. Crop insurance premium subsidies are not payments to  farmers, but they can be considered a financial benefit. Without a  premium subsidy, a participating farmer would have to pay the full amount  of the premium. The administrative expense subsidies also can be  considered a subsidy to farmers; with these subsidies, crop insurance  premiums are lower than they would otherwise be if the program followed  commercial insurance practices. In private insurance, such as automobile  insurance, these administrative expenses typically are included in the  premium that a policy holder pays.", "ARPA and the 2008 farm bill set premium subsidy rates, that is, the  percentage of the premium paid by the government. Premium subsidy  rates vary by the level of insurance coverage that the farmer chooses and  the geographic diversity of the crops insured. For most policies, the  statutory subsidy rates range from 38 percent to 80 percent. Table 1  shows the total costs of subsidies for all crop insurance premiums and  administrative expenses for 2000 through 2011. The table shows that  premium subsidies have generally increased since 2000, both in dollars  and as a percentage of total premiums. The premium subsidy rates,  authorized by ARPA, became effective in 2001. Premium subsidies  increased, as a percentage of total premiums, from 37 percent in 2000 to  60 percent in 2001. In addition, premium subsidies rose as crop prices  increased.", "As crop prices increase, the value of the crops being insured increases,  which results in higher crop insurance premiums and premium subsidies.  For example, the prices of major crops were substantially higher in 2011  than in 2006, and premium subsidies in 2011 (about $7.4 billion) were  substantially higher than in 2006 (about $2.7 billion). USDA forecasts that  the prices of major crops\u2014corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat\u2014will  continue to be substantially higher than 2006 prices through 2016.  Administrative expense subsidies also increased because of higher crop  prices. However, RMA capped administrative expense subsidies in the  2011 standard reinsurance agreement (SRA), a cooperative financial  agreement between USDA and insurance companies. These changes  became effective in 2011. As a result, administrative expense subsidies  were lower in 2011 than they otherwise would have been."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Crop Insurance Participation and Disaster Assistance Payments", "paragraphs": ["The federal government provides crop insurance subsidies to farmers in  part to achieve high crop insurance participation and coverage levels,  which are intended, according to USDA economists, to reduce or  eliminate the need for ad hoc disaster assistance payments to help  farmers recover from natural disasters, which can be costly.

In order to increase participation,  according to the USDA publication, the Federal Crop Insurance Reform  Act of 1994 increased premium subsidy rates. Farmers responded by  enrolling more acres. Enrollment was about 100 million acres in 1993  before the act and about 182 million acres in 1997. Under ARPA,  premium subsidy rates increased again in 2001. Farmers subsequently  purchased more insurance at higher coverage levels. With the increases  in acres enrolled and coverage levels, premium subsidy costs increased.

In addition, we  identified considerations associated with either limiting premium subsidies  to large farmers or reducing premium subsidy rates for all farmers.", "The application of limits of $40,000 in premium subsidies to farmers  participating in the federal crop insurance program would primarily affect  farmers who have large farms. For example, as discussed earlier, using  our data for 2011, these participating farmers represented 3.9 percent of  the farmers participating in the crop insurance program in 2011 and  accounted for 32.6 percent of the premium subsidies. In view of the  insured value of these farmers\u2019 crops, they likely had annual gross sales  approaching or exceeding $1 million. In addition, the insured value of  these farmers\u2019 crops represented about 26 percent of the total value of  insured crops in 2011. Limiting premium subsidies to farmers may raise  concerns about how these limits could affect large farms\u2019 financial  condition.

In contrast, the  next two farm categories (farms with annual gross sales of from  $500,000 to $1 million and farms with annual gross sales of from  $250,000 to $500,000) had average annual net farm incomes of about  $184,000 and $92,000, respectively.", "The largest farms with crop insurance coverage had higher relative  profitability as measured by rate of return on equity, which is the ratio  of net farm income to the net worth of the farm.

Furthermore, a high debt-to-asset ratio is not necessarily a problem,  as long as the rate of return on assets exceeds the interest rate on the  funds borrowed.

Marketing contracts reduce price risks and are  already used by many large farmers. These contracts are either  verbal or written agreements between a buyer and a farmer that set a  price for a commodity before harvest or before the commodity is ready  to be marketed.", "Futures contracts and hedging. A futures contact is a financial  contract obligating the buyer to purchase an asset (or the seller to sell  an asset), such as a commodity, at a predetermined future date and  price. Futures contracts detail the quality and quantity of the  underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures  exchange. Futures can be used to hedge on the price movement of  the underlying asset. For example, a producer of corn could use  futures to lock in a certain price and manage risk (hedge).", "Crop and other enterprise diversification. Diversification is a risk  management strategy that involves participating in more than one  activity.

Furthermore, assuming they are eligible to  purchase unsubsidized crop insurance, farmers could still enroll all of  their eligible crop acres in the program, making them eligible to receive  claim payments on these acres.

According to RMA officials, about two-thirds of the  farmers who receive a letter from FSA reduce or stop filing claims for at  least 2 or 3 years following receipt of the letter, and one-third of farmers  make additional anomalous claims after being placed on the list; some of  these claims are likely to be legitimate.", "The value of identifying farmers with anomalous claim payments may be  undermined, however, by the fact that FSA does not complete all field  inspections, and neither FSA nor RMA has a process to ensure that the  results of all completed inspections are accurately reported, in  accordance with USDA\u2019s written procedures. In particular, in 2009 and  2010, RMA did not have field inspection results for 20 percent and 28  percent, respectively, of the fields for farmers listed as having anomalous  claim payments.

First, we found that FSA state offices are not required to monitor the  completion of field inspections conducted by FSA county offices during  the growing season. Without FSA state office monitoring of RMA- requested field inspections, FSA county offices may have less incentive  to complete them. The FSA state offices in the six states we reviewed  varied in how closely they monitor these field office inspections. In  particular, in Minnesota and North Dakota, FSA state offices monitored  completion of field inspections and, in 2010, in these states, FSA county  offices had 111 and 183 field inspections to conduct, respectively, and  completed 97 percent and 92 percent, respectively, of these inspections.  In Minnesota, according to an FSA official we spoke with, the state office  \u201cencouraged\u201d completion of field inspections by e-mailing all of the state\u2019s  FSA county offices a list of offices that had not completed their  inspections. In North Dakota, a state FSA official attributed the state\u2019s  high rate of completed inspections largely to the fact that the state office  monitors the rate of field inspections during the growing season,  encouraging county offices that have not completed their inspections to  do so. In contrast, California, Colorado, and Florida each had from 24 to  85 inspections to conduct and completed from none to 44 percent of  these inspections. FSA officials from California and Florida agreed that it would be a good practice to monitor the completion of field inspections  during the growing season at the state or district level to hold the county  offices accountable.", "Second, FSA state officials in two of the four states with low inspection  rates told us that insufficient resources were a key reason that county  offices had not completed FSA inspections. These officials said that  staffing had decreased for the past several years, but workload had  increased.", "Third, some FSA state officials said that county office staff may hesitate  to spend time and effort on inspections when they do not believe the  inspections will have any impact. For example, they said that neither they  nor county officials are informed of any action taken on their inspection  results and that county officials are discouraged when their inspections do  not result in actions against the farmers who appear to be engaged in  negligent farming practices. However, at least one RMA compliance  office\u2014RMA\u2019s Northern Regional Compliance Office\u2014does provide  feedback to FSA. This office is responsible for Iowa, Minnesota, Montana,  North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. According to an  FSA official in North Dakota, RMA\u2019s Northern Regional Compliance Office  sends FSA state officials letters describing the results of reviews RMA  requested the insurance companies to conduct based on FSA  inspections, and the state officials are to forward this information to the  counties.", "In addition, in 2010, as provided for under the SRA, RMA regional  compliance offices directed insurance companies to review and report on  farmers\u2019 policies to ascertain whether fraud, waste, or abuse had  occurred. These RMA offices have generally directed such reviews in two  situations. First, when FSA inspectors reported that farmers\u2019 crops were  in worse condition than their peers, RMA regional compliance offices may  direct companies to analyze the claims, documenting their work with  appraisal sheets, special adjuster reports, pictures, and receipts for inputs  such as seeds and fertilizer. Second, when farmers have anomalous  claims data related to production history\u2014a key factor in determining the  total claims farmers make\u2014RMA offices may direct the insurance  companies to review these policies.", "USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General reported in 2009 that RMA lacks  documented procedures for following up on cases where farmers file  claims after FSA\u2019s field inspections indicate that crops are in good  condition, and the farmer should not experience a loss.  Under the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, federal  agencies are to employ control activities, such as clearly documenting  internal control in management directives, administrative policies, or  operating manuals, and the documentation is to be readily available for  examination. Without documented agency policies and procedures for  reviewing farmers\u2019 policies identified by data mining reports, RMA cannot  provide reasonable assurance that the farmers\u2019 policies would be  reviewed consistently. The Inspector General added that, since RMA\u2019s  resources are not unlimited, the agency should consider requiring that  insurance companies perform as much of this work as possible. In this  regard, as we noted above, about one-third of farmers listed as having  anomalous claim payments again claim losses after being placed on the  list. RMA has not maximized the use of the list of farmers with anomalous  claim payments by, for example, directing insurance companies to review  these farmers\u2019 claims before paying them after FSA has reported the  crops to be in good condition. According to three current and former RMA  and Office of the Inspector General officials, because these farmers have  previously had anomalous claim payments, their claims warrant a review,  particularly when FSA\u2019s inspection found their crops to be in good  condition within weeks of the time that the farmer made a claim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA May Use the List of Agents and Adjusters with Anomalous Losses to Corroborate Other Information, but RMA Does Not Conduct Required Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Investigators from RMA and USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General said  that they use the list of insurance agents and loss adjusters with  anomalous losses at times to corroborate information from other  sources\u2014such as the Office of the Inspector General\u2019s fraud hotline\u2014 rather than as a basis for initiating reviews.

In 2009, the Inspector General found that  RMA was not reviewing these individuals and recommended that RMA  develop policies and procedures for reviewing disparately performing  agents and adjusters to assess whether the higher-than-average loss  ratios for the agents and adjusters identified are the result of potential  fraud, waste, or abuse. According to RMA officials we interviewed, RMA  had not fully met this requirement because of resource constraints,  among other things. These officials told us that investigating agents and  loss adjusters is more complex and time-consuming than investigating  individual farmers because one agent or adjuster may be identified with a  dozen or more policies. In addition, officials said, the insurance company  database used to develop the list includes agents who are not servicing  the policy they are identified with. RMA officials told us that they have  discussed the problem of inaccurate data with insurance companies and  that the companies have made improvements, but they could not specify  the extent of the problem or the improvements. Some RMA officials also  pointed out that investigators use many different data mining tools and  that it may be a better use of resources if the requirement for RMA to  review the list of agents and adjusters was changed to allow RMA to  review agents and adjusters and farmers using a variety of data mining  tools, such as a software program that helps investigators identify links  among producers, agents, or adjusters who are jointly engaged in  activities that are anomalous. In addition, in response to another 2000  ARPA requirement, RMA included in the 2011 SRA a provision directing  insurance companies to annually evaluate the performance of every  agent and loss adjuster, including their loss ratios and the number and  type of errors made by an agent or adjuster.

One RMA official noted that  FSA occasionally provides late responses for fields with crops in  worse condition than others in the area.

Without subsidy  limits, a small number of farmers receive relatively large premium  subsidies and a relatively large share of total premium subsidies. In  addition, premium subsidies for all farmers, which averaged 62 percent of  premiums in 2011, have increased substantially since 2000. With  increasing pressure to reduce the federal budget deficit and with record  farm income in recent years, it is critical that taxpayer-provided funds for  the farm safety net are spent as economically as possible. Limits on  premium subsidies to individual farmers or reductions in the amount of  premium subsidies for all farmers participating in the crop insurance  program, or both limits and reductions, present an opportunity to save  hundreds of millions of dollars per year for taxpayers without  compromising this safety net.", "In addition, RMA has made substantial progress over the past decade in  developing data mining tools to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and  abuse from a list of farmers who have received payments for anomalous  claims, but RMA\u2019s use of these tools lags behind their development,  largely because of competing priorities. By not maximizing the use of  these tools, RMA may be missing opportunities to identify and prevent  losses to the federal government that result from fraud, waste, or abuse.  Furthermore, because FSA does not require its state offices to monitor,  during the growing season, completion of its county office field  inspections for farmers with anomalous claim payments, and because  FSA does not always communicate its inspection results to RMA in a  timely manner, RMA and FSA may not know about farmers who  improperly manage their crops or falsely report losses. FSA state offices  that do such monitoring seem to encourage a higher completion rate of  county office field inspections. RMA has also not provided insurance  companies with most FSA inspection results, particularly findings that  crops were in good condition, or directed insurance companies to review  the results of all completed FSA field inspections before paying claims  that occur after inspections showed a crop was in good condition. As a  result, insurance companies may not have information that could help  them identify claims that should be denied.", "RMA has also not realized the potential of data mining tools to enhance  its detection of fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of insurance agents  and adjusters, including addressing the ARPA requirement to review  agents and adjusters identified as having anomalous losses.

We received written comments from the acting  USDA Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services. In  these comments, the acting Under Secretary stated it was ill advised for  us to suggest that Congress consider limiting or reducing premium  subsides without further study. The acting Under Secretary stated that in  recommending a $40,000 limit on premium subsidies, the report does not  fully account for all potentially negative impacts and costs resulting from  such a change. However, as we state in the report, we do not recommend  a $40,000 limit in premium subsidies per crop insurance participant.  Instead, we used $40,000 as an example of a premium subsidy limit and  noted that setting a premium subsidy limit higher or lower would have  corresponding effects on cost savings. In addition, our report recognizes  that setting a subsidy limit may have impacts, and we discuss some of  these potential impacts. Moreover, at a time when the agriculture sector is  enjoying record farm income and higher farmland values and the nation is  facing severe deficit and long-term fiscal challenges, we believe that crop  insurance premium subsidies\u2014the single largest component of farm  program costs\u2014is a potential area for federal cost savings. Furthermore,  the Administration\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2013 and the Congressional  Budget Office each proposed a reduction in premium subsidies. These  subsidies increased fourfold, from $1.7 billion in 2002 to $7.4 billion in  2011.", "USDA agreed with one of our recommendations, and did not directly  respond to the other three. Regarding our first recommendation\u2014 encouraging the completion of FSA county office inspections for the list of  farmers with anomalous claim payments by requiring FSA state offices to  monitor the status of their completion\u2014USDA stated that it will update its  written procedures to require FSA state offices to monitor county offices\u2019  completion of these inspections.", "Regarding our second recommendation\u2014that USDA maximize its list of  farmers with anomalous claims by providing the results of completed FSA  inspections to the insurance companies\u2014USDA stated it is unlikely that  FSA will be able to accomplish this recommendation, but that comment is  not responsive to our recommendation. We clarified the language to say  that insurance companies should receive the results of all inspections that  have been completed. This effort would not entail additional work on the  part of FSA. RMA\u2019s data mining contractor told us that it could complete  this activity within a few days after an inspection was completed.", "Regarding our third recommendation\u2014to direct insurance companies,  during annual performance evaluations of insurance agents and  adjusters, to focus more of their attention on the list of agents and  adjusters with anomalous losses than on others\u2014USDA reported that it  was issuing guidance directing companies to provide to USDA the results  of reviews conducted on each agent/loss adjuster identified on the  anomalous agent/loss adjuster list provided by RMA. We agree that  providing guidance to the companies is important and continue to believe  that directing insurance companies to focus more attention on these  agents and loss adjusters during annual performance reviews would  produce additional benefits.", "Regarding the fourth recommendation\u2014to develop a mechanism, such as  a revised electronic form, to collect additional data from insurance  companies in order to facilitate the use of the companies\u2019 reviews in data  mining\u2014USDA did not clearly state whether it agreed or disagreed.  USDA stated that as one of its information systems projects matures, it  will find better ways to record and gather data for data mining.

We also interviewed officials from  USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Risk Management Agency  (RMA) regarding eligibility standards and payment limits in the 2008 farm  bill for farm programs other than the crop insurance program. To  determine the distribution of crop insurance subsidies among farmers  who participate in the program, we analyzed RMA data for 2010 and 2011  on the number and percentage of farmers receiving various levels of  subsidies and the locations of farmers who received higher subsidies. We  selected $40,000 as an example of a potential subsidy limit because it is  the payment limit for direct payments. Many participants in the crop  insurance program also participate in other farm programs that are  administered by USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA). Many of these  other farm programs have payment limits based on benefits that are  attributed to each interest holder in a farming operation. Under a scenario  of a limit on premium subsidies, it is likely these same rules regarding the  attribution of benefits would also apply to premium subsidies for the crop  insurance program. Therefore, in our analysis, we attributed these  subsidies for each policy to the interest holders in the policy. We did so  based on the payment share of each interest holder as recorded in FSA\u2019s  validated Permitted Entity database that is used to ensure compliance  with payment limit rules. For entities, we attributed benefits through four  levels, as appropriate. We summed premium subsidies across policies for  each crop insurance participant. For those that were not found in FSA\u2019s  Permitted Entity database or if RMA\u2019s database contradicted FSA\u2019s  Permitted Entity database, we attributed premium subsidies by dividing it  equally among the policy holder and the interest holders as reported in  RMA\u2019s database. These participants represented 18.5 percent of the  entities.", "We also reviewed USDA and other studies that examined participation in  the crop insurance program and premium subsidies. In addition, we  reviewed USDA data on the financial condition of farms of various sizes.  Furthermore, we reviewed USDA reports on the availability of private risk  management tools against crop losses and the effects of farm program  subsidies on beginning and smaller farmers. Finally, we reviewed farm  and crop insurance industry organizations\u2019 statements on the crop  insurance program.", "To determine the extent to which USDA has used data mining tools to  prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in the crop insurance  program, we analyzed how RMA uses two data mining lists\u2014the list of  farmers with anomalous claim payments and the list of insurance agents  and adjusters with anomalous losses\u2014and the methods it uses to  develop these lists. We reviewed requirements in the Agricultural Risk  Protection Act of 2000 and the current and former standard reinsurance  agreement related to data mining, FSA guidance for field inspections,  FSA letters to farmers with anomalous claim payments, data analyses  and summaries on data mining tools developed by RMA\u2019s data mining  contractor, USDA\u2019s Inspector General reports and testimonies, and  reports of RMA completion of disaster payment reconciliations. We also  interviewed RMA data mining contractor staff, and RMA officials at  headquarters and six regional compliance offices to identify RMA\u2019s uses  of these data mining tools, weaknesses found in the tools, opportunities  for increased use of them, or competing RMA priorities. We also  interviewed officials with USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General on their  views and uses of these tools. In addition, we worked with RMA\u2019s data  mining contractor to analyze 2009 and 2010 data on FSA\u2019s completion of  field inspections for policies of those farmers listed as having anomalous  claim payments. We conducted tests of the reliability of the data, such as  checking formulas, and found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We also interviewed officials with RMA and its  data mining contractor to determine the process used to acquire FSA\u2019s  field inspection data. We interviewed officials with FSA\u2019s headquarters  office and the five FSA state offices for California, Colorado, Florida,  North Dakota, and Texas to obtain information about these data,  obstacles to completing the inspections, and suggestions for increasing   We selected FSA\u2019s North Dakota office  their completion and reporting.because of its high completion rate of field inspections (96 percent) for  2009 and 2010 and large number of requests for field inspections (378).

As the figure shows, many  of these farmers were in the northern and southern plains. According to  RMA officials, a region might have more farmers who received more than  $40,000 in premium subsidies because farmers in the region have large- acreage farms; produce high-value crops, such as sugar beets; or have  higher premium rates. For example, the average farm size in North  Dakota is 1,241 acres, but the average size nationwide is 418 acres. In  addition, high-value crops, such as sugar beets in North Dakota and fruits  and vegetables in California, contribute to higher premiums and premium  subsidies.

As we clearly state in the report, we do not recommend a $40,000  limit in premium subsidies per crop insurance participant. Instead, as  we stated, we used $40,000 as an example of a premium subsidy limit  and noted that setting a premium subsidy limit higher or lower would  have corresponding effects on cost savings. In this connection, we  provided information on the potential savings that would result if  premium subsidies were limited to $100,000. Furthermore, limits on  premium subsidies would not prevent potentially affected farmers from  enrolling all of their crop acres in the crop insurance program and  receiving claim payments when a loss occurs. The report also notes  that savings could result from reducing the subsidy amount for all  farmers participating in the program, or both limiting and reducing  these subsidies. In proposing these changes to the crop insurance  program, we also identified other considerations that would come into  play, including the potential effect on large farms\u2019 financial condition  and on participation in the crop insurance program. 2.  We disagree. This report does show regions of the country that would  be more affected by a limit on premium subsidies. On page 19, we  state that many of the participating farmers who received more than  $40,000 in premium subsidies were in the northern and southern  plains. Additional information on the locations of participating farmers  who received more than $40,000 in premium subsidies for 2011 is  presented in appendix III. 3.  An assessment of the availability of credit to the agricultural sector  was not the focus of our work, but our review of data from USDA\u2019s  Agricultural Resource Management Survey shows that larger farms,  which are more likely to be affected by a limit on premium subsidies,  generally have stronger financial ratios and credit worthiness than  other farms participating in the crop insurance program. (See pages  21 and 22 of this report.) Furthermore, since we sent our draft report  to USDA for comment, we identified two Federal Reserve Bank  reports\u2014one from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and one  from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2014that reported that  credit conditions for farmers are favorable. In addition, if premium  subsidies were limited, an affected farmer could still purchase crop  insurance, although the premiums might not be subsidized or  subsidized less than currently. Thus, an affected farmer would not  lose access to credit.  4.  USDA did not adjust its estimate of affected crop insurance  participants and savings in premium subsidies to reflect how a limit on  premium subsidies might actually be implemented. That is, we  assume that any subsidy limit would be administered as USDA\u2019s Farm  Service Agency (FSA) administers payment limits for other farm  programs\u2014allocating the benefits according to the interest holders in  the farming operation. Most participants in the crop insurance  program also participate in other farm programs that FSA administers,  and many of these other farm programs have payment limits based on  benefits that are attributed to each interest holder in a farming  operation. As explained in our methodology, in developing our  estimate for a potential $40,000 subsidy limit, we used the payment  share of each interest holder as recorded in FSA\u2019s validated Permitted  Entity database, which FSA uses to ensure compliance with payment  limit rules for farm programs. Using FSA\u2019s information on the payment  share of each interest holder, we attributed subsidies for each crop  insurance policy to the interest holders in the policy. Therefore, we  estimated that up to 33,690 participating farmers would have been  affected in 2011 by a reduced subsidy, for a savings of up to $1 billion  if a $40,000 subsidy limit were applied. We believe our analysis  provides a reasonable estimate of the number of participating farmers  who might be affected by a limit on premium subsidies and the dollars  that might be saved. (See app. I for more information on our  methodology.) 5.  As we note in this report, a limit on crop insurance premium subsidies  would affect more farmers in some areas of the country than in other  areas. We also note in the report that large farms are better  positioned than smaller farms to pay a higher share of their premiums.  Furthermore, a higher limit on premium subsidies would affect fewer  farmers. In addition, limits on farm program benefits already have  disproportionate impacts. For example, under the Supplemental  Revenue Assistance Payments program and Noninsured Crop  Disaster Assistance program, annual payments are limited to  $100,000, which disproportionately affects farmers in regions that are  more prone to natural disasters.", "In addition to a limit on premium subsidies, this report also examines  reducing premium subsidy rates for all farmers, which would have a  more proportionate effect across states and regions. However, it  would also reduce subsidies for those who may be less able to afford  higher premiums, particularly beginning and limited resource farmers,  as well as socially disadvantaged farmers.  6.  We do not agree that it would be virtually impossible to  administratively track and control a limit on premium subsidies. Most  farmers participating in the crop insurance program also participate in  other farm programs that FSA administers. Many of the farm  programs FSA administers already limit the payments an individual  can receive. Therefore, we believe that FSA\u2019s methods\u2014which  account for complicating factors such as the organization of farm  businesses and multiple crops in multiple counties, and even multiple  programs\u2014could be applied to a limit on premium subsidies for crop  insurance and that any addition to administrative burdens would not  be significant. Moreover, as we stated in our report, premium subsidy  rates vary by the level of insurance coverage that the farmer chooses  and the geographic diversity of the crops insured. If RMA is capable of  tracking these different subsidy rates, we believe USDA can also  administer a subsidy limit. 7.  We believe it would not be impractical to administer a limit on  premium subsidies because of differences in dates and insurance  periods. FSA attributes benefits to each individual or entity for each  program that it administers. For each participant in a given program,  payments are summed across all entities, crops, and counties for the  crop year. Regarding livestock insurance, the amount of insurance  purchased in comparison with crop insurance is very small. Moreover,  this report did not discuss combining limits on premium subsidies for  livestock insurance and crop insurance. 8.  We do not agree that a limit on premium subsidies would prevent  farmers from making sound and informed insurance choices. Under  the crop insurance program, the amounts of a farmer\u2019s premium  subsidy and premium expense are estimated during the period before  planting, when the farmer is making insurance choices. However,  insurance companies determine the actual premium later in the  growing season and bill the farmer at the end of the growing season.  Therefore, to the extent that a limit on premium subsidies introduces  additional uncertainty, it would likely be marginal.  9.  We believe it is unlikely that a limit on premium subsidies would affect  agricultural lenders\u2019 decisions in providing farm operating loans. It is  not clear how a limit on premium subsidies would introduce so much  uncertainty about the amount of a farmer\u2019s premium expenses that a  lender could not decide whether to provide financing. Agricultural  lenders already deal with a level of uncertainty about farmers\u2019  revenues and expenses. In addition, lenders could require borrowers  to purchase crop insurance.  10. As we stated in this report, the amount of savings from a limit on  premium subsidies may depend on whether, and to what extent,  farmers and legal entities reorganized their business to avoid or  lessen the effect of limits on premium subsidies. In addition, some  farmers would likely begin to report their spouse as a member of the  farming operation, which, under payment limit rules, enables an  operation to double the amount of benefits it can receive. Regarding  potential reorganizations, most of the farmers and legal entities who  participate in the crop insurance program also participate in FSA  programs, and many of them have already reorganized their business  because of these programs\u2019 payment limits. These farmers and legal  entities would be unlikely to reorganize further in response to a limit  on premium subsidies. In addition, in some instances, the requirement  that an individual or entity be actively engaged in farming to receive  farm program benefits is likely to prevent the creation of entities in  order to avoid a limit on premium subsidies. Furthermore, the 2008  farm bill decreased the incentive to reorganize a farming operation in  order to avoid a limit on farm program payments by eliminating the  \u201cthree-entity rule\u201d and requiring direct attribution of payments to  individuals. 11. This report includes information about how crop insurance  participation and coverage levels may relate to spending on ad hoc  disaster assistance. The report also notes that in view of the nation\u2019s  budgetary pressures, Congress may be less willing to approve ad hoc  disaster assistance payments than it has in the past. In addition, the  Administration\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2013 budget addresses  participation and ad hoc disaster assistance and states, \u201cWith current  participation rates, the deep premium subsidies are no longer  needed.\u201d  12. In addition to federal cost savings, our report discussed several  considerations that would come into play with limits on premium  subsidies. Furthermore, we noted that FSA has extensive experience  in administering limits on farm program benefits, which USDA does  not recognize in its comments. We believe RMA could benefit from  FSA\u2019s experience in administering payment limits.  13. We recognize that FSA, like most federal agencies, faces resource  constraints. However, as we have previously reported, effective  strategies help set priorities and allocate resources to inform decision  making and help ensure accountability. Such priority setting and  resource allocation is especially important in a fiscally constrained  environment.  14. We clarified the language to say that insurance companies should  receive the results of all inspections that have been completed. This  effort would not entail additional work on the part of FSA. RMA\u2019s data  mining contractor told us that it could complete this activity within a  few days after an inspection was completed. 15. We are pleased that RMA is developing guidance and believe that this  guidance may be a good first step towards increasing insurance  companies\u2019 focus on anomalous agents and loss adjusters, who  warrant greater attention. However, we continue to believe that  directing insurance companies to focus more attention on these  agents and loss adjusters during annual performance reviews would  produce additional benefits. 16. It is unclear from RMA\u2019s response whether it agrees or disagrees with  our recommendation. However, we continue to believe that the data  mining contractor needs additional data from insurance company  reviews in order to improve data mining and specific direction from the  government to collect these data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Susan Offutt, Chief Economist;  Thomas M.
