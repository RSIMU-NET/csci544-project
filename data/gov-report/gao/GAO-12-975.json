When facing uncertainty, businesses  tend to delay investments that cannot be easily recovered, such as  investments in expanding a hotel or building a new golf course; by  delaying investments, businesses keep their options open until more  information becomes available. For example, if a hotel in the CNMI were  trying to decide whether to expand its operation by adding new rooms, it  currently would face significant uncertainty regarding its future cost  structure and its access to foreign workers. In 2009, labor costs  accounted for approximately one-third of a hotel\u2019s operating cost,  according to a survey of CNMI businesses that we conducted. Without  access to foreign workers, a hotel might have to increase its wage rate  significantly to attract enough U.S. workers with the specific skills, such  as the ability to speak a foreign language.

Further, in the case of a change of  employment, DHS authorized the worker to begin the new  employment upon filing of the new petition.", "Permit preferences. DHS made no changes to the final rule to give  first preference for worker permits to foreign workers already living  and working in the CNMI. However, DHS did make a significant  change to its work authorization regulations to authorize the continued  employment of beneficiaries of CW-1 petitions filed on or before  November 27, 2011, for lawfully present workers and pending  adjudication of the petitions. According to DHS, this provision allowed  large numbers of workers whose work authorization under their former  CNMI government-authorized \u201cumbrella permits\u201d expired on that date  to continue their employment while USCIS worked through the  petitions filed for them.", "Exclusions of occupational categories. DHS did not exclude any  occupational categories from the final rule, such as dancing, domestic  workers, or hospitality service workers. DHS said it had considered  excluding these categories in the interim rule because of human  trafficking concerns. DHS also strengthened the attestations required  of petitioning employers regarding compliance with applicable laws,  and emphasized the limits on the ability of individual households to  petition for domestic workers stemming from the rule\u2019s requirements  that established that legitimate businesses file petitions.", "DHS made other minor changes to the final rule to clarify certain  references or remove references that were no longer relevant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Emil Friberg, Assistant Director;  Kira Self; Ben Bolitzer; Ashley Alley; Ming Chen; and Reid Lowe made  key contributions to this report.
