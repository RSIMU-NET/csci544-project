Under the existing initiative, many countries are unlikely to achieve their debt relief targets, primarily because their export earnings are likely to be significantly less than projected by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). GAO assessed (1) the projected multilateral development banks' funding shortfall for the existing initiative and (2) the amount of funding, including development assistance, needed to help countries achieve economic growth and debt relief targets. The Treasury, World Bank, and African Development Bank commented that historical export growth rates are not good predictors of the future because significant structural changes are under way in many countries that could lead to greater growth. We consider these historical rates to be a more realistic gauge of future growth because of these countries' reliance on highly volatile primary commodities and other vulnerabilities such as HIV/AIDS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The three key multilateral development banks we analyzed face a funding shortfall of $7.8 billion in 2003 present value terms, or 54 percent of their total commitment, under the existing HIPC Initiative. The World Bank has the most significant shortfall--$6 billion. The African Development Bank has a gap of about $1.2 billion. Neither has determined how it would close this gap. The Inter-American Development Bank is fully funding its HIPC obligation by reducing its future lending resources to poor countries by $600 million beginning in 2009. We estimate that the cost to the United States, based on its rate of contribution to these banks, could be an additional $1.8 billion. However, the total estimated funding gap is understated because (1) the World Bank does not include costs for four countries for which data are unreliable and (2) all three banks do not include estimates for additional relief that may be required because countries' economies deteriorated after they qualified for debt relief. Even if the $7.8 billion gap is fully financed, we estimate that the 27 countries that have qualified for debt relief may need more than $375 billion to help them achieve their economic growth and debt relief targets by 2020. This $375 billion consists of $153 billion in expected development assistance, $215 billion to cover lower export earnings, and at least $8 billion in debt relief. Most countries are likely to experience higher debt burdens and lower export earnings than the World Bank and IMF project, leading to an estimated $215 billion shortfall over 18 years. To reach debt targets, we estimate that countries will need between $8 billion and $20 billion, depending on the strategy chosen. Under these strategies, multilateral creditors switch a portion of their loans to grants and/or donors pay countries' debt service that exceeds 5 percent of government revenue.

In 1999, in response to  concerns about the continuing vulnerability of these countries, the World  Bank and the IMF agreed to enhance the HIPC Initiative by more than  doubling the estimated amount of debt relief and increasing the number of  potentially eligible countries. A major goal of the HIPC Initiative is to  provide recipient countries with a permanent exit from unsustainable debt  burdens.", "Under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, countries seeking debt relief must first  carry out economic and social reforms under specified programs. At a  country\u2019s decision point, the World Bank and the IMF assess the country\u2019s  eligibility to receive debt relief under the initiative. At the completion point,  the World Bank and the IMF assess whether the country has continued to  implement sound economic policies and is eligible to receive full debt  relief. To determine the amount of assistance that is required for each  country to achieve debt sustainability, the World Bank and the IMF prepare  detailed economic analyses called debt sustainability analyses (DSA),  which include economic projections covering 20 years. To date, 27 poor  countries have reached their decision points, and 10 of these have reached  completion points.

Under this strategy, no additional countries become debt  sustainable other than the 12 that are already projected to be debt  sustainable with no further assistance. While this strategy would free  significant resources for poverty reduction expenditures, it could provide  an incentive for countries to pursue irresponsible borrowing policies. By  guaranteeing that no country would have to pay more than 5 percent of its  revenue in debt service, this strategy would separate the amount of a  country\u2019s borrowing from the amount of its debt repayment. Consequently,  it could encourage countries to borrow more than they are normally able to  repay, increasing the cost to donors and reducing the resources available  for other countries.", "The third strategy combines strategies 1 and 2 to achieve both debt  sustainability and a lower debt-service burden.

We  also found that the optimal percentage of loans switched to grants  necessary for each country to achieve debt sustainability increases from  33.5 percent when grants fill the shortfall to 55.6 percent when loans and  grants fill the shortfall, thus increasing the cost to donors. Providing grants  alone is more cost effective because it avoids the build up of debt,  improving countries\u2019 likelihood of achieving debt sustainability and  reducing the need for more debt relief in the future. The range in total cost  of debt relief reflects the variation in additional costs, from $8.5 billion to  $27.8 billion, in addition to the $153 billion in expected baseline  development assistance donors provide and the $215 billion needed to  cover the shortfall in countries\u2019 export earnings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Switching a Constant Percentage of Loans to Grants for All Countries", "paragraphs": ["The strategies we examined in this report determined the minimum  percentage of grants necessary for each country to achieve debt  sustainability and resulted in a different percentage of grants for each  country.

For example, we  estimate that switching 50 percent of new loans to grants would result in  seven fewer countries achieving debt sustainability than would providing  the minimum percentage of grants. Switching 50 percent of new loans to  grants would cost over $6 billion more (see table 7). These options,  therefore, are not the most cost-effective means of maximizing debt  sustainability.", "In addition to the strategies mentioned in the report, you asked us to  analyze the cost and impact of four specific options for increasing debt  relief to poor countries.

With 20-percent grants, we estimate that 14  countries would achieve debt sustainability, while 18 would do so with 50- percent grants (see table 8). In each option, all countries would also reach  the 5- or 10-percent debt service goal, as specified.

The export earnings  of these countries experience large year-to-year fluctuations due to their  heavy reliance on primary commodities, weather extremes, natural  disasters, and other factors. We found that higher export volatility, along  with lower average growth rates, lowers a country\u2019s likelihood of achieving  debt sustainability. For example, under the World Bank and IMF export  growth assumptions, which are usually higher than historical growth rates,  all 27 HIPC countries are projected to be debt sustainable in 2020.  However, we found that negative shocks tend to have greater impact on  debt sustainability than positive shocks. After factoring in the impact of  export growth volatility, we found that countries will not consistently  achieve debt sustainability, with the average likelihood of achieving  sustainability at 84 percent, despite the assumption of high export growth.   We estimate that 10 countries have less than an 80-percent likelihood of  achieving debt sustainability due to export volatility, with Rwanda having  the lowest probability at 57 percent (see table 12).  Countries with low  export volatility, such as Honduras, tend to have a high likelihood of  achieving debt sustainability under the high World Bank and IMF growth  rates.", "Under historical export growth rates, which are usually lower than  assumed in the World Bank and IMF projection, volatility reduces these  countries\u2019 likelihood of achieving debt sustainability even further. On  average, we estimate that the likelihood of achieving debt sustainability is  only 45 percent for the 27 HIPC countries, under historical export growth  rates. Five countries, all of which had on average negative historic growth,  are estimated to have less than a 10-percent likelihood of achieving debt  sustainability. Since volatility in export earnings reduces countries\u2019  likelihood of achieving debt sustainability, it is also likely to further  increase donors\u2019 cost, as countries will require an even greater than  expected level of debt relief to achieve debt sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of the Treasury  letter, dated April 2, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Treasury said the report leaves the impression that very large amounts  of money, substantially above previously projected costs, will be  required to be paid in substantial part by American taxpayers in future  years. We agree that the challenge of achieving high economic growth  rates, while maintaining debt sustainability, will likely require a  substantial commitment of resources from the donors, including the  United States, beyond what is currently projected by the World Bank  and IMF. 2. Treasury said the report should have clearly reported the existence of  international agreements for financing HIPC as they relate to the  multilateral development banks and that contributions have thus far  largely met commitments. We recognized throughout the report the  donor community\u2019s commitment to financing HIPC. However, under  the agreed upon pay-as-you-go financing arrangement, funding has not  been identified for large emerging financing shortfalls. We consider it to  be fiscally prudent to estimate the full magnitude of the donor\u2019s  financial commitment. 3. Treasury said there has been no indication since October 2002 of any  further financing gap in the HIPC Trust Fund. Our report refers to  financing challenges over the life of the initiative, not specifically to the  HIPC Trust Fund at this point in time, as reflected by the donor\u2019s pay-as-  you-go approach. Under the current pay-as-you-go approach, we did  not identify a gap in the HIPC Trust Fund. However, as Treasury  recognizes in its letter, there are several factors that are likely to result  in the need for additional resources in the future. Our report provides  estimates of those and other emerging additional costs. 4. Treasury said it is not convinced that our cost estimates for the AfDB  are correct. We consider our estimate to be more accurate because it  accounts for the actual amount of resources the AfDB has identified to  contribute to the initiative and converts the estimate into 2003 dollars.  For example, although the AfDB expects to provide $662 million  (nominal) as it share of the HIPC Initiative it has only identified $370  million (nominal) thus far. 5. Treasury disagrees with the assertion that the enhanced HIPC Initiative  was intended to ensure an exit from unsustainable debt burdens. We  disagree. Numerous official World Bank and IMF documents as recent  as 2003 affirm that a permanent, lasting, or durable exit from  unsustainable debt remains a central objective of the HIPC Initiative.  While the Treasury may have retreated from this objective, the World  Bank and IMF have not. 6. Treasury also said achieving the aspiration of debt sustainability for  poor countries requires a combination of elements. The report states  that our estimates assume that the countries will follow their World  Bank and IMF development programs, including undertaking  recommended reforms and achieving economic growth rates  consistent with reducing poverty and maintaining long-term debt  sustainability 7. The Treasury said the report contains various cost projections largely  unrelated to the current Enhanced HIPC Initiative. We disagree. At least  95 percent of our cost projections directly pertain to achieving the  goals of the initiative\u2014helping countries achieve economic growth and  maintain long-term debt sustainability. The remaining amount is our  estimate of the cost of achieving a second debt target\u2014a debt service- to-government revenue of less than 5 percent\u2014requested by the  committee. 8. Treasury said that a recent World Bank/IMF study demonstrates that,  while overall the projections were optimistic, almost half the countries  have exceeded their original export projections. We do not believe that  strong short-term (2 to 3 years) export growth necessarily constitutes a  long-term trend. HIPC countries have historically experienced great  volatility in their export earnings. It is not uncommon to see substantial  increases in their export earnings for a few years followed by  substantial declines. Although some countries have experienced high  growth in recent years, sustaining that growth over 20 years or more is  a difficult challenge. 9. Treasury said that it remains unconvinced that using an export growth  average for the past 20 years is the best way to project future export  growth. As noted in our previous reports, World Bank/IMF projected  export growth rates have been optimistic\u2014overall, more than double  historical rates. We consider historical export growth rates to be more  realistic, given these countries\u2019 reliance on highly volatile commodities  and other vulnerabilities. For example, the increasing prevalence of  HIV/AIDS in many poor countries will likely have substantial negative  effects on a broad range of economic variables, including export  growth."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from The World Bank", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the World Bank letter, dated  March 31, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The World Bank disagreed with the assumption that any deviation from  a projected debt profile would be offset only by additional debt relief or  compensatory financing. We disagree with the Bank\u2019s characterization  of the report. The report explicitly states that donors have the option of  not financing the export shortfalls; however, this will hamper countries\u2019  economic growth and reduce the funds available for poverty reduction.  We assume, consistent with World Bank and IMF projections, that  countries are following their reform and development programs. Hence  we assumed that the other key elements of an effective development  strategy are in place. 2. The World Bank said that the HIPC Initiative has never committed to  debt relief targets in 2020. While we agree with this technical  distinction, we note that debt sustainability analyses project all HIPC  countries to have net present value debt-to-export ratios at or below  150 percent in 2020. Therefore, we chose 2020 because it represented  the final year in World Bank and IMF projections. 3. The World Bank said that our methodology to assess the financing  needs of HIPCs can be improved to recognize the very important efforts  made by these countries themselves. As the report states, our analysis  assumes that government revenue and GDP will grow at the optimistic  rates projected by the World Bank and IMF because countries are  expected to be undertaking recommended structural and policy  reforms.  4.
