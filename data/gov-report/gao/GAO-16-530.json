Through several grant programs, EPA headquarters and 10 regional offices award these grants to a variety of recipients, including state and local governments. EPA provides guidance through directives that seek to ensure the appropriate use of funds and achievement of environmental results or public health protection, among other purposes. GAO was asked to review how EPA monitors environmental and other grant results. This report examines (1) how EPA awards grants, (2) the federal and EPA requirements for monitoring grant and program results, and (3) how EPA monitors its grants to ensure that environmental and other program results are achieved. GAO analyzed relevant federal laws, regulations, and EPA guidance; reviewed processes for ensuring that environmental results are achieved for the three EPA program offices that award the majority of EPA grant dollars; and interviewed EPA officials and officials from eight state environmental agencies\u2014selected based on the amount of environmental funding they receive from EPA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) generally awards three different categories of grants: formula, categorical, and discretionary. According to EPA data, in fiscal year 2015, EPA awarded the majority of its grant funds\u2014 $2.25 billion of $3.95 billion (57 percent)\u2014as formula grants, primarily to states to support water infrastructure based on funding formulas prescribed by law. EPA awarded $1.09 billion (about 28 percent) of its grant funds as categorical grants. These grants were generally awarded noncompetitively, mostly to states and Indian tribes to operate environmental programs. EPA determines the amount of funding each grantee receives based on agency formula or program factors. EPA awarded $0.513 billion (about 13 percent) in discretionary grants for specific activities, such as research. EPA also awarded $0.09 billion (2 percent) in grant funds to special appropriations act projects for specific drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects in specific communities.", "Multiple federal and agency requirements and guidelines apply to monitoring grant and grant program results. For example, under EPA regulations, grantees must submit performance reports to EPA at least annually. EPA policies and guidance, such as its environmental results directive, call for EPA program officials to review performance reports to determine if the grantee achieved the planned results and for program offices to report on significant grant results through other processes, such as submissions to EPA databases. EPA incorporates requirements related to grantee reporting frequency, content, and reporting processes into grant terms and conditions.", "EPA monitors performance reports and program-specific data from grantees to ensure that grants achieve environmental and other program results. However, GAO found that certain practices may hinder EPA's ability to efficiently monitor some results and increase administrative burden. For example, EPA collects some information from grantees twice\u2014once in a performance report and once in a database\u2014because EPA uses the information for different purposes. GAO's prior work and EPA analyses have shown that duplication of efforts can increase administrative costs and reduce the funds available for other priorities. By identifying grant programs where existing data reporting can meet EPA's performance reporting requirements, the agency can help reduce duplicative reporting for grantees. Also, GAO's review of grantee performance reports found issues that may hinder EPA's ability to efficiently identify factors affecting grantee results. For example, because grantees submit performance reports in a written format, there are no built-in quality controls to ensure these reports' consistency with EPA's environmental results directive. Rather, EPA officials must perform a manual review. A 2014 analysis of EPA's grants management processes found that EPA relied heavily on manual processes and could incorporate improvements into its new grants management database system. EPA officials said they plan to develop a web-based portal for grantees to submit documents, such as performance reports. By incorporating built-in data quality controls, such as required fields, for performance reports into its planned web-based portal, EPA could improve these reports' consistency with the environmental results directive and reduce the administrative burden of performing manual reviews."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that EPA (1) reduce duplicative reporting by identifying grant programs where existing data reporting can meet EPA's performance reporting requirements and (2) incorporate data quality controls for performance reports into its planned web-based portal.

For example, in 2014, EPA\u2019s  Office of Inspector General found that EPA did not enforce reporting  requirements for grantees to provide data that would demonstrate the  effects the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund has on public health.  Additionally, in an August 2015 report, we found that EPA had made  progress monitoring agency-wide compliance with certain grants  management directives, such as EPA policies, by electronically tracking  unspent grant funds and grantee submission of required reports in a  timely manner. However, we found that two key challenges hampered  EPA\u2019s efforts to monitor agency-wide compliance with such directives.  First, several EPA regional offices use paper files to document  compliance, so monitoring these offices\u2019 compliance with directives  requires resource-intensive manual file reviews. Second, the limited  reporting and analysis capabilities of its information technology (IT)  systems leaves EPA without agency-wide information for most of the  directive requirements we reviewed. EPA officials planned to fully  implement an updated IT system by 2017. We recommended that EPA  could better monitor agency-wide compliance with grants management  directives by developing ways to more effectively use existing web-based  tools until it implements its new IT system. EPA agreed with our findings  and recommendations.", "You asked us to examine how EPA monitors environmental and other  results from its grants.

We identified 45 programs that  award grants within the three program offices we reviewed, from the  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. For each of the 45 grant  programs, we searched EPA\u2019s grants management databases for  relevant performance reports.

Additionally, officials  we spoke with from several states said that electronic reporting had  certain benefits. EPA officials told us that collecting certain information  electronically from grantees allows EPA to access and analyze grant and  program results more efficiently than it can for results collected in a  written format, because EPA officials do not have to manually enter  information into a data system for analysis. Additionally, in response to  information-sharing problems\u2014such as incompatible computer systems,  manual data entry, and differing data structures across program offices\u2014 EPA and the Environmental Council of States formed the Environmental  Information Exchange Network (Exchange Network) in 1998, an  information-sharing partnership that uses a common, standardized format  so that EPA, states, and other partners can share environmental data  across different data systems. As a result, EPA and its partners may  access and use environmental data more efficiently, according to  Exchange Network documents.

Additionally, we  interviewed representatives from the Environmental Council of States\u2014 an association of state environmental agency leaders\u2014and a  nongeneralizable sample of officials from environmental agencies in eight  states\u2014California, Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, New York, North  Carolina, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia\u2014to obtain their perspectives  on EPA\u2019s monitoring processes for grants. We selected these eight  states because they received the greatest amount of funding from the  federal government, according to an Environmental Council of States\u2019  analysis of state environmental budgets data in 2012, the most recent  publicly available data. The results of our interviews with officials from  these agencies cannot be generalized to those of states not included in  our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 through July  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Additional Information on GAO\u2019s Review of 23 EPA Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["Table 5 summarizes the scope of our review of grantee performance  reports.", "Table 6 provides information on which program-specific databases we  reviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Environmental Protection Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michael Hix (Assistant Director),  Amy Bowser, Cindy Gilbert, Taylor Hadfield, Thomas James, Benjamin  Licht, Kimberly McGatlin, Alison O\u2019Neill, Danny Royer, Jeanette Soares,  Sara Sullivan, Kiki Theodoropoulos, and Lisa Van Arsdale made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
