FAMS deploys air marshals on selected flights to address such threats and is a key component of TSA's approach to aviation security. However, longstanding challenges faced by FAMS's workforce could impact its ability to carry out its mission.", "GAO was asked to review FAMS workforce issues. This report addresses (1) the extent to which FAMS has taken steps to address air marshals' health concerns, (2) the extent to which FAMS has taken steps to address air marshals' concerns about their work schedules, and (3) the number of discrimination complaints FAMS employees have reported and the extent to which FAMS has taken steps to prevent discrimination.", "GAO analyzed TSA and FAMS policies; documentation of efforts to address air marshals' quality of life issues; and FAMS data on missions, schedules, and discrimination complaints.

Air marshals in all six field offices we visited noted health issues, such as sleep deprivation, as a key quality of life concern. FAMS has taken steps to assess air marshals' individual health, such as requiring medical exams, but has not comprehensively assessed the overall health of its workforce and has not developed a plan to do so. FAMS officials stated that it would be difficult to analyze air marshals' medical records because they are not stored electronically, though they are researching options to do so. FAMS could develop and implement a plan to analyze the employee health data it already collects to identify workforce trends, and use this information to better promote employee welfare consistent with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) leadership principles.", "FAMS has taken some steps to address air marshals' concerns about their work schedules. In March 2018, FAMS revised its deployment strategy to expand coverage of certain high risk missions that it typically learns of 72 hours in advance. Following this, changes to air marshals' schedules to accommodate these missions more than doubled. In response, FAMS altered how it staffs these missions and reports that these modifications have reduced schedule changes. FAMS also maintains shift length and rest period guidelines intended to balance mission needs with air marshals' quality of life. However, FAMS does not monitor the extent to which air marshals' actual work hours are consistent with guidelines because it has not identified a need to do so. As a result, it cannot determine how frequently air marshals work beyond guidelines and is not well-positioned to manage risks associated with long work hours.", "From fiscal years 2016 through 2018, FAMS employees filed 230 discrimination complaints with TSA's Civil Rights Division, though employees may have reported additional discrimination complaints through other means. In 2012, FAMS adopted an action plan to address discrimination and has taken some steps called for in the plan, such as sustaining a FAMS Ombudsman position. However, due to a loss of management focus on the plan, FAMS has not fully implemented other planned efforts, such as holding diversity focus groups. Taking steps to reaffirm its efforts to prevent discrimination would demonstrate leadership commitment to reducing concerns of discrimination within FAMS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to FAMS, including that it implement a plan to assess the health of the FAMS workforce, monitor the extent that air marshals' shifts are consistent with guidelines, and strengthen efforts to prevent discrimination.

Attacks involving aircraft and airports in Egypt, Somalia,  Belgium, and Turkey underscore the continued threat to aviation and the  need for effective aviation security measures. To help address such  threats, the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS), an office within the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), is tasked with promoting  confidence in the nation\u2019s civil aviation system through the deployment of  air marshals to protect U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews.  To accomplish this mission, FAMS deploys armed federal law  enforcement officers\u2014air marshals\u2014to provide an onboard security  presence on selected flights of United States air carriers travelling within  the United States and around the world. TSA, within the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), considers FAMS to be an integral component  of its risk-based security strategy.", "FAMS has faced longstanding challenges addressing the impacts of air  marshals\u2019 heavy travel requirements and often unpredictable schedules  on their quality of life. For example, in 2003, we reported that FAMS  lacked sufficiently detailed information to effectively monitor actual hours  worked by air marshals, which had implications for air marshals\u2019 quality of  life. In 2009, we reported that air marshals\u2019 quality of life issues included  long work hours, inconsistent start times, health issues such as  musculoskeletal injuries, and challenges obtaining adequate sleep. In  2013, a FAMS review of air marshal fitness noted that air marshals were  experiencing high injury rates during physical fitness assessments and  declining overall health and wellness, which they attributed in part to the  increasing age of air marshals.", "Air marshals have also raised concerns about age, gender, and racial  discrimination within FAMS. The DHS Office of Inspector General (DHS  OIG) reviewed allegations of discrimination and retaliation within FAMS  from 2010 through 2012. The DHS OIG\u2019s review did not support a finding  of widespread discrimination and retaliation within FAMS but found that  employees\u2019 perceptions of discrimination and retaliation were extensive.", "As a result, in 2012, FAMS created an action plan to prevent  discrimination.", "You requested that we evaluate FAMS\u2019s workforce issues, including air  marshals\u2019 quality of life, schedules, and discrimination complaints.

We chose these field offices to capture variation in: types of  missions, numbers of schedule changes, rates of discrimination  complaints, and field office size, among other things. In each field office  we held separate discussion sessions with air marshals and supervisory  federal air marshals (SFAMs) to obtain their perspectives on air marshals\u2019  quality of life, schedules, and issues related to discrimination within  FAMS. We also interviewed field office operations staff to learn about  their role in scheduling and field office management to get their  perspectives on all of these issues. Findings from our site visits cannot be  generalized to all FAMS field office locations but provide insight into air  marshals\u2019 quality of life, schedules, and discrimination issues within  FAMS. We also interviewed a TSA employee group (Women Executives  at FAMS), a professional association representing federal law  enforcement officers including air marshals (the Federal Law  Enforcement Officers Association), and the FAMS Ombudsman to learn  their perspectives.", "To address the first objective about the extent to which FAMS has taken  steps to address air marshals\u2019 health concerns, we reviewed our past  work as well as relevant studies and data on FAMS employees\u2019 health.  For example, we analyzed the results of the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) for  FAMS, TSA, and DHS employees in 2018, the most recent year available  as of October 2019. We also analyzed FAMS\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation  claim data for fiscal years 2013 (when FAMS reviewed air marshals\u2019  physical fitness) through 2018 (the most recent full fiscal year of data  available). To identify steps FAMS has taken to address air marshals\u2019  health concerns, we asked FAMS management officials, SFAMs, and air  marshals we met with in headquarters and field offices to identify any  such efforts. We then analyzed documentation related to FAMS medical  and fitness programs. This documentation included standards and  policies for medical examinations and health and fitness assessments.  We also interviewed senior FAMS officials and staff from the FAMS  Medical Programs Section about their efforts to understand the health  and wellness of the FAMS workforce and to address its health concerns.  We compared FAMS\u2019s efforts to address air marshals\u2019 health concerns to  OPM strategies for human capital management and TSA\u2019s strategic  planning documents.", "Regarding the second objective about the extent to which FAMS has  taken steps to address air marshals\u2019 concerns about their work  schedules, we reviewed FAMS\u2019s internal reports on air marshals\u2019  scheduled and actual work hours as well as standard operating  procedures that include scheduling guidelines and protocols for adjusting  air marshals\u2019 schedules. We met with FAMS Flight Operation Division  officials to learn about their efforts to reduce schedule unpredictability, to  monitor air marshals\u2019 shift lengths and rest periods and compare them to  scheduling guidelines, and to make scheduling guidelines and protocols  available to field offices. We analyzed data on the volume of changes to  air marshals\u2019 schedules from November 2016 to June 2019. We also  analyzed the length of air marshals\u2019 actual shifts using time and  attendance data for a stratified random sample of air marshals across  four different roster periods\u2014two in fiscal year 2018 and two in fiscal year  2019. We compared FAMS\u2019s efforts to monitor air marshals\u2019 work hours  and rest periods and to share scheduling protocols to two principles in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to the  need to implement control activities and use quality information to achieve  the entity\u2019s objectives.", "To address the third objective about the number of discrimination  complaints within FAMS, we analyzed record-level complaint data from  TSA\u2019s Civil Rights Division (CRD) and FAMS Incident Activity  Coordination and Trends Unit for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, record- level complaint data from TSA\u2019s National Resolution Center for fiscal year  2018 (the only year for which data were available), as well as information  on complaints brought to the DHS OIG by air marshals in fiscal years  2016 through 2018. We reviewed FAMS\u2019s 2012 action plan to prevent  discrimination and evidence of actions taken to address the steps in that  plan. For example, we reviewed DHS and TSA training materials from  2018, as well as Field Office Focus Group meeting minutes from all 20  FAMS field offices from fiscal years 2016 through 2018.

FAMS Flight Operations Division officials report  that they implemented a standby shift to staff SMCs in June 2018.  According to Flight Operations Division officials, FAMS typically staffed  SMCs using air marshals scheduled to domestic and international  missions, recovery shifts, or ground-based duties prior to the  implementation of the standby shift. Flight Operations Division officials  also report that they increased the number of scheduled standby shifts in  an effort to curtail schedule unpredictability. Based on our review of  FAMS data, the number of scheduled standby shifts more than tripled  from June 2018 to December 2018.

According to Flight Operations  Division officials, field office SACs reported that FAMS frequently  adjusted air marshals\u2019 scheduled start times for the single standby shift in  response to SMC requests. To reduce this schedule unpredictability,  Flight Operations Division officials reported that in November 2018, they  began scheduling air marshals to multiple standby shifts per day with  staggered start times, rather than just one shift per day. These officials  stated that they received positive feedback regarding this change during  management\u2019s subsequent field office visits. We asked air marshals in  four of the six field offices we visited for their perspectives on the  effectiveness of this change during discussion sessions and received  mixed feedback. Air marshals in two field offices stated that they thought  this change had improved SMC scheduling by reducing the number of  changes to standby shift start times.

Systems Operation Control Section officials noted that the magnitude of  adjustments to air marshals\u2019 standby shift start times is not always  significant.

Additionally, Flight Operations Division officials stated that they  continue to monitor data on SMC start times to identify the optimal  standby shift start times to reduce scheduling unpredictability.", "Improved coordination with field offices. In April 2019, FAMS  management issued guidance aimed at improving coordination between  the Mission Operations Center and field offices to reduce schedule  unpredictability. First, the guidance requires that the Mission Operations  Center obtain field office approval prior to adjusting an air marshal\u2019s  standby shift start time by more than 2 hours in order to staff an SMC.  Second, in situations where FAMS receives a SMC request with more  than 24 hours\u2019 notice and there are no available air marshals scheduled  to standby, Mission Operations Center and field office personnel are to  use air marshals scheduled to recovery shifts (if they are available and at  the field office\u2019s discretion) before pulling air marshals from non-SMC  missions to cover the request.

We chose these field offices to capture variation in the  following factors: the number of special mission coverage trips (SMCs) in  fiscal year 2018; the rate of schedule changes by field office in fiscal year  2018; the rate of equal employment opportunity complaints by field office  for fiscal years 2015 through 2018; the number of employees in each field  office as of September 2018; field office location; and results from the  Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) 2018 Federal Employee  Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). To obtain a range of perspectives on quality  of life issues, work schedules, and discrimination within FAMS, we  conducted discussion sessions with air marshals as well as separate  discussion sessions with supervisory federal air marshals (SFAMs) in  each field office.", "We conducted a total of ten discussion sessions with air marshals. We  initially conducted one discussion session with air marshals in the Seattle  field office\u2014where we spoke with approximately 15 air marshals\u2014and  one discussion session with air marshals in the Dallas field office\u2014where  we spoke with approximately 30 air marshals. Following these discussion  sessions, we developed a standardized list of questions used to facilitate  two discussion sessions with approximately 10 air marshals each, in each  of the remaining four field offices (Atlanta, Los Angeles, Newark, and New  York). We also conducted a total of six discussion sessions exclusively with SFAMs\u2014one session in each field office that we visited. The  discussion session in the Seattle field office consisted of two SFAMs,  while all others consisted of approximately 10 SFAMs. Following  discussion sessions with SFAMs in the Seattle and Dallas field offices,  the team developed a standardized list of questions that was used by a  moderator in meetings with SFAMS in the remaining four field offices. For  discussion sessions with air marshals and SFAMs, we requested that  each field office make available a diverse group of participants, to include  women and minorities.", "These were semi-structured discussions, led by a moderator who  followed a standardized list of questions and allowed for unstructured  follow-up questions. The results from these group discussions are not  generalizable to air marshals or SFAMs who did not participate in them,  but they provided a range of perspectives from about 125 air marshals  and about 50 SFAMs spanning the six FAMS field offices we visited. In  each field office we visited we also interviewed field office management  officials about these same topics. Finally, we interviewed field office  operations staff in four of the six field offices about their role in scheduling  air marshals. To obtain additional perspectives on these topics, we  interviewed a TSA employee group (Women Executives at FAMS); a  professional association representing federal law enforcement officers,  including air marshals (the Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association); and the FAMS Ombudsman.", "To address the first objective about air marshals\u2019 health concerns, we  reviewed prior research on FAMS workforce issues including our past  reports on challenges associated with FAMS\u2019s workforce; a 2012 FAMS- commissioned Harvard Medical School study on air marshal sleep and  fatigue; and reports from FAMS working groups that examined medical  issues and physical fitness.", "To identify air marshals\u2019 current concerns about health issues, we asked  air marshals about any quality of life issues they face during discussion  sessions.

We reviewed documentation related to these efforts including FAMS\u2019s  policies outlining medical standards for air marshals and its Health,  Fitness, and Wellness program, as well as FAMS analyses of health  issues among air marshals, workers\u2019 compensation claims, and on-the- job injuries. For example, we examined (a) minutes from two FAMS  meetings when FAMS Medical Programs Section officials reported on  medical and health issues among air marshals; (b) summary information  from TSA\u2019s Occupational Safety, Health, and Environment Division  describing air marshals\u2019 worker compensation claims from fiscal years  2015 through 2018; (c) an analysis of injuries and illnesses reported by  air marshals from calendar years 2016 through 2018.", "We also reviewed information about FAMS practices for maintaining  medical and health information about air marshals.

We found these data to be  sufficiently reliable for use in our analysis.", "To identify the lengths of air marshals\u2019 shifts when they flew missions, we  analyzed 808 air marshal time sheets. We first selected four separate  28-day periods, known as roster periods, during which air marshals flew  missions. Our analysis included air marshals scheduled to fly or on  recovery shifts on 11 or more days during the selected roster periods.  This resulted in a total of 7,981 roster periods worked by air marshals as  our population of interest. To help ensure the sample included air  marshals from field offices that had high rates of SMCs for each roster  period, we stratified our population into eight mutually exclusive strata  based on the roster period and the percentage of each field office\u2019s  missions that were SMCs in each roster period. We then randomly  selected a stratified sample of 101 air marshals from each roster period  proportionally allocated across the SMC percentage strata within each  roster period.", "Using these data for these air marshals, we analyzed the length of air  marshals\u2019 shifts when they flew domestic and international missions to  identify shifts that were (1) consistent with or (2) exceeded scheduling  guidelines. For example, we analyzed time sheets to estimate the  percentage of roster periods worked by air marshals that included one or  more shifts longer than 10 hours. We also analyzed time sheets to  estimate the percentage of roster periods worked by air marshals that  included one or more shifts between 10 and 12 hours and to estimate the  percentage of roster periods worked by air marshals that included one or  more shifts longer than 12 hours.", "We also examined the number of air marshals\u2019 regular days off.  Specifically, we analyzed air marshals\u2019 time sheets to estimate the  percentage of roster periods worked by air marshals that included less  than 8 regular days off. In performing this analysis, we did not count days  as regular days off when air marshals reported receiving a regular day off  but also reported time worked for the same day, unless the time worked  was carryover from a prior workday.", "In conducting these time sheet analyses, we took steps to minimize  issues that might affect data reliability. Specifically, we identified time and  attendance sheets that included errors that would impact our analysis\u2014 such as those with missing values\u2014and either excluded them or obtained  corrected information from FAMS. We excluded a total of 44 of the 404  roster periods initially selected in our sample. We also performed an  analysis to ensure that by excluding these timesheets we did not  introduce bias into our sample. We found no evidence of bias and  concluded the sample data was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  producing population estimates. The results of our analysis are  generalizable to the roster periods analyzed.", "To identify steps FAMS has taken to address air marshals\u2019 concerns  about their schedules, we interviewed management officials from FAMS\u2019s  Flight Operations Division about their efforts to (1) monitor air marshals\u2019  shifts and rest against scheduling guidelines and (2) make scheduling  protocols available to staff. We compared FAMS\u2019s actions to address air  marshals\u2019 scheduling concerns to two principles in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government related to the need to implement  control activities and use quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s  objectives.", "To address the third objective about discrimination, we reviewed FAMS,  TSA, and DHS policies related to discrimination and interviewed FAMS,  TSA, and DHS officials to understand how FAMS employees report  discrimination complaints.
