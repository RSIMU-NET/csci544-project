Although still small, accounting for only 4 percent of U.S. goods exports in 2004, U.S. goods exports to China tripled, from $11 billion to $33 billion, and increased across virtually all major categories from 1995 to 2004. Over the same period, China went from the ninth-largest to the fifth-largest U.S. market for goods behind Canada, the European Union, Mexico, and Japan. Although smaller, U.S. services exports grew from $3 billion to $7 billion, from 1995 to 2004. Economic growth in China and liberalization of its market, including joining the WTO, are among the factors driving the impressive export growth. Despite rapid growth, U.S. goods exports to China have not kept pace with those of other countries, particularly exports from Asia. The U.S. share of world goods exports to China declined from 12 percent to 9 percent, from 1995 to 2004, while South Korea and Taiwan's shares increased and at times surpassed that of the United States. The decline is partly due to increased integrated production among China's neighbors; growing resource-based exports, such as oil, from smaller countries; and macroeconomic factors, including exchange rates. Sales to China by U.S. affiliates located in China grew faster and exceeded U.S. exports to China in 2003, $38 billion versus $35 billion, while U.S. foreign direct investment grew from $2 billion to $15 billion from 1995 to 2004. Growth in U.S. investment and affiliate sales, particularly for goods, is due at least in part to China's attraction as a growing economy, including its burgeoning domestic market, high productivity and low labor costs, and developing infrastructure."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["China has become an important nation within the global economy and a  major U.S. trading partner.

Trade expanded rapidly after the United States  and China signed a bilateral trade agreement in 1979. Total U.S.-China trade  increased from about $8 billion in 1985 to $20 billion in 1990 and to $57  billion in 1995, according to the Census Bureau. The economic reforms and  open investment policies that China initiated around the same time led to a  surge in demand for foreign goods and services to modernize the economy,  from infrastructure to industries. China\u2019s rapid economic growth, with its  real gross domestic product growing at an average annual rate of about 9.5  percent from 1980 to 2000, generated demand for raw materials and basic  commodities, such as steel, iron, and cotton. Economic growth also  enhanced the purchasing power of Chinese citizens, especially those living  in urban areas. This created a relatively large middle class with the ability  to buy foreign consumer goods and services. In addition, China joined the  WTO in December 2001, making it subject to the multilateral organization\u2019s  trade liberalizing requirements.", "While U.S. exports to China rose rapidly after 1980, U.S. imports from  China grew at an even faster pace, creating a large bilateral trade deficit  that continues to increase today. The deficit in goods ballooned from $6  million in 1985 to $34 billion in 1995 and to $162 billion in 2004, according  to the Census Bureau. This U.S. trade deficit with China in 2004 accounted  for almost 25 percent of the overall U.S. trade deficit. The U.S.-China trade  imbalance has gained much political and media attention in recent years  and has become a source of trade friction between the two countries. Some  policy makers, industry leaders, and labor groups believe that this trade  imbalance is costing United States jobs in industries trying to compete with  imports from China. Further, some plicy makers believe that this trade  imbalance may be due to China\u2019s unfair trade practices or its failure to meet  all of its WTO obligations. Some policy makers also believe that China\u2019s  currency is undervalued relative to the U.S. dollar, and thereby inhibits greater imports from the United States. The causes of the U.S. trade deficit  with China, or with the rest of the world, while complex, are rooted in part  in macroeconomic factors at home and abroad, such as national savings  and investment decisions, growth levels, monetary and fiscal policies,  changes in domestic and foreign prices, and exchange rates. For example,  when a country\u2019s budget deficit or domestic spending grows without  increases in domestic savings, foreign capital inflows can rise, affecting  exchange rates, leading to an increase in imports and deterioration in the  trade balance. China, Japan, and Europe have been the largest foreign  sources of these capital inflows to the United States in recent years. Some  experts remain less concerned about trade deficits because the inflow of  foreign capital allows a higher level of investment, benefiting the economy  as a whole.", "China\u2019s accession to the WTO in 2001, a complex process that took 15  years, resulted in commitments to further open and liberalize its economy  and offer a more predictable environment for trade and foreign investment  in accordance with WTO rules. In particular, China committed to gradually  eliminate or lower tariffs and nontariff barriers on a broad range of goods  and services. A subsequent survey of U.S. companies showed that they  expected China\u2019s membership to the WTO to have a positive impact on  their business operations.

First, U.S. exports have benefited from this  increasing demand in China. For example, a Department of Agriculture  report noted that U.S. cotton exports surged primarily because of the rapid  growth of China\u2019s textile and apparel industry, especially in 2005 after the  expiration of U.S. and other WTO members\u2019 import quotas under the WTO  Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. Another contributing factor was  cotton shortage following a poor Chinese harvest in 2003. In addition, U.S.  exports of integrated circuits\u2014a key component of consumer electronics,  such as digital video disk players, cell phones, and global position system  devices\u2014have increased because China has become a major manufacturer  of consumer electronics and China\u2019s domestic production of integrated  circuits can only meet around 10 percent to 15 percent of China\u2019s demand,  according to a Commerce trade expert. Exports of electronic circuits and  micro assembling have grown at an annual rate of 47 percent since 1995,  reaching over $2 billion in 2004. Economic growth in China also has fueled  demand for energy-related equipment. For example, U.S. exports of gas  turbine parts to China increased dramatically in recent years, reaching $266  million in 2004.", "Second, market liberalization has been a factor in the growth of U.S. goods  exports to China. Reduction or removal of trade barriers has created  opportunities for foreign exporters to access China\u2019s market. The United  States concluded bilateral negotiations with China on WTO accession in  1999. Then, as part of its 2001 WTO accession agreement, China committed  to reducing or eliminating a variety of market access barriers to foreign  products. In its agreement, China made specific commitments on the tariff  rates for more than 7,000 products covering all imports as well as  commitments on trade-distorting practices, such as state trading and  quotas, affecting more than 900 products. By 2010, the end of the WTO  commitment phase-in period, China\u2019s overall average tariff is scheduled to  be less than 10 percent.

However,  in contrast to goods, the overall value of services exports is smaller and  individual categories and subcategories experienced more variable growth.  The smaller value of U.S. services exports to China is consistent with world  trade patterns with the United States. Trade in services tends to be smaller  than trade in goods in part because many services require some type of  direct contact or local presence and thus are harder to provide across  international borders. In addition, China is following a common trend  among developing countries, which usually have relatively small services  sectors, according to the World Bank. However, the smaller overall value of  services exports and variable growth rates among services categories may  also be due to the fact that China\u2019s services sector is yet to be fully  liberalized. For example, most market access commitments for services are  to be phased in by 2007. Finally, China\u2019s export-oriented growth has  depended on the industrial sector, rather than services.", "While China\u2019s WTO commitments for services are to provide foreign  services providers with increased access to a number of sectors, including  business services, communications services, financial services, and  tourism- and travel-related services, many of these commitments have only  recently come into effect or are yet to be phased in. For example, under  financial services, insurance was scheduled to be fully liberalized over a  5-year period, thereby relaxing many restrictions, such as selective  licensing processes and geographic limitations. In another example, in the  financial services area, U.S. banks will be able to provide local (Chinese)  currency services without geographic and client limitations by 2006; and  telecommunications is also scheduled to be liberalized by 2007, when  foreign providers will be allowed to offer a broad array of  telecommunications services with no geographic restrictions, although  only through joint ventures with Chinese partners. International Trade  Commission officials contend that joint venture requirements may, in part,  explain the smaller value for U.S. services exports compared with goods  exports to China. Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR)  officials noted that implementation problems have inhibited market access  for services.", "However, a portion of U.S.-China services trade does not depend upon  market access. For example, some U.S. services exports are delivered to  Chinese residents by virtue of the Chinese residents traveling to the United  States to consume these services. Thus, although exports in the  subcategory of education are among the largest in terms of dollar value, a  good portion of those exports are tuition and living expenses of foreign  students enrolled in U.S. colleges. Similarly, a portion of  telecommunications exports is international calls from China to the United  States.", "Finally, a good portion of services trade depends not only upon exports, but  also upon foreign direct investment and establishing commercial presence,  or selling services through local U.S. affiliates. This is also the case in  China. A Commerce trade expert told us that cross-border trade in services  is small relative to the Chinese domestic market, since many services must  be provided by firms located in China, and the real potential for growth in  services trade is in affiliate sales. For example, while exports in  telecommunications are growing, the real potential is in providing  telecommunications services to China\u2019s domestic market, such as  improving telephone service, which requires setting up local operations. In  another example, according to an official from the Coalition of Service  Industries, business, professional, and technical services are especially  important to coalition members as well as to the Chinese government  because the Chinese are anxious to form joint ventures to increase their  expertise.

The loss in the U.S. share of worldwide exports to  China has occurred as the volume of exports from smaller exporters has  grown and the number of countries exporting to China has increased.  These trends are due to multiple factors. For example, greater integration  of Asian production processes has helped certain other Asian countries  become larger suppliers of China\u2019s growing manufacturing and assembly  operations. Also, China\u2019s resource-based imports, including those from oil- producing countries, rose sharply as its rapid economic growth increased  demand for raw materials. In addition, macroeconomic factors that  influence the overall U.S. trade deficit, including exchange rates with China  and other Asian countries, as well as industry-specific circumstances, are  likely to have affected the overall U.S. export share.", "Individual countries, particularly those from Asia, have increased their  share of world exports to China at the expense of the United States and  other large suppliers. South Korea, Taiwan, and ASEAN countries,  including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, have all increased their  export share overall and in many particular products (e.g., autos and parts,  and electronics). There are several reasons why these countries may have  increased their market share in China. Regional economies in Asia have  increasingly integrated their production processes, producing parts for  products in one location and shipping them to another for assembly. China  has become a key component of this process due to its relatively low labor  costs and large-scale production potential. For example, China is a major  producer of electronic products, such as computers and video players,  which may be sold domestically or exported worldwide. As an indication of  this, China\u2019s largest import and export subcategory is electrical machinery,  which includes finished products, such as consumer electronics, as well as  components used in their production, such as electronic circuits.", "In addition, this greater integration of production processes can affect  trade trends. For example, U.S. components and parts exports first sent to  other countries and incorporated into those countries\u2019 exports to China are  not captured in U.S.-China bilateral trade statistics. Trade statistics only  show direct imports and exports between countries. For products that are  produced by a process that involves a series of locations, trade statistics  generally do not capture the value of inputs coming from locations other  than the last point of export. Therefore, for some U.S.-made components,  such as semiconductors, that are modified and added to in Malaysia,  Singapore, and the Philippines before being sent to China for use in cell  phones and computers, trade statistics do not generally count them as U.S.  exports to China, but as U.S. exports to Singapore or the Philippines.", "Furthermore, as the number of countries that export to China expands, 1  export category that is particularly relevant is chemicals, plastics, and  minerals, which had the 2nd-highest U.S. export value in 2004 and includes  resource-based products, particularly petroleum products, which United  States exports very little to China. All major suppliers lost overall export  share in this category as a wider range of countries supplied exports in this  category between 2002 and 2004. Petroleum products are one of the fastest- growing Chinese imports in recent years and accounts for a substantial  share of overall Chinese imports. In fact, imports of crude oil from  petroleum and bituminous minerals was the 2nd-largest Chinese import  by value in 2004, worth about $34 billion and accounting for over 6 percent  of total Chinese imports, according to Chinese statistics. Many oil- producing countries\u2019 exports to China grew faster than the average annual growth rate of 27 percent for all countries from 2000 to 2004. Table 6 lists  examples of oil-producing countries with high growth rates.", "Chad Congo Saudi Arabia Angola United Arab Emirates Finally, there are also a variety of other broad macroeconomic factors,  such as exchange rates as well as industry-specific circumstances that may  have affected the U.S share of world exports to China. For example, many  economists believe the Chinese renminbi/yuan is undervalued relative to  the U.S. dollar, and certain Asian currencies that experienced devaluations  during the Asian financial crisis may therefore have a competitive  advantage in China. A higher-valued dollar would be expected to have a  dampening effect on U.S. exports to China by making U.S. exports more  expensive in the Chinese market relative to other countries\u2019 exports. Also,  industry-specific circumstances may provide certain countries with export  advantages over those of the United States. For example, some industries\u2019  companies from other countries may have been operating in the Chinese  economy for longer than U.S. companies and may be gaining in export  share due to their greater experience. Also, according to one Commerce  specialist, some countries have provided \u201ctied-aid\u201d to China in which they  provide financial support for certain types of investments such as  environment projects, if their companies, rather than U.S. companies, are  able to supply the materials and components for the project.

However, we also calculated the weighted average  share across these time periods (using the value of trade as weights) in  order to confirm that our results still generally held. When we report the  value of Chinese trade flows (as opposed to the share of China\u2019s trade)  using Chinese trade statistics, it is in nominal dollars. We were not able to  identify an appropriate trade deflator for Chinese statistics in order to  remove the potential effect of inflation or deflation on the values. Finally,  we also interviewed industry experts from the Departments of Agriculture  and Commerce, and the International Trade Commission, and reviewed  government and academic reports to obtain contextual information about  the trends in U.S. share of world exports to China.", "To study growth in affiliate sales and foreign direct investment, we  collected annual U.S. affiliate sales statistics from 1995 to 2003 and  investment statistics from 1995 to 2004 from BEA. We identified China\u2019s  importance as a foreign direct investment destination by looking at China\u2019s  overall share of U.S. foreign direct investment, and examined the United  States\u2019s importance as a foreign direct investor in China by looking at the  overall share of U.S. foreign direct investment in China compared with  other countries. We calculated the growth rates for investment categories  and subcategories using a log function, so that we could examine which  categories had the highest growth and decline both in terms of value and  percentage. BEA reports data on foreign direct investment on an historical  cost basis. We evaluated the growth in affiliate sales of goods and services  and compared these values to the growth in cross-border trade in goods  and services. We calculated the growth rates for affiliate sales categories  and subcategories using a log function. In some cases, when BEA did not  publish values for some categories in some years, we estimated the missing  values and based the growth rate on those estimations. In one case, for  foreign direct investment in the finance and insurance category, we had to  use an average annual growth rate instead of a log function because BEA  reported the value of sales as a negative number. We used Chinese  Consumer Price Index data to deflate the affiliate sales to 2004 constant  dollars. We also interviewed several government and industry experts to  obtain contextual information about U.S. investment in and affiliate sales  to China.", "For each of the data sets that we used, we examined the data and found  them sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. In addition,  although Chinese data on U.S. exports have limitations and differ from U.S.  statistics, we found them to be sufficiently reliable to present individual  countries\u2019 relative shares of China\u2019s trade.", "We performed our work from April 2005 to December 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Goods Exports and U.S. Share of World Goods Exports to China", "paragraphs": ["U.S. exports of goods to China have grown rapidly over the past decade,  while the U.S. share of world exports to China has fallen during the same  period. These trends are evident at a broad category level and at a more  detailed subcategory level. This appendix provides detailed information on  these changes as well as selected information on particular products.  Specifically, the tables that follow provide additional information on  subcategories of products. Table 8 lists subcategories whose exports to  China accounted for more than 10 percent of total U.S. exports in that  category in 2004; table 9 lists subcategories whose exports to China  accounted for less than 1 percent of total U.S. exports in 2004; table 10 list  subcategories with the largest increases in export value over the decade;  table 11 lists subcategories with the largest declines in export value; table  12 lists subcategories with the largest declines the U.S. share of world  exports to China; and table 13 lists subcategories with the largest increases  in the U.S. share of world exports to China. Finally, table 14 provides  complete data on U.S. exports to China and the U.S. share of world exports  to China for the 10 broad categories of goods and their 99 subcategories.", "China is a major market for some U.S. goods exports. Table 8 lists the  products for which exports to China accounted for more than 10 percent of  U.S. exports in that category in 2004. In particular, there were four products  for which more than one-quarter of total U.S. exports were destined for  China in 2004.", "China is an insignificant market for some other U.S. goods exports. Table 9  lists products for which less than 1 percent of U.S. exports went to China in  2004. Some of these products are among major U.S. exports, such as  vehicles and pharmaceutical products, which had an overall export of $67  billion and almost $19 billion in 2004, respectively.", "U.S. goods exports to China for the majority, 88 out of 99 goods  subcategories, increased in value over the past decade. High-value  subcategories, such as electric machinery, and those experiencing the  highest growth rates, such as oilseeds, were the main contributors to the  overall export value increase. As shown in table 10, the top 5 subcategories  accounted for close to 60 percent of the total export increase for the  period.", "Far fewer, 9 of 99 of the goods subcategories, experienced declines in  export value in the past decade. Fertilizer experienced the highest decline,  with the annual average dropping $560 million for the second 5 years from  the previous 5 years, accounting for more than half of the total export  decline.", "U.S. share of world goods exports to China declined overall from 1995 to  2004. Table 12 shows the top 20 products that experienced declines in  share between 1995 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004, as well as information on the  overall value of U.S. exports to China in 2004. Carpets and other textile  floor coverings experienced the largest decline of any subcategory, falling  from 42 percent of the world exports to China between 1995 and 1999, to  only 13 percent between 2000 and 2004, on average. U.S. exports to China  of carpets and other textile floor coverings in 2004 were $4 million.  However, the table shows that a range of products experienced declines,  including tobacco, toys, some agricultural products, and fertilizers.", "Although, as previously discussed, 55 of the 99 subcategories of U.S.  exports to China experienced a decline in the share of world exports to  China, 42 subcategories experience a rise from the first half of the decade  (1995 to 1999) to the second half (2000 to 2004). Table 13 shows the top 20  of these 42 categories that experienced increases in share. Miscellaneous  edible preparations\u2014which are types of prepared foodstuffs, including  certain products, such as mayonnaise, mixed seasonings, and certain  sauces and syrups\u2014experienced the largest increase over the decade,  growing from a 14 percent share to a 40 percent share of world exports, on  average. Once again, the subcategories that experienced increases covered  a wide range of products, including gums and resins, printed books and  newspapers, and aircraft. However, many of these, as shown in table 13,  were agricultural products.", "Finally, table 14 provides information across all 10 broad categories and the  99 subcategories that comprise them on the average annual growth of U.S.  exports to China from 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, and over the whole  decade of 1995 to 2004.
