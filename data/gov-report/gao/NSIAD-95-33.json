Short duration, low acceleration environments can be created in drop towers (2 to 5 seconds of free fall), aircraft flying a distinctively curved flight path (up to 23 seconds of low gravity), and suborbital rockets (over 300 seconds).

According to NASA officials, IML-2 provided a preview of the science operations to come on the space station.", "The IML flights, which began in January 1992, gave the U.S scientific community access to foreign-developed flight hardware while providing the international research community with access to the Space Shuttle/Spacelab. Approximately 80 investigations were performed on IML-2, including 15 U.S. experiments\u201411 in the biotechnology, fluid physics, and materials science and 4 in the life sciences.

NASA officials have not made comparable estimates for life science researchers. To accomplish this goal, NASA has abandoned its tradition\u2014principally associated with life science research\u2014of soliciting research proposals for general and specific space flight opportunities.

In the select-for-science approach, two IML-2 microgravity investigators were selected from researchers who submitted proposals in response to two 1991 discipline-related (\u201cfundamental science\u201d and \u201cbiotechnology\u201d) research announcements.", "A NASA program scientist considers the IML-2 flight to have been a programmatic success and, in some respects, a model for the international space station. According to a NASA official, one indication of the flight\u2019s success was the amount of good research generated from the many proposals submitted in response to a mix of science and flight-related research announcements. Additionally, two of NASA\u2019s recent research announcements were in the select-for-flight tradition: its July 1993 announcement soliciting proposals for research on a 1998 space life sciences flight (Neurolab) and its February 1994 announcement soliciting proposals for life science research on the Russian space station Mir from 1995 to 1997. Presumably then, one effective way to develop a research community would be to solicit specific proposals for research that are directly related to the space station. NASA, however, has chosen to move toward exclusive use of \u201cselect for science,\u201d as discussed below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\u201cSelect for Science\u201d Has Become Preferred Approach", "paragraphs": ["Although NASA recently solicited proposals specifically for research on Shuttle flights to Mir, NASA\u2019s life science office changed from the widespread use of the select-for-flight approach in December 1993. At that time, it solicited proposals for ground-based research in space biology focused on the hypergravity effects that can be induced by NASA\u2019s centrifuges. NASA\u2019s shift to ground-based research did not stifle competition for funding: it received 650 responses to the December 1993 announcement. Although \u201cselect for science\u201d is relatively new to life science research, all microgravity research announcements since 1990 have focused on research opportunities in one or more science disciplines. And, as if to emphasize the independence of microgravity research from space station development, NASA changed the fiscal year 1992 goals for the microgravity program. The previous goals referred to developing and using the space station, whereas the current, more general goal is to \u201cenable  research . . . by choosing the carrier most appropriate for the experiment.\u201d", "Physical events, unlike biological processes, can be meaningfully observed under the short-duration microgravity conditions afforded by ground-based facilities, aircraft, and suborbital rockets. Consequently, a ground-based microgravity research investigator does not always have to conduct experiments in a space environment, and many do not. For example, of the 51 principal investigators who conducted such research at NASA\u2019s Lewis Research Center from fiscal years 1989 through 1993, only 7 have been principal investigators on space-based experiments, including a microgravity Spacelab flight in September 1995. \u201cNASA establish a vigorous ground based research program focussing on gravitational biology in which centrifuge facilities at NASA centers are utilized for exploring science programs aimed at forces greater than 1g .\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Select-for-Science Approach Reasonable", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s strategy for using the select-for-science approach to further develop a life science research community in the station-era appears reasonable based on the experience of the microgravity sciences community.", "First, the microgravity sciences research community has been growing. Principal investigators funded for microgravity sciences research increased by 120 percent\u2014from 89 in calendar year 1989 to 196 in fiscal year 1993. The budget authority for microgravity sciences increased by  130 percent, from $75.6 million to $173.9 million during this period. The number of proposals submitted in response to research announcements also generally increased during this period. For example, although proposals submitted in response to materials, fluids, and fundamental (benchmark) physics research announcements decreased from 397 in 1991 to 217 in 1993, those responding to combustion physics announcements increased from 65 in 1989 to 98 in biotechnology research announcements increased from 94 in 1991 to 141 materials and fluids research announcements increased from 69 in 1990 to 346 in 1991.", "Second, the microgravity research community is stable but not stagnant. Fifty-five percent of all microgravity sciences investigators that were funded in 1989 were also funded in fiscal year 1993. This core group represents 25 percent of the investigators funded in fiscal year 1993. On the other hand, 44 percent of the investigators funded in 1993 were not funded in 1992.", "Third, NASA is attracting new investigators to its microgravity sciences program. The decline in proposals (from 397 to 217) submitted in response to the 1993 materials, fluids, and fundamental physics announcement may have been partly caused by NASA\u2019s stated purpose of encouraging new investigators, and most of the 55 investigators funded from this announcement were new to the program. Only 15 of them had been previously funded by NASA. In June 1994, NASA\u2019s life sciences advisory subcommittee recommended that NASA use this approach and establish appropriate categories within life science research announcements that recognize and encourage new investigators.", "Finally, for those proposals we reviewed, the select-for-science approach produced relatively fewer low peer review scores than the select-for-flight approach. Figure 3 shows that 8 percent of the select-for-science proposals received peer review scores in the bottom category, while 32 percent of the select-for-flight proposals received scores in the bottom category.", "Similarly, as figure 4 shows, of all the proposals in the bottom category, only 16 percent were in the select-for-science tradition, while 84 percent were in the select-for-flight tradition.", "Many of the proposals submitted in response to NASA\u2019s research announcements were not considered scientifically meritorious.

In fiscal year 1992, NASA funded 73 ground-based investigators in microgravity sciences, only about 30 percent of the future need. Ground-based research is funded from NASA\u2019s research and analysis budget. However, NASA does not anticipate that this budget will increase for fiscal years 1995 through 1999. Annual life science research and analysis appropriations are estimated to be about $51 million and microgravity sciences at $21.7 million. To deal with this potential mismatch between plans and resources, NASA\u2019s microgravity sciences office has proposed that the research and analysis budget be augmented by research and development funds used to support NASA\u2019s space-based research program. The proposed amounts are $4.7 million for fiscal year 1996, $12.2 million for 1997, and $22.2 million for 1998. According to NASA, shifting resources in this way would not increase its overall budget authority. \u201cwhere they are proven to be inadequate to support the intellectual underpinning of the flight program, even if this means a transfer from the  budget so as to comply with overall budget constraints.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selecting Quality Experiments", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s quality assurance procedures start with a series of external and internal reviews designed to evaluate the merits of research proposals.
