This testimony discusses (1) TSA's requirements for domestic air carriers to conduct watch-list matching, (2) the extent to which TSA has assessed compliance with watch-list matching requirements, and (3) TSA's progress in developing Secure Flight. This statement is based on GAO's report on air carrier watch-list matching (GAO-08-992) being released today and GAO's previous and ongoing reviews of Secure Flight. In conducting this work, GAO reviewed TSA security directives and TSA inspections guidance and results, and interviewed officials from 14 of 95 domestic air carriers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TSA's requirements for domestic air carriers to conduct watch-list matching include a requirement to identify passengers whose names are either identical or similar to those on the No Fly and Selectee lists. Similar-name matching is important because individuals on the watch list may try to avoid detection by making travel reservations using name variations. According to TSA, there have been incidents of air carriers failing to identify potential matches by not successfully conducting similar-name matching. However, until revisions were initiated in April 2008, TSA's security directives did not specify what types of similar-name variations were to be considered. Thus, in interviews with 14 air carriers, GAO found inconsistent approaches to conducting similar-name matching, and not every air carrier reported conducting similar-name comparisons. In January 2008, TSA conducted an evaluation of air carriers and found deficiencies in their capability to conduct similar-name matching. Thus, in April 2008, TSA revised the No Fly List security directive to specify a baseline capability for conducting watch-list matching and reported that it planned to similarly revise the Selectee List security directive. While recognizing that the new baseline capability will not address all vulnerabilities, TSA emphasized that establishing the baseline capability should improve air carriers' performance of watch-list matching and is a good interim solution pending the implementation of Secure Flight. TSA has undertaken various efforts to assess domestic air carriers' compliance with watch-list matching requirements; however, until 2008, TSA had conducted limited testing of air carriers' similar-name-matching capability. In 2005, for instance, TSA evaluated the capability of air carriers to identify names that were identical--but not similar--to those in terrorist watch-list records. Also, TSA's internal guidance did not specifically direct inspectors to test air carriers' similar-name-matching capability, nor did the guidance specify the number or types of name variations to be assessed. Records in TSA's database for regular inspections conducted during 2007 made reference to name-match testing in only 61 of the 1,145 watch-list-related inspections that GAO reviewed. During the course of GAO's review, and prompted by findings of the evaluation conducted in January 2008, TSA reported that its guidance for inspectors would be revised to help ensure air carriers' compliance with security directives. Although TSA has plans to strengthen its oversight efforts, it is too early to determine the extent to which TSA will provide oversight of air carriers' compliance with the revised security directives. In February 2008, GAO reported that TSA has made progress in developing Secure Flight but that challenges remained, including the need to more effectively manage risk and develop more robust cost and schedule estimates (GAO-08-456T). If these challenges are not addressed effectively, the risk of the program not being completed on schedule and within estimated costs is increased, and the chances of it performing as intended are diminished. TSA plans to begin assuming watch-list matching from air carriers in January 2009."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s work assessing the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and domestic air carrier  efforts in conducting watch-list matching\u2014or the matching of airline  passenger information against terrorist watch-list records\u2014a front-line  defense against acts of terrorism that target the nation\u2019s civil aviation  system. Domestic air carriers operating to, from, and within the United  States are to conduct watch-list matching in accordance with requirements  set forth by TSA. That is, air carriers are to conduct preboarding checks by  comparing passenger data\u2014most prominently name and date of   birth\u2014against the No Fly List to identify individuals who should be  prevented from boarding an aircraft, and against the Selectee List to  identify individuals who must undergo enhanced screening at the  checkpoint prior to boarding.

Critical to this oversight effort are the agency\u2019s  inspectors\u2014both the principal security inspectors who oversee  implementation efforts at air carriers\u2019 corporate security offices and the  transportation security inspectors who oversee implementation efforts at  airport locations. Beginning in 2009, under a program known as Secure  Flight, TSA is to take over from air carriers the function of watch-list  matching for domestic and ultimately international flights. Pending Secure  Flight\u2019s implementation, air carriers continue to have primary  responsibility for conducting watch-list matching. In turn, TSA continues  to have an important oversight responsibility to ensure that air carriers  comply with watch-list-matching requirements.", "My testimony today addresses (1) TSA\u2019s requirements for domestic air  carriers to conduct watch-list matching for domestic flights, (2) the extent  to which TSA has assessed domestic air carriers\u2019 compliance with watch- list-matching requirements, and (3) TSA\u2019s progress in developing and  implementing the Secure Flight program. This statement is based on a  report we released today on air carrier watch-list-matching processes and  TSA\u2019s oversight of these efforts, as well as work we conducted on the  Secure Flight program from August 2007 to January 2008, with selected  updates in September 2008.", "Regarding air carrier watch-list matching, we reviewed TSA\u2019s security  directives and related guidance applicable to watch-list matching;  interviewed responsible officials at TSA headquarters; conducted  interviews (both in-person and via telephone) with officials from domestic  air carriers to discuss their implementation of watch-list-matching  requirements; analyzed watch-list-related inspections that TSA conducted  during fiscal year 2007 to ensure that air carriers were in compliance with  applicable requirements; and reviewed the results from a special emphasis  assessment that TSA conducted in 2005 and a special emphasis inspection  it conducted in January 2008, both of which addressed air carriers\u2019  capability to conduct watch-list matching. Regarding the Secure Flight  program, we reviewed systems development, privacy, and other  documentation, and interviewed Department of Homeland Security (DHS),  TSA, and contractor officials. We conducted these performance audits  from July 2006 to September 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on the audit  objectives.

Related to watch-list matching, TSA outlines air carrier requirements in  the No Fly List Procedures security directive, requiring domestic air  carriers to conduct checks of passenger information against the No Fly  List to identify individuals who should be precluded from boarding flights,  and the Selectee List Procedures security directive, directing domestic air  carriers to conduct checks of passenger information against the Selectee  List to identify individuals who should receive enhanced screening (e.g.,  additional physical screening or a hand-search of carry-on baggage) before  proceeding through the security checkpoint. Since 2002, TSA has issued  numerous revisions to the No Fly and Selectee list security directives to  strengthen and clarify requirements, and has issued guidance to assist air  carriers in implementing their watch-list-matching processes.", "TSA conducts inspections of air carriers throughout the year as part of  regular inspection cycles based on annual inspection plans to determine  the extent to which air carriers are complying with TSA security  requirements. These inspections are based on inspection guidelines known  as PARIS prompts, which address a broad range of regulatory  requirements (including airport perimeter security and cargo security, as  well as screening of employees, baggage, and passengers). With respect to  watch-list matching, inspection guidelines instruct inspectors regarding  the aspects of air carrier watch-list matching that should be tested, such as  whether air carriers are comparing the names of all passengers against  names on the most current No Fly and Selectee lists in accordance with  the procedures outlined in TSA\u2019s security directives.", "TSA conducts watch-list-related inspections at air carriers\u2019 corporate  security offices (where policies and procedures are established on how  watch-list matching is to be performed) and at airports (where policies  and procedures for responding to a potential match are implemented).  TSA\u2019s principal security inspectors are responsible for conducting  inspections at domestic air carriers\u2019 corporate headquarters. These  inspectors assess air carriers\u2019 compliance with security requirements and  provide direct oversight of air carriers\u2019 implementation of and compliance  with TSA-approved security programs. Field inspectors\u2014known as  transportation security inspectors\u2014conduct watch-list-related inspections  at airports. They are responsible for a multitude of TSA-related activities,  including conducting inspections and investigations of airports and air  carriers, monitoring compliance with applicable civil aviation security  policies and regulations, resolving routine situations that may be  encountered during the assessment of airport security, participating in  testing of security systems in connection with compliance inspections,  identifying when enforcement actions should be initiated, and providing  input on the type of action and level of penalty commensurate with the  nature and severity of a violation that is ultimately recommended to TSA\u2019s  Office of Chief Counsel.", "To further enhance commercial aviation security and as required by the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, TSA is  developing an advanced passenger prescreening program known as  Secure Flight to assume from air carriers the function of matching  passenger information against government-supplied terrorist watch lists  for domestic, and ultimately international, flights. Through assumption of  the watch-list-matching function from the air carriers, Secure Flight is  intended to ensure a higher level of consistency than current air carrier  watch-list matching and also help remedy possible misidentifications if a  passenger\u2019s name is similar to one found on a watch list. According to TSA  plans, Secure Flight\u2019s benefits, once the program becomes operational,  will include    eliminating inconsistencies in current air carrier watch-list matching    decreasing the risk of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive watch-list  information,  reducing the number of individuals who are misidentified as being on  the No Fly or Selectee lists, and  integrating the redress process so that individuals are less likely to be  improperly or unfairly delayed or prohibited from boarding an aircraft.", "TSA expects to begin assuming from air carriers the watch-list matching  function for domestic flights in January 2009, and to assume this function  from U.S. Customs and Border Protection for flights departing from and to  the Unites States by fiscal year 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior to April 2008, TSA Watch-List- Matching Requirements Were Broad and Allowed Air Carriers Discretion in Comparing Name Variations, Which Resulted in Less Effective Processes", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, TSA has imposed,  through security directives, requirements for watch-list matching, which  include identifying passengers with names similar to those on the No Fly  and Selectee lists\u2014a process TSA refers to as similar-name matching.  Identifying passengers with names similar to those on the No Fly and  Selectee lists is a critical component of watch-list matching because  individuals may travel using abbreviated name forms or other variations of  their names. Therefore, searching for only an exact match of the  passenger\u2019s name may not result in identifying all watch-listed individuals.", "Before undertaking revisions of the relevant security directives in 2008,  TSA expected air carriers to conduct similar-name matching, but TSA\u2019s  security directives did not specify how many and what types of such name  variations air carriers should compare. Consequently, the 14 air carriers  we interviewed reported implementing varied approaches to similar-name  matching.  Some carriers reported comparing more name variations than  others, and not every air carrier reported conducting similar-name  comparisons. Air carriers that conduct only exact-name comparisons and  carriers that conduct relatively limited similar-name comparisons are less  effective in identifying watch-listed individuals who travel under name  variations. Also, due to inconsistent air carrier processes, a passenger  could be identified as a match to a watch-list record by one carrier and not  by another, which results in uneven effectiveness of watch-list matching.  Moreover, there have been incidents, based on information provided by  TSA\u2019s Office of Intelligence, of air carriers failing to identify potential  matches by not successfully conducting similar-name matching.", "Generally, TSA had been aware that air carriers were not using equivalent  processes to compare passenger names with names on the No Fly and  Selectee lists. However, in early 2008 the significance of such differences  was crystallized during the course of our review and following TSA\u2019s  special emphasis inspection of air carriers\u2019 watch-list-matching capability.  On the basis of these inspection results, in April 2008, TSA issued a revised  security directive governing the use of the No Fly List to establish a  baseline capability for similar-name matching to which all air carriers must  conform. Also, TSA announced that it planned to similarly revise the  Selectee List security directive to require the new baseline capability.", "According to TSA officials, the new baseline capability is intended to  improve the effectiveness of watch-list matching, particularly for those air  carriers that had been using less-thorough approaches for identifying  similar-name matches and those air carriers that did not conduct any  similar-name comparisons. However, because the baseline capability  requires that air carriers compare only the types of name variations  specified in the security directive, TSA officials noted that the new  baseline established in the No Fly List security directive is not intended to  address all possible types of name variations and related security  vulnerabilities. Agency officials explained that based on their analysis of  the No Fly and Selectee lists and interviews with intelligence community  officials, the newly established baseline covers the types of name  variations air carriers are most likely to encounter. TSA officials further  stated that these revised requirements were a good interim solution  because, among other reasons, they will strengthen security while not  requiring air carriers to invest in significant modifications to their watch- list matching processes, given TSA\u2019s expected implementation of Secure  Flight beginning in 2009. If implemented as intended, Secure Flight is  expected to better enable the use of passenger names and other  identifying information to more accurately match passengers to the  subjects of watch-list records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Until a 2008 Special Emphasis Inspection, TSA Had Conducted Limited Testing of Air Carriers\u2019 Capability to Perform Similar-Name Matching", "paragraphs": ["Until 2008, TSA had conducted limited testing of air carriers\u2019 similar-name- matching capability, although the agency had undertaken various efforts  to assess domestic air carriers\u2019 compliance with watch-list matching  requirements in the No Fly and Selectee list security directives. These  efforts included a special emphasis assessment conducted in 2005 and  regular inspections conducted in conjunction with annual inspection  cycles. However, the 2005 special emphasis assessment focused on air  carriers\u2019 capability to prescreen passengers for exact-name matches with  the No Fly List, but did not address the air carriers\u2019 capability to conduct  similar-name comparisons. Regarding inspections conducted as part of  regular inspection cycles, TSA\u2019s guidance establishes that regulatory  requirements encompassing critical layers of security need intensive  oversight, and that testing is the preferred method for validating  compliance. However, before being revised in 2008, TSA\u2019s inspection  guidelines for watch-list-related inspections were broadly stated and did  not specifically direct inspectors to test air carriers\u2019 similar-name- matching capability. Moreover, TSA\u2019s guidance provided no baseline  criteria or standards regarding the number or types of such variations that  must be assessed. Thus, although some TSA inspectors tested air carriers\u2019  effectiveness in conducting similar-name matching, the inspectors did so  at their own discretion and without specific evaluation criteria.", "In response to our inquiry, six of TSA\u2019s nine principal security inspectors  told us that their assessments during annual inspection cycles have not  included examining air carriers\u2019 capability to conduct certain basic types  of similar-name comparisons. Also, in reviewing documentation of the  results of the most recent inspection cycle (fiscal year 2007), we found  that available records in TSA\u2019s database made references to name- matching tests in only 6 of the 36 watch-list-related inspections that  principal security inspectors conducted, and in only 55 of the 1,109  inspections that transportation security inspectors conducted. Without  baseline criteria or standards for air carriers to follow in conducting  similar-name comparisons, TSA has not had a uniform basis for assessing  compliance. Further, without routinely and uniformly testing how  effectively air carriers are conducting similar-name matching, TSA may not  have had an accurate understanding of the quality of air carriers\u2019 watch- list-matching processes.", "However, TSA began taking corrective actions during the course of our  review and after it found deficiencies in the capability of air carriers to  conduct similar-name matching during the January 2008 special emphasis  inspection. More specifically, following the January 2008 inspection, TSA  officials reported that TSA began working with individual air carriers to  address identified deficiencies. Also, officials reported that, following the  issuance of TSA\u2019s revised No Fly List security directive in April 2008, the  agency had plans to assess air carriers\u2019 progress in meeting the baseline  capability specified in the new security directive after 30 days, and that the  agency\u2019s internal guidance for inspectors would be revised to help ensure  compliance by air carriers with requirements in the new security directive.  Further, in September 2008, TSA updated us on the status of its efforts  with watch-list matching.  Specifically, TSA provided us with the results of  a May 2008 special emphasis assessment of seven air carriers\u2019 compliance  with the revised No Fly List security directive.  Although the details of this  special emphasis assessment are classified, TSA generally characterized  the results as positive. Also, the TSA noted that it plans to work with  individual air carriers, as applicable, to analyze specific failures, improve  system performance, and conduct follow-up testing as needed. Further,  officials noted that the agency\u2019s internal handbook, which provides  guidance to transportation security inspectors on how to inspect air  carriers\u2019 compliance with requirements, including watch-list-matching  requirements, was being revised and was expected to be released later this  year. Officials stated that the new inspection guidance would be used in  conjunction with TSA\u2019s nationwide regulatory activities plan for fiscal year  2009.

Acknowledging the  challenges it faced with the program, in February 2006, TSA suspended the  development of Secure Flight and initiated a reassessment, or  rebaselining, of the program, which was completed in January 2007. In  February 2008, we reported that TSA had made substantial progress in  instilling more discipline and rigor into Secure Flight\u2019s development and  implementation, including preparing key systems development  documentation and strengthening privacy protections. However, we  reported that challenges remain that may hinder the program\u2019s progress  moving forward. Specifically, TSA had not (1) developed program cost and  schedule estimates consistent with best practices, (2) fully implemented  its risk management plan, (3) planned for system end-to-end testing in test  plans, and (4) ensured that information-security requirements are fully  implemented. If these challenges are not addressed effectively, the risk of  the program not being completed on schedule and within estimated costs  is increased, and the chances of it performing as intended are diminished.", "To address these challenges, we made several recommendations to DHS  and TSA to incorporate best practices in Secure Flight\u2019s cost and schedule  estimates and to fully implement the program\u2019s risk-management, testing,  and information-security requirements.

The April 2008  revision establishes a baseline name-matching capability applicable to all  domestic air carriers. Effective implementation of the baseline capability  should strengthen watch-list-matching processes, especially for those air  carriers that had been using less-thorough approaches for identifying  similar-name matches. Concurrently, revised internal guidance for TSA\u2019s  inspectors can help ensure that compliance inspections of air carriers are  conducted using the standards specified within the security directives as  evaluation criteria. At the time of our review, TSA was in the initial stage  of revising the internal guidance for inspectors. As a result, it is too early  to determine the extent to which updated guidance for principal security  inspectors and transportation security inspectors will strengthen oversight  of air carriers\u2019 compliance with the security directive requirements. Going  forward, TSA officials acknowledge that the baseline capability specified  in the revised No Fly List security directive and the similar revision  planned for the Selectee List security directive\u2014while an improvement\u2014 does not address all vulnerabilities identified by TSA and does not provide  the level of risk mitigation that is expected to be achieved from Secure  Flight.
