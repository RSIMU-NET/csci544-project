The act requires agencies to refer eligible debts delinquent more than 180 days to the Department of the Treasury for payment offset and to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for cross-servicing. The Treasury Offset Program, includes the offset of benefit payments, vendor payments, and tax refunds. Cross-servicing involves locating debtors, issuing demand letters, and referring debts to private collection agencies. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) has initiatives to ensure the timely referral of all delinquent debt. However, the agency's failure to make the act a priority has left key provisions of the legislation unimplemented and severely reduced collection opportunities. The agency had referred no direct single-family housing (SFH) loans to the Financial Management Service for cross-servicing. Three major factors delayed implementation. First, RHS's loan-servicing system had not incorporated key features necessary to implement the act's referral provisions. Second, RHS did not refer any debts for cross-servicing while pursuing an exemption from Treasury. Third, amounts reported as delinquent and eligible for consideration for referral were materially understated. RHS had not kept the documentation needed to independently verify the accuracy and validity of the exclusion amounts in its certified fiscal year 2000 year-end report. Accordingly, GAO was unable to determine whether RHS had appropriately excluded $182 million of delinquent loans from referral for offset and for cross servicing as of September 2000."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On October 10, 2001, we testified before your subcommittee on selected  federal agencies\u2019 implementation of certain key provisions of the Debt  Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) of 1996.

Our more  recent testimony, in early December 2001, focused on progress in this area  by two Department of Agriculture agencies\u2014the Rural Housing Service  (RHS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA).", "One of the major purposes of DCIA is to maximize collection of billions of  dollars of nontax delinquent debt owed to the federal government.  Toward  this end, DCIA requires that agencies refer eligible debts delinquent more  than 180 days that they have been unable to collect to Treasury for payment  offset and to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for  cross-servicing.  Treasury performs payment offset through its Treasury  Offset Program (TOP), which includes the offset of certain benefit  payments, vendor payments, and tax refunds.

RHS provides a wide array of housing services to rural residents and often  offers more favorable loan terms and conditions than other federal housing  programs.  The agency delivers services through an extensive network of  field offices.  In September 1997, Rural Development completed a  conversion of its direct SFH loan servicing from a dispersed nationwide  network of more than 2,000 field offices to Agriculture\u2019s new Central  Servicing Center.  The center is responsible for servicing the department\u2019s  entire direct SFH loan portfolio, which totaled about $17 billion at the close  of fiscal year 2000.", "Through its SFH programs, RHS provides highly subsidized direct loans to  rural households with very low and low incomes, guaranteed loans to  households with low and moderate incomes, and grants and direct loans  for housing repairs to households with very low incomes. Under the  guaranteed SFH loan program, RHS agrees to reimburse approved private  lenders for up to 90 percent of the principal advanced to a borrower in the  event the borrower defaults.  In recent years, RHS\u2019s guaranteed SFH loan  program has expanded, with the reported outstanding principal due on the  guaranteed SFH loan portfolio increasing from about $3 billion in fiscal  year 1996 to more than $10 billion at the end of fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine whether (1) RHS was promptly referring  eligible SFH loans to FMS for collection action, (2) any obstacles were  hampering RHS from referring eligible SFH loans to FMS, and (3) RHS was  appropriately using exclusions from referral requirements.", "To determine whether RHS is promptly referring eligible SFH loans to FMS  for collection action, we interviewed officials responsible for identifying  eligible SFH loans and referring them to FMS.  We also reviewed pertinent  policies, procedures, and reports related to RHS loan referrals, including  Treasury instructions for preparing the TROR and RHS internal  delinquency reports.  To determine whether any obstacles were hampering  RHS from referring eligible SFH loans, we interviewed RHS officials and  obtained and reviewed relevant documents, including the agency\u2019s debt- referral schedule and Agriculture\u2019s request to Treasury to exempt  delinquent SFH loans from referral for cross-servicing for up to a year after  liquidation of collateral.  We also reviewed responses to questions about  RHS\u2019s debt collection practices that you submitted to the deputy secretary  of agriculture in October 2001.  We used information from the responses to  clarify or augment our report, where appropriate.", "A scope limitation prevented us from determining whether RHS\u2019s  exclusions of about $182 million of direct SFH loans from referral  requirements were appropriate.  RHS officials told us that the agency did  not retain supporting documentation (a list of individual loans, including  loan amounts, for each exclusion category) for the $182 million of direct  SFH loans excluded from referral to FMS.  Without such documentation,  we could not independently verify that amounts excluded for forbearance  or appeals, bankruptcy, and foreclosure were accurate or met established  criteria.", "We conducted our review from November 2000 through October 2001 in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.

As of September  30, 2000, RHS reported about $383 million of direct SFH loans delinquent  more than 180 days.  Because of a software deficiency that prevented  automated identification of direct SFH loans eligible for cross-servicing  and an agency plan to obtain an exemption from referring direct SFH loans  for cross-servicing, RHS had referred virtually no delinquent SFH loans for  cross-servicing as of September 30, 2000.

Because of a software  deficiency that has existed since fiscal year 1997, Agriculture\u2019s automated  loan-servicing system cannot identify loans that are eligible and should be  referred for cross-servicing.  As a result, RHS referred virtually no direct  SFH loans to FMS for cross-servicing through September 30, 2000, and only  minor amounts through September 30, 2001.  An additional obstacle was  RHS\u2019s application for\u2014and unrealistic expectation of receiving\u2014an  exemption from Treasury that would have allowed the agency to delay  referring direct SFH loans to FMS for cross-servicing for up to a year after  liquidation of a loan\u2019s collateral.  Based on its expectation that the  exemption request would be approved on an after-the-fact basis, RHS  classified all of its delinquent direct SFH loans as excluded from referral  requirements in its September 30, 2000, TROR.  Finally, RHS understated  loan amounts that are eligible for referral in two respects.  First, the agency  included in its reporting of delinquent debts only the delinquent portions of  installment loans rather than the total unpaid loan balances as required by  Treasury.  Second, RHS did not take action until recently to recognize  losses on guaranteed SFH loans as nontax federal debt.  Until these steps  are completed, RHS cannot use the collection tools provided under DCIA  to pursue collection directly from debtors on guaranteed SFH loans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "System Limitations Hampered Identification and Referral of Loans for Cross-Servicing", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 1996 and 1997, RHS converted its loan-servicing system,  which serviced a portfolio of more than 700,000 direct SFH loans, from a  decentralized servicing network of more than 2,000 field offices to a single,  automated loan-servicing location\u2014Agriculture\u2019s Central Servicing Center.  The main automated system is a commercial off-the-shelf loan-servicing  system that required modification if it was to perform the unique functions  associated with the direct SFH loan program, such as identifying direct  SFH loans eligible for cross-servicing.  If the system is to perform this  function, it must, for example, be capable of determining the status of any  collateral, because all collateral must be liquidated prior to a loan\u2019s referral  to FMS for cross-servicing.  According to RHS officials, RHS has been  unable since the conversion to readily identify direct SFH loans that are  eligible for referral to FMS for cross-servicing because the necessary  software was not completed prior to conversion.  RHS nevertheless  completed the conversion in fiscal year 1997 because the agency did not  want to delay implementation of the new system.  RHS plans to complete  the system software in April 2002 and has stated that the software  modifications will facilitate identification of loans for cross-servicing.", "In April 2001, while we were performing our fieldwork, RHS began an  interim process to manually identify direct SFH loans eligible for cross- servicing.  Agency officials advised us, however, that relatively few  referrals for cross-servicing are likely to be made before completion of the  software because the interim manual process is tedious and labor- intensive.  According to RHS\u2019s debt-referral schedule, only about 100 to 200  loans are to be referred each month, and as of September 30, 2001, the  agency had referred 599 direct SFH loans to FMS for cross-servicing.  The  current manual process creates an overwhelming challenge for the agency  because of the large volume of loans potentially eligible for cross-servicing.  RHS officials said that all direct SFH loans eligible for TOP will have to be  reviewed for cross-servicing eligibility.  As of September 30, 2000, RHS had  referred 23,032 direct SFH loans to FMS for TOP.  According to RHS\u2019s debt- referral plan as of the completion of our fieldwork, the agency intends to  refer about 30 percent of eligible direct SFH loans to FMS for cross- servicing in fiscal year 2002.

Liquidation could, in some cases, occur years after  a loan became delinquent.", "Treasury officials told us that the department had informal discussions  with Agriculture officials concerning the planned request.  They said  Treasury discouraged Agriculture from submitting a formal request  because Treasury did not believe an exemption was warranted.  Nevertheless, Agriculture submitted a formal request for an exemption on  behalf of RHS in November 2000.  Although Treasury officials stated that  the department had never formally or informally approved the request,  RHS reported in its September 30, 2000, TROR that Treasury had approved  the request.  In the TROR, RHS classified all eligible direct SFH loans as  exempted by Treasury from cross-servicing.", "Treasury issued a formal denial of the exemption request on May 14, 2001.  The denial was based in part on the fact that other agencies with similar  delinquent loans were referring the loans for cross-servicing and that RHS  had not identified any new or unique collection tools applicable to its SFH  loans that would justify different treatment.  RHS officials said that they  contacted Treasury in January 2001 to acknowledge that the statement  regarding the approval of the exemption request in the September 30, 2000,  TROR was incorrect.  However, in subsequent quarterly TROR submissions  through June 30, 2001, RHS continued to report significant direct SFH loan  amounts as exempted by Treasury from cross-servicing.", "RHS Did Not Consider the  Full Range of Debt for DCIA\t DCIA referral requirements in two important areas.

Similarly, RHS reports only the delinquent  installment portion as eligible for referral to TOP.  RHS officials said they  do not believe it is appropriate to refer more than the delinquent portion of  direct SFH loans to FMS.  They said they are concerned that if RHS referred  amounts greater than the delinquent installments before liquidation of  collateral at foreclosure, the agency would risk collecting amounts in  excess of those due from borrowers.  This situation should not arise,  however, because DCIA allows any debt to be temporarily excluded from  referral if its collateral is being liquidated as part of foreclosure  proceedings.  Therefore, under its practices and Treasury\u2019s requirements,  RHS should report all amounts due and payable and refer them to FMS for  collection action unless the loans are in foreclosure or meet other  exclusion criteria.", "As previously stated, at the end of fiscal year 2000, RHS reported that about  $383 million of direct SFH loans were more than 180 days delinquent and  that approximately $201 million of the loans were eligible for and had been  referred for offset through TOP.  Based on our review of RHS\u2019s internal  delinquency records, by not including accelerated loan balances RHS may  have understated delinquent direct SFH loan amounts reported to Treasury  by about $849 million and direct SFH loan amounts eligible for offset  through TOP by about $348 million.  Underreporting delinquencies distorts  the TROR for debt management and credit policy purposes.  It also distorts  key governmentwide financial indicators, including total delinquencies  outstanding, on which the president, the Congress, and the Office of  Management and Budget rely to make important budget and management  decisions.

However, as of  September 30, 2000, RHS still had no policies and procedures to  recognize losses on guaranteed SFH loans as federal debts and to refer  such debts to FMS for TOP and cross-servicing.  4.\t We did not provide an estimate of the amount of guaranteed losses that  may be recovered through TOP and cross-servicing.  Rather, as stated  in this report, RHS continues to miss opportunities to collect from  borrowers the amounts it has paid to cover losses on guaranteed SFH  loans.  Moreover, such lost opportunities not only involve collection  through cross-servicing but TOP as well, which, according to Rural  Development in its response, involved collections of $31 million in 2001  on debts other than guaranteed losses.  5.\t See our discussion in the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d  section.  6.\t This example provided by Rural Development is not consistent with  RHS\u2019s procedures for accelerating direct SFH loans and Treasury\u2019s  instructions for reporting accelerated debts on the TROR.  See our  discussion in the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section for  additional details.  In view of RHS\u2019s response on this matter, we have  modified our first recommendation to RHS to include working together  with FMS to resolve any inconsistencies between RHS\u2019s reporting of  delinquent debts on its TROR and Treasury\u2019s instructions for such  reporting.  7.
