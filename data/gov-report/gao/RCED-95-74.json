Specifically, we were asked to assess the effect of (1) October 1991 revisions to Circular A-21 that primarily established a 26-percent cap on federal reimbursements to universities for three components of their administrative costs and (2) July 1993 revisions that further clarified and tightened certain indirect cost accounting procedures, including the specification that the remission of tuition for graduate students working on federally funded research be treated as a direct cost.

Circular A-21 is designed to provide that the federal government bear its fair share of total costs, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except where restricted or prohibited by law. By consolidating seven indirect cost components into the administrative and facilities categories, the 1991 and 1993 revisions have clarified how universities incur and allocate indirect costs. The capped administrative category includes general administration and expenses, departmental administration, sponsored projects administration, student services, and other miscellaneous costs. The facilities category includes depreciation and/or use allowance, operations and maintenance, and library costs.", "The average overall indirect cost rate of 118 universities that HHS tracks grew from 48.8 percent in 1986 to 50.5 percent in 1995. Federal efforts to control indirect cost growth have focused on administrative rates, which fell 1.7 percentage points in 1993 as a result of the administrative cap. In contrast, rates for the facilities category increased by 4.3 percentage points during this period, so that with the addition of library costs, facilities costs account for slightly more than half of the overall indirect cost rate in fiscal year 1995.", "The National Science and Technology Council was established by Executive Order 12881 in November 1993 to oversee federal science and technology policy. In a November 1994 report, the Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Research recommended ways to stabilize the federal reimbursement of indirect costs, narrow the range of rates, and develop a simplified methodology for financing research facilities. On February 6, 1995, OMB published in the Federal Register a Proposed Revision to Circular A-21 that implements these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1991 Revisions Reduced Government Spending for Administrative Costs and Made Rates More Uniform", "paragraphs": ["The 26-percent administrative cap has reduced government spending for universities\u2019 administrative costs by about $104 million per year and has made universities\u2019 overall indirect cost rates more uniform. The cap lowered the administrative rates of 69 of the 140 universities we surveyed and may have affected 13 other universities whose administrative rates either rose to or stayed at the 26-percent cap from fiscal year 1992 to fiscal year 1994. The cap had little or no effect on the remaining 58 universities, whose administrative rates remained below 26 percent.", "Overall, the cap\u2019s greatest impacts were (1) among 11 universities whose administrative rates dropped more than 10 points to 26 percent and (2) in the New England and Middle Atlantic regions, where administrative rates for 31 of 43 universities were capped. The cap affected 37 public and 32 private universities. Columbia University, the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Southern California, Yeshiva University, and Boston University accounted for $35 million of the $104 million in reduced spending.", "As a result of the cap, universities\u2019 overall indirect cost rates have become more uniform\u2014in fiscal year 1995, 117 of the 140 universities surveyed had overall rates between 41 and 60 percent, as compared with 105 of the 140 universities in fiscal year 1992.

Twenty-eight surveyed universities reported that these revisions reduced their recovery by more than $25,000 in fiscal year 1993. In particular, they noted that housing and personal living expenses for university officers and travel costs for board of trustee members had previously been allowable but could no longer be claimed. In addition, the 1991 revisions required that 99 of the largest research universities spend federal payments for use allowance or depreciation within 5 years to acquire or improve research facilities. Overall, 83 of the 99 universities reported that this provision has had little or no effect on their ability to acquire or improve facilities, while 15 universities reported only a moderate effect at most, and 1 university did not respond."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Effect of the 1993 Revisions Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["The effect of the 1993 changes on universities\u2019 ability to recover costs is unclear because federal agencies are implementing the changes only when each university renegotiates its multiyear rate agreement. In addition, the effect of the changes is difficult to measure because they generally addressed components of cost categories. Adding student services to the administrative category, a change that can be estimated, is likely to affect only 19 of the 140 universities surveyed and reduce government spending by about $7.3 million per year.", "The 1993 revision treating tuition remission for graduate students working on federally funded research as a direct cost will become effective in October 1997. This revision affects four universities\u2014the California Institute of Technology, Columbia University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University. The Office of Naval Research had allowed these universities to spread tuition remission costs across all salary accounts of their federally and privately sponsored research instead of assigning the costs directly to each project that employed graduate students as research assistants. The four universities, which account for a significant portion of all engineering doctoral students in the United States, expressed concern that this change could substantially reduce the number of doctoral candidates. They stated that faculty members applying for federal funding will have an incentive to hire postdoctoral scientists, whose salaries are lower than the tuition and stipend payments that graduate students receive as research assistants. The universities emphasized that their mission includes education and training, as well as research, and further noted that without the financial support of a research assistantship, many graduate students may opt to obtain only a master\u2019s degree instead of a doctoral degree. Although these universities, as well as NSF, have expressed concern about the effect of this change on doctoral programs in scientific and engineering fields, federal agencies have not assessed the implications of this accounting change for such programs. While looking at the potential supply of doctoral candidates, one also needs to consider the demand for them by U.S. industry and government. We did not examine these issues; however, we note that the need for scientists and engineers with doctorates may have dropped as a result of the end of the Cold War.", "In addition, many universities expressed strong concern about the effect of the 1993 revisions, stating that departmental administrative and clerical salaries should normally be treated as indirect costs. According to university administrators, including these salaries within the 26-percent administrative cap would cause many universities to cut back on departmental support staff, thus leaving faculty to perform these tasks. Federal officials told us that this provision was designed to reduce the possibility that administrative and clerical salary costs might be inadvertently included as both direct and indirect costs for a federally funded research project. In July 1994, OMB issued a memorandum that clarified the July 1993 provision by providing six examples illustrating when administrative and clerical salaries could be charged directly to a federally funded research project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives Proposed for Further Revising Circular A-21", "paragraphs": ["Various options have been proposed for further revising Circular A-21.

Similarly, NSF and HHS Inspector General officials supported simplifying Circular A-21 by establishing a flat-rate system adjusted for locality and other special circumstances. They stated that the Circular A-21 cost accounting procedures are too expensive to implement and susceptible to abuse.", "After the 1993 revisions are included, each university\u2019s negotiated administrative rate could be frozen and made a permanent rate that does not require documentation. In exchange for reducing the burden on universities to document these costs, a permanent rate would preclude further administrative rate increases for universities under the 26-percent cap. The administrative rate might be subject to renegotiation if a university\u2019s total amount of federal research funding substantially changed.", "Circular A-21 allows universities to allocate utility and library costs to federally funded research either by using a standard allocation method or by conducting cost analysis studies designed to more accurately determine actual costs. Cost analysis studies could be eliminated, and the standard method for allocating utility and library costs to federally funded research could be revised to better reflect actual usage.", "Universities can recover the acquisition cost of buildings and equipment by either (1) claiming an annual use allowance of 2 percent for buildings and 6-2/3 percent for equipment or (2) depreciating an asset over its useful life. A more uniform approach could be developed for universities to recover their investment in facilities and equipment by revising use allowance rates to better reflect the actual useful lives of research buildings and equipment while either replacing or simplifying the use of depreciation.", "Circular A-21 could be revised in line with elements of OMB\u2019s September 1994 proposed revision to Circular A-122 (Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations) allowing nonprofit organizations to claim interest on debt for constructing new research facilities. In particular, the proposed revision would require an institution to (1) compute interest on the excess of depreciation and interest reimbursement over the bond principal and interest payments and (2) subtract this amount from the institution\u2019s allowable interest expense, unless it contributes at least 25 percent of an asset\u2019s cost.", "A ceiling could be established on the costs of renovations or improvements to a building that can be expensed in the year incurred as opposed to being depreciated over the building\u2019s useful life. Under Circular A-21, a university could expense a major improvements project even though the costs might be more properly depreciated over the building\u2019s useful life.", "Universities could be encouraged to use Circular A-21\u2019s simplified method to calculate indirect costs. For example, HHS\u2019 rate negotiators suggested that the simplified method allow universities to use either modified total direct costs or wages and salaries as the base for calculating indirect costs. They stated that this change would not add substantially to the costs the government pays smaller universities that use the simplified method.", "We did not fully analyze the effect of these suggested options. Almost all of the agency officials we interviewed and universities we surveyed opposed capping indirect cost rates\u2014through either a system of flat rates or an overall cap\u2014because they believe that limiting cost recovery for facilities would adversely affect universities\u2019 ability to provide the modern laboratory facilities and equipment needed to perform advanced scientific research.

Table II.3 shows that most universities surveyed recover the acquisition cost for both buildings and equipment through the use allowance.", "University administrators and agency officials agreed that the use allowance rates do not reflect the shorter useful lives of (1) certain major building systems\u2014such as the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system\u2014or (2) scientific equipment. In addition, a research building may become technologically obsolete because it was not designed with the capability to, for example, provide scientific needs for greater measuring precision or meet health requirements for ventilating air from laboratories. Similarly, rapid advances in computer technology have made much scientific equipment obsolete before 15 years.", "ONR has allowed universities to switch from use allowance to depreciation more readily than HHS. For example, Cornell University converted to depreciation for both buildings and equipment, and Pennsylvania State University converted to depreciation for equipment. In each case, the amount reimbursed through the use allowance was subtracted from the original purchase price to determine the amount that remained eligible for depreciation. In contrast, HHS\u2019 approach for converting either buildings or equipment from use allowance to depreciation is to allow depreciation charges only for the remaining useful life of the asset. For example, if a university wanted to convert from use allowance to depreciation for recovering construction costs for a 25-year-old building with a useful life of 40 years, it could claim depreciation only for the last 15 years, and thereafter it would not be reimbursed for the use of the building. In this case, the university would have been reimbursed for 50 percent of the building\u2019s cost through the use allowance and 37.5 percent of the cost through depreciation\u2014an 87.5-percent reimbursement. The university could not claim the remaining 12.5 percent of the building\u2019s cost because of the conversion. As a result of this approach, many universities overseen by HHS have decided not to switch from the use allowance method to the depreciation method. One university that switched, New York University Medical Center, did so just before major new laboratory facilities opened in 1993. University of Virginia administrators told us that they would like to convert to depreciation, but they would not be able to recover a substantial portion of their investment in research facilities.", "OMB\u2019s Proposed Revision of Circular A-21 would adopt the HHS approach as the standard method for universities to convert from use allowance to depreciation. OMB also announced its decision to examine and potentially revise the useful life schedule for equipment. This decision responds to (1) the NSTC Subcommittee on Research\u2019s recommendation that standard-level use allowances be developed on the basis of institutional characteristics to replace current depreciation and use allowance practices and (2) a suggestion by the university community that only depreciation be used to recover costs for new buildings, capital improvements, and equipment.", "OMB\u2019s proposed revision would also raise the dollar-value definition of equipment from $500 to $5,000. Overall, 108 of the universities surveyed supported this change, which would (1) reduce the burden of maintaining inventory records on a substantial amount of equipment and (2) allow a university to write off equipment costing less than $5,000 in a shorter period than the 15 years that the use allowance method permits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Revision to OMB Circular A-122 for New Construction", "paragraphs": ["In September 1994, OMB published a proposed revision to Circular A-122 that specifies cost principles for nonprofit organizations that receive federal funding. The proposed revision would allow these organizations to claim interest on debt in certain circumstances. In particular, Circular A-122 would require that nonprofit organizations (1) compute interest on the excess of the depreciation and interest reimbursement over the bond principal and interest payments and (2) treat the computed interest as a reduction in the interest expense to be reimbursed by the government, unless the nonprofit organization makes an initial equity contribution of 25 percent or more to purchase the asset. OMB\u2019s Proposed Revision to Circular A-21 would add a similar provision limiting possible excess interest payments.", "HHS officials supported requiring a minimum downpayment for constructing a research facility. They cited an instance in which a university raised money for a new $40-million research facility through a building campaign, yet borrowed a sum equal to almost the full cost of the facility. The HHS officials noted that a university could make periodic interest payments to bondholders over the life of a 30-year bond and a principal payment after 30 years. However, during the same period, the government would reimburse the university through its indirect cost rate for the interest payments and depreciation associated with space used to perform federally funded research. If the university invested the depreciation payments made over the 30-year period, it might earn substantially more than the principal owed to bondholders. HHS\u2019 Office of Inspector General currently is examining financing practices of five universities for constructing new research facilities.", "In addition, the proposed Circular A-122 revision would require that a nonprofit organization conduct an assessment that demonstrates the need for an asset in the conduct of federally sponsored activities if the government\u2019s reimbursement is expected to equal or exceed 51 percent of an asset\u2019s cost. Alternatively, the university community\u2019s November 1994 working paper suggested using a peer-review process to assess the reasonableness of the costs of construction and renovation that exceed certain benchmarks. The working paper suggested that the peer-review process would be used only for large-scale projects where federal funding plays a major role, citing as an example projects costing at least $25 million for which the government would contribute at least 51 percent of the cost. Both suggestions respond to a concern that universities can construct facilities\u2014the cost of which is to be borne in large part by the government\u2014without any opportunity for the government to assess the need or costs. Some agency officials noted, however, that a peer-review process could add substantial administrative burdens and financial costs to the indirect cost recovery process.

Because Circular A-21 currently does not set a ceiling, a university might decide to expense a major improvements project even though it might more properly be capitalized over the building\u2019s useful life. A $50,000 ceiling was included in OMB\u2019s notice of proposed revisions to Circular A-21 published in the Federal Register in December 1992. However, it was deleted from the final revisions published in July 1993, pending further study. Some agency officials suggested raising the ceiling to $100,000 to allow universities to expense more small improvements projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Encouraging Universities to Use the Simplified Method", "paragraphs": ["Encouraging universities to switch from negotiating indirect cost rates to using the simplified method would reduce the administrative burden for both universities and federal agencies. In return for reducing the burden in accounting for indirect costs, the simplified method would limit the amount of indirect costs that a university could recover. HHS\u2019 rate negotiators suggested that universities be allowed to use modified total direct costs as their base for calculating indirect costs under the simplified method, stating that this change would not add substantially to the costs the government pays smaller universities that use the simplified method. Currently, only salaries and wages constitute the base.", "A second option would enable simplified method users to recover more of their indirect costs, giving some universities that currently negotiate an indirect cost rate a greater incentive to shift to the simplified method. Although this option would also increase federal outlays to more than 400 universities and colleges that currently use the simplified method, the outlays account for only a small percentage of the total federal funding for research at universities and colleges. The 140 universities in our survey received 88 percent of the federal funds obligated to universities and colleges for research in fiscal year 1992.

Specifically, we were asked to assess the effect of (1) October 1991 and (2) July 1993 revisions to Circular A-21.

Rate discrepancies were resolved in all but two universities\u2014the University of Michigan and Utah State University\u2014for which we used the universities\u2019 rates. We analyzed these data using the same factors that our August 1992 report used\u2014whether the institution was a public or private university, where its geographical region was, and whether the institution was among the top 20 recipients of federal research funding. These factors were similar to the three factors that HHS\u2019 May 1992 study, Management of Research Costs: Indirect Costs, had found were statistically significant.
