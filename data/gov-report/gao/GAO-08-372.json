Specifically, GAO was asked to analyze (1) other countries' major efforts to reform entitlement programs, (2) the pressure(s) that led countries to undertake the reforms, (3) how reform proposals were developed, and (4) to what extent enacted reforms built in triggers requiring future actions under certain conditions; and where such trigger mechanisms did not exist, whether some adjustments nonetheless occurred. GAO conducted a literature review focusing on developed, high-income Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries facing similar fiscal challenges. To gain a more in-depth understanding of reform process, GAO selected three efforts for further study: Sweden's pension reform in 1998, Germany's pension reform in 2004, and the Netherlands' disability reform in 2005. For these cases GAO interviewed government officials, reform participants, and experts knowledgeable about the reforms.

Several countries more advanced in population aging and facing greater demographic challenges than ours have successfully undertaken reforms of major entitlement programs. Since the 1980s, almost all of the OECD countries have restructured their public pension programs; disability, unemployment, and other programs have also been reformed. Many reform efforts began or accelerated in an environment of economic and fiscal crisis. Other prompts included longer term concerns about population aging and economic competitiveness, and supranational factors such as a desire to meet the fiscal criteria for entry into the European Union. In many countries, reform occurred despite political processes that made it difficult. Consensus had to be built in coalition governments, and leaders had to work across parties to achieve a broad consensus for reform. Commissions were generally used to develop proposals, but this was only one stage in the reform process. Leaders needed to define the problem, persuading others that reform was needed and urgent. The challenge was to build a broad coalition to assure the reform's permanency while preserving the main policy initiatives sought in the reform process. In some reform efforts political leaders used the \"bully pulpit\" to educate the public but in some cases commissions also helped. Achieving a broad consensus across parties and groups was key to enacting and sustaining reform. Proposals were generally developed by ad hoc commissions established by governments with a strong commitment to reform. Commissions in case study efforts that developed proposals were small, with varying composition. They removed divisive issues from the usual political process, facilitating consultation and negotiation needed to devise a reform package. Commissions also helped to insulate policymakers from political risk. Reform processes were generally complex and often conflict-ridden before they ultimately succeeded in enacting legislation. Many reforms were iterative. Following reform enactment, a need for additional changes sometimes emerged. In some countries standing commissions were established to monitor pension systems and make recommendations for change. Some recent pension reforms have included mechanisms to automatically adjust benefits if adopted reforms prove insufficient to make programs sustainable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Our nation faces a future fiscal challenge that poses severe and  Our nation faces a future fiscal challenge that poses severe and  unacceptable risks to the federal budget and our economy.

From our literature review  we identified instances in other countries where enacted reforms to  programs such as pension or other social welfare programs were expected  or intended to slow cost growth and increase fiscal sustainability.  Although OECD countries have made many reforms to their health care  systems since the 1980s, and reform efforts continue, we found no country  that has been able to optimize the multiple goals of cost containment,  access, and quality over time. Some countries have already undertaken  national pension reform efforts to address demographic changes similar to  those occurring in the United States, and in a previously issued report we  drew lessons from their experiences. Based on this, we selected three  reform efforts for further study, including examples of both iterative and  noniterative types of process: Sweden\u2019s pension reform in 1998; Germany\u2019s  pension reform in 2004; and the Netherlands\u2019 disability reform in 2005.

Reform may entail short-term sacrifice for long-term gain. Some  experts have expressed the view that entitlement reform in the United  States faces unique challenges due to the existence of multiple program  constituencies combined with a complex legislative process with many  hurdles to enactment.", "Since the early 1990s, several commissions have been established to  develop entitlement reform proposals, and considerable public debate,  especially on Social Security reform, has taken place. (See app. II for more  information on historical U.S. commissions on entitlement reform.) Both  the current President and his predecessor discussed the need for Social  Security reform and participated in related town meetings on Social  Security, raising public awareness of the need for change. We have  developed criteria to help Congress evaluate Social Security reform  proposals. These criteria reflect the multiple and conflicting goals that  will have to be balanced in any reform package. To date, major structural  change to the entitlement programs that drive the long-term fiscal  challenge has not been enacted.", "With regard to both Social Security and Medicare, consensus on the need  for reform and reform approaches remains elusive. For example, some do  not believe fundamental structural change to Social Security is necessary.  Among those who have developed proposals, some include individual  accounts and others do not. No major changes have been enacted to Social  Security since 1983, when reform legislation based on a proposal  developed by the Greenspan Commission was enacted in response to a  near-term crisis in program financing. In contrast, Medicare has been  modified frequently, but the most significant change was a 2003 expansion  of benefits to include prescription drugs. This step served to significantly  increase the fiscal imbalance in the Medicare program.", "Challenges posed by the growth path of entitlement spending are not  unique to the U.S. Other developed countries have faced and continue to  face the challenges of unsustainable social welfare programs including  public pensions and health care. Moreover, many developed countries,  especially in Western Europe, face more daunting demographic shifts due  to population aging than the U.S. Figure 1 shows changes in the elderly  dependency ratio\u2013the number of older people relative to those of working  age. As figure 1 shows, population aging in France, Germany, Italy, Japan,  Sweden, and the United Kingdom is already as advanced today as is  projected for the U.S. in 2020.", "Spending on public pensions has presented major challenges in many  countries where such spending generally represents a larger share of the  total economy than in the U.S. Figure 2 shows this spending as a share of  gross domestic product (GDP) in selected high-income countries in 1990  and 2003.", "As in the U.S., health care cost growth presents challenges in OECD  countries, with total healthcare spending, both public and private,  generally rising as a share of GDP in the last 10 years. Although total  health care spending in other countries is smaller as a share of the  economy than in the United States, a larger share of that spending is  public. On average, the public share of health spending in OECD countries  was 73 percent in 2005. For example, in 2005 public health spending as a  share of GDP in Germany was 8.2 percent, or 77 percent of total health  spending; in France 8.9 percent, or 80 percent of total health spending; and  in the U.K. 7.2 percent, or 87 percent of total health spending.

This is also true outside the EU. For example,  in our recent study of accrual budgeting, we found that Australia projects  that health care spending will nearly double as a share of GDP by 2046- 2047.

Like the U.S., many other developed countries have  experienced and expect to continue to experience a rate of cost growth in  their public health programs that exceeds the growth rates of their  economies. Unlike the United States, however, many other countries have  made major changes to their public pension programs in the last two  decades. (For a summary of selected reform efforts, see app. III.)", "In the 1980s, some countries sought to address future financial shortfalls  in their public pension programs by increasing contributions, but since the  early 1990s many pension reform efforts have sought to reduce future  public finance commitments. As shown in figure 2, spending on public  pensions in some other developed countries is much larger than in the  United States. Contribution rates are also higher. In the U.S., contribution  rates for Social Security are 12.4 percent of taxable income. In Sweden  and Germany, rates in 2006 were over 18 percent; in the Netherlands over  25 percent; and in Italy over 30 percent. Governments have either  undertaken far-reaching, structural pension reforms or adopted a series of  smaller reforms which, taken together, affect future pension entitlements  substantially. Although Sweden undertook a single major overhaul; more  typically, several rounds of reform took place as in Italy, France, Germany,  and Japan.", "Since the early 1990s almost all the 30 OECD countries have made changes  to restructure their public pension programs with a clear trend toward  reduced benefit promises. In 16 OECD countries that implemented  significant reform in the last 10 years, OECD estimates that the benefit  promise was reduced by 22 percent. Italy, Sweden, France, Austria,  Germany, and Japan reduced replacement rates for workers with average  earnings by at least 6 percent. In assessing future fiscal risk of individual  European Union member countries, a 2007 European Commission report  cited pension reforms in Italy, Sweden, France, Austria, Denmark, and  Germany as having contributed to increased sustainability of public  finances.", "Efforts to reform pensions are continuing. For example, in France the  current government is seeking changes including reductions to pension  benefits for certain civil servants; reform of civil service pensions was  previously attempted in 1995. The U.K., which restructured its public  pension program in the 1980s and has made numerous changes since then,  has recently enacted a new major reform following the work of the Turner  Commission. Among other changes, this reform combines an increase in  the retirement age with higher promised benefits to address an emerging  problem of poverty among the elderly. This tension between reducing  costs and the need to avoid increasing the number of elderly poor is  reflected in the OECD\u2019s 2007 report on the status of pension reforms. This  report noted that in some countries further reforms are needed to ensure  fiscal sustainability while in others previous enacted reforms may have to  be revisited given the risk of old-age poverty for low-income workers.", "Non-pension social welfare programs have also been subject to change,  with many reforms reducing benefits. For example, in 14 of 20 OECD  countries changes in disability policy between 1985 and 2000 included  reductions in compensation, with the Netherlands undertaking the largest  reductions. The Netherlands also undertook the largest policy change  with respect to increased integration of disabled people. More recent  disability reforms in the Netherlands were cited as contributing to curbing  long-term public spending in the European Commission\u2019s 2006 report  assessing the sustainability of public finances. Since the early 1990s,  concerns about cost containment have played a role in reforms of  unemployment programs in countries such as Canada, France (2001), and  Germany (2003-2005). Reforms of social assistance (welfare) programs  were enacted in the Netherlands (2004). Efforts to reform other types of  programs continue as well. For example, Sweden is seeking further reform  of its sickness benefit, under which general tax revenue and employer and  employee contributions pay employees for sick days.", "In some countries, reforms sought to make changes to related programs at  the same time. For example, the Hartz reforms in Germany integrated  unemployment and social assistance. In recent years the Netherlands has  undertaken reform of unemployment, social assistance, and health care as  well as disability. In Denmark a 2006 comprehensive reform package  known as the \u201cWelfare Agreement\u201d included changes to unemployment  policy, increases in the retirement age, and provisions for increased  investment in education. The Danish government described the Welfare  Agreement as part of a national reform strategy building on two decades of  reforms and was based in part on the work of a 2003 expert commission.", "In our 2003 report on strategies to increase labor force participation  among older workers, we studied policies in three countries with high  levels of older worker participation and recent reforms\u2014Japan, Sweden,  and the United Kingdom. All three countries had made changes to their  pension systems. Sweden and the United Kingdom had also tightened  eligibility requirements for disability insurance to reduce its use as a path  to early retirement. Officials in these countries agreed on the need for  comprehensive reforms, e.g., changes to national pension reforms should  be accompanied by reforms in the employer-provided pension system, in  related social insurance programs such as disability, and in labor market  policies.", "OECD countries have made many reforms to their health care systems  since the 1980s, and reform efforts continue. For example, the  Netherlands has recently restructured its health system with a stated aim  of containing health care cost increases. We found no country that has  been able to optimize the multiple goals of cost containment, access, and  quality over time. As has been noted by the Deputy Head of OECD\u2019s Health  Division, the challenge for OECD countries today is how to ensure their  health systems will be sustainable given population aging and a rate of  health care cost growth faster than the economy.", "As in the United States, structural reform of health systems is highly  controversial, and the reform process may take time. The 2002 Rurup  Commission in Germany was charged with developing recommendations  to ensure sustainability for the social insurance system including pensions,  health care, and long-term care. Two opposing approaches for health care  financing were discussed, but the Commission was unable to reach  consensus on a proposal.

In many countries reforms occurred in environments of  economic and fiscal crisis. Long-term concerns about population aging  and economic competitiveness are commonly cited as prompting reforms,  especially of pension programs. Supranational factors such as a desire to  meet the fiscal criteria needed for entry into the European Monetary  Union have also been cited as constituting pressures for reform.", "Many reform efforts began or accelerated in an environment of economic  and fiscal crisis. In the early 1990s, for example, the Swedish pension  reform process took on urgency as Sweden was experiencing its worst  recession since the 1930s, with growing public debt and a devaluation of  its currency. A Parliamentary Working Group established by the  government in 1991 developed the reform proposal that was ultimately  enacted in 1998. Similarly, the 2002 reform effort of the German pension  system was triggered by an economic downturn that worsened the  program\u2019s financial condition and led to the establishment of the Rurup  Commission. Although the Commission reached no consensus on health  care and long-term care, the pension reforms it recommended were  enacted in 2004 and 2007. According to experts, pension reforms in  Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, and New Zealand all took  place in an environment of economic and fiscal crisis.", "Long-term pressures are also frequently cited as motivating reforms. Our  2005 report found that demographic as well as fiscal factors necessitated  pension reform in many countries. With rising longevity and declining  birthrates, the number of workers for each retiree is falling in most  developed countries, straining the finances of national pension programs,  particularly where contributions from current workers fund payments to  current beneficiaries. Population aging affects pension programs and  projections directly. Swedish and German government officials attributed  pension reforms primarily to concerns about the programs\u2019 long-term  fiscal sustainability. Similarly, according to a Japanese government  official, since 1994, projections of Japan\u2019s pension program\u2019s financial  condition have necessitated a series of reforms largely due to further aging  of society.", "Concerns about competitiveness in an era of globalization combined with  current and future population aging are also cited as leading to entitlement  reforms and influencing reform options. In the 1980s some pension  reforms raised payroll tax contribution rates, but in the 1990s a desire in  some countries to keep non-wage labor costs as low as possible tilted  options toward benefit reductions. For example, in Germany, avoiding  higher payroll tax contribution rates was one concern in their 1990s  reforms. Reforms that included benefit reductions and eligibility changes  in pension and non-pension social welfare programs, e.g., disability and  unemployment, sought to increase labor force participation rates as one  response to competitiveness concerns. The European Commission has  noted a need to increase employment rates, notably of older workers, as  an issue of prime importance in EU countries. The Commission has further  noted that in countries where a significant decrease in the benefit ratio,  i.e., average pensions over GDP per worker, is projected, raising  employment rates of older workers is especially important as this could  reduce the risk of possibly inadequate pensions in the future.", "Supranational factors are also said to have played a part in bringing about  entitlement reforms. In some European countries, the desire of some  countries to meet fiscal criteria for entry into the European Monetary  Union (EMU) has been cited as a factor leading to reforms. For example,  Italy\u2019s 1992 pension reform was undertaken as the country sought to join  the EMU. Entitlement reforms during the 1990s in countries such as  Netherlands, France, and Germany have similarly linked to these  countries\u2019 efforts to meet the fiscal criteria for EMU membership. More  recently, the European Commission has encouraged its member countries  to adapt their public programs including entitlements such as pensions  and health care to be better able to cope with future economic challenges  as part of the \u201cLisbon Strategy\u201d to ensure growth and jobs. Denmark\u2019s  first progress report on its national reform program, developed as a  contribution to the Lisbon Strategy, focuses on its 2006 Welfare  Agreement.", "Clearly, these various pressures are not mutually exclusive in Europe or  elsewhere. For example, according to a Japanese government official, the  1985 pension reform in Japan was introduced as part of a broader fiscal  reform in a context of the end of rapid economic growth, growing public  debt, and the aging of society. Neither are the pressures sufficient  explanations for why some countries enacted reform changes to increase  program sustainability while others did not. As a result, according to  OECD, some countries\u2019 pension systems continue to need a major  overhaul."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Reform Proposals Were Developed in Other Countries", "paragraphs": ["Detailed reform proposals in other countries were generally developed by  commissions or other specially established groups. Proposal  development, however, is only one stage in what is often a long, difficult,  and conflict-ridden process. Before reform can be enacted and  implemented, policymakers and the public generally need to have a shared  understanding of the size, scope, and nature of the problem. Next, reform  options need to be developed, and reform packages that key stakeholders  can support need to be negotiated. This stage generally involves dialogue,  negotiation, and coalition building to reach a sufficient degree of  consensus across political parties and groups in society. Special groups  outside the normal political process such as commissions can be used to  create a space where the difficult negotiations needed to reach consensus  can take place. Such groups can mitigate political risk for reform  participants as well as educate the public, creating pressure for change.  Finally, a reform package needs to be enacted and implemented in  succeeding years. Whatever the reform process, leadership is key at all  stages for reform to be enacted and sustained. As one expert has put it,  for broad-ranging reform to occur, two conditions must exist: first, the  public must believe that change is needed, and second, leadership must be  able to transform this perception into an agenda that crystallizes the issues  and points to their solution."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stage 1 of Reform: Framing the Problem", "paragraphs": ["In reform efforts we examined, various events and actions helped define  the size and scope of the problem.

In the  early 1990s, government efforts to reform the disability program in the  Netherlands and reduce benefits had met with considerable political  opposition. Then-Prime Minister Lubbers made a speech in which he  declared that if the number of disability claimants exceeded 1 million, he  would resign. Analysts, including some who participated in later reform  efforts, cited this measure as having re-framed the public discussion about  disability. Although this number was never reached, the \u201c1 million\u201d  number became a widely accepted symbol of the need for reform in both  expert studies and public discussion. This continued to be the case as the  number of disability claimants rose and fell throughout the 1990s and into  the early 2000s.", "Netherlands disability reform: televised hearings by the  Buurmeijer Parliamentary Commission led to a change in the  conversation about disability. In the mid 1990s, the Buurmeijer  Commission, a special parliamentary inquiry chaired by Social Democrat  Flip Buurmeijer, investigated the administration of disability by  employers and employee groups. According to experts, this kind of  parliamentary inquiry is rare and considered significant in Dutch politics.  The work of the Commission took many months and received widespread  public attention through nightly televised hearings. According to experts,  this Commission\u2019s work had profound effects on the subsequent reform  process. The Commission\u2019s recommendations influenced later legislation;  in the public discussion they raised issues as to whether the program was  meeting its goal of serving the truly needy.

The Commission\u2019s recommendation for a  \u201csustainability factor\u201d in the pension system was enacted in 2004 by the  Social Democrats; its recommendation to raise the retirement age was  enacted in 2007 by a coalition of Christian Democrats and Social  Democrats.", "In some reforms, the process of negotiation and proposal development  continued after the commission had concluded its work. For example, the  Donner Commission\u2019s disability reform proposal was reviewed by an  institution representing employer groups, labor unions, and the  government. This review, a routine feature in the Dutch legislative  process, led to further changes before legislation was enacted. Similarly,  according to the Danish government, the 2006 Welfare Agreement was  based not only on the recommendations of the Danish Welfare  Commission but also on the work of two other groups, the Danish  Globalisation Council and a tripartite council of employer, employee (e.g.,  labor unions), and government representatives.", "Although all three case study countries used ad hoc commissions,  commissions involved in a reform process can also be standing  institutions. Japan used Pension Councils coordinated by a government  ministry and composed of representatives of employers\u2019 groups, labor  unions, academic researchers, and government officials to facilitate  pension reforms during the 1990s. Other countries also have standing  commissions. Whether ad hoc or standing, commissions or other  specially established groups are commonly used to develop reform  specifics because they can take divisive and controversial issues out of the  usual political process, facilitate consultation and negotiation, and help to  insulate policymakers from political risks inherent in supporting a reform  package.", "Although commissions are a frequently used means to develop proposals,  governments have also taken other approaches. In some countries the  government developed reforms on a unilateral basis, i.e., without seeking  consensus through participation by opposition parties or other  stakeholders. Sometimes such efforts succeeded in creating changes; in  other cases, they did not. The 1980s pension reform in the U.K. was  enacted despite opposition and sustained over time with numerous  adjustments. However in France a unilateral approach did not lead to  legislative enactment. A 1995 civil service pension reform effort met with  sufficient opposition that it was not enacted. The same thing happened  with a 1994 pension reform effort in Italy, which led to a change in  government. In other cases, the public was involved in the reform  process. Canada\u2019s 1997 pension reform included public consultations that  highlighted consensus principles for reform. In Japan\u2019s 2000 reform,  reform alternatives were presented to the public in the early stages of  discussion. Indeed, a 2000 study noted that a process involving  consultation, negotiation, and public education has been used for pension  reform in highly industrialized countries in recent years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Process of Reform Is Complex and Not Sequential", "paragraphs": ["In reforms we examined, the reform process as it unfolded did not  proceed in a simple or straightforward manner from problem definition to  negotiation and consensus-building to enactment. Rather, the reform  process at some points seemed more like a zigzag or \u201ctwo steps forward,  one step back\u201d than a straight line.", "An important provision of the 1997/1999 pension reform by the Christian  Democrats in Germany was revoked by the successor Social Democratic  government. This same government subsequently undertook a structural  reform in 2001 and in 2002 established the Rurup Commission to address  unexpected shortfalls in pension financing.  In Sweden, following the work of the 1991 group, a second Parliamentary  Working Group worked out legislative details of the reform between 1994  and 1998 while leaders of the Social Democratic party worked to persuade  opponents within their party on the need for and contours of reform.", "Similarly, the activities of consultation, negotiation, and public education  may occur at several points in the process, with commissions performing  multiple roles. For example, the Danish Welfare Commission both  developed recommendations used in the legislative process and educated  the public about the need for change. The 2002 Rurup Commission\u2019s  recommendation to raise the retirement age is said to have led to a  controversial public debate, with this change enacted in 2007.", "Reform is difficult. Commissions can help, but they are a tool in a larger  process, not a guarantee of reform success. For reform changes to be  enacted and sustained, a sufficient degree of consensus across the major  parties and acceptance by the general public of the need for change must  be achieved. Leadership is needed to bring this about. In Sweden and  Germany, formal and informal cross-party cooperation was key in moving  reform forward; in the Netherlands, disability reforms were enacted by  various coalition governments. Consultation took place with key  stakeholders either formally or informally. As experts have noted, the  tension is to build a broad coalition to assure the permanency of the  reform, while preserving the main policy initiatives sought in the reform  process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Reform Process May Continue Following Enactment of Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Each country\u2019s reform process was unique, but some re-adjustment or  fine-tuning often occurred over time. In some cases adjustments were  needed to address emerging implementation challenges. In other cases  change included new rounds of reform as the reform process became  iterative. In recent pension reforms, a trend has emerged toward including  automatic mechanisms, or triggers, which aim at insulating reforms from  policy change. These types of mechanisms are structured to reduce  benefits without legislative action under specified circumstances, e.g., if  demographic or economic trends prove unexpectedly unfavorable.", "As reforms are implemented, unexpected challenges may emerge that call  for fine-tuning or other adjustments including due to unintended  consequences.", "In Sweden, following the implementation of pension reform, changes to  individual account administration have been under discussion. Since  account inception, the number of Swedes making active investment  choices has dropped, with more people routing their money into the  government default option. A government committee has recommended  limiting investment options from over 700 accounts to around 200, and  converting the default fund into a fund that adjusts based on an  individual\u2019s age. To date, no changes have been enacted.  In the Netherlands, one of the disability reforms sought to provide  employers with incentives to limit the number of their employees claiming  disability. However, some experts said that in response employers began  to seek ways to identify prospective employees who posed a risk of  becoming sick or disabled. Legislation was then passed preventing health  screenings in the hiring process.", "The United Kingdom experienced substantial difficulties in the 1980s when  it implemented its pension reform, in part, by providing too little public  education and relying on its already existing regulatory system, which  proved to be inadequate. In what has become known as the \u2018mis-selling\u2019  controversy, high-pressure sales tactics were used to persuade individuals,  especially older workers, to take up individual accounts when they would  more likely have been better off retaining their occupation-based  pensions.", "As we noted in our report on other countries\u2019 pension reforms, the extent  to which new provisions are implemented, administered, and explained to  the public may affect the outcome of the reform.", "In some cases the need to revisit is anticipated and initial legislation  provides for some form of periodic re-visiting under specified  circumstances. For example, Germany and Japan established \u201csoft\u201d  triggers as part of their pension reforms. The 2001 German reform  included a requirement that if projections did not meet specified  thresholds for maximum expected contribution rates or minimum  replacement rates in the future, government action would need to be  taken. Triggered in 2002, this mechanism led to the establishment of the  Rurup Commission. A similar mechanism in Japan requiring an  examination every 5 years of its pension program\u2019s sustainability led to  additional rounds of reform. Other countries also have established  institutions to monitor pension fiscal sustainability and in some cases are  tasked with recommending adjustments as appropriate.", "Reform processes can be described as one-time \u201cbig bang\u201d reforms as in  Sweden; more commonly, reforms are iterative as in the Netherlands  disability reform or German pension reform. In our work on other  countries\u2019 pension reforms, we noted that, in almost every country we  studied, debate continued about alternatives for additional reform  measures even after initial changes were enacted. It is clearly not a  process that ends with one reform, and it often requires more than one  type of reform. An iterative process can be understood as reflecting the  difficulties posed by reform of popular and politically sensitive programs.", "Some have pointed out that frequent changes may have a downside. Some  officials we spoke with noted that although an iterative process may be  politically necessary, constant re-opening of issues is not ideal. In some  cases where several rounds of reforms occurred, frequent changes to  pension systems created public mistrust. For example, in Japan  noncompliance with the system became an issue in the public debate in  the early 2000s following a series of pension reforms driven by rapid  population aging. Swedish officials said that achieving a consensus on a  reform that would be politically sustainable was one reason that the  reform process took so long.", "Because reform is so difficult, a major goal is to have a reform that will  last. Given that there is uncertainty about the future, some pension  reforms include mechanisms to reduce benefits (and in some cases also  increase revenues) without intervention by policymakers. In 2001 as part  of its reform changes Sweden enacted an automatic balancing mechanism  to adjust benefits if other reform changes prove insufficient to keep the  pension program in fiscal balance. The automatic balance mechanism is a  kind of \u201chard trigger\u201d that comes into play under specified circumstances.  Following Sweden\u2019s lead, several other countries have adopted similar  types of mechanisms, and these mechanisms are considered an emerging  trend in pension reform. Germany\u2019s 2004 pension reform included a  \u201csustainability factor\u201d as recommended by the Rurup Commission. The  sustainability factor automatically adjusts benefits based on the number of  workers to beneficiaries. Pension reforms in Japan, Italy, Canada and  other countries have also included automatic adjustment mechanisms. An  aim of this type of mechanism is to insulate reforms from future legislative  changes, thereby increasing trust in program sustainability and  compliance with the system. In addition, experts have noted that such  mechanisms could mitigate political risk for policymakers in the event  reductions are triggered.", "The effects of such mechanisms generally remain to be seen. In Japan, a  mechanism adopted in 2004 to limit increases in contribution rates has  been triggered. According to one expert, the result has been accepted by  the public following a painful public debate.", "Experts have expressed differing views concerning these types of  mechanisms as used in pension reforms. Some have expressed the view  that automatic mechanisms may be the best approach to slowing cost  growth in the entitlement programs driving the long-term fiscal challenge.  Others have noted that mechanisms could be subject to erosion should  they be triggered and the required benefit reductions prove politically  unacceptable. Those who support the concept of automatic mechanisms  note that in this event legislators always have the option of suspending the  mechanism and are unlikely to raise benefits above the levels that would  have been the case had the mechanism never been activated. In any case,  triggers may make it more difficult to ignore that a problem exists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications for the United States", "paragraphs": ["The experiences of other countries suggest that while reform is difficult, it  is also possible.

Nonetheless, politically sensitive and popular  programs such as public pensions were reformed including those which  were (and are) more generous to individuals and constituted a larger share  of their economy than is the case in the U.S.", "The experiences of other countries also underline that for reform to be  enacted and sustained, it needs broad-based support that reaches across  parties and groups.

In other  countries leaders undertook many actions to begin the reform process and  move it forward to enactment and implementation. Leaders framed the  problem in new ways, persuaded the public and other policymakers that  reform was necessary and urgent, established commissions to develop  reform packages, and worked to build coalitions to support reform.  Throughout the process, leaders had to negotiate tensions between the  need to build broad coalitions while maintaining reform goals. In the U.S.,  presidential leadership will be key if reform is to happen.", "As in the 1983 reform of Social Security, other countries\u2019 experiences  show that commissions can be a useful tool. Commissions in other  countries moved reform forward by educating the public and also  provided a forum for developing reform packages. Commissions we  studied often met out of the public eye, thereby facilitating discussions  and negotiations that could then be supported by all those involved.  Establishing a commission, however, does not guarantee that a reform  package that can gain consensus will be developed. While commissions  can help, they are not a substitute for leadership or political will.", "Other countries\u2019 experiences show that for reform to occur, certain  elements must fall into place. For reform to occur and be sustained, the  public and policymakers in other countries were ultimately persuaded that  reform was necessary and urgent. Coalitions were built to support reform,  and a package that could gain support and a broad consensus was  negotiated and enacted. For reforms to be enacted and be sustained by  future governments, the involvement of major stakeholders whose support  was necessary for the success of the reform was needed, whether through  membership in the commission or through some other means.

Like its predecessor, the new system uses pay-as- you-go financing; however, the former benefit scheme was replaced with  notional and individual accounts whose balances are based primarily on  work-related contributions, and a guaranteed minimum pension for low- income individuals (see table 1). Credits for child care, education, military  service, and sickness also contribute to an individual\u2019s pension rights.

During this period,  however, Social Democrat leaders faced opposition to the reforms within  their party, as some members believed the reforms veered too far from the  existing system the Social Democrats created.

These private pensions were made voluntary, but the  government sought to encourage people to take them up by offering direct  subsidies or tax advantages. The relatively good performance of the stock  market in the 1990s and the idea that everyone could benefit from it played  a role in the promotion of these private pensions, according to an expert.  The successful introduction of individual accounts in other countries,  especially Sweden, which was viewed as a model by the Social Democrats,  also played a role.", "The Riester reforms stipulated a gradual reduction of the PAYGO first  pillar pensions by modifying the adjustment formula. They also set to  stabilize contributions rates at no more than 20 percent before 2020 and   22 percent before 2030 for the first pillar to avoid negative effects on  employment and growth. In addition, the reform package fixed a target for  the replacement rate, promising that pensions would not fall below            67 percent of average net earnings, from the current 70 percent. The  replacement rate was actually redefined insofar as it assumed the average  worker would invest 4 percent of his or her gross earnings in the new  voluntary supplementary pensions.

In November 2002 immediately after winning a  second term in the federal elections, Chancellor Schroeder\u2019s government  set up a commission. The Rurup Commission was charged to make  recommendations on ways to achieve sustainability in the pension system,  as well as in health and long-term care insurance schemes.

The subcommission on public pensions had about a third of the total  number of members. It was successful in pushing for broad reforms,  unlike the other two subcommissions on health and long-term care  insurance, partly because the group agreed early on to avoid extreme  ideological positions and find a rational, rule-bound middle ground  acceptable to everyone, according to a member of this group. The  subcommission on health insurance, on the other hand, was deeply  divided and could not achieve a majority behind a policy model.  Moreover, the media focused its attention on the bitter debates over health  insurance financing as those became public, even though commission  members were supposed to avoid public commentary and position taking,  according to government officials. This allowed the pension group to work  without close public scrutiny.", "All but one of the recommendations of the Rurup Commission regarding  pensions\u2014the 2004 reforms\u2014became legislation fairly rapidly. Building  on the Riester reforms, the new provisions included supplementing the  pension benefit adjustment formula with a new \u201csustainability factor\u201d to  reflect changes in the number of workers supporting the system relative to  pensioners; and loosening the rules and regulations governing the Riester  pensions to encourage greater participation. The sustainability factor  would lead to smaller pension adjustment, hence smaller increase in  benefits, whenever the ratio of contributors to pensioners declines. The  pension adjustment would be allowed to go down to zero but not lower to  prevent pensions from declining, in nominal terms. The commission\u2019s  projections showed that individuals choosing to invest in supplementary  pensions, either in the second or third pillar, would be able to maintain a  constant replacement rate. The sustainability factor was introduced to  ensure that the pension system would be self-sustaining, balancing itself  automatically in line with demographic development and employment  levels. The expectation was that such a mechanism reduces the need for  future reexamination and helps \u201cdepoliticize\u201d the system.", "The 2004 reforms also stipulated that the government should report to the  legislative bodies\u2014the Bundestag and Bundesrat\u2014every 4 years on  whether targeted replacement rates for 2020 and 2030 are at risk, given the  contributions rates, and if so, propose remedies.", "Only one recommendation of the Rurup Commission\u2014the gradual  increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67\u2014was adopted later in 2007 by  the current coalition government, which includes both the SPD and the  CDU.
