GAO found that Reclamation's grant award process is consistent with relevant federal regulations for awarding grants. For example, the Title XVI funding opportunity announcements GAO reviewed contained information required by the regulations, such as the criteria used to evaluate applications.

Reclamation is responsible for awarding and  monitoring Title XVI grants to nonfederal project sponsors, who are  involved in the planning, designing, and constructing of these projects.  Title XVI grants generally require a cost share from the project sponsor.  For example, federal funding for construction projects under the Title XVI  program is generally limited to 25 percent of total project costs\u2014up to $20  million in federal funding\u2014and requires a 75 percent nonfederal cost  share from the project sponsor.

From 1992 through 2009, Congress authorized a total  of 53 water reuse projects for construction under the Title XVI program. In  December 2016, the act was amended through Section 4009 of the Water  Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act), which  authorized the Secretary of the Interior to provide grants for water reuse  projects with agency-approved feasibility studies.

We  selected this time period to cover funding from the inception of the  program through the most current data that were available at the time of  our review. To determine the reliability of Reclamation\u2019s financial data, we  reviewed agency documents, compared publicly available information to  Reclamation\u2019s Title XVI financial data, and interviewed agency officials.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  our review. To determine the amount Reclamation has awarded to Title  XVI studies and projects, we analyzed the agency\u2019s financial data. To  determine remaining project costs for individually congressionally  authorized projects, we further analyzed the financial data to determine  the federal share of remaining costs. For individually authorized projects  that have not received the full federal funding share, we verified with  project sponsors the status of projects in terms of planned construction.  To determine remaining project costs for Title XVI projects eligible under  the WIIN Act, we reviewed relevant feasibility studies to calculate the  federal share of remaining costs.", "For the second objective, we reviewed documents from Reclamation and  project sponsors that describe the types of projects and studies funded  under the Title XVI program. We analyzed the information to categorize  each Title XVI project by the purpose or use of the reused water, such as  irrigation, commercial and industrial uses, and indirect-potable reuse. This  information was independently verified to confirm the categorization of  each project. To learn more about the types of Title XVI projects and  studies funded, we interviewed project sponsors from all 17 of the  individually authorized projects that Reclamation documents listed as  being ongoing at the time of our review, as well as all 3 of the WIIN Act- eligible projects that Reclamation selected for grants in fiscal year 2017.  We also interviewed a nonprobability sample (11 of 25) of project  sponsors of projects that had been completed, or had already been  awarded their full federal cost share. We selected project sponsors from  different Reclamation regions and with a variety of project sizes (i.e.  amount of water to be delivered) and types. Because this was a  nonprobability sample, the views of the sponsors we spoke with are not  representative of the views of all Title XVI project sponsors but provide  illustrative examples of the views of project sponsors for a range of Title  XVI projects. We conducted some of our interviews with project sponsors  by telephone and others in person. This included interviews conducted  during site visits to 14 Title XVI projects\u2014selected to understand different  purposes and types of projects\u2014in central and southern California in  March and April 2018. In addition to project sponsors, we also spoke with  representatives from eight nongovernmental organizations that sponsor  research, have an interest in water reuse, or represent water or  wastewater districts.

We selected this time frame because 2011 was the year that  Reclamation introduced a competitive selection process for annual Title  XVI grants. To assess the extent to which Reclamation\u2019s process for  selecting projects is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations, we  compared the process Reclamation uses to select projects against the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Uniform Administrative  Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal  Awards (Uniform Guidance). For this comparison, we selected relevant  provisions from the Uniform Guidance that pertain to the project selection  process. To determine how evaluation criteria have changed since  2011, we analyzed the criteria listed in Reclamation\u2019s funding opportunity  announcements for fiscal years 2011 through 2018 and discussed the  reasons for changes to the criteria with Reclamation officials. To identify  project sponsors\u2019 views on the process and changes to the criteria, we  interviewed project sponsors and reviewed relevant documentation,  including letters project sponsors sent to Reclamation.", "For the fourth objective, we reviewed relevant federal grant regulations  outlined in OMB\u2019s Uniform Guidance as well as agency guidance related  to the monitoring process. To assess the extent to which the monitoring  process is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations, we  compared the process Reclamation uses to monitor grants against  relevant sections of OMB\u2019s Uniform Guidance. We analyzed financial  and performance reports related to all 56 Title XVI grants that were active  at the end of fiscal year 2017 using a standard document review tool to  determine the extent to which these reports contained information  required by the Uniform Guidance or Reclamation. For financial reports,  we determined whether project sponsors submitted required reports by  their due dates and whether they submitted these reports on the form  required by the agency. For performance reports, we determined whether  project sponsors submitted reports by their due dates and whether these  reports contained information on progress made toward constructing the  Title XVI project.

Reclamation carries out its  portion of the WaterSMART program by administering grants, including  Title XVI grants for water reuse, conducting research, and providing  technical assistance and scientific expertise. Reclamation offers three  types of grants to project sponsors under the Title XVI program:  construction projects, which are projects to plan, design, or construct  infrastructure for the treatment and distribution of reused water;  feasibility studies, which are documents that generally identify specific  water reuse opportunities, describe alternatives, and incorporate other  considerations, such as the financial capability of the project sponsor;  and  research studies, which are studies to help states, tribes, and local  communities establish or expand water reuse markets, improve  existing water reuse facilities, or streamline the implementation of new  water reuse facilities.", "Key Terms Related to Water Reuse", "Acre-foot of water: about 326,000 gallons  generally identify specific water reuse  opportunities; describe alternatives; and  incorporate other considerations, such as  the financial capability of the project  sponsor.", "Federal awards for construction projects under the Title XVI program are  generally limited to 25 percent of total project costs\u2014up to $20 million in  federal funding\u2014and require a 75 percent nonfederal cost share from the  project sponsor.

Each of these projects was subject to a cap on the federal cost share. In  fiscal years 1992 through 2010, Congress generally directed funding for  these specific authorized projects each year. Starting in fiscal year  2011, Congress began appropriating funding for the Title XVI program  without directing specific funding to individual projects. As a result,  Reclamation started using a competitive process to award Title XVI  grants to projects and studies, through which project sponsors with  authorized projects applied for Title XVI grants. Only the 53 projects  that were already authorized by Congress were eligible to apply for  grants for construction projects. Section 4009(c) of the WIIN Act,  enacted in December 2016, authorized an additional $50 million to be  appropriated for water reuse projects. To be eligible to receive Title XVI  grants under the WIIN Act, projects must submit a completed feasibility  study to Reclamation, and Reclamation must review the study to  determine whether, among other things, the project is technically and  financially feasible and provides a federal benefit in accordance with the  reclamation laws. Reclamation is then to submit a report with the results  of its review to Congress, and projects determined to be feasible are then  eligible to apply for grants under the competitive grant program  established by the WIIN Act. Each feasibility study identifies an  estimated project cost. Like most projects individually authorized prior to  the WIIN Act, the federal share of this cost is generally capped at 25  percent, up to $20 million.

For example, municipal wastewater typically  undergoes primary and secondary treatment before it can be discharged  into a river, stream, or other body of water. With water reuse,  wastewater generally undergoes further (tertiary) treatment to remove  additional nutrients and suspended solids and to disinfect the water. The  treated water can then be reused for nonpotable uses, such as landscape  or agricultural irrigation or industrial uses. In some cases, wastewater  undergoes additional, advanced treatment\u2014such as microfiltration and  reverse osmosis\u2014and may then be suitable for potable uses, such as  injection into a groundwater basin or reservoir where it may later be  extracted for drinking water.

For example, in a 2012 report on municipal wastewater reuse,  the National Research Council of the National Academies estimated that  U.S. municipalities discharged about 12 billion gallons of treated  municipal wastewater each day into coastal waters. They estimated that  reuse of these coastal discharges could directly augment available water  sources by providing the equivalent of 27 percent of the municipal supply.  Municipalities discharge another 20 billion gallons each day to inland locations. While reuse of inland discharges has the potential to affect the  water supply of downstream users by decreasing the amount of water  available to them, we previously found that at least some of this volume  could also be beneficial.

According to Reclamation data, the projects funded by Title XVI  individually delivered between 38 acre-feet of reused water and more  than 100,000 acre-feet of water in fiscal year 2017. Most of these  construction projects provided reused water for nonpotable uses across  four main categories: (1) landscape irrigation, (2) agricultural irrigation,  (3) commercial and industrial use, and (4) habitat restoration.", "Landscape irrigation. Landscape irrigation\u2014including irrigation of golf  courses, road medians, school grounds, parks, sport fields, and other  green spaces\u2014is the most common use of reused water produced by  Title XVI projects, with 29 Title XVI projects producing reused water for  this purpose, based on our analysis of documents from Reclamation and  project sponsors. The reused, nonpotable water produced by such  projects is generally distributed through purple-colored pipes, to denote  that the water is not for drinking purposes. For example, the Title XVI  program provided grants to Eastern Municipal Water District\u2014a water  district located in Southern California\u2014to help build water reuse infrastructure, including pipelines, pumping stations, and storage tanks.  With this added storage capacity, the district has the ability to store more  than 2 billion gallons of reused water, which is used to irrigate sports  fields, golf courses, parks, school grounds, and medians, according to the  project sponsor. By maximizing use of its reused water, the project  sponsor noted that the district is reducing its dependence on water piped  in from other parts of the state or region. Similarly, the Title XVI program  provided grants to help build pipelines and reservoirs to distribute and  store reused water for landscape irrigation and other purposes in other  parts of California (see fig. 4).", "Agricultural irrigation. Reused water produced by Title XVI projects is also  used to irrigate a variety of agricultural products, including fruits and  vegetables, flowers, and vineyards. For example, the North Valley  Regional Recycled Water Program is helping to provide a reliable water  source for the Del Puerto Water District, which provides water to  approximately 45,000 acres of farmland in California\u2019s San Joaquin  Valley, according to the project sponsor. The Del Puerto Water District  has encountered water shortages in recent years, which have created  economic hardships on growers in the area, according to the project  sponsor. Title XVI grants provided under WIIN Act authority helped the  district expand its reused water supply and distribution infrastructure and  ensure a reliable, drought-resistant water supply, according to the project  sponsor. In addition, reused water produced by the Watsonville Area  Water Recycling Project near Watsonville, California, is used to irrigate  strawberries and other fruits and vegetables as well as flowers. The  groundwater basin that serves the coastal region where Watsonville is  located has been overdrafted for a long time, causing groundwater  elevations to drop below sea level and leading to seawater intrusion that  makes the groundwater unusable in certain areas, according to the  project sponsor. This sponsor noted that Watsonville\u2019s Title XVI project  helps reduce demand on the overdrafted groundwater basin, which in turn  helps to protect against further seawater intrusion and also provides a  reliable, drought-tolerant water supply to help protect the region\u2019s  agricultural economy. Figure 5 shows flowers in a greenhouse that are  irrigated with reused water from Watsonville\u2019s Title XVI project.", "Commercial and industrial use. Reused water produced by Title XVI  projects is used for cooling towers at power plants and data centers, oil  production, toilet flushing in university and commercial buildings, and for  other commercial and industrial purposes, according to project sponsors.  For example, some of the reused water produced by the Southern  Nevada Title XVI project is used for power plant cooling, and reused  water from San Jose\u2019s Title XVI project is used for cooling at data centers  in California\u2019s Silicon Valley. In addition, reused water from the Long  Beach Area Reclamation Project is injected into the ground after oil is  extracted, which helps prevent the ground from sinking, according to the  project sponsor. Having access to a secure source of reused water can  attract data centers and other businesses that require large amounts of  water to areas that can guarantee access to reused water, according to a  project sponsor and representatives from a nongovernmental water reuse  organization we interviewed.", "Habitat restoration. Some Title XVI projects use reused water to restore  wetlands or supply water to recreational lakes. For example, in  California\u2019s Napa Valley, reused water from the North Bay Title XVI  project is being used to restore the Napa Sonoma Salt Marsh. Some  threatened and endangered species, such as the Chinook Salmon, have  started returning to the area since the restoration began, according to the  project sponsor. Reused water from this Title XVI project also provides  other habitat benefits. For example, wineries in the area that irrigate with  reused water do not need to divert as much water from streams, which  leaves more water for fish, according to the project sponsor. In addition,  the North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program in California\u2019s San  Joaquin Valley supplies reused water to wildlife refuges and wetlands, in  addition to agricultural lands. This area has the largest remaining  freshwater marsh in the western United States, which provides critical  habitat for migratory birds as well as other species, according to the  project sponsor (see fig. 6).", "There are also several potable projects that have been funded by Title  XVI. These projects generally fall into two categories: (1) indirect-potable  reuse and (2) desalination.", "Indirect-potable reuse. Title XVI has provided grants for indirect-potable  projects, in which wastewater undergoes advanced treatment to obtain  potable-quality water. The water is then injected into an environmental  buffer, such as a groundwater aquifer, where it is left for a certain amount  of time before it is extracted. The water is treated again before it is  distributed as drinking water. One use for highly-treated reused water is  for seawater barriers, where water is injected into the ground to prevent  the intrusion of high-salinity water into groundwater aquifers. Indirect- potable reuse has been gaining prominence, according to some project  sponsors and representatives from nongovernmental water reuse  organizations, with Title XVI grants going to several project sponsors for  both the construction of facilities as well as research into optimal  treatment methods. For example, the Groundwater Replenishment  System in Orange County, California, which was partially funded by Title  XVI, takes highly-treated wastewater that would have previously been  discharged into the Pacific Ocean and purifies it using an advanced  treatment process. The water is then injected into a groundwater aquifer  and is later extracted as drinking water that serves more than 800,000  people, according to the project sponsor. Figure 7 shows reused water at  several different points in the treatment process and reverse osmosis  treatment equipment at Orange County\u2019s Groundwater Replenishment  System.", "Desalination. Title XVI has provided grants for projects that treat brackish  groundwater\u2014water that has a salinity above freshwater but below  seawater\u2014and then feed it directly into potable water distribution systems  or into a groundwater aquifer or surface water reservoir. For example,  the Mission Basin Groundwater Purification Facility in Oceanside,  California, desalinates brackish groundwater using reverse osmosis and  other treatment methods. The reused water supplies about 15 percent of  the city\u2019s water needs, according to the project sponsor.", "In addition to Title XVI construction projects, Reclamation\u2019s feasibility and  research studies also vary in their planned uses of reused water. For  example, one feasibility study project sponsor we interviewed was  awarded a Title XVI grant to investigate the feasibility and potential  impacts of reusing produced water from oil and gas operations in  Oklahoma. The study plans to investigate possible dual benefits of  reusing produced water, including (1) providing a new source of water for  irrigation and other purposes and (2) reducing the disposal of produced  water as a possible means for addressing increased seismic activity  associated with oil and gas operations, according to the project sponsor.  Another feasibility study project sponsor we interviewed from a rural,  landlocked community in Washington State is investigating the feasibility  of creating a virtual zero discharge system that would eliminate all  wastewater disposal by reusing the wastewater. Similar to feasibility  studies, Title XVI research studies address different topics. For example,  one project sponsor we interviewed was researching how to optimize  filtration of reused water using membrane filtration, which is a critical  treatment process to reduce contaminants in water. Another project  sponsor was researching impediments and incentives to using reused  water for agricultural irrigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title XVI Projects and Studies Include Western Urban and Rural Areas", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of agency documents, project sponsors in 12 of the  18 states eligible to participate in the Title XVI program were awarded at  least one type of funding under Title XVI since the inception of the  program in 1992, as shown in table 3.", "From fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2017, Reclamation awarded  about $640 million\u2014or about 90 percent of total awarded Title XVI  funding\u2014to projects in California, the majority of which was for  construction projects. The concentration of projects in California reflects  the early emphasis of the Title XVI program on Southern California and  reducing its reliance on water provided by the Colorado River, as well as  the high level of interest in the program in the state, according to a 2010  Congressional Research Service report. Overall, project sponsors in 9  states were awarded feasibility study grants, sponsors in 4 states were  awarded research study grants, and sponsors in 8 states were awarded  construction grants (see fig. 8).", "Title XVI projects and studies include western urban and rural areas. In  particular, many Title XVI projects are sponsored by entities in urban  areas that serve a large population base. For example, the main part of  the Los Angeles Area Water Supply Title XVI project is sponsored by the  West Basin Municipal Water District, which has a service area of nearly 1  million people in 17 cities and unincorporated areas in Los Angeles  County. This Title XVI project produces five different types of reused  water to meet the unique needs of West Basin\u2019s municipal, commercial,  and industrial reuse customers, according to the project sponsor.  Similarly, the City of San Diego, which has a population of about 1.4  million, was awarded Title XVI grants for a number of projects, including  an indirect-potable reuse project anticipated to provide one-third of San  Diego\u2019s water supply by 2035, according to the project sponsor. Other  Title XVI projects are sponsored by entities in rural areas and small cities.  For example, the Hi-Desert Water District project serves a rural and  economically disadvantaged community in the town of Yucca Valley,  California, that has a population of about 20,000. This Title XVI project  will fund facilities to collect, treat, and reuse treated wastewater, thereby  eliminating degradation of the local groundwater supply and helping  ensure a safer, reliable water supply for this community, according to the  project sponsor. Similarly, the city of Round Rock, Texas, which has a  population of about 120,000, sponsored the Williamson County Title XVI  project. This project produces reused water for landscape irrigation, most  of which is used to irrigate a 650-acre park, according to the project  sponsor.", "Some Title XVI projects are sponsored by regional partnerships  composed of different local entities. For example, in the late 1990s, 4  entities in Northern San Diego County\u2014Carlsbad Municipal Water  District, Leucadia Wastewater District, Olivenhain Municipal Water  District, and San Elijo Joint Powers Authority\u2014formed a coalition to  leverage their water reuse programs; the coalition has since grown to 10  entities. This coalition sponsored an individually congressionally  authorized Title XVI project, the North San Diego County project, and  applied for a Title XVI grant for a new project eligible under the WIIN Act  in fiscal year 2017. Similarly, in the northern part of the San Francisco  Bay Area, 10 local agencies formed a regional partnership covering 315  square miles across Sonoma, Marin, and Napa Counties to sponsor the  North Bay Water Reuse Program. According to the project sponsors  involved in this regional partnership, using a regional partnership  approach to water reuse projects provides an economy of scale;  maximizes the ability to obtain local, state, and federal funding for the  projects; and allows smaller, local entities to access funding and expertise  for projects that would be out of reach without regional collaboration.

Reclamation  officials then review the applications to ensure the projects are eligible  and that applications are complete, according to agency officials we  interviewed and documents we reviewed related to the selection process.  Next, an application review committee scores eligible applications. The  application review committee is composed of Reclamation staff  representing the five regions and other staff with technical expertise.  Committee members individually review and score each Title XVI  application based on the evaluation criteria in the FOA. After the  individual scoring, the application review committee meets collectively to  discuss the scores; this meeting is generally facilitated by Title XVI  program staff from Reclamation\u2019s central office in Denver. If there are any  outliers in the scores\u2014e.g., if a committee member scores an application  significantly higher or lower than the other members\u2014then they are to  discuss and may adjust the score to help ensure fairness and consistency  in how the applications are scored relative to the evaluation criteria,  according to agency officials. Following this discussion, Reclamation  averages the members\u2019 scores for each application and then ranks the  applications based on the average scores. Reclamation creates a list of  recommended projects and funding amounts for these projects, based on  the rankings and congressional direction on the amount of funding for the  Title XVI program in any given year.", "Reclamation\u2019s process for selecting projects and studies to fund under  the Title XVI program is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations  outlined in the Uniform Guidance. Based on our review of Title XVI FOAs  from fiscal years 2011 through 2018, all FOAs met the requirements  prescribed by the Uniform Guidance. Specifically, the Uniform Guidance  requires that grant funding opportunities be publicly announced and  contain certain information, such as the evaluation criteria, key dates, and  the process used to evaluate applications. Based on our review of  FOAs, Reclamation\u2019s FOAs were publicly announced and contained this  information.", "Many project sponsors we interviewed said that Reclamation\u2019s Title XVI  application selection process is generally clear and well-managed and  that Reclamation officials, at both the regional level and central office in  Denver, were responsive and transparent throughout the selection  process. Several project sponsors noted that Reclamation offered to  debrief with Title XVI applicants after it made its grant selections; further,  Reclamation officials provided constructive feedback to applicants to  improve their applications in future years.", "Some project sponsors raised concerns about how long it takes WIIN Act- eligible Title XVI projects to be awarded grants. In particular, the WIIN Act  provides that WIIN Act-eligible projects can only receive funding if an  enacted appropriations act designates funding by project name, after  Reclamation has recommended specific projects for funding and  transmitted its recommendations to Congress. Given the timing of  Reclamation\u2019s FOA process, WIIN Act-eligible projects selected in a given  fiscal year generally need to be included in the subsequent fiscal year\u2019s  appropriations act. For example, congressional direction in May 2017  provided that $10 million of the total Title XVI funding was to go to Title  XVI WIIN Act-eligible projects, and Reclamation sent Congress its fiscal  year 2017 selections for WIIN Act-eligible projects to fund in November  2017. However, according to Reclamation officials, Reclamation could not  begin awarding fiscal year 2017 funding to selected projects until March  2018, after enactment of the fiscal year 2018 appropriations act, which  listed the selected projects by name. One project sponsor noted that this  two-part process created challenges related to the project timeline and  budget. Reclamation officials said that project sponsors have also  expressed concerns to Reclamation about how any resulting delays may  affect the ability of projects to move forward.

Reclamation first developed criteria for the  annual Title XVI project selection process in 2010, which it applied  starting in fiscal year 2011. Prior to that, Congress generally provided  project-specific funding direction for individually authorized Title XVI  projects. According to agency officials, Reclamation developed the initial  evaluation criteria for the annual Title XVI selection process based on  (1) the language in the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater  Studies and Facilities Act, as amended; (2) Reclamation goals and  priorities for the program; and (3) the criteria Reclamation used to select  projects to fund under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009. Reclamation sought and incorporated public comments on the  criteria in 2010. After that, Reclamation\u2019s evaluation criteria for Title XVI  construction projects generally remained unchanged from fiscal years  2011 through 2016.", "In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, Reclamation eliminated some criteria in  the Title XVI FOAs for construction projects, added some new criteria,  and changed the weighting of some criteria, based on our review of FOAs  for those years. For example, in 2017, Reclamation more than doubled  the weight of the economic criterion for the fiscal year 2017 FOA for WIIN  Act-eligible projects, making it worth 35 percent of the points as  compared to the previous 13 percent. Reclamation officials told us that  these changes were made in response to the language of the WIIN Act\u2014 which listed a number of criteria for projects, including projects that  provide multiple benefits\u2014and comments they received from OMB during  the review process for the revised criteria. In March 2018, Reclamation  proposed further revisions to the evaluation criteria for the fiscal year  2018 Title XVI program and held a public comment period to solicit input  on the proposed changes. The proposed FOA contained one set of  criteria applicable to both types of eligible Title XVI construction  projects\u2014individually congressionally authorized and WIIN Act-eligible  projects. Reclamation received 21 comment letters on the criteria and,  after analyzing the comments, officials said that they made additional  changes to some of the criteria before issuing the final fiscal year 2018  FOA on May 30, 2018. For example, Reclamation added clarification to  the economic criteria. See appendix II for a more detailed description of  the final fiscal year 2018 Title XVI criteria, as well as changes to the  criteria in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.", "Several project sponsors noted that changes to the evaluation criteria  may affect which projects are more competitive in Reclamation\u2019s  application scoring and project selection process. In particular, several  project sponsors and representatives from nongovernmental  organizations we interviewed told us they believed that recent changes\u2014 particularly the increased weight on economic criteria, including cost  effectiveness\u2014may disadvantage small projects. Others said increasing  the weight on cost effectiveness may disadvantage new projects that are  just beginning construction of costly new treatment facilities versus  projects that are expanding existing facilities. Reclamation officials we  interviewed stated that the economic criteria take into account the extent  to which projects would provide multiple benefits\u2014not just cost  effectiveness. They also pointed out that they clarified in the fiscal year  2018 FOA that there are a number of ways to provide information on  project benefits in Title XVI applications, including by describing benefits  in a qualitative manner. They added that feedback from project sponsors  had been positive on the additional changes Reclamation made in  response to earlier stakeholder comments on the economic criteria for the  final fiscal year 2018 FOA.

To further monitor the  performance of Title XVI grants, Reclamation officials communicate  regularly with project sponsors via telephone and email and conduct  site visits to obtain information on the status of the projects, according  to Reclamation officials and project sponsors. Based on our review of  agency guidance, Reclamation generally is to conduct at least one  site visit per year for projects with significant on-the-ground activities,  such as construction projects. During the visits, agency officials  generally are to receive updates on progress made on the project and  determine if it is on schedule and meets the scope of work identified in  the financial assistance agreement. Reclamation generally requires  officials to document these visits and other monitoring activities in  project files, according to agency documents. Through the site visits  and other communication with project sponsors, agency officials may  also provide information on program requirements and respond to  project sponsors\u2019 questions about the Title XVI program. For example,  during site visits, Reclamation officials have responded to project  sponsors\u2019 questions about the status of payments and allowable  project costs and clarified requirements for financial and performance  reports, according to our review of agency documents and interviews  with project sponsors. In our review of Reclamation\u2019s Title XVI  construction grants active in fiscal year 2017, we found that  Reclamation generally conducted annual site visits for Title XVI  construction projects that year.

Reclamation  analyzes the water delivery data, compares projected data to actual  deliveries, and follows up with project sponsors to understand any  discrepancies, according to agency officials. For example, actual  water deliveries could be lower than projected deliveries if  communities implement water conservation measures that result in  projects having less wastewater to treat and deliver for reuse.  According to Reclamation officials, information on the amount of  reused water delivered from Title XVI projects helps them to monitor  progress on Title XVI projects and helps demonstrate the benefits and  accomplishments of the Title XVI program.
