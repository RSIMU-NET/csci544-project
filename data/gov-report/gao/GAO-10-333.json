The law applied the first $.50 per hour increase in July 2007 and mandated additional increases in each subsequent year until the minimum wages reach the level of the U.S. minimum wage--currently $7.25 per hour. American Samoa's lowest paid will reach that wage in 2016, and the CNMI in 2015. In American Samoa, one of two tuna canneries employing almost a third of workers closed in September 2009. In the CNMI, where the garment industry was one of two major employers, the last garment factory closed in early 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act requires GAO to report annually on the impact of the minimum wage increases in American Samoa and the CNMI. In this report GAO describes, since the increases began, wages, employment, employer actions, inflation-adjusted earnings, and worker views. GAO reviewed existing information from federal and local sources. GAO also collected data from large employers (at least 50 employees) through a questionnaire and from small employers and workers through discussion groups, in addition to conducting interviews during visits to each area. GAO shared the report with relevant federal agencies and the governments of American Samoa and the CNMI and incorporated their comments as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In American Samoa, the first minimum wage increase raised the wages of about three-quarters of workers at private sector employers that responded to GAO's questionnaire. June 2009 wage data from GAO's questionnaire indicate that by 2016, the minimum wage increases would affect the wages of close to 95 percent of those employers' private sector workers. Earnings data show that employment grew from 2006 to 2008, while questionnaire responses show that employment dropped from 2008 to 2009; since the September 2009 closure of one tuna cannery, employment has very likely continued to drop. Cannery officials said that minimum wage increases were a significant contributing factor in the closure of one cannery, in addition to other factors. Public and private sector officials expressed concern about the significant impact on employment if future minimum wage increases lead the remaining cannery to close or make attracting new industries more difficult. Many employers reported having taken cost-cutting actions, such as freezing hiring and cutting worker benefits, since the increases began. Employers also reported planning actions such as leaving American Samoa or closing by the end of 2010. More employers attributed their actions to the minimum wage increases than to other factors. Federal data show that median annual inflation-adjusted earnings in American Samoa declined by about 6 percent from 2006 to 2008. GAO estimated that inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time minimum wage workers who retained their jobs and hours rose by about 14 percent. In discussion groups, workers generally said that their support for the wage increases had dwindled because of concerns about issues such as the cannery closure, job insecurity, and loss of benefits. In the CNMI, the first minimum wage increase raised wages for about a third of workers at private sector employers that responded to GAO's questionnaire. June 2009 wage data from GAO's questionnaire indicate that the future increases will affect the wages of more than 80 percent of those employers' workers by 2015. CNMI government data show that following the 2007 wage increase, employment continued an existing downward trend largely reflecting the garment factory closures. Small employers and other private sector officials expressed mixed views about the future increases, and many expressed greater concern about immigration changes. In questionnaire responses, employers reported having taken cost-cutting actions, such as freezing hiring, since the increases began and also reported planning such actions by the end of 2010. Employers attributed their actions both to the minimum wage increases and to other factors. Based on an analysis of responses from CNMI employers in the hotel industry, GAO found that raising room rates to cover higher wage costs may cause a 2.6 to 13.7 percent decline in visits to the CNMI. CNMI government tax data show that average annual inflation-adjusted earnings declined by about 6 percent from 2006 to 2008. GAO estimated that annual inflation-adjusted earnings for minimum wage full-time workers who retained their jobs and hours rose by about 12 percent. In discussion groups, CNMI workers generally expressed support for the minimum wage increases and cited other factors affecting living standards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, the United States enacted legislation that incrementally applies  the U.S. minimum wage to American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).

Previously, both U.S. insular areas had minimum wages lower than that of  the 50 U.S. states. American Samoa\u2019s minimum wage was set for each of 18  industries by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) under biennial reviews;  its minimum wages ranged from $2.68 to $4.09 in 2006, and the lowest paid  workers will reach a minimum wage of $7.25 in 2016. The CNMI had  authority to set its own minimum wage under its 1976 Covenant with the  United States; the CNMI\u2019s minimum wage was $3.05 as of 2006 and is  scheduled to reach $7.25 in 2015. To date, the minimum wages in both  American Samoa and the CNMI have been increased by $.50 three times  since enactment of the law.", "The economies of both American Samoa and the CNMI face major  challenges. American Samoa\u2019s private sector economy is largely based on  the tuna canning industry, and the closure of one of its two tuna canneries  in September 2009 significantly affects the labor market and economy.  Before the first minimum wage increase in 2007, about one-third of  workers in American Samoa were employed by the two canneries, and  more than three-quarters of cannery employees were foreign workers from  neighboring Samoa, an independent country. The CNMI\u2019s economy has  been affected by the departure of its garment industry and fluctuation in  its tourism industry. Until recently, the garment industry was central to the  CNMI economy and employed close to a third of all workers; however, by  early 2009, the last garment factory had closed. The CNMI also faces  uncertainty due to the application of U.S. immigration law to the  commonwealth, ending decades of the CNMI\u2019s control over its own  immigration system. U.S. law established federal control of CNMI  immigration on November 28, 2009, with provisions affecting employers\u2019  access to foreign workers. In 2005, foreign workers represented a  majority of the CNMI labor force and outnumbered U.S. citizens in most  industries.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 requires that GAO  report annually on the impact of past and future minimum wage increases  in American Samoa and the CNMI.

While the SSA data cover all types of workers in American  Samoa and were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, they exclude CNMI  workers who are not subject to SSA withholding taxes. We have chosen not  to report the CNMI SSA data because of these coverage gaps.", "In addition, because key federal sources of data on the U.S. labor market  do not cover the insular areas, we collected our own data in each area.", "In both American Samoa and the CNMI we collected detailed data from  large employers\u2014those with at least 50 employees\u2014including through a  questionnaire that covered employment, wage structure, past and planned  employer actions, and related topics for 2006 to 2009. The respondents to  our questionnaire employed about 72 percent of the American Samoa total  workforce and about 29 percent of the CNMI total workforce, excluding  garment factories, which had all closed by the time of our questionnaire.  American Samoa questionnaire respondents included the two tuna  canneries and other employers in the sectors of manufacturing, wholesale  and retail trade, food services, hotel, construction, transportation,  publishing and communication, and health care, as well as the American  Samoa government and other public sector employers. CNMI  questionnaire respondents included hotels and other employers in the  sectors of food service, utilities, construction, manufacturing, retail, and  transportation, as well as the CNMI government and other public sector  employers. Particularly for the CNMI, questionnaire responses are not  necessarily representative of all workers and employers in each area. We  weighted employers\u2019 responses by the number of workers they employ,  and results of questionnaire responses are significantly affected by the  responses of the two tuna canneries and the local government in American  Samoa and by the local government in the CNMI.", "During visits to American Samoa and the CNMI, we conducted interviews and  discussion groups with government officials, smaller employers, other private  sector representatives, workers, and community members to obtain views  and information on the minimum wage increases and related topics. In each  area, we held an open public meeting, and we established e-mail accounts to  obtain comments from the public. We visited American Samoa in August  2009, after one tuna cannery had announced that it would close, and we  visited the CNMI in September 2009, after the closure of all garment factories.", "We also analyzed available information from the local American Samoa  and CNMI governments:    We analyzed American Samoa administrative and survey data, including  Consumer Price Index data and the American Samoa Department of the  Treasury\u2019s tax data.", "We analyzed available CNMI administrative and survey data, including  Consumer Price Index data and CNMI data on the number and earnings of  workers from the CNMI Department of Finance\u2019s tax returns.

In  particular, although our approach yielded information on trends in  employment, wages, and earnings in both areas, it is difficult to distinguish  between the effects of minimum wage increases and of other factors,  including the global recession in 2009, fluctuations in energy prices, global  trade liberalization, and the application of U.S. immigration law to the  CNMI. However, we determined that the available data were, apart from  these limitations, adequate and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  review. We conducted our work from April 2009 to April 2010 in  accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that  are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and  perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to  meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work.

In addition, the 2007 through 2009  wage increases narrowed the wage gap between the lowest and highest  paid employees of questionnaire respondents by 37 percent. Based on  American Samoa large-employer questionnaire responses about workers\u2019  wages as of June 2009, the minimum wage increases scheduled for 2010  through 2016 would affect the wages of close to 95 percent of those  private sector workers by 2016.", "Employment. Available data show that from 2006 to 2007, the total  number of people employed in American Samoa grew by 5.5 percent (from  17,551 to 18,518) and that from 2007 to 2008, employment growth slowed  to 3 percent (from 18,518 to 19,060). Questionnaire responses show that  employment of workers employed by respondents dropped about 12  percent from 2008 to 2009. Although data for all of 2009 are not yet  available, employment in American Samoa dropped further with the loss  of 2,000 jobs when the cannery closed in September 2009. Public and  private sector officials expressed concern about the significant impact on  employment if future minimum wage increases led the remaining cannery  to close or made it more difficult to attract new industries to the territory.", "Employer actions. American Samoa employers responding to our  questionnaire reported having taken cost-cutting actions, including  freezing hiring and reducing workers\u2019 benefits, since the minimum wage  increases began. Employers also reported plans to reduce costs by the end  of 2010, including laying off workers. Employers representing 84 percent  of private sector workers employed by respondents, including the cannery  that has now closed, said they planned to close or relocate. More  employers attributed their actions largely to the minimum wage increases  than attributed their actions to other factors, such as transportation and  shipping costs. Tuna cannery officials said that minimum wage increases  were a significant contributing factor in the closure of one cannery, in  addition to other factors. Our analysis shows that outsourcing cleaning  operations from low labor-cost areas, such as Thailand, provides  opportunities to significantly reduce cannery operating costs.", "Inflation-adjusted earnings. Earnings data from SSA and consumer price  data show that from 2006 to 2008, median inflation-adjusted earnings  dropped by about 6 percent, resulting from a rise in median annual  earnings of about 8 percent while local prices rose by about 15 percent.  Although earnings data do not allow for a direct comparison of median  and minimum-wage annual earnings or for tracking the earnings of  workers who lost their jobs, we estimate that inflation-adjusted earnings  of full-time minimum wage workers who retained their jobs and full  benefits rose by about 14 percent from 2006 to 2008.", "Worker views. Workers participating in discussion groups said that their  support for the minimum wage increases had dwindled because of the  closure of one cannery and uncertainty about the future of the remaining  cannery, as well as concern about job security and reductions in benefits  related to the wage increases. Workers also expressed an obligation to  support extended families and the broader community negatively affected  by the minimum wage increases.

In its written comments, the American Samoa  government generally agreed with our findings. In addition, the comments  stated that the report findings lead to the conclusion that without a change  to the existing incremental minimum wage increases, American Samoa  will face very serious economic difficulties. The comments further stated  that the economy was losing jobs more quickly than expected and that  with the closure of one cannery and continuing significant job losses in the  private sector, government revenues and funding available for government  services and employment will decrease. American Samoa\u2019s comments also  noted that increases in shipping costs due to decreased tuna exports will  likely further increase the cost of imported goods and the overall cost of  living. Appendix IX provides our more detailed evaluation of the American  Samoa government\u2019s letter.", "CNMI. In its written comments, the CNMI government agreed with some  of our findings but raised concerns about several aspects of our report  methodology and analysis. Specifically, the CNMI government expressed  concerns about our large-employer questionnaire\u2019s coverage, noting that  the questionnaire covers employers with 50 or more employees but  excludes smaller employers. In response, we note that because key federal  sources of data on the U.S. labor market do not cover the insular areas, we  collected our own data on employers through the questionnaire,  discussion groups, and other methods such as interviews. Our report  appropriately states the limitations of the questionnaire data and  repeatedly observes that the data may not be representative of all CNMI  workers and employers. Moreover, our report summarizes the views of  small employers based on the method that we determined would be most  effective and efficient in collecting information from them\u2014through  discussion groups targeting small employers (see app. IV, employment  section). The CNMI government also expressed concern about the  questionnaire\u2019s response rate, given that 33 of 61 employers responded to  our questionnaire. While we spent considerable effort to obtain as high a  response rate as possible, employers were not required to respond, and  the response rate reflects the individual decisions of CNMI employers who  received the questionnaire about whether to provide information  regarding the extent to which minimum wage increases had affected their  operations. Further, the CNMI government states that it questions our  findings related to worker views based on our discussion groups, because  of the limitations of this approach. Given the relevance of the minimum  wage increases to workers, we considered it critical to include their views;  however, no existing federal data source provided this information. We  believe the discussion groups were an appropriate and worthwhile  approach for collecting and including the views of workers.", "In addition to expressing concerns about our methodology, the CNMI  government expressed concern that the annual minimum wage increases  will greatly and negatively affect the CNMI economy, particularly small  employers. The CNMI government proposes capping the minimum wage in  the CNMI at the current rate of $4.55 to allow an in-depth assessment of  the effects of the minimum wage increases on the private and public  sectors, including small employers, and it proposes allowing the economy  to adjust to the $4.55 minimum wage level. The CNMI government also  stated that we should ask for more time to study the effects of the  minimum wage increases; however, the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act does not permit additional time for this report.

The respondents represented about 79 percent  of the workforce employed by questionnaire recipients (those with 50 or  more employees) in 2008 and about 29 percent of the total workforce,  including 20 percent of the total private sector workforce. Questionnaire  respondents represented about 89 percent of the public sector workforce  employed by questionnaire recipients and about 87 percent of the total  public workforce in 2008 (4 public sector employers were not covered by  questionnaire because they had fewer than 50 employees). CNMI  questionnaire respondents provided wage data on a total of 7,535 full-time  workers as of June 2009. CNMI questionnaire respondents included hotels  and other employers in the sectors of food service, utilities, construction,  manufacturing, retail, and transportation, as well as the CNMI government  and other public sector employers.", "In reporting the percentages for questionnaire responses throughout our  report, we weighted each percentage to reflect the proportion of workers  employed by the responding employers relative to all workers employed  by all questionnaire respondents. As a result, the responses of larger  employers affect our findings more than those of smaller employers. We  determined the number of employees at each employer by summing the  number of hourly and salaried workers that employers reported in  questionnaire responses. In addition to asking a direct question about  number of employees, the questionnaire asked respondents to complete a  separate table listing the number of employees at each wage or salary  level. Separate tables were required for hourly wage and salaried workers.  In cases in which the employers completed the table but did not answer  the direct question, the sum of the tabled responses were used as the  weight. In the few cases in which employers did not report any employees,  they were assigned a weight of zero. To apply the weights, we cross- multiplied the number of employees by the employer response, then  divided by the total number of employees in the sample. For example, if  three of five employees attributed an action to the minimum wage to a  moderate extent, the unweighted response would be 60 percent. However,  if those three employers represented 300 of 400 employees, the weighted  response that we report would be 75 percent.", "From our questionnaire, we obtained information on earnings and  employment for both hourly wage and salaried workers during the pay  periods that included June 12, 2007, 2008, and 2009. For hourly wage  workers, respondents were asked to provide the number of employees  paid at each wage rate, and the number of both regular and overtime hours  worked during the pay period. For salaried workers, respondents were  asked the number of full-time and part-time workers paid in salary ranges  (such as from $10,000 to $19,999). In order to determine the wage rate for  salaried workers, we assumed that each worker was paid at the midpoint  of the range. Because it was unclear the hours each worked, we excluded  part-time employees. For any given employer, this may either over or  under estimate the wage rate, depending on whether more employees for  that employer tend to be at the top or bottom of the range. This  particularly affected our reported data regarding government workers. To  determine the number of workers affected by each minimum wage  increase, we assumed that all workers employed by questionnaire  respondents were legally required to receive the minimum wage. If some  are not covered or are exempt, the minimum wage increases would affect  fewer workers.", "After recording the questionnaire data, we verified all keypunched records  by comparing them with the corresponding questionnaires and corrected  the errors we found. Less than 0.5 percent of the data items we checked  had random keypunch errors that would not have been corrected during  data processing. Analysis programs were also independently verified.  However, we did not independently verify that the wage and other  information provided to us were correct.", "The questionnaire responses cannot be used to make inferences about all  employers and workers in each insular area, particularly in the CNMI.  First, because the lists of employers that received the questionnaire were  intended to include only those with more than 50 employees, the lists were  not representative of all employers. Second, we were unable to survey  employers that had closed between 2007 and our questionnaire date,  including those in the CNMI garment industry. Third, some nonresponse  bias may exist in some of the questionnaire responses, since  characteristics of questionnaire respondents may differ from those of  nonrespondents in ways that affect the responses (e.g., if those that  employ a larger number of workers would have provided different  responses than those that employ a smaller number). Last, it is possible  that some employers\u2019 views of the minimum wage increases may have  influenced their responses.", "In addition, the tuna canneries and local government in American Samoa  employed a large percentage of workers employed by all questionnaire  respondents, as in the actual American Samoa workforce; as a result, these  employers\u2019 responses significantly affected our reported questionnaire  data.

We  compared the two models used by firms that produce for the U.S. market  to illustrate how the major cost components differ under each model.  Under model A, used by the firm that owns the cannery remaining in  American Samoa, a firm conducts loining (cleaning, cutting, and cooking  the fish) and canning in American Samoa and exports canned tuna to the  U.S. market tariff-free. Under model B, used by the firm that closed its  cannery in American Samoa and now operates in the U.S. state of  Georgia, the firm sources fish loins from low labor-cost regions outside  American Samoa, exports the frozen loins to the United States, pays U.S.  tariffs, and cans tuna in the United States. Assuming that the production  and employment level are similar to those of the firm that closed its  cannery in American Samoa, we found that the annual savings on labor  costs ($12 million) under model B will more than offset the increased  tariff costs ($320,000) per year. We were not able to quantify other  production costs, such as utility costs and shipping costs.", "Wage costs. Wage costs are significantly lower under model B than  under model A. After May 2009 and before the May 2010 increase,  the minimum wage for tuna cannery workers in American Samoa is  $4.76 per hour; in contrast, the minimum wage in Thailand is less  than $1 per hour. Assuming that a plant employs 2,000 people, under  model A, all 2,000 employees would earn a minimum wage of $4.76  per hour, while under model B, 1,700 foreign employees would earn  $0.75 per hour for loining and 300 U.S.-based employees would earn  $7.25 per hour for canning. We estimate that the firm that closed its  cannery in American Samoa can save approximately $12 million in  wages in the first year using model B.", "Tariff costs. Tariff costs will be higher under model B than under  model A. American Samoa exports benefit from tariff-free access to  the U.S. market, while the United States imposes tariffs on imported  loins. Assuming that a firm imports the same amount of cleaned  loin to produce the same amount of canned tuna under model B as  under model A, we estimate the additional tariff on cleaned loins  from Thailand under model B to be around $320,000 annually.", "Other costs. It is not clear which business model has an advantage  in terms of shipping cost and prices of fish. According to one  cannery official, because tuna is harvested throughout the western  Pacific Ocean, and given American Samoa\u2019s location, fishing vessels  generally deliver directly to the Samoan canneries. Shipping fish to  Thailand for cleaning might be more costly than shipping directly to  American Samoa. However, an official from a different cannery said  economies of scale and other factors may lead to lower cost for fish  in Thailand than in American Samoa and to little or no difference in  shipping costs. Additionally, the firm using model B may save on  other shipping costs. For example, a high-level firm representative  told us that under the new business model, the firm will now avoid  the high costs of shipping cans and condiments to American Samoa.

Using the elasticity  estimates from the literature, including one used in a study  commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security study, we  found that raising prices to cover higher costs from the minimum  wage increases through 2015 for hotel workers may cause visits to  the CNMI to decline by approximately 2.6 percent to 13.7 percent.  However, hotels may have different abilities to raise prices. For  example, hotels that cater to budget conscious visitors might be less  able to raise prices than hotels catering to visitors for whom prices  are less important. In addition, the current business environment may  make it difficult to increase prices.

The American Samoa government developed and cited its own  estimates of employment loss based on the information included in our  report. It stated that after the first three minimum wage increases, total  employment fell by 4,287, or by 22 percent, including losses of 2,287  even before the cannery closure. Our report does not include an  estimate of the total number of jobs lost during this time period;  however, we were able to replicate the American Samoa government\u2019s  estimate by applying our finding that employment among large- employer questionnaire respondents decreased 12 percent from June  2008 to June 2009 to our statement that SSA data show 19,060  American Samoa workers in 2008. We did not include this type of  estimate because, as noted in the report, although questionnaire  responses covered about 72 percent of the American Samoa  workforce, they are not necessarily representative of all American  Samoa workers and employers. In addition, our questionnaire  measured employment by respondents in June of each year, while the  SSA data measured the entire year\u2019s employment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Government", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the CNMI government\u2019s letter,  dated March 11, 2010."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The CNMI government stated that our summary-level finding regarding  CNMI wages is insufficient and not representative of the overall CNMI  workforce because of our large-employer questionnaire\u2019s coverage.  First, it noted that the questionnaire covers employers with 50 or more  employees but excludes smaller employers. Because key federal  sources of data on the U.S. labor market do not cover these insular  areas, we collected our own data on employers through the  questionnaire, discussion groups, and other methods such as  interviews. Our report appropriately states the limitations of the  questionnaire data and repeatedly notes that the data may not be  representative of all CNMI workers and employers. In addition, we  determined that the most effective and least burdensome method of  collecting information from small employers would be to conduct  discussion groups targeting these employers. Both the Saipan and  Tinian Chambers of Commerce assisted us in inviting small employers  to discussion groups in the CNMI, and our report summarizes their  views (see app. IV, employment section). Small employers also were  invited, among others, to share their views at a public forum we held in  the CNMI and to send comments to an e-mail account we established  for this purpose. Furthermore, while we use the terms \u201clarge  employers\u201d and \u201csmall employers\u201d in our report for clarity, the U.S.  Small Business Administration generally defines small employers as  having, depending on the industry and other factors, employees  numbering from 500 to 1,500 or fewer. By these definitions, our  questionnaire covers many small employers. Second, the CNMI  government expressed concern about the questionnaire\u2019s response  rate, given that 33 out of 61 employers responded to our questionnaire.  While we spent considerable effort to obtain as high a response rate as  possible, employers were not required to respond, and the response  rate reflects the individual decisions of CNMI employers who received  the questionnaire about whether to provide information regarding the  extent to which minimum wage increases had affected their  operations.", "2.  The CNMI government incorrectly stated that the report does not  include findings related to employees in the public sector. Our findings  related to public sector employees are included in multiple sections of  appendix IV. In addition, the CNMI government stated that our  summary-level finding related to wages should note that the  questionnaire included greater coverage of public than private sector  employees. We disagree. Our report findings on public and private  sector employees combined note that the CNMI government  accounted for a higher percentage of workers employed by  questionnaire respondents than in the actual CNMI workforce, so the  government\u2019s responses disproportionately influence our  questionnaire results on the public and private sectors combined.  However, this limitation is not relevant to findings on public sector  workers alone or on private sector workers alone. 3.  The CNMI government stated that GAO\u2019s findings related to employer  actions understate the negative impact of minimum wage increases on  small employers. We note that the employer actions section does not  address the actions of small employers because they were not covered  by the questionnaire; however, findings related to small employers are  included in the preceding report section on employment. 4.  The CNMI government comments on the inflation-adjusted earnings  findings reflect misunderstanding of the analysis presented. The CNMI  government commented that the analysis of changes in earnings  should, but does not, account for changes in local prices. In fact, the  inflation-adjusted earnings data we present account for changes in  local prices, using local Consumer Price Index data from the CNMI  Department of Commerce. Accordingly, the findings based on the  earnings analyses for both average wage earners and minimum wage  earners fully account for CNMI price increases.  5.  The CNMI government stated that it questions the findings related to  worker views based on our discussion groups. As we note in the  report\u2019s objectives, scope, and methodology section, discussion groups  are not designed to provide results generalizable to a larger population  or to provide quantitative estimates. However, discussion groups are a  qualitative research method capable of adding valuable information  that may be difficult or impossible to collect through quantitative  methods. Given the relevance of the minimum wage increases to  workers, we considered it critical to include their views; however, no  existing federal data source provided this information. We believe the  discussion groups were an appropriate and worthwhile approach for  collecting and including the views of workers.", "6.  The CNMI government stated that we should ask for more time to  study the effects of minimum wage increases; however, the law does  not permit additional time for this report. The American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 requires that GAO report annually on the  impact of past and future minimum wage increases in American Samoa  and the CNMI, and the reports are due between March 15 and April 15  of each year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["David Gootnick, (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov.", "Tom McCool, (202) 512-2642 or mccoolt@gao.gov."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Emil Friberg, Assistant Director,  Mark Speight, Assistant General Counsel, Marissa Jones, analyst-in-charge,  Ashley Alley, Benjamin Bolitzer, Joe Carney, Ming Chen, Gergana  Danailova-Trainor, Jill Lacey, Reid Lowe, Luann Moy, Ramzi Nemo, and  Vanessa Taylor made key contributions to this report.
