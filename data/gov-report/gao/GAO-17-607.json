Opponents of section 716 maintained that swaps trading by banks did not significantly contribute to the financial crisis.

A variety of firms (end-users) use swaps to hedge risk, to speculate, or for other purposes. For example, an airline may use swaps to lock in its fuel price to hedge against a future price rise. End-users engage in swaps through swap dealers, and some large banks act as swap dealers, exposing them to risks. Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)\u2014also known as the \u201cswaps push-out rule\u201d\u2014requires banks registered as swap dealers, in effect, to stop engaging in certain swap activities to remain eligible for federal financial assistance but allows them to \u201cpush out\u201d such activities to nonbank affiliates within the same bank holding company (BHC). As originally enacted, section 716 would have covered certain equity, commodity, and credit default swaps activities, but amendments made in 2014 now cover only certain swap activity based on asset-backed securities.", "GAO analyses of the effects of the amended and original versions of section 716 on U.S. banks and their BHCs, swap end-users, and taxpayers in light of other Dodd-Frank Act reforms found the following:", "A significantly larger volume of swaps would have been pushed out under the original section 716. The amended section 716 affected four U.S. banks and caused them to push out an estimated $265 billion of swaps in notional value as of September 30, 2016, or less than 1 percent of their total derivatives. The original version would have affected 11 U.S. banks (including the 4 banks) and could have affected an estimated $10.5 trillion of swaps in notional value, or about 6 percent of their total derivatives, if the provision had not been amended.", "Section 716 increases risks and costs for BHCs and end-users . Under the amended version, banks moved their covered swap activities to nonbank affiliates, requiring the affiliates and clients to incur legal and operational costs. Banks and end-users told GAO that moving the swaps can increase their risks and, in turn, costs. Such risks and costs likely would have been greater under the original version because of its broader scope.", "Other Dodd-Frank Act provisions mitigate risks . Section 716 seeks to reduce a bank's risk of failure and potential need for federal assistance, but the act's other reforms also seek to mitigate such risks. For example, regulators have subjected banks to enhanced prudential and other requirements that can help to mitigate their swap-related risks. Consistent with such requirements, GAO's analyses indicate the 11 U.S. banks that would have been affected by the original section 716 held financial resources needed to support their swap-related credit, liquidity, and market risk exposures as of September 30, 2016. Federal banking regulators and BHCs with the largest bank swap dealers are continuing to develop resolution strategies that seek to resolve a large BHC in an orderly manner and without federal assistance if it were to fail. These strategies, if successful, can help BHCs to wind-down or sell their swaps in an orderly manner and avoid value destruction."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Swaps and other over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives played a role in the  2007\u20142009 financial crisis in varying degrees and ways, as illustrated by  the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

A swap is a type of  OTC derivative in which two parties agree to exchange payments based  on the value of an underlying asset, a reference rate, or an index over a  specified period.  According to a 2009 survey conducted by a derivatives  industry association, 94 percent of the world\u2019s 500 largest companies use  derivatives to manage and hedge their business and financial risks.

The  provision allowed covered banks to move such activity to nonbank  affiliates.

Proponents of the original section 716 sought to prohibit banks with  access to federal assistance from engaging in riskier swap activities and  to reduce the potential for the federal government, and therefore  potentially taxpayers, to have to provide emergency assistance to banks  engaging in such swap activities. In contrast, opponents of the provision  maintained that swaps trading by banks did not significantly contribute to  the 2007\u20142009 financial crisis.

Swaps and other derivatives have one or more \u201cunderlyings\u201d  (i.e., specified interest rate, security price, commodity price, foreign  exchange rate, index of prices or rates, or other variable) and one or  more notional amounts (i.e., number of currency units, shares, bushels,  pounds, or other units specified in the contract) that help determine the  amount of the payments. For example, an end-user seeking to hedge its  interest rate risk may enter into an interest rate swap with a dealer to  exchange fixed-rate interest payments of 5 percent of $10 million for  floating interest payments based on the 3-month London Interbank  Offered Rate. Under the terms of the swap, the dealer agrees to make  quarterly payments of 5 percent multiplied by $10 million to the end-user,  and the end-user agrees to make quarterly payments of the 3-month  London Interbank Offered Rate multiplied by $10 million. The notional  value of this contract would be $10 million because that is the specified  value on which exchanged interest payments are based. Swaps and  other derivatives volumes generally are measured by their notional  amounts. For example, the notional amount of derivative contracts held  by insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations increased  from around $17 trillion in 1995 to around $165 trillion in 2016. However,  notional amounts generally do not represent amounts at risk.", "Financial and nonfinancial firms use swaps and other derivatives to  hedge risk, to speculate, or for other purposes, such as to reduce  uncertainty. For example, an airline may enter into a commodity swap to  lock in its fuel price over a certain time horizon, so that it can better  manage its costs. Banks and other end-users that are exposed to  maturity, currency, or interest rate mismatches between assets and  liabilities may enter into swaps to hedge their exposure. Speculators may  enter into equity derivatives to speculate on the direction of equity  markets in order to make a profit, understanding that the profit or loss  from the swap can be large in comparison to the cost of entering the  swap.", "Unlike futures contracts, which are standardized financial contracts that  are traded on exchanges, swaps traditionally have been privately  negotiated between two counterparties in the OTC market. Types of  swaps include the following:  Interest rate swaps are contracts in which two parties agree to exchange  interest cash flows or one or more notional principal amounts at certain  times in the future according to an agreed-on formula. Banks,  corporations, sovereigns, and other institutions use swaps to manage  their interest-rate risks or speculate on interest-rate movements.", "Foreign exchange swaps are simultaneous purchases and sales of a  certain amount of foreign currency for two different value dates.  Corporations use such swaps to hedge their assets and liabilities  incurred as a result of their overseas operations.

The protection buyer makes periodic  payments over the contract\u2019s life, and the premium is a percentage of the  contract\u2019s notional value. If a credit event occurs (e.g., bankruptcy), the  premium payment stops, and the protection seller pays the buyer the  notional amount or agreed-to default payment.

While the  Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prudential reforms discussed earlier seek to lower the  probability of failure of large BHCs or their banks, the act\u2019s resolution  reforms seek to reduce the risk that the failure of a large BHC would  adversely affect U.S. financial stability. Federal banking regulators and  large BHCs are developing resolution strategies that seek to resolve a  large BHC, if it were to fail, in an orderly manner and without federal  assistance. For example, under the resolution strategies being developed  by the BHCs with the four largest bank swap dealers, only the BHC would  enter bankruptcy; its bank and other subsidiaries would remain solvent.   These strategies, if successful, could help enable the BHC and its bank  swap dealer to unwind or sell its swaps in an orderly manner and avoid  value destruction.", "A bank\u2019s swaps may not always result in losses that reduce its resolution  value because swaps and other derivatives can be either assets or  liabilities. In resolution, a failed bank\u2019s trading derivatives portfolio could  be (1) a net asset that increases the bank\u2019s resolution value or (2) a net  liability that decreases the failed bank\u2019s resolution value.  Because  banks hedge market risk, their trading derivative assets and liabilities  typically are close to each other in value.  As discussed earlier, the  Volcker Rule also serves to help minimize the market risk to which banks  can be exposed through their swaps activity, in part by limiting the extent  to which the value of their trading derivative assets can differ from the  value of their trading derivative liabilities. Consequently, if a bank can  wind down its trading derivatives portfolio in an orderly manner, it could  avoid value destruction, if any. However, as illustrated by the failure of  Lehman, the legal right of a bank\u2019s swaps counterparties to terminate  their swaps early if the bank or its BHC were to fail can result in the  disorderly unwinding of the bank\u2019s swaps and cause the bank to suffer  avoidable losses on its swaps that decrease the bank\u2019s resolution value.", "We found that prudential regulators are implementing the Dodd-Frank  Act\u2019s resolution reforms that seek to help ensure that the largest BHCs, if  they were to fail, can be resolved in an orderly manner and avoid asset  fire sales and value destruction.

Before the act, the government generally  had two options to address the potential failure of a systemically  important BHC or other nonbank financial firm: (1) allow it to enter  bankruptcy or (2) provide it with aid. The act preserved bankruptcy as the  preferred option and required the large BHCs to develop resolution plans  describing how they can be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in  a rapid and orderly manner.", "In the public sections of their resolution plans, the BHCs of the four  largest bank swap dealers generally have stated they have adopted the  Single Point of Entry (SPOE) strategy as their preferred resolution  strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under the SPOE strategy, only  the top-tier BHC would enter bankruptcy. The BHC would use its financial  resources, as needed, to support and recapitalize its operating  subsidiaries to keep them solvent and preserve their going-concern value.  For example, a loss that caused a BHC to fail would be passed up from  the subsidiary that incurred the loss and absorbed by the BHC\u2019s equity  holders and unsecured creditors, which would have the effect of  recapitalizing the BHC\u2019s subsidiary. By keeping their bank subsidiaries  solvent in the event of their failure, the BHCs could enable their banks to  wind down or sell their swaps in an orderly manner and preserve their  value. If one of the BHCs was not able to keep its bank solvent under its  resolution strategy, FDIC would resolve the bank separately under the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (outside of the BHC\u2019s resolution strategy)  and could transfer the bank\u2019s swaps to a solvent company to preserve  their value.", "We found that the four U.S. BHCs, along with other resolution plan filers,  have faced a number of challenges and obstacles developing their  resolution plans.  The four BHCs are continuing to revise their plans to  address such challenges and obstacles, and regulators have proposed or  finalized regulations to help improve the ability of the BHCs to execute  their plans.  According to the Federal Reserve and FDIC, resolution  planning cannot guarantee that a BHC\u2019s resolution would be executed  smoothly, but the preparations can help ensure that the BHC could be  resolved under bankruptcy without government support or imperiling the  broader financial system.  In 2016, we concluded that whether the plans  of the largest BHCs actually would facilitate their rapid and orderly  resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is uncertain, in part because  none has used its plan to go through bankruptcy.", "In cases where resolution of a large BHC under the U.S. Bankruptcy  Code may result in serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability, the  Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s Orderly Liquidation Authority serves as the backstop  alternative.  Orderly Liquidation Authority gives FDIC the authority,  subject to certain constraints, to resolve large financial companies outside  of the bankruptcy process.  Since 2013, FDIC has been developing a  SPOE strategy to implement this authority.  FDIC would be appointed  receiver of the top-tier holding company and establish a bridge financial  company into which it would transfer the holding company\u2019s assets.  The  bridge company would continue to provide the holding company\u2019s  functions, and the company\u2019s subsidiaries would remain operational. As  its SPOE strategy has evolved, FDIC has focused on developing multiple  options for liquidating the subsidiaries, such as by winding down or selling  subsidiaries or selling a subsidiary\u2019s assets. Importantly, FDIC is  authorized to transfer swaps and other qualified financial contracts to the  bridge company or another solvent financial company.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain  institutions, including the four BHCs, to develop resolution plans for rapid  and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.   According to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC), resolution planning cannot guarantee that a BHC\u2019s  resolution would be executed smoothly, but the preparations can help  ensure that the BHC could be resolved under bankruptcy without  requiring government support or imperiling the broader financial system.

Based on their review of the 2015 plans  submitted by these four BHCs, the regulators jointly determined that two  of the plans were not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution  under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  The regulators sent these two BHCs  feedback letters that identified the plan deficiencies and required  corrective actions.  In addition, in their feedback letters, the regulators  identified shortcomings in all four of the BCHs\u2019 resolution plans and  directed them to address the shortcomings in their plans submitted by  July 1, 2017.

According to the  guidance, a dealer\u2019s plan to stabilize and wind down a large derivative  portfolio in an orderly manner following the BHC\u2019s bankruptcy raises a  number of significant issues that the four U.S. BHCs should address in  their 2017 plans.  As summarized in table 12, the four U.S. BHCs  reported in the public sections of their 2016 plan filings a high-level  summary of selected actions that they have taken.", "In the public sections of their resolution plans, the four U.S. BHCs with  the largest bank swap dealers generally have adopted the Single Point of  Entry (SPOE) strategy as their preferred resolution strategy under the  U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under the SPOE strategy, only the top-tier BHC  would enter bankruptcy. The BHC would use its financial resources, as  needed, to recapitalize and support its operating subsidiaries to keep  them solvent and preserve their going-concern value. For example, a loss  that caused a BHC to fail would be passed up from the subsidiary that  incurred the loss and would be absorbed by the BHC\u2019s equity holders and  unsecured creditors, which would have the effect of recapitalizing the  BHC\u2019s subsidiary. As shown in figure 10, the SPOE resolution approach  serves to enable a BHC\u2019s subsidiaries to continue to operate while the  BHC enters bankruptcy, reducing the potential for negative impact on its  customers and the overall economy. In the example, the bank transfers  losses up to its BHC in the event of distress, and only the BHC enters  bankruptcy. As permitted by the bankruptcy court, the BHC transfers its  subsidiaries to a new BHC, and these subsidiaries are then sold or wound  down in an orderly manner.", "While the four U.S. BHCs face a number of obstacles or challenges in  implementing their SPOE strategies, they and prudential regulators are  taking actions to address such obstacles or challenges. For example, the  Federal Reserve has finalized a rule to help ensure that the BHCs have  sufficient financial resources to implement their SPOE strategies. Also,  the regulators and BHCs are reducing the ability of swap counterparties  to a BHC\u2019s bank swap dealer to terminate their swaps early in the event  of the BHC\u2019s filing for bankruptcy and cause a disorderly wind-down of  the bank swap dealer\u2019s swaps and other qualified financial contracts.", "Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity. To implement their SPOE strategies,  the four U.S. BHCs with the largest bank swap dealers must have  sufficient financial resources to absorb losses by their banks or other  operating subsidiaries and prevent them from failing. In January 2017, the  Federal Reserve finalized its total loss-absorbing capacity rule, the  objective of which is to reduce the financial impact of a failure by requiring  companies to have sufficient loss-absorbing capacity.  The rule requires,  among other things, covered BHCs to maintain an outstanding minimum  level of eligible external total loss-absorbing capacity comprised of capital  issued by the BHC and eligible external long-term debt.  The term  \u201cexternal\u201d conveys that the requirement would apply to loss-absorbing  instruments issued by the GSIB to third-party investors, and the  instrument would be used to pass losses from the BHC to the third-party  investors in bankruptcy or other resolution.  For example, while a bank  or other subsidiary would pass up its losses to its BHC in the event of  distress, the BHC would pass its losses in the event of distress to its  equity holders and unsecured creditors, including external long-term debt  holders.", "Cross-Default Rights and ISDA Stay Protocol.

Under an ISDA Master  Agreement, a solvent bank\u2019s counterparties may exercise their cross- default rights to terminate their swaps with the bank early if the bank\u2019s  BHC files for bankruptcy.  As illustrated by the failure of Lehman  Brothers, such counterparty actions could result in a disorderly unwinding  of the bank\u2019s swaps that causes the bank to suffer avoidable losses on its  swaps and contributes to its failure.  For example, counterparties to  whom the bank owes money may terminate their swaps early, and  counterparties that owe the bank money may not terminate their swaps  but may suspend their swap-related payments\u2014exposing the bank to  price risk and reducing the bank\u2019s liquidity.", "Banking regulators and derivatives market participants have taken steps  to address the threat that early terminations of swaps can pose to a  BHC\u2019s orderly resolution. Working with its members, U.S. and foreign  regulators, and others, ISDA published protocols in 2014 and 2015 that  enable parties to ISDA Master Agreements and certain other financial  contracts to amend their financial contracts, in effect, to recognize the  applicability of special resolution regimes (including Orderly Liquidation  Authority discussed subsequently) and to restrict cross-default provisions  to facilitate orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  For  example, provided certain conditions are met, parties that adhere to the  2015 protocol generally would be prohibited from exercising their cross- default rights to terminate early with a BHC\u2019s bank if the bank\u2019s BHC  entered bankruptcy.", "In 2016, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC separately proposed rules  that generally require a U.S. GSIB and its subsidiaries to amend their swaps (and other qualified financial contracts), so that their counterparties  would be stayed from exercising their cross-default rights based on the  GSIB\u2019s or its subsidiary\u2019s entry into resolution.
