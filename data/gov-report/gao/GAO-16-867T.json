Several of the contracting officials we  spoke with stated that they were, at times, uncertain about which  contracting office handled what requirements. VA issued a memorandum  in 2013 to clarify areas of responsibility for the national contracting  organizations, but confusion remains. VA\u2019s Acting Chief Acquisition  Officer stated that he is aware of overlap in the functions of some  contracting organizations, especially the NAC and the SAC.

Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  state that it is important for an organization\u2019s management to update its  policies over time to reflect changing statutes or conditions, and that  those policies should be communicated to those who need to implement  them. However, many of VA\u2019s regulations and policies are outdated,  most notably the VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR), which has not been  updated since 2008. The department has issued a patchwork of policy  documents in the interim to fill this gap. VA asks contracting officers to  refer to two different versions of the VAAR, one from 1997 and the other  from 2008. This causes confusion among contracting officers. In addition,  VA communicates interim procurement policies in a number of different  forms, some of which can be duplicative. Figure 3 illustrates the  numerous sources that contracting officers must turn to for guidance.", "The sheer volume and number of different forms of communications\u2014 many of which are outdated\u2014are confusing and present challenges for  contracting officials seeking appropriate guidance. While VA recently fully  rescinded the 1997 VAAR after our inquiries, the 2008 version remains  out of date. A new revision of the VAAR is also in development, but has  faced delays. VA began the process in 2011 but does not plan to finalize  the new VAAR until December 2018, including the required rulemaking  process. The lengthy delay in updating this fundamental source of policy  impedes contracting officers\u2019 abilities to effectively carry out their duties.  In our September 2016 report, we recommended that VA identify  measures to expedite the revision of the VAAR, and take interim steps to  clarify its policy framework; the Acting Chief Acquisition Officer, OALC  stated that the department agreed with both of these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Can Improve Its Processes for Medical Supply Purchasing and Identify Other Cost Savings Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["VA medical centers use contractors called medical-surgical prime  vendors to obtain many of the supplies they use on a daily basis, such as  bandages and surgical sutures. Officials known as ordering officers, who  work at the medical centers, regularly place orders. In turn, the prime  vendor delivers those orders via a local warehouse. The prices for these  medical supplies are established by VA national contracts, which typically  provide significant discounts over the Federal Supply Schedule prices\u2014 an estimated 30 percent on average, according to a senior NAC official.  Use of these national contracts is also required by VA policy and  regulation. Figure 4 provides an overview of the MSPV process.", "However, the current MSPV process is confusing and cumbersome. Most  orders are placed through the Integrated Funds Distribution Control Point  Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) system, a decades-old IT  system with a text-based interface, which does not include a tool to look  up items that are available on the national contracts. For instance,  ordering officers must know the exact item number\u2014which is different for  each vendor\u2014to enter into IFCAP. The existing tools to look up available  national contracts are also cumbersome. Along with discounted items on  national contracts, the MSPV system also allows ordering officers to buy  thousands of items directly from VA\u2019s Federal Supply Schedule contracts,  which lack the degree of discounted pricing of the national contracts.  Because of the challenges posed by the system, ordering officers in some  cases purchase items directly from the Federal Supply Schedules, and  might miss opportunities to obtain discounts on the national contracts.", "Administration of the MSPV program is being transferred from NAC to  SAC, and, along with this transfer, VHA and SAC are making changes to  the MSPV program in an effort to address the issues discussed above  and streamline the process. To support the next generation MSPV, SAC  has already awarded new prime vendor contracts and is in the process of  awarding the supporting national contracts for individual types of supplies.", "VHA and SAC also plan to implement a new online ordering interface,  developed by a contractor for VHA, which will provide ordering officers a  more intuitive interface for the outdated and difficult-to-use IFCAP  system. Further, unlike the current system, this new interface will only  permit ordering officers to purchase items from a specific catalog of items,  not the wider range of Federal Supply Schedule items. VA estimates that  this catalog will eventually contain 8,000 to 10,000 items to meet the  needs of its medical centers. However, there have been some delays in  VHA\u2019s development of supply requirements and SAC\u2019s award of new  supply contracts, with only about 1,800 items on national contracts as of  July 2016. VA does not anticipate that SAC will be able to award  contracts for the full catalog by the time the new MSPV contracts become  operational in December 2016. In the interim, SAC and VHA officials  stated that they will allow ordering of Federal Supply Schedule items  (approximately 4,500) that are not on national contracts, to ease the  transition.", "Work remains to ensure that the transition to this new approach will be  successful. Updating the MSPV process affects how essential supplies  are ordered and delivered at 167 medical centers on a daily basis, and  facility logistics staff, including ordering officers, must be able to  implement the new approach. VHA has an outreach plan in place, but  chief logistics officers at medical centers we visited expressed some  concerns about the transition\u2014for instance, one reported that his office\u2019s  analysis found 14 items deemed critical to the function of the medical  center were not on a preliminary list of supplies available through the new  MSPV, nor were acceptable substitutes. If medical centers instead  purchase items through their local contracting offices because the new  MSPV does not meet their needs, it will undermine the program\u2019s  potential to increase efficiency and cost savings.", "In our September 2016 report, we recommended that VA take steps to  facilitate the transition to the new MSPV process, including ensuring that  SAC collects data to monitor the use of national contracts in the new  system, that SAC and VHA establish achievable time frames for  eliminating Federal Supply Schedule items from the MSPV catalog once  national contracts are in place, and that the new ordering interface clearly  distinguish between items on national contracts and the 4,500 items on  the Federal Supply Schedules. The Acting Chief Acquisition Officer,  OALC said that the department agreed with this recommendation.", "VA\u2019s substantial buying power presents many opportunities for  procurement cost savings, but the department has not consistently taken  advantage of them. A key aspect of strategic sourcing is consolidating  similar requirements to manage them collectively, reaping cost savings  and efficiency gains. VA has done this successfully in some areas, such  as pharmaceuticals, and the planned changes to the MSPV program  could result in greater use of discounted national contracts for medical  supplies if they are successfully implemented.", "There are opportunities to better apply strategic sourcing principles at the  regional level, as well. Within VHA, each of the 19 VISNs is responsible  for a regional network of multiple medical centers and clinics. Individual  medical centers within each VISN procure many goods and services  separately, despite the fact that their requirements are similar.  Consolidating these requirements\u2014such as security services, elevator  maintenance, and eyeglasses for patients\u2014can realize both cost savings  and greater efficiency in awarding and administering contracts.", "We found efforts underway to consolidate requirements at the regional  level, but local autonomy and limited planning capacity pose obstacles.  For instance, one VISN we visited recently began an initiative to  consolidate requirements for purchases made by all of its medical  centers, especially services. VISN managers explained that they began  with the easiest requirements, such as landscaping services and parking  administration. They issued a draft memorandum with plans to broaden  this approach to most purchases, but medical center staff provided  feedback that they preferred their own local contracts and did not want  VISN-wide contracts to become the default approach. In our review of 37  selected contracts, we did find several instances of VISN and contracting  officials consolidating requirements for greater efficiency and to obtain  better pricing. This indicates that consolidating procurement is possible  with leadership buy-in, and that there are opportunities to share lessons  learned across VISNs. Within VHA, in VISNs where there is not a  consistent push by local leadership to pursue consolidation, it is  challenging for efforts driven by individual departments or contracting  personnel to overcome cultural obstacles.", "To provide the necessary leadership commitment to take advantage of  these opportunities, we recommended in our September 2016 report that  VHA Procurement and Logistics conduct a review of VISN-level strategic  sourcing efforts, identify best practices, and, if needed, issue guidance.  The Acting Chief Acquisition Officer, OALC said that the department  agreed with this recommendation.", "Chairman Coffman, Ranking Member Kuster, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
