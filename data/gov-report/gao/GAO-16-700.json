SNFs are required to self-report their expenditures in annual financial cost reports, and CMS posts the raw data on its website. However, CMS has not provided the data in a readily accessible format and has not posted the data in a place that is easy to find on its website, according to public stakeholders and GAO's observations. In addition, CMS does little to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data. Federal internal control standards suggest that agencies should make data accessible to the public and ensure data reliability. Until CMS takes steps to make reliable SNF expenditure data easier to use and locate, public stakeholders will have difficulty accessing and placing confidence in the only publicly available source of financial data for many SNFs.", "GAO found that, for each fiscal year from 2011 through 2014, direct and indirect care costs were lower as a percentage of revenue, on average, at for-profit SNFs compared with nonprofit and government SNFs. Direct and indirect care costs were similarly lower at chain SNFs compared with independent SNFs. In addition, the median margin, which measures revenue relative to costs, was higher for for-profit and chain SNFs than for other SNFs in each of the 4 years.", "The relationship between SNFs' nurse staffing levels (hours per resident day) and their margins varied by ownership type in each fiscal year from 2012 through 2014, the 3 years with complete staffing data. For-profit SNFs generally had lower nurse staffing ratios than did nonprofit and government SNFs. Examining each fiscal year separately, GAO estimated that a SNF's margin had a small, but statistically significant, effect on its case-mix adjusted (that is, adjusted for residents' health care needs) nurse staffing ratios. For example, for each percentage point increase in a for-profit SNF's margin in fiscal year 2014, GAO estimated that the SNF's total nurse staffing ratio (including registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certified nursing assistants) decreased by 4.1 minutes per resident day after controlling for other factors. However, in GAO's analyses, these other factors, such as geographic location, were more important predictors of a SNF's case-mix adjusted nurse staffing ratios."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) improve public stakeholders' ability to locate and use SNF expenditure data and (2) ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data.

Most SNFs are distinct  units (such as buildings, floors, or wings) within nursing homes that also  provide long-term care, which Medicare does not cover. Medicare SNF  residents include those recovering from surgeries, such as joint  replacements, and health conditions, such as stroke and pneumonia.", "To participate in Medicare, SNFs must meet minimum federal quality and  life-safety standards and must submit annual cost reports. The cost  reports are the only publicly available source of financial data for many  SNFs. The reports also capture information on facility characteristics and  nurse staffing levels. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare, provides the cost report  data to the public and uses the data to update SNF payment rates. Public  stakeholders, such as beneficiary advocates and researchers, could use  the cost report data to compare SNFs\u2019 costs for resident care, among  other things. SNFs participating in Medicare can decide how much to  spend on resident care and other costs and how much to retain. In 2014,  the average SNF Medicare margin, which measures payments relative to  costs, was 12.5 percent.", "Some researchers have questioned whether SNFs\u2019 margins are coming  at the expense of resident quality of care in the form of low nurse staffing  levels. For example, to increase their margins, SNFs could reduce  staffing levels or provide residents with fewer or a less expensive mix of  services. SNFs employ three types of nursing staff: registered nurses  (RN), licensed practical nurses (LPN), and certified nursing assistants  (CNA). Previous research has demonstrated that higher nurse staffing  levels\u2014particularly RN staffing levels\u2014are associated with higher quality  of care. In addition, our past work suggests that SNF ownership type  (for-profit, nonprofit, or government) and chain affiliation (chain or  independent) may be associated with staffing levels and quality of care.  For example, we found in October 2015 that nursing homes that  consistently performed poorly on selected quality measures between  2011 and 2014 were more likely to be for-profit or large homes (greater  than 100 beds) compared with homes that performed well. In July 2011,  we found that nursing homes owned by private investment firms had  lower reported average total nurse staffing levels and more quality of care  problems identified in inspections compared with other homes. Industry  representatives contend that SNFs prioritize high-quality care despite  pressure to manage operating costs within reimbursement constraints.", "You asked us to provide information on how SNFs spend their Medicare  and other revenues and how spending may vary by facility characteristics.  In this report, we examine  1.  the extent to which the expenditure data CMS collects from SNFs and  provides to the public are accessible and reliable,  2.  how SNF costs and margins vary by facility characteristics, and  3.  how SNF nurse staffing levels vary by facility characteristics and the  relationship between SNF nurse staffing levels and margins.", "To examine the extent to which the expenditure data CMS collects from  SNFs and provides to the public are accessible and reliable, we reviewed  SNF expenditure data requirements in the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and Medicare cost report documentation.  We also compared CMS\u2019s expenditure reporting with that of another  organization, the California HealthCare Foundation, which publicly reports  cost, finance, and quality measures for nursing homes in the state on its  CalQualityCare.org website. In addition, we interviewed CMS officials,  two academic researchers who have studied this topic for many years,  and representatives from two beneficiary advocacy organizations familiar  with SNF expenditure data to obtain their views on CMS\u2019s expenditure  reporting. We also contacted two SNF trade associations.  Representatives from one association told us they did not have expertise  on cost reporting, and representatives from the second association did  not respond. Finally, we reviewed CMS\u2019s efforts to make SNF  expenditure data accessible to the public and to ensure the reliability of  the data against the relevant standards for internal control in the federal  government.", "To examine how SNF costs and margins vary by facility characteristics,  we analyzed Medicare cost report data for fiscal years 2011 through  2014\u2014the most recent years with complete data available as of July  2015, when we began our analyses. While the cost reports include some  data related specifically to Medicare residents, they also contain data for  all facility residents regardless of payer. Generally, the cost reports cover  a 12-month period of operations and reflect SNFs\u2019 fiscal years, which  comprise different ranges of months. We first organized each SNF\u2019s costs  into four categories: direct care, indirect care, capital-related assets, and  administrative services. We then calculated how much each SNF spent  for each category as a percentage of revenue and computed each SNF\u2019s  margin, reflecting the percentage of revenue each SNF retained. We then  compared SNF costs and margins by ownership type and chain affiliation.", "To examine how SNF nurse staffing levels vary by facility characteristics  and the relationship between SNF nurse staffing levels and margins, we  first used nurse work time as a proxy for nurse staffing levels. Using cost  report data, we calculated each SNF\u2019s total nurse time worked (RNs,  LPNs, and CNAs combined) and total RN time worked, and expressed  the totals as a ratio of nurse time per resident day. Because the time  needed for treating residents varies with their clinical conditions and  treatments, we adjusted each SNF\u2019s staffing ratios on the basis of its  Medicare residents\u2019 health care needs. This process is known as case- mix adjustment. We then used multiple linear regression analysis, a  statistical procedure that allowed us to assess the relationship between a  SNF\u2019s margin and its case-mix adjusted total nurse and total RN time per  resident day, controlling for other factors. The other factors in our models  included a SNF\u2019s average hourly RN wage, average resident length of  stay, chain affiliation, number of beds, number of competitors within 15  miles, ownership type, proportion of Medicare days, and urban or rural  status. Our models also accounted for the state where each SNF was  located. We restricted our analyses to fiscal years 2012 through 2014  because nurse staffing data were incomplete for fiscal year 2011 and  were generally unavailable beyond fiscal year 2014 when we began our  analyses. For each of the 3 years, we performed analyses for all SNFs  and by ownership type and chain affiliation.", "We limited our analyses of Medicare cost report data to freestanding  SNFs\u2014that is, those not based in a hospital\u2014in the 50 states and  Washington, D.C. We excluded hospital-based SNFs from our analyses  because their costs may be driven in part by hospitals\u2019 methods for  allocating overhead costs among departments. In addition, CMS requires  hospital-based SNFs to submit the Medicare hospital cost report, which  does not gather SNF direct care staffing data, rather than the SNF cost  report. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reported that  hospital-based SNFs accounted for 5 percent of all SNFs and 3 percent  of Medicare SNF spending in 2014.", "The Medicare cost report data we used for our analyses had some  limitations. Although the cost reports provided the most suitable data for  our analyses, they are not routinely audited and are subject to limited  verification. In addition, because SNFs are not reimbursed directly on the  basis of their costs, the level of effort SNFs put into accurately completing  the cost reports is uncertain. Furthermore, prior research has  demonstrated that it is possible for SNFs to conceal profit in management  fees, lease agreements, interest payments to owners, and purchases  from related-party organizations. It is not possible to detect this activity  using cost report data. To the extent that profit is \u201chidden\u201d in various cost  categories, our findings may understate a SNF\u2019s margin.", "We took several steps to assess the reliability of the Medicare cost report  data we used in this report. We interviewed CMS officials, reviewed cost  report documentation, and excluded SNFs that reported implausible  values for their costs, revenues, nursing hours, number of beds, and  number of inpatient days. We used standard statistical techniques to  identify outliers and eliminate SNFs that reported extreme values among  the dependent variables used in our regression analyses as well as SNFs  whose reported values had a disproportionate effect on our regression  results. Finally, because SNFs sometimes file more than one cost report  for a single fiscal year (e.g., amended or partial year reports), we ensured  that each SNF we included had only one cost report per year. Our  exclusions removed between 5 percent and 14 percent of all SNFs that  submitted a cost report each year. Our final population ranged from  11,132 to 13,255 SNFs in each year. On the basis of these steps, we  concluded that the Medicare cost report data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report. See appendix I for additional detail on the  methods and results of our expenditure analyses.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to September 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Medicare may cover  up to 100 days per episode of SNF care. Many SNFs also provide long- term care, which Medicare does not cover, to Medicaid or private paying  residents. Medicaid, the joint federal-state program for certain low-income  individuals, is the primary payer for over 60 percent of SNF residents.  Industry advocates have raised questions about Medicaid payment rates  in many states being lower than the costs of providing care. While  Medicare and Medicaid separately certify SNFs, nearly all SNFs have  dual certification and participate in both programs.

For  example, several studies have demonstrated that for-profit SNFs  generally have lower nurse-to-resident staffing ratios compared with  nonprofit SNFs, likely allowing them to reduce their personnel costs and  increase their margins. Nonprofit SNFs receive favorable tax status  because they are not allowed to operate for the benefit of private  interests.", "SNFs also vary by chain affiliation.

For example, a higher  proportion of RNs may be employed to meet residents\u2019 needs in SNFs  that serve more residents with acute care needs or in SNFs with specialty  care units (such as units for residents who require ventilators).

In addition, higher total  nurse and RN staffing levels have been associated with better health  outcomes, such as fewer cases of pressure ulcers, urinary tract  infections, malnutrition, and dehydration, as well as improved resident  functional status. In 2001, a CMS contractor reported the effect of nurse  staffing on quality of care in SNFs. The contractor identified staffing  thresholds in both a short-stay sample of Medicare SNF admissions and  a long-stay sample of nursing home residents who were in the facility for  at least 90 days. These thresholds demonstrated incremental benefits of  nurse staffing; once these thresholds were met, there were no additional  benefits in terms of quality. For the short-stay sample, the thresholds  were 0.55 hours per resident day for RNs and 3.51 hours per resident day  for all nurses.

Similarly, for fiscal year 2013, we estimated that a  1 percentage point increase in a SNF\u2019s margin decreased its case-mix  adjusted total nurse time per resident day by 5.1 minutes and its case-mix  adjusted RN time per resident day by 0.4 minutes. Finally, for fiscal year  2014, we estimated that a SNF\u2019s case-mix adjusted total nurse time per  resident day decreased by 7.4 minutes and its case-mix adjusted RN time  per resident day decreased by 0.2 minutes for each percentage point  increase in its margin.", "In each of the 3 fiscal years, which we examined separately, the  relationship between SNF nursing time and margins varied by ownership  type. Table 2 shows our estimates for the change in a SNF\u2019s case-mix  adjusted total nurse and RN time per resident day for each percentage  point increase in its margin. For example, for fiscal year 2012, we  estimated that if a for-profit SNF with a margin of 20 percent and a case- mix adjusted total nurse time of 4 hours per resident day increased its  margin to 21 percent, holding all other variables constant, its total nurse  time would fall to 3 hours and 49 minutes per resident day (a decrease of  11.0 minutes).", "The relationship between a SNF\u2019s total nurse time per resident day and  its margin also differed slightly by chain affiliation. We estimated that the  total nurse time per resident day decreased slightly more at SNFs that  were part of chains than at those that were independent. For example, we  estimated that for each percentage point increase in a SNF\u2019s margin, the  case-mix adjusted total nurse time per resident day decreased by 6.9  minutes at chain-affiliated SNFs and by 4.3 minutes at independent SNFs  in fiscal year 2014. For each of the 3 years we examined, a chain- affiliated SNF\u2019s margin did not have a statistically significant effect on its  RN time per resident day.", "Although the effect of margins in our regression analyses was statistically  significant, margins were not the strongest predictor of case-mix adjusted  total nurse and RN time per resident day. Accounting for the state where  each SNF was located was very important in explaining its nursing time.  This could be attributable to variation across states in staffing  requirements, Medicaid reimbursement rates, or other factors. Because of  the strong effect of the state where each SNF was located, we needed to  statistically control for a SNF\u2019s state to isolate the effects of a SNF\u2019s total  nurse and RN time per resident day on its margin. In addition, we  estimated that a SNF\u2019s proportion of Medicare days increased its total  nurse and RN time per resident day.

To measure  nurse staffing levels, we calculated each SNF\u2019s total nurse and RN time  per resident day. A SNF\u2019s total nurse time per resident day reflects the  number of hours that RNs, licensed practical nurses (LPN), and certified  nursing assistants (CNA) worked per resident day. We computed each  SNF\u2019s total nurse and RN time per resident day using a complex formula.  We first calculated a SNF\u2019s total paid hours for full-time and part-time  RNs, LPNs, and CNAs who are both directly hired and under contract.  Because the time needed for treating residents varies with their clinical  conditions and treatments, we then adjusted each SNF\u2019s nursing time per  resident day on the basis of its Medicare residents\u2019 health care needs.  This process is known as case-mix adjustment. We developed our  formula based largely on CMS\u2019s methodology for case-mix adjusting  nurse staffing measures for Nursing Home Compare, the CMS website  that contains summary measures of SNF quality data. CMS\u2019s approach  is based on the distribution of a SNF\u2019s residents\u2019 assignments into one of  53 different payment groups, called resource utilization groups. Each  group describes residents with similar therapy, nursing, and special care  needs. CMS\u2019s model uses the estimated RN, LPN, and CNA minutes for  each resource utilization group based on the results from the Staff Time  Measurement Studies conducted in 1995 and 1997.", "For our analyses, we used a different source of data than what CMS uses  for Nursing Home Compare. CMS obtains staffing data from Form CMS- 671 (Long Term Care Facility Application for Medicare and Medicaid)  from the Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports (CASPER)  system and census data from Form CMS-672 (Resident Census and  Conditions of Residents). CMS officials advised us against using the  CASPER data. CMS has observed that the CASPER data, which are  collected over a 2-week period at the time of a SNF\u2019s annual inspection  survey, generally indicate higher RN staffing levels and lower LPN and  CNA staffing levels compared with the Medicare cost reports. Table 4  shows CMS\u2019s analysis of the staffing levels using 2013 data from the  Medicare cost reports and CASPER.", "Because of the available data in the cost reports, there were some  limitations with our case-mix adjustment calculation. While the cost  reports include data on the resource needs for Medicare residents, they  do not capture data on the resource needs for non-Medicare residents.  Accordingly, we estimated a SNF\u2019s resident case-mix based only on its  Medicare residents\u2019 resource utilization groups. In addition, the cost  reports obtain data on 13 additional resource utilization groups that CMS  implemented in 2010 to reflect updated staff time measurement data. For  our calculation, we could not use Medicare days attributable to these  groups on the cost reports. Finally, because SNFs\u2019 staffing data on the  cost reports were incomplete for fiscal year 2011 and were generally  unavailable beyond fiscal year 2014 when we began our analyses, we  limited our analyses to fiscal years 2012 through 2014.", "HoursAdjusted is the case-mix adjusted total nurse or RN hours per  resident day.", "HoursReported is each SNF\u2019s number of reported total nurse or RN  hours per resident day.", "HoursExpected is each SNF\u2019s number of expected total nurse or RN  hours per resident day.", "HoursNational Average is the national average of reported total nurse or RN  hours per resident day.", "We then used multiple linear regression analysis, a statistical procedure  that allowed us to assess the relationship between a SNF\u2019s margin and its  case-mix adjusted total nurse and RN time per resident day, controlling  for other factors. The other factors in our models included a SNF\u2019s  average hourly RN wage, average resident length of stay, chain affiliation,  number of beds, number of competitors within 15 miles, ownership type,  proportion of Medicare days, and urban or rural status. Our models also  accounted for the state where each SNF was located. We performed  separate regressions for all SNFs in fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014.  We also performed regressions by ownership type and chain affiliation.", "Table 5 shows the results of our regressions for all SNFs where the  dependent variable is the case-mix adjusted total nursing hours per  resident day, and table 6 shows the results of our regressions for all  SNFs where the dependent variable is the case-mix adjusted RN hours  per resident day. The tables include regression coefficients and R2  statistics. Regression coefficients can be interpreted as the predicted  change in nursing time per resident day for every unit change in the  independent variable. In general, it is not meaningful to compare the size  of these coefficients because our independent variables are on different  scales. We used R statistics to estimate how much of the variation in the  nursing time per resident day can be explained by all the independent  variables in our models. Taken together, the independent variables  explained between 27 percent and 31 percent of the variation in the case- mix adjusted total nursing hours per resident day and between 36 percent  and 39 percent of the variation in the case-mix adjusted RN hours per  resident day for fiscal years 2012 through 2014.
