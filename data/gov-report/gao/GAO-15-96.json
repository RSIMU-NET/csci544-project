This is approximately 9 percent of NOAA's total annual appropriations for these years. In reviewing these estimates, GAO found NOAA's annual costs for these observing systems ranged from about $22 million for systems managed by the National Marine Fisheries Service to $198 million for systems managed by the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in fiscal year 2014.", "NOAA has not taken all of the steps it has identified as important to integrate and improve the cost-effectiveness of its observing systems portfolio. Since 2002, NOAA has identified the need to move toward an integrated observing systems portfolio. GAO's previous work has found that, in undertaking initiatives such as this, federal agencies can benefit from following leading practices for strategic planning, which include defining goals and performance measures to track progress. NOAA has not, however, developed a plan that clearly sets forth its vision for an integrated observing systems portfolio, the steps it needs to take to achieve this vision, or how it will evaluate its progress. NOAA officials said they have focused on taking specific steps toward integration rather than developing an integration plan. Without a plan, however, NOAA cannot be assured it has established a framework to effectively guide and assess the success of its observing system integration efforts. NOAA has also not assessed whether its observing systems are collecting unnecessarily duplicative data even though NOAA documents have identified the need to reduce duplication. NOAA officials told GAO that duplication is not a significant problem requiring further analysis. However, in the absence of an analysis, NOAA cannot know whether it is missing opportunities to achieve cost savings. NOAA has taken steps to integrate the management of its observing systems, including creating an observing systems council to provide a more centralized perspective on systems management. The agency has also developed analytical tools to assess its observing system capabilities and requirements, including a model to analyze investment options. Reliable cost data are needed to ensure the most accurate results from this model, but NOAA does not have a standard methodology for tracking its observing systems costs. NOAA officials said the agency is considering developing a better method for tracking observing system costs but has not established a time frame for doing so.

We identified 75 environmental parameters, such as wave direction,  salinity, and ocean temperature. We then reviewed NOAA\u2019s entire observing  systems portfolio to identify which of the systems collect data on at least one  of these environmental parameters. We provided the list of ocean, coastal,  and Great Lakes observing systems we identified to NOAA officials and  incorporated their views into our final list as appropriate. To obtain  descriptive information about the systems, we reviewed agency  documentation, such as NOAA\u2019s observing system summary reports, and  we interviewed NOAA officials. To identify NOAA\u2019s costs to operate and  maintain its ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems, we asked  NOAA officials to provide cost data for these systems. NOAA does not have  a process to track observing system operations and maintenance costs.  However, as part of an analysis of its observing systems portfolio, NOAA  gathered cost information for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 by surveying  agency officials. We assessed the reliability of the information they provided  by, among other things, reviewing documentation of NOAA\u2019s data collection  procedures and interviewing agency officials, including observing system  program managers. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our report, which is to provide an overview of the costs for  NOAA\u2019s ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems. The data may  not, however, be sufficiently reliable for other purposes that require more  accurate cost data, such as for making comparisons of the relative cost- effectiveness of different observing systems. To determine the extent to  which NOAA has taken steps to integrate and improve the cost- effectiveness of its portfolio of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing  systems, we reviewed agency and external documentation. Specifically, we  reviewed NOAA plans related to managing the agency\u2019s observing systems  portfolio and documentation of the agency\u2019s observing systems  management activities. In addition, we reviewed internal NOAA reports and  external reviews that identified opportunities to improve the management  and integration of the agency\u2019s observing systems portfolio.

This office is part of NOAA\u2019s National Ocean Service and works with  18 federal agencies and 11 regional associations to expand, standardize,  and integrate ocean observing systems and data. The U.S. IOOS program  relies on the voluntary participation of its federal and regional partners to  achieve its coordination objectives, which have focused primarily on  increasing the data compatibility and integration among the observing  systems owned by NOAA, other federal agencies, and regional partners.  According to NOAA officials, the program does not manage any of these  systems, including those ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing  systems operated by NOAA.", "On the basis of our review of NOAA documents and discussions with  agency officials, there are several ways in which integration could take place  in the context of an observing systems portfolio. One way is by changing  how a portfolio of observing systems is managed. This type of management  integration could occur to different degrees along a continuum. At one end of  the continuum, each individual observing system would be operated and  managed separately by its program manager, with little or no higher-level  organizational oversight. This would result in little to no integration because  decisions about operating and maintaining each individual system would be  made in isolation from each other. At the other end of the continuum, all the  observing systems would be managed centrally, rather than at the individual  program level. In this scenario, top-level managers would make decisions  about operating and maintaining the organization\u2019s portfolio of systems by  considering trade-offs among all of the systems the organization manages.  Between the two extremes of individual and central management, a number  of other management approaches would offer different degrees of  integration. For example, several observing systems within the portfolio  could be grouped together and managed by a small number of  organizational units or individual programs could manage their systems but  also have some sort of oversight from higher levels in the organization.  Another way that integration can occur is for data collected by observing  systems to be integrated. For example, using a standardized data collection  format and quality control protocols increases the comparability of data  obtained from different observing systems. This would allow data from  multiple systems to be combined more efficiently for analysis and to produce  products, such as weather forecasts. Integration can also occur by  combining physical components (hardware) of various observing systems,  for example, by placing additional sensors on an existing platform to collect  data on different environmental parameters.", "NOAA recognized the need to begin taking steps toward integrating its  observing systems portfolio in 2002, when the Under Secretary of  Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere initiated a review to examine  NOAA\u2019s strengths and identify opportunities for improvement. Historically,  most of NOAA\u2019s observing systems were designed individually to meet  specific data collection needs. For example, the Marine Optical Buoy  observing system was designed to collect data on an environmental  parameter that is used by multiple satellites to validate their ocean color  imagery data. Most observing systems also used different data collection  formats, which historically made it difficult to combine and use data from  different systems. Management of NOAA\u2019s observing systems portfolio was  decentralized and, according to NOAA documents, the agency considered  its systems to be \u201cstovepiped.\u201d The 2002 review generated many  recommendations, one of which called for NOAA to centrally plan and  integrate all observing systems. The report did not specify what central  planning and integration of NOAA\u2019s observing systems portfolio would look  like or how the agency would accomplish these goals. NOAA officials we  spoke with described this review as the catalyst for the actions the agency  has taken since 2002 to address observing systems integration issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Operates 41 Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes Observing Systems", "paragraphs": ["We identified 41 ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems at  NOAA.

Buoys are used by 18 of the agency\u2019s  ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems. For example, the  Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System consists of 11 buoys located in  the Chesapeake Bay that collect meteorological, oceanographic, and water- quality data used to help protect and restore the area. (See fig. 1 for a map  of the buoy\u2019s locations in the Chesapeake Bay.) Five of the observing  systems use a combination of NOAA ships or chartered vessels to collect  data. The National Marine Fisheries Service\u2019s Fish Surveys, for example,  are conducted from ships and collect data on the distribution and abundance  of commercially-targeted and ecologically-important fish species. Four of the  observing systems use satellites as their primary platform. For example, the  Jason Ocean Surface Topography Mission satellite collects data for use in  ocean models to predict severe storm intensity. Other ocean and coastal  observing systems also use satellites to transmit their data to land-based  data centers.", "Thirty-three of the 41 ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing system  platforms are located in situ\u2014meaning situated where the data are  measured. For these systems, that means in the water. The other systems  are located remotely (either on land or in the atmosphere) and look down at  the environment they are measuring. Some in situ systems are on a fixed  platform, such as a moored buoy. These types of platforms are used to  obtain a series of measurements over a long time at the same location. For  example, the National Weather Service\u2019s Tropical Atmospheric Ocean buoy  array was designed to study and predict climate variations due to the El Ni\u00f1o  Southern Oscillation on a year-to-year basis. This moored buoy system is  located in the equatorial oceans and it collects data on several  environmental parameters, such as air temperature and sea surface  temperature, as shown in figure 2. The data are transmitted via satellite to  NOAA and are used to assist in monitoring, predicting, and understanding El  Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events.", "In contrast, other in situ systems use mobile platforms that measure how  environmental parameters vary spatially, temporally, and geographically. For  example, the Global Ocean Observing System Argo Profiling Floats use a  free-drifting buoy system to collect data on the heat content and salinity of  the upper ocean over a predetermined depth (up to 2,000 meters) and cycle  time (10 days) as shown in figure 3. Data collected by an Argo float is  available within hours of collection, which allows for continuous monitoring of  the state of the ocean and provides data for other scientific uses, such as  weather forecasting and climate modeling, according to a NOAA official.", "The agency\u2019s ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems gather a  broad range of data that NOAA uses to create a variety of products. In some  cases, NOAA prepares products directly from data from an individual  observing system and, in other cases, the agency prepares products by  combining and analyzing data from a number of observing systems. Some  of NOAA\u2019s products include the following:", "Forecasts and warnings. NOAA provides weather, water, and climate  forecasts and warnings for the nation, its territories, adjacent waters, and  ocean areas that are used by the private and public sectors. The  forecasts and warnings are derived from weather prediction models that  use the data collected by the ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing  systems. For example, the Coastal Weather Buoys observing system  measures barometric pressure, wind direction, and air and sea  temperature, and these data are used in weather prediction models to  create forecasts. In addition, data from aircraft and satellites that observe  ocean environmental parameters are used to develop severe storm and  flash flood warnings.", "Scientific research. Data collected by the agency\u2019s ocean, coastal, and  Great Lakes observing systems are used to support NOAA\u2019s research  projects and activities. For example, the Ecosystems and Fisheries- Oceanography Coordinated Investigations observing system was  established in 1984 and collects data on ecosystem changes in the Gulf  of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean. Scientists use the data to  determine how biological and physical environmental trends, such as the  loss of sea ice in the Bering Sea, are affecting Alaska\u2019s marine  ecosystems. In addition, the observing systems that comprise the Global  Ocean Observing Systems collect long-term measurements of  environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature and ocean  current speed that can be used to help assess climate change.", "Navigation tools. Navigation tools are some of NOAA\u2019s most important  products, according to NOAA documents, because they help ensure the  safe navigation of ports and harbors. Data collected by some of NOAA\u2019s  ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems are used to  generate nautical charts. For example, the National Ocean-Shoreline  observing system surveys the nation\u2019s shorelines, and the Hydrographic  Surveying observing system measures, among other things, the depth  between the sea\u2019s surface and the sea floor and the locations of  potentially hazardous obstructions. Data from both of these systems are  used to create nautical charts of coastlines and ports that are used by  ships engaged in maritime commerce. These charts are also used for  other activities, such as port and harbor maintenance.", "Emergency management and response. NOAA uses its ocean,  coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems to provide data and  information that the agency uses in its emergency response and  management efforts. For example, the National Ocean Service\u2019s  National Water Level Observation Network observing system collects  data on water levels and currents that are used to develop plans to  contain oil spills.

NOAA  provided us with estimated cost information because its budget structure  and accounting system are not designed to capture costs at the observing  system level. Of the 41 ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing  systems, 4 have line items in NOAA\u2019s budget that identify the amount of  money dedicated to operating and maintaining those systems. Funding  for the other observing systems comes from the budgets of various NOAA  programs that cover multiple program activities, including the observing  systems. For example, the Sustained Ocean Observations and Monitoring  program in the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research provides  funding for a variety of activities, including operating several observing  systems, such as the Global Ocean Observing System Argo Profiling Floats,  Ocean Reference Stations, and Ocean Carbon Networks, that are key  components of the Global Ocean Observing System.

For the  Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, these costs include operation and  maintenance of NOAA\u2019s fleet of specialized ships and aircraft, including the  scientific and technical equipment they carry to collect data, according to  NOAA documentation. For example, in fiscal year 2013, NOAA\u2019s fleet  included 16 active ships that provided 1,702 days at sea and 9 aircraft that  provided 2,503 flight hours to programs in each of NOAA\u2019s line offices to  support observational activities needed to achieve their environmental and  scientific missions. The National Ocean Service\u2019s costs include operating  11 ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems that collect data  NOAA describes as being essential to safe, efficient, and sustainable uses  of busy coastal areas and waterways. For example, some of these costs  were for the Hydrographic Surveying observing system that provides data  that are used primarily to develop nautical charts. The costs also included  operating and maintaining the National Water Level Observation Network  and the National Current Observation Program observing systems that  monitor tides, currents, water levels, and other environmental parameters.  The data from these systems are used to create navigational products and  provide other services.", "NOAA\u2019s estimated annual costs vary widely across the different observing  systems. In fiscal year 2014, NOAA\u2019s costs ranged from nearly $170 million  to operate the NOAA-owned ships that collect ocean and fisheries-related  data, to $80,000 for the Ocean Acoustic Monitoring System. That system  consists of mobile underwater hydrophones in the Pacific Ocean that are  primarily used to listen for earthquakes, but they can also be used for  observing some endangered marine species. The 10 systems with the  highest estimated annual costs, as shown in table 3, together accounted for  approximately 79 percent of NOAA\u2019s annual costs to operate and maintain  its ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems in fiscal year 2014.  The largest item in the annual operations and maintenance costs for the 10  systems varies depending on the type of observing system. For example,  most of the costs for the Global Ocean Observing System Argo Profiling  Float system are for the acquisition of new floats since deployed floats are  not retrieved for maintenance. But, for the Coastal Weather Buoys, the  major cost is labor to maintain the systems\u2019 stations, sensors, and  instruments. For other systems, such as Fish Surveys, ship time accounts  for a majority of the annual operations costs.

Not all of these systems may need to collect sea  surface temperature data to meet the needs of NOAA\u2019s programs. However,  according to NOAA officials, there are a variety of reasons why multiple  observing systems might measure the same parameters. First, the systems  may all be collecting data, such as sea surface temperature, in different  locations. Second, in some situations, collecting data on the same  environmental parameter is done purposefully to maintain continuity of data  collection in the event that one system failed. Third, different observing  systems may collect data on the same environmental parameter but at  different times or with different degrees of accuracy. While one or more of  these reasons, or some other reasons, may be why 21 observing systems  collect data on sea surface temperature, NOAA officials could not provide  analysis or documentation to show that unnecessary duplication does not  exist. NOAA officials told us they do not believe unnecessary duplication in  data collection in the agency\u2019s observing systems portfolio is a significant  problem requiring further analysis. However, without analyzing whether  there is unnecessary duplication or opportunities to reduce or consolidate  observations, NOAA would not know if there were opportunities to achieve  cost savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Has Created a Council to Help Integrate the Management of Its Observing Systems Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["NOAA\u2019s 2002 agency-wide review recommended the development of a  \u201ccross-cut team\u201d to centrally plan and integrate the management of its  observing system portfolio. In response to the recommendation, the  agency created the NOAA Observing System Council (NOSC), which held  its first meeting in July 2003. The NOSC consists of representatives from  each of the six line offices, the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations,  the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Information Officer. The  Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and  Prediction chairs the NOSC, with support provided by three vice chairs.  The purpose of the NOSC is to provide a more centralized, agency-wide  perspective on the management of NOAA\u2019s observing systems. However,  according to NOAA officials, individual programs within NOAA\u2019s line offices  are still responsible for operating and managing their observing systems.", "According to NOAA officials and documents, the NOSC coordinates all of  the agency\u2019s observing systems portfolio and data management activities  and provides recommendations to the NOAA Executive Council on  observing system investments. For example, in 2009, the NOSC appointed  a team, with representation from each line and one staff office, to review  analyses of 25 alternatives related to NOAA\u2019s observing system portfolio.  The team recommended whether the various options should or should not  be funded. For example, the team recommended funding to expand annual  fish surveys that provide data for fish stock assessments conducted by the  National Marine Fisheries Service, in part, because the assessments were  both a line office and agency priority. According to NOAA documentation,  NOAA\u2019s Program Analysis and Evaluation Office planned to use the team\u2019s  recommendations as part of the agency\u2019s planning and budgeting process  for fiscal years 2013 through 2017.", "The NOSC, in 2004, established the Technology, Planning and Integration  for Observation (TPIO) program office to assist in conducting technical  analyses to support the NOSC\u2019s recommendations to NOAA leadership on  integrating and improving the cost-effectiveness of the agency\u2019s observing  system portfolio. According to NOAA documentation, TPIO identifies: (1)  NOAA\u2019s observation requirements, (2) NOAA\u2019s observing system and data  management capabilities, (3) gaps between observation requirements and  capabilities, and (4) observing system and data management solutions to  fulfill NOAA\u2019s observational requirements. For example, in 2011, TPIO  conducted an analysis of observational needs for six of NOAA\u2019s high priority  program areas, including fisheries management and tide and current data.  Specifically, the analysis examined the effect to the programs if NOAA no  longer collected data on key observational requirements. For example,  TPIO\u2019s analysis found that four observing systems collect data on key  requirements related to tides and currents and, if these systems were no  longer funded, key data on these requirements would no longer be available.  The purpose of the analysis was to provide an agency-wide perspective to  NOAA leadership on which high-priority programs were critical to fund in an  increasingly constrained fiscal environment. NOAA officials told us this  particular analysis was only conducted once as the agency decided to invest  in other analytical tools to assist with its decision making.", "In 2009, the NOSC formed a subcommittee\u2014the Observing Systems  Committee\u2014consisting of representatives from NOAA\u2019s line and staff  offices. According to NOAA documentation, the Observing Systems  Committee\u2019s purpose is to conduct analyses of the current observing  systems portfolio and provide recommendations to the NOSC for changes in  the configuration of the portfolio to maximize its benefits. For example,  according to NOAA officials, one of the Observing Systems Committee\u2019s first  activities was to develop the criteria to identify NOAA\u2019s \u201cobserving systems- of-record.\u201d Observing systems-of-record are those systems that the agency  deems necessary to meet its mission and receive sustained funding. As of  2014, the Observing Systems Committee has identified 108 observing  systems of record, which includes nearly all of the 41 ocean, coastal, and  Great Lakes systems we identified.", "The NOSC also established a second subcommittee in 2009\u2014the  Environmental Data Management Committee\u2014which includes members  from each line office and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. This  subcommittee (1) coordinates the development of NOAA\u2019s data  management strategy related to its observing systems, (2) provides  guidance to promote consistent implementation across NOAA, and (3)  identifies opportunities to improve the usability of its data. For example, in  response to a recommendation from NOAA\u2019s Science Advisory Board, in  2013 the committee developed an agency-wide environmental data  management framework that defines the policies, requirements, activities,  and technical considerations relevant to the management of NOAA\u2019s  observational data and products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Is Working to Develop Analytical Capabilities to Improve the Cost-Effectiveness of Its Observing Systems but Has Not Developed a Methodology to Consistently Capture Cost Information", "paragraphs": ["To enhance NOAA\u2019s ability to understand and make cost-effective  management decisions for its entire observing system portfolio, of which the  ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems are a part, the agency  has developed some analytical tools:", "NOAA Observing System Architecture database. The database,  initially created in 2003, provides a comprehensive list of NOAA\u2019s  observing systems and their capabilities. Currently, the NOAA Observing  System Architecture database includes documentation on more than 200  observing systems that are operational, planned, in development, used  for research purposes, retired, or canceled. About half of the systems  are associated with other federal agencies, states and localities, the  commercial sector, or foreign countries. NOAA includes these systems in  the database because they are deemed important to the agency\u2019s  mission, according to NOAA officials. TPIO is responsible for updating  and managing the database and uses it to analyze NOAA\u2019s observing  system capabilities. In 2008 and 2009, TPIO used the database to help  prepare analyses to support observing system investment decisions. For  example, TPIO examined whether to fund additional aerial data  collection for shoreline and coastal areas for use in nautical maps.", "Consolidated Observation Requirements List. The NOSC developed  this database in 2003 to create a more formalized process for NOAA to  identify, collect, document, and update its observational needs and  requirements. After a line office has identified the environmental  parameters that it believes need to be measured, it assigns each one a  priority level. TPIO and the line office then initiate a validation process  for those observing requirements identified as priority-1. According to  NOAA documentation, the purpose of the validation process is to confirm  that a program needs to observe a specific environmental parameter.  After the NOSC reviews and concurs with the validated observation  requirement, it is added to the database. NOAA officials told us the  database now contains information on more than 1,000 validated  observation requirements. NOAA officials said the agency still needs to  document the observing requirements for about 15 percent of the  agency\u2019s ocean and coastal programs. According to NOAA officials, they  use the Consolidated Observation Requirements List and the NOAA  Observing System Architecture databases as analytical tools to help  focus their investment decisions on high-priority observation  requirements. For example, TPIO can compare observational  capabilities listed in the system architecture database with observational  requirements listed in the requirements list database to identify gaps  between capabilities and requirements.", "NOAA Observing Systems Integrated Analysis. The NOAA Observing  Systems Integrated Analysis model is a tool intended to help compare  the cost-effectiveness of the agency\u2019s observing systems in obtaining  mission-critical data and to inform investment decisions. Two external  reviews conducted in 2010 at the request of NOAA found that the  agency had developed tools such as the NOAA Observing Systems  Architecture and Consolidated Observation Requirements List  databases, but there was no mechanism to evaluate the observing  systems portfolio agency-wide. As a result, NOAA developed a pilot  integrated analysis model, known as NOSIA-I, which was completed in  December 2011. The NOSC, in March 2012, decided to expand the pilot  model so it could analyze the agency\u2019s entire observing systems portfolio  including operational observing systems and satellites under  development. As of September 2014, the expanded model (NOSIA-II) is  still in development but, according to NOAA officials, it is expected to be  fully operational by August 2015. The expanded model includes  information on NOAA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives, key products,  qualitative performance ratings of the observing systems, and their  costs. According to NOAA officials, the cost information is important  because it will be used in analyses to help inform management decisions  on observing system investments. For example, NOAA could use it to  show different ways that the agency could absorb a 5 percent budget cut  for its observing systems and how best to allocate those cuts to still allow  the agency to meet its mission.", "However, the two external reviews conducted in 2010 identified concerns  with the quality of the cost information NOAA collected on its observing  systems. Specifically:", "One review found that NOAA does not have guidance on how to capture  costs associated with its observing systems and has limited  documentation to support its reported observing systems costs. It also  found a major weakness in the apparent lack of any formal, documented  process for preparing and reporting observing system costs. Based on  their assessment, the reviewers were concerned that there was a low  level of consistency in observing system cost information across line  offices.", "The other review similarly found (1) accurate cost data for NOAA\u2019s  observing systems appeared very difficult to determine due to  accounting differences and no standard process for how to record and  report the data within programs and (2) a lack of consistency in what  programs included in their observing system costs. The review  concluded that more work was needed to improve the quality and  accounting of costs for NOAA\u2019s observing systems.", "NOAA documents have also recognized the need for accurate cost  information for its observing systems in order to assess the cost- effectiveness of its portfolio. For example, NOAA\u2019s 2012 implementation  plan for its objective to collect accurate observation data states that \u201cit is  critical that NOAA have the capability to determine the optimum portfolio of  observing systems that enable it to accomplish its mission in the most cost- effective, efficient, and economic manner possible.\u201d The implementation  plan further stated that it is critical that NOAA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer  develop a standardized methodology for obtaining accurate cost information  to support investment analyses and to improve the cost-effectiveness of  NOAA\u2019s observing systems portfolio. Specifically, according to NOAA  documents, it is important that the NOAA Observing Systems Integrated  Analysis model include accurate, consistent, and up-to-date cost information  on all of NOAA\u2019s individual observing systems. Without reliable, consistent  cost data, comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of various systems would  not be accurate. However, in a 2013 presentation on the status of the  development of the model, TPIO noted that observing system cost data  needs to be improved and is likely the weakest component of the model.", "NOAA has taken limited steps to improve the quality of these data. Officials  from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer told us they were not working  on developing the methodology identified in NOAA\u2019s 2012 implementation  plan. The officials told us they do not have the technical expertise and  knowledge of the operational requirements of the observing systems to  develop this methodology, and suggested it should be done through the  NOSC. TPIO officials told us they do not have in-house expertise in this  area, and that is why the implementation plan delegated this responsibility to  the NOAA Chief Financial Officer. TPIO officials said that earlier this year  they had informal discussions with the staff from NOAA\u2019s budget and finance  offices to address the need for a standardized methodology for estimating  the costs of its observing systems. According to NOAA officials, the NOAA  Chief Financial Officer has since asked a committee to explore developing a  better method for tracking observing system costs though no time frame for  doing so has been established. Without accurate, consistent, and reliable  cost information, the observing system integrated analysis model will not  provide decision makers with the best information to make decisions  regarding investment trade-offs and to improve the cost-effectiveness of  NOAA\u2019s observing systems portfolio."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NOAA has identified a need to better integrate and improve the cost- effectiveness of its portfolio of observing systems, including ocean,  coastal, and Great Lakes systems.

The  agency has not, however, developed a plan for systems integration that  identifies what it wants the portfolio of observing systems to look like in  the future and includes ways for NOAA to measure and track its progress  toward its goals. Without such a plan, NOAA does not have a detailed,  transparent framework to effectively guide and assess the success of its  observing systems integration efforts, and it will be difficult for  stakeholders to hold the agency accountable for meeting its integration  goals. Also, because NOAA has not assessed whether there is  unnecessary duplication in its observing systems portfolio, the agency  may be missing opportunities to reduce duplication and achieve cost  savings. Finally, NOAA does not have consistent, reliable information on  the costs associated with operating and maintaining each of its observing  systems.

In its written comments, (reproduced in appendix VI), NOAA,  providing comments on behalf of Commerce, generally agreed with our  recommendations. In commenting on the recommendation that NOAA  develop a plan for observing systems integration, NOAA\u2019s response focused  on the 41 ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems identified in  the report and acknowledged there is no single observing plan for these  systems. NOAA listed existing observing plans for several of its ocean,  coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems and said it plans to build off of  these and other existing documents to explore the feasibility of enacting this  recommendation. From NOAA\u2019s response, it appears the agency believes  that our recommendation was directed only at its 41 ocean, coastal, and  Great Lakes observing systems. This is not the case. NOAA does not  manage the 41 ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems as a  separate portfolio and we are not recommending that they do so. Rather, we  recommended that NOAA develop a plan for integrating the agency\u2019s entire  observing systems portfolio, including the ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes  observing systems. In response to the recommendation that NOAA analyze  the extent to which unnecessary duplication exists in NOAA\u2019s portfolio of  observing systems, NOAA acknowledged a continued need to do so and  said it has taken steps in this regard with the development of the NOAA  Observing Systems Integrated Analysis model. In response to our  recommendation that NOAA develop a standardized methodology for the  routine preparation and reporting of observing systems cost data, NOAA  said that it agrees with this recommendation and has already begun talks to  address how its accounting system could collect and report cost data for all  observing systems of record.", "NOAA also provided three general comments. First, NOAA said that the title  of the report should refer to NOAA\u2019s ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes  observing systems, since that was the original scope of our study. While two  of the report\u2019s objectives address only ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes  observing systems, the third objective examines the extent to which NOAA  has taken steps to integrate and improve the cost-effectiveness of its  portfolio of observing systems, including ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes  systems.  Our recommendations address the third objective and  consequently we believe the report title is both accurate and appropriate.  Second, NOAA said that it has long seen the need for an integrated and  cost-effective observing systems portfolio, which is vital to maximizing the  benefits of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes information for the nation.  NOAA said it has dedicated a large effort over the past decade to  systematically develop management structures as well as tools to address  these issues.  We agree that NOAA has developed management structures  and tools and the report includes examples of both. Third, NOAA said that  the fact that key parameters, such as temperature, are measured by multiple  observing systems is not in itself an indicator of potential duplication. We  agree. However, our report noted that multiple systems measuring the same  parameter suggested the potential for unnecessary duplication and we  recommended that NOAA analyze the extent to which unnecessary  duplication exists in its portfolio of observing systems.

After consulting with NOAA officials, we determined that National  Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Global Change Master Directory  contained the federal government\u2019s most complete list of these  environmental parameters. The directory is a Web-based catalogue that we  accessed in October 2013 to identify the 74 environmental parameters it  contained related to the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.

In response, NOAA officials explained that this  information is not readily available as the agency does not routinely collect  data on observing system operation and maintenance costs in the ordinary  course of business. They indicated that the most recent and best available  observing system cost data were collected in 2013 by its Technology,  Planning and Integration for Observation (TPIO) office for use in NOAA\u2019s  Observing Systems Integrated Analysis model. To collect the data, TPIO  developed a spreadsheet template that requested specific cost information  in a particular format. TPIO sent the template to each line office and asked  them to provide annual costs for their observing systems for fiscal years  2012 through 2014. TPIO officials told us they intended the cost information  they requested from the line office to be actual expenditures for fiscal years  2012 and 2013 and estimates for costs in fiscal year 2014 based on  amounts in the 2014 presidential budget request. However, they said the  observing systems costs reported by the line offices for fiscal years 2012  and 2013 are estimates because NOAA\u2019s budget structure and accounting  systems are not set up to track actual spending at the observing system  level.", "According to TPIO officials, the cost information provided by the line offices  was not reviewed by TPIO or the Chief Financial Officers for each of the line  offices prior to being entered into a database. After we requested the  observing systems cost information TPIO had collected, NOAA\u2019s Budget  Office requested the data be reviewed to assess the accuracy of the  information prior to releasing it to us. According to NOAA budget officials,  they asked program managers to review the data they reported to TPIO for  their respective observing systems and they asked each of the line office  Chief Financial Officers to review the combined costs for the observing  systems operated by their line offices. The purpose of the review was to  verify that the cost information NOAA was providing to us accurately  represented the information that had been reported to TPIO. The line office  Chief Financial Officers also evaluated whether the costs were consistent  with the program\u2019s budget allocation based on NOAA\u2019s appropriation levels  for the fiscal years covered by the request. According to NOAA officials, the  review resulted in mostly minor adjustments to the cost information originally  collected by TPIO, and the information we received was the most accurate  cost information NOAA has for its ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes  observing systems portfolio.", "We also took steps to assess the reliability of NOAA\u2019s observing system cost  information by, among other things, reviewing documentation of NOAA\u2019s  data collection procedures and interviewing agency officials, line office Chief  Financial Officers, and observing system program managers.

While we believe the cost information are  sufficiently reliable for this purpose, they may not be sufficiently reliable for  other purposes that require more accurate cost data, such as for making  comparisons of the relative cost-effectiveness of different observing  systems. In addition, to obtain other information related to observing system  costs, we reviewed agency documents, including budget requests,  guidance, and policies, and documentation of NOAA\u2019s managerial cost  accounting system.
