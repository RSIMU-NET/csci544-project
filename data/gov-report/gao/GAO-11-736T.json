GAO examined (1) the volume of sexual assault incidents reported in recent years and the extent to which these incidents are fully reported, (2) what factors may contribute to any observed underreporting, and (3) precautions VA facilities take to prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents. This testimony is based on recent GAO work, \"VA Health Care: Actions Needed To Prevent Sexual Assaults and Other Safety Incidents,\" (GAO-11-530) (June 2011). For that report, GAO reviewed relevant laws, VA policies, and sexual assault incident documentation from January 2007 through July 2010. In addition, GAO visited five judgmentally selected VA medical facilities that varied in size and complexity and spoke with the four Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that oversee them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that many of the nearly 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police were not reported to VA leadership officials and the VA Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Specifically, for the four VISNs GAO spoke with, VISN and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Central Office officials did not receive reports of most sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police. Also, nearly two-thirds of sexual assault incidents involving rape allegations originating in VA facilities were not reported to the VA OIG, as required by VA regulation. GAO identified several factors that may contribute to the underreporting of sexual assault incidents. For example, VHA lacks a consistent sexual assault definition for reporting purposes and clear expectations for incident reporting across its medical facility, VISN, and VHA Central Office levels. Furthermore, VHA Central Office lacks oversight mechanisms to monitor sexual assault incidents reported through the management reporting stream. VA medical facilities GAO visited used a variety of precautions intended to prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents. However, GAO found some of these measures were deficient, compromising medical facilities' efforts to prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents. For example, medical facilities used physical security precautions--such as closed-circuit surveillance cameras to actively monitor areas and locks and alarms to secure key areas. These physical precautions were intended to prevent a broad range of safety incidents, including sexual assaults. However, GAO found significant weaknesses in the implementation of these physical security precautions at the five VA medical facilities visited, including poor monitoring of surveillance cameras, alarm system malfunctions, and the failure of alarms to alert both VA police and clinical staff when triggered. Inadequate system configuration and testing procedures contributed to these weaknesses. Further, facility officials at most of the locations GAO visited said the VA police were understaffed. Such weaknesses could lead to delayed response times to incidents and seriously erode VA's efforts to prevent or mitigate sexual assaults and other safety incidents. GAO reiterated recommendations that VA improve both the reporting and monitoring of sexual assault incidents and the tools used to identify risks and address vulnerabilities at VA facilities. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations and provided an action plan to address them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as the Subcommittee discusses policies and  actions to prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents at  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. During our recent  work on services available for women veterans in VA medical facilities,  several clinicians expressed concern about the safety of women veterans  housed in mental health programs at a VA medical facility\u2019s residential  mental health unit that also housed veterans who had committed past  sexual crimes. Clinicians were also concerned about the adequacy of  existing safety precautions to protect women veterans being treated in the  inpatient mental health units of this same facility. These concerns  highlight the importance of VA having effective security precautions to  protect all patients\u2014especially those with residential and inpatient mental  health programs\u2014and a consistent way to exchange information about  and discuss safety incidents, including sexual assaults.", "My testimony today is based on our June 7, 2011 report: (1) the volume of  sexual assault incidents reported in recent years and the extent to which  these incidents are fully reported, (2) what factors may contribute to any  observed underreporting, and (3) the precautions in place in residential  and inpatient mental health settings to prevent sexual assault and other  safety incidents and any weaknesses in these precautions.", "To examine the volume of sexual assault incidents reported to VA in  recent years, the extent to which these incidents were fully reported, and  factors that may contribute to any observed underreporting, we reviewed  relevant VA and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policies,  handbooks, directives, and other guidance documents regarding the  reporting of safety incidents. We also interviewed VA and VHA Central  Office officials involved with the reporting of safety incidents\u2014including  officials with VA\u2019s Office of Security and Law Enforcement (OSLE) and  VHA\u2019s Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and  Management and Office of the Principal Deputy Under Secretary for  Health. In addition, we conducted site visits to five VA medical facilities.  These judgmentally selected medical facilities were chosen to ensure that  our sample: (1) had both residential and inpatient mental health settings;  (2) reflected a variety of residential mental health specialties, including  military sexual trauma; (3) had medical facilities with various levels of  experience reporting sexual assault incidents; and (4) varied in terms of  size and complexity. During the site visits, we interviewed VA medical  facility leadership officials and residential and inpatient mental health unit  managers and staff to discuss their experiences with reporting sexual  assault incidents. We also spoke with officials from the four Veterans  Integrated Service Networks (VISN) responsible for managing the five  selected VA medical facilities to discuss their expectations, policies, and  procedures for reporting sexual assault incidents. Information obtained  from these VISNs and VA medical facilities cannot be generalized to all  VISNs and VA medical facilities. In addition, we interviewed officials from  the VA Office of the Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) Office of Investigations\u2014 Criminal Investigations Division to discuss information they receive from  VA medical facilities about sexual assault incidents that occur in these  facilities. Further, we reviewed federal statutes related to sexual offenses  and sentencing classification for felonies to verify that all rape allegations  included in our review met the statutory criteria for felonies under federal  law. Finally, we reviewed documentation of reported sexual assault  incidents at VA medical facilities provided by VA\u2019s OSLE, the VA OIG, and  VISNs from January 2007 through July 2010, to determine the number and  types of incidents reported, as well as which VA and VHA offices were  notified of those incidents. For this analysis, we used a definition of sexual  assault that was developed for the purpose of this report. Our analysis of  VA police and VA OIG reports was limited to only those incidents that  were reported and cannot be used to project the volume of sexual assault  incident reports that may occur in future years. Following verification that  VA police and VA OIG incidents met our definition of sexual assault and  comparisons of sexual assault incidents reported by the two groups within  VA, we found data derived from these reports to be sufficiently reliable for  our purposes.", "To examine the precautions in place to prevent sexual assault and other  safety incidents, we reviewed relevant VA, VHA, VISN, and selected  medical facility policies related to the security of residential and inpatient  mental health programs.

Finally, to assess any weaknesses in physical  security precautions at the VA medical facilities selected for this review,  we conducted an independent assessment of the precautions in place at  each of our selected medical facilities\u2014including the testing of alarm  systems. These assessments were conducted by physical security experts  within our Forensic Audits and Investigative Services team using criteria  based on generally recognized security standards and selected VA security  requirements.

According to VA police at this medical facility, the residential  program staff did not consult with VA police before installing their own  system. At another medical facility, where staff in the police office monitor  cameras covering the residential programs\u2019 grounds and parking area, we  found that the police office was unattended part of the time. In addition, at  the remaining three medical facilities we visited, staff in the police  command and control centers assigned to monitor medical facility  surveillance cameras had other duties, such as serving as telephone  operators and police/emergency dispatchers. These other duties  sometimes prevented them from continuously monitoring the camera  feeds in the police command and control center. Although effective use  of surveillance camera systems cannot necessarily prevent safety incidents  from occurring, lapses in monitoring by security staff compromise the  effectiveness of these systems.", "Alarm malfunctions. At least one form of alarm failed to work properly  when tested at four of the five medical facilities we visited. For example,  at one medical facility, we tested the portable personal panic alarms used  by residential program staff and found that the police command and  control center could not accurately pinpoint the location of the tester  when an alarm was activated outside the building. At another medical  facility that used stationary panic alarms in inpatient mental health units,  residential programs, and other clinical settings, almost 20 percent of  these alarms throughout the medical facility were inoperable. At an  inpatient mental health unit in a third medical facility, three of the  computer-based panic alarms we tested failed to properly pinpoint the  location of our tester because the medical facility\u2019s computers had been  moved to different locations and were not properly reconfigured. Finally,  at a fourth medical facility, alarms we tested in the inpatient mental health  unit sounded properly, but staff in the unit and VA police responsible for  testing these alarms did not know how to turn them off after they were  activated. In each of the cases where alarms malfunctioned, VA staff were  not aware the alarms were not functioning properly until we informed  them.", "Inadequate documentation or review of alarm system testing. One  of the five sites we visited failed to properly document tests conducted of  their alarm systems for their residential programs, although testing of  alarms is a required element in VA\u2019s Environment of Care Checklist.  Testing of alarm systems is important to ensure that systems function  properly, and not having complete documentation of alarm system testing  is an indication that periodic testing may not be occurring. In addition,  three medical facilities reported using computer-based panic alarms that  are designed to be self-monitoring to identify cases where computers  equipped with the system fail to connect with the servers monitoring the  alarms. Officials at all three of these medical facilities stated that due to  the self-monitoring nature of these alarms, they did not maintain alarm test  logs of these systems. However, we found that at two of these three  medical facilities, these alarms failed to properly alert VA police when  tested. Such alarm system failures indicate that the self-monitoring  systems may not be effectively alerting medical facility staff of alarm  malfunctions when they occur, indicating the need for these systems to be  periodically tested.", "Alarms failed to alert both police and unit staff. In inpatient mental  health units at all five medical facilities we visited, stationary and  computer-based panic alarm systems we tested did not alert staff in both  the VA police command and control center and the inpatient mental health  unit where the alarm was triggered. Alerting both locations is important to  better ensure that timely and proper assistance is provided. At four of  these medical facilities, the inpatient mental health units\u2019 stationary or  computer-based panic alarms notified the police command and control  centers but not staff at the nursing stations of the units where the alarms  originated. At the fifth medical facility, the stationary panic alarms only  notified staff in the unit nursing station, making it necessary to separately  notify the VA police. Finally, none of the stationary or computer-based  panic alarms used by residential programs notified both the police  command and control centers and staff within the residential program  buildings when tested.", "Limited use of portable personal panic alarms. Electronic portable  personal panic alarms were not available for the staff at any of the  inpatient mental health units we visited and were available to staff at only  one residential program we reviewed. In two of the inpatient mental health  units we visited, staff were given safety whistles they could use to signal  others in cases of emergency, personal distress, or concern about veteran  or staff safety. However, relying on whistles to signal such incidents may  not be effective, especially when staff members are the victims of assault.  For example, a nurse at one medical facility we visited was involved in an  incident in which a patient grabbed her by the throat and she was unable  to use her whistle to summon assistance. Some inpatient mental health  unit staff with whom we spoke indicated an interest in having portable  personal panic alarms to better protect them in similar situations.", "VA police staffing and workload challenges. At most medical facilities  we visited, VA police forces and police command and control centers were  understaffed, according to medical facility officials. For example, during  our visit to one medical facility, VA police officials reported being able to  staff just two officers per 12-hour shift to patrol and respond to incidents  at both the medical facility and at a nearby 675-acre veteran\u2019s cemetery.  While this staffing ratio met the minimum standards for VA police staffing,  having only two police officers to cover such a large area could potentially  increase the response times should a panic alarm activate or other security  incident occur on medical facility grounds. Also, we found that there was  an inadequate number of officers and staff at this medical facility to  effectively police the medical facility and maintain a productive police  force. The medical facility had a total of 9 police officers at the time of our  visit; according to VA staffing guidance, the minimum staffing level for this  medical facility should have been 19 officers. Not all medical facilities we  visited had staffing problems. At one medical facility, the VA police  appeared to be well staffed and were even able to designate staff to  monitor off-site residential programs and community-based outpatient  clinics.", "Lack of stakeholder involvement in unit redesign. As medical  facilities undergo remodeling, it is important that stakeholders are  consulted in the design process to better ensure that new or remodeled  areas are both functional and safe. We found that such stakeholder  involvement on remodeling projects had not occurred at one of the  medical facilities we visited. At this medical facility, clinical and VA police  personnel were not consulted about a redesign project for the inpatient  mental health unit. The new unit initially included one nursing station that  did not prevent patient access if necessary. After the unit was reopened  following the renovation, there were a number of assaults, including an  incident where a veteran reached over the counter of the unit\u2019s nursing  station and physically assaulted a nurse by stabbing her in the neck,  shoulder, and leg with a pen. Had staff been consulted on the redesign of  this unit, their experience managing veterans in an inpatient mental health  unit environment would have been helpful in developing several safety  aspects of this new unit, including the design of the nursing station. Less  than a year after opening this unit, medical facility leadership called for a  review of the units\u2019 design following several reported incidents. As a result  of this review, the unit was split into two separate units with different  veteran populations, an additional nursing station was installed, and  changes were planned for the structure of both the original and newly  created nursing stations\u2014including the installation of a new shoulder- height plexiglass barricade on both nursing station counters.", "In conclusion, weaknesses exist in the reporting of sexual assault  incidents and in the implementation of physical precautions used to  prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents in VA medical facilities.  Medical facility staff are uncertain about what types of sexual assault  incidents should be reported to VHA leadership and VA law enforcement  officials and prevention and remediation efforts are eroded by failing to  tap the expertise of these officials. These officials can offer valuable  suggestions for preventing and mitigating future sexual assault incidents  and help address broader safety concerns through systemwide  improvements throughout the VA healthcare system. Leaving reporting  decisions to local VA medical facilities\u2014rather than relying on VHA  management and VA OIG officials to determine what types of incidents  should be reported based on the consistent application of known  criteria\u2014increases the risk that some sexual assault incidents may go  unreported. Moreover, uncertainty about sexual assault incident reporting  is compounded by VA not having: (1) established a consistent definition of  sexual assault, (2) set clear expectations for the types of sexual assault  incidents that should be reported to VISN and VHA Central Office  leadership officials, and (3) maintained proper oversight of sexual assault  incidents that occurred in VA medical facilities. Unless these three key  features are in place, VHA will not be able to ensure that all sexual assault  incidents will be consistently reported throughout the VA health care  system. Specifically, the absence of a centralized tracking system to  monitor sexual assault incidents across VA medical facilities may seriously  limit efforts to both prevent such incidents in the short and long term and  maintain a working knowledge of past incidents and efforts to address  them when staff transitions occur.", "In addition, ensuring that medical facilities maintain a safe and secure  environment for veterans and staff in residential programs and inpatient  mental health units is critical and requires commitment from all levels of  VA. Currently, the five VA medical facilities we visited are not adequately  monitoring surveillance camera systems, maintaining the integrity of alarm  systems, and ensuring an adequate police presence. Closer oversight by  both VISNs and VHA Central Office staff is needed to provide a safe and  secure environment throughout all VA medial facilities.", "To improve VA\u2019s reporting and monitoring of allegations of sexual assault,  we are making numerous recommendations\u2014in a report that we issued  last week. We recommended VA improve the reporting and monitoring of  sexual assault incidents, including ensuring that a consistent definition of  sexual assault is used for reporting purposes, clarifying expectations for  reporting incidents to VISN and VHA leadership, and developing and  implementing mechanisms for incident monitoring. To address  vulnerabilities in physical security precautions at VA medical facilities, we  recommended that VA ensure that alarm systems are regularly tested and  kept in working order and that coordination among stakeholders occurs  for renovations to units and physical security features at VA medical  facilities.", "In responding to a draft of the report on which this testimony is based, VA  generally agreed with the report\u2019s conclusions and concurred with our  recommendations. In addition, VA provided an action plan, which  described the creation of a multidisciplinary workgroup to manage the  agency\u2019s response to many of our recommendations. According to VA\u2019s  comments, this workgroup will provide the Under Secretary for Health  and his deputies with monthly verbal updates on its progress, as well as an  initial action plan by July 15, 2011, and a final report by September 30,  2011.", "Chairwoman Buerkle, Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
