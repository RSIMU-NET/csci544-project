For example, requiring collections to be annually appropriated before an agency can use the collections increases opportunities for congressional oversight on a regular basis. Conversely, if Congress grants an agency authority to use collections without further congressional action, the agency may be able to respond more quickly to customers or changing conditions.

Congress exercises its  constitutional power of the purse by appropriating funds and prescribing  conditions governing their use. As you know, through appropriations,  Congress provides agencies with budget authority to make financial  obligations for specified purposes. An appropriations act is the most  common means of providing appropriations; however, Congress may  provide appropriations through other laws as well.", "The federal government receives funds from a variety of sources during  the fiscal year, including tax revenues, federal fees, fines, penalties, and  settlements. Collections from fees, fines, penalties, and settlements fund  a wide variety of programs integral to our nation\u2019s security, to the security  of our financial system, and to the protection of our natural resources and  involve billions of dollars annually. For example, some user fees\u2014 including U.S. Postal Service charges for stamps and other fees,  Medicare premiums, and Tennessee Valley Authority proceeds from the  sale of energy\u2014exceed $1 billion in annual collections. Annual collections  of fines and penalties fluctuate. For example, the federal government  collected civil penalties paid in connection with the 2010 Deepwater  Horizon oil spill ranging from about $400 million in fiscal year 2013 to  about $160 million in fiscal year 2016.", "The design and structure\u2014and corresponding agency flexibility and  congressional control\u2014of statutory authorities for fees, fines, penalties,  and settlements can vary widely. In many cases, Congress has provided  agencies with permanent authority to collect and obligate for specific  purposes funds from sources such as fees, fines, and penalties without  further congressional action. Such authorities are part of a broader  category of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations  acts, which also includes contract and borrowing authorities, as well as  spending on entitlement programs such as Social Security. These  collections, known as \u201coffsetting collections\u201d are a form of appropriation  and are subject to the fiscal laws governing appropriated funds. Although  the laws authorizing permanent budget authority make them available for  obligation without further legislative action, it is not uncommon for annual  appropriation acts to include limitations on the obligations to be financed  by these collections. Given the nation\u2019s fiscal condition, it is critical that  every funding source and spending decision be carefully considered and  applied to its best use.", "Our testimony provides an overview of key design decisions and statutory  authorities and controls related to the availability of funds collected from  federal fees, fines, and penalties. In preparing this testimony, we relied on  our September 2013 and May 2008 reports on the design of federal user  fees and our February 2015 report on Department of Justice alternative  funding sources, and drew examples from other work on specific fees,  fines, and penalties that we issued between September 2005 and  November 2016. Detailed information about the scope and methodology  used to conduct this work can be found in each of the issued products.  We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government receives amounts from numerous sources in  addition to tax revenues, including user fees, fines, penalties, and  intragovernmental fees. Whether these collections are dedicated to a  particular purpose and available for agency use without further  appropriation depends on the type of collection and its specific authority.", "User fees: User fees are fees assessed to users for goods or services  provided by the federal government. They are an approach to  financing federal programs or activities that, in general, are related to  some voluntary transaction or request for government services above  and beyond what is normally available to the public. User fees are a  broad category of collections, whose boundaries are not clearly  defined. They encompass charges for goods and services provided  to the public, such as fees to enter a national park, as well as  regulatory user fees, such as fees charged by the Food and Drug  Administration for prescription drug applications. Unless Congress  has provided specific statutory authority for an agency to use (i.e.,  obligate and spend) fee collections, fees are deposited to the  Treasury as miscellaneous receipts and are generally not available to  the agency.", "Fines, penalties, and settlement proceeds: Criminal fines and penalty  payments are imposed by courts as punishment for criminal  violations. Civil monetary penalties are not a result of criminal  proceedings but are employed by courts and federal agencies to  enforce federal laws and regulations. Settlement proceeds result from  an agreement ending a dispute or lawsuit. As with user fees, unless  Congress has provided specific statutory authority for an agency to  use fines, penalties, and settlements, those collections are deposited  as miscellaneous receipts and are generally not available to the  agency.", "Intragovernmental fees are charged by one federal agency to another  for goods and services such as renting space in a building or  cybersecurity services. Unlike user fees, fines, and penalties, unless  Congress has specified otherwise, agencies generally have authority  to use intragovernmental fees without further appropriation.", "In 2013, we identified six key fee design decisions related to how fees are  set, used, and reviewed that, in the aggregate, enable Congress to  design fees that strike its desired balance between agency flexibility and  congressional control. Four of the six key design decisions relate to how  the fee collections are used and in 2015 we reported that they are  applicable to fines and penalties (see figure 1).", "Congress determines the availability of collections by defining the extent  to which an agency may use (i.e., obligate and spend) them, including the  availability of the funds, the period of time the collections are available for  obligation, the purposes for which they may be used, and the amount of  collections that are available to the agency.", "Availability. Congressional decisions about the use of a fee, fine, or  penalty will determine how the funds will be considered within the  context of all federal budgetary resources. Collections are classified  into 3 major categories: offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, or  governmental receipts. Funds classified as offsetting collections can  provide agencies with more flexibility because they are generally  available for agency obligation without further legislative action. In  contrast, offsetting receipts and governmental receipts offer greater  congressional control because, generally, additional congressional  action is needed before the collections are available for agency  obligation.", "Time. When Congress provides that an agency\u2019s collections are  available until they are expended, agencies have greater flexibility and  can carry over unobligated amounts to future fiscal years. This  enables agencies to align collections and costs over a longer time  period and to better prepare for, and adjust to, fluctuations in  collections and costs. Funds set aside or reserved can sustain  operations in the event of a sharp downturn in collections or increase  in costs. Carrying over unobligated balances from year to year, if an  agency has multi- or no-year collections, is one way agencies can  establish a reserve.", "Purpose. Congress sets limits on the activities or purposes for which  an agency may use collections. Congress has granted some agencies  broad authority to use some of their collections for any program  purpose, but has limited the use of other collections to specific sets of  activities. Narrower restrictions may benefit stakeholders and increase  congressional control. On the other hand, statutes that too narrowly  limit how collections can be used reduce both Congress\u2019s flexibility to  make resource decisions and an agency\u2019s flexibility to reallocate  resources. This can make it more difficult to pursue public policy goals  or respond to changing program needs, such as when the activities  intended to achieve the purposes of the related program change.", "Amount. Congress determines the specific level of budget authority  provided for a program\u2019s activities by limiting the amount of collections  that can be collected or used by the agency; however, these limits can  also pose challenges for the agency. For example, when a fee-funded  agency is not authorized to retain or use all of its fee collections and  no other funding sources are provided, the agency may not have the  funds available to produce the goods or services that it has promised  or that it is required to provide by law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Design Options Related to Agency\u2019s Access to and Use of Its Collections", "paragraphs": ["Our design guides can help Congress consider the implications and  tradeoffs of various design alternatives. One key design element is  whether the funds will be (1) deposited to the Treasury as miscellaneous  receipts for general support of federal government activities, (2) dedicated  to the related program with availability subject to further appropriation, (3)  dedicated to the related program and available without further  congressional action, or (4) available based on a combination of these  authorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Collections Deposited to the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts", "paragraphs": ["Some authorities to collect fees, fines and penalties specify that the funds  will be deposited to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. These funds  are not dedicated to the agency or program under which they were  collected; they are used for the general support of federal government  activities. For example,", "Penalties from financial institutions: Civil monetary penalty payments  collected from financial institutions by certain financial regulators,  including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are deposited to the Treasury  as miscellaneous receipts. In March 2016, we reported that, from  January 2009 through December 2015, financial regulators and  components within the Department of the Treasury deposited $2.7  billion to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts from enforcement  actions assessed against financial institutions for violations related to  anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, and U.S. sanctions programs  requirements.", "Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Application Fees: The  FCC regulates interstate and international communications by radio,  television, wire, satellite, and cable, and telecommunications services  for all people of the United States. FCC collects application fees from  companies for activities such as license applications, renewals, or  requests for modification. As we reported in September 2013, these  fees are deposited to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dedicated Collections with Availability Subject to Further Appropriation", "paragraphs": ["Some fees, fines, and penalties cannot be used by an agency without  being further appropriated to the agency. For example,", "Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) Merchandise Processing  Fee: Importers of cargo pay a fee to offset the costs of \u201ccustoms  revenue functions\u201d as defined in statute, and the automation of  customs systems. CBP deposits merchandise processing fees as  offsetting receipts to the Customs User Fee Account, with availability  subject to appropriation. In July 2016, we reported that in fiscal year  2014 merchandise processing fee collections totaled approximately  $2.3 billion.", "Requiring an appropriation to make the funds available to an agency  increases opportunities for congressional oversight on a regular basis.  When the amount of collections exceeds the amount of the appropriation,  however, unobligated collection balances that are not available to the  agency may accumulate. For example,", "Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Fees: When SEC collects  more in Section 31 fees than its annual appropriation, the excess  collections are not available for obligation without additional  congressional action. In September 2015, we reported that at the  end of fiscal year 2014, the SEC had a $6.6 billion unavailable  balance in its Salaries and Expenses account because the fee  collections exceeded appropriations.", "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Motor Vehicle and Engine  Compliance Program (MVECP) Fees: MVECP fee collections are  deposited into EPA\u2019s Environmental Services Special Fund. As we  reported in September 2015, according to officials, Congress had not  appropriated money to EPA from this fund for MVECP purposes.  EPA instead received annual appropriations which may be used for  MVECP purposes. As a result, the unavailable balance of this fund  steadily increased and totaled about $370 million at the end of fiscal  year 2014.", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Harbor Maintenance Fee: The  authorizing legislation generally designates that the purpose for the  fee collections is harbor maintenance activities but, as we reported in  February 2008, fee collections have substantially exceeded spending  on harbor maintenance. In July 2016, we reported that the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund had a balance of over $8 billion at the end of  fiscal year 2014.", "U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Fees: In September  2013, we reported that in some years Congress chose not to make  available to USPTO the full amount of its collections which, according  to USPTO officials, contributed to USPTO\u2019s inability to hire sufficient  examiners to keep up with USPTO\u2019s workload and invest in  technology systems needed to modernize the USPTO. According to  USPTO officials, patent fee collections can only be used for patent  processes, and trademark fee collections can only be used for  trademark processes, as well as to cover each processes\u2019  proportionate share of the administrative costs of the agency. USPTO  officials stated that patent and trademark customers are typically two  distinct groups and this division helps to assure stakeholders that their  fees are supporting the activities that affect them directly.", "Some programs include mechanisms to link the amount of collections  with the amount of collections appropriated to the program, over time. For  example,", "Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Prescription Drug User Fees: If  FDA prescription drug user fee collections are higher than the amount  of the collections appropriated for the fiscal year, FDA must adjust fee  rates in a subsequent year to reduce its anticipated fee collections by  the excess amount. In March 2012, we reported that in fiscal year  2010, Prescription Drug User Fee Act user fees collected by FDA\u2014 including application, establishment, and product fees\u2014totaled more  than $529 million, including over $172 million in application fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dedicated Collections Available without Further Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["Legislation authorizing a fee, fine, or penalty may give the agency  authority to use collections without additional congressional action.

APHIS is  authorized to set and collect user fees sufficient to cover the cost of  providing and administering AQI services in connection with the arrival  of commercial vessels, trucks, railcars, and aircraft, and international  passengers. AQI fee collections are available without fiscal year  limitation and may be used for any AQI-related purpose without  further appropriation. In March 2013, we reported that in fiscal year  2012, AQI fee collections totaled about $548 million.", "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund Settlements:  Under the Superfund program, EPA has the authority to clean up  hazardous waste sites and then seek reimbursement from potentially  responsible parties. EPA is authorized to retain and use funds  received from certain types of settlements with these parties in  interest-earning, site-specific special accounts within the Hazardous  Substance Superfund Trust Fund. EPA generally uses these funds for  future cleanup actions at the sites associated with a specific  settlement or to reimburse appropriated funds that EPA had  previously used for response activities at these sites. In January 2012,  we reported that as of October 2010 EPA held nearly $1.8 billion in  unobligated funds in 947 open special accounts for 769 Superfund  sites.", "Tennessee Valley Authority Collections (TVA): The TVA, the nation\u2019s  largest public power provider, has authority to use payments it  receives from selling power to the public without further appropriation.

Some agencies are  fully supported by intragovernmental fees; for others, intragovernmental  fees are one of their sources of funds.", "Federal Protective Service (FPS) Fees: The FPS is a fully fee-funded  organization authorized to charge customer agencies fees for security  services at federal facilities and to use those offsetting collections for  all agency operations. In July 2016, we reported that, at the end of  fiscal year 2014, FPS had an unobligated balance of approximately  $193 million and that FPS had not established targets to determine  the extent to which that balance was appropriate to fund its  operations.", "Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Franchise Fund Customer  Fees: FAA\u2019s Administrative Services Franchise Fund provides goods  and services\u2014including training and specialized aircraft  maintenance\u2014to customer agencies on a fee-for-service basis.", "National Park Service Fees (NPS): NPS collections include  intragovernmental fees, as well as user fees and appropriations.

The House Report to the fiscal year 2008 Department  of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, H.R. 2638, directed USCIS  to allocate all premium-processing fee collections to information  technology and business-systems transformation. In January 2009,  we reported that, consistent with this directive, USCIS\u2019s 2007 fee  review stated that the agency intended to use all premium processing  collections to fund infrastructure improvements to transform USCIS\u2019s  paper-based data systems into a modern, digital processing  resource. In July 2016, we reported that USCIS estimated that the  unobligated carryover balance for the premium processing fee could  grow to $1.1 billion by fiscal year 2020, as fee collections are  expected to exceed Transformation initiative funding requirements in  fiscal years 2015 through 2020.", "Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Crime Victims Fund (CVF) Fines and  Penalties: Criminal fines and penalties collected from offenders,  among other sources, are deposited in the CVF and can be used  without further appropriation to fund victims\u2019 assistance programs and  directly compensate crime victims.

The relevant authorities designate a  portion of the grazing fees collected by the BLM for range  improvement, a portion to states, and a portion to be deposited to the  Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. For example, in September  2005, we reported that in fiscal year 2004 the BLM collected about  $11.8 million in grazing fees, half of which was deposited to a special  fund receipt account in the Treasury for range rehabilitation,  protection, and improvements. Of the other half of the collections,  about $2.2 million was distributed to states and counties and about  $3.7 million was deposited to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.", "Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Mutual  Mortgage Insurance Fund Settlement: HUD\u2019s Mutual Mortgage  Insurance Fund receives payments resulting from violations related to  single-family programs. The primary purpose of the Mutual Mortgage  Insurance Fund is to pay lenders in cases where borrowers default on  their loan and the lender makes a claim for mortgage insurance  benefits. In November 2016, we reported on a case involving False  Claims Act violations and loans backed by HUD\u2019s Federal Housing  Administration (FHA) in which a portion of the settlement was paid to  the company that filed a complaint in regard to the False Claims Act  on behalf of the government.
