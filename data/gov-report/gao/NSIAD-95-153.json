Given the high priority DOD places on combat identification, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) proposed an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) funding line for the CAI effort to (1) pursue the planned course of development or (2) alternatively use an advanced concepts and technology demonstration (ACTD) to accelerate it.", "OSD decided not to proceed with the Program Objective Memorandum proposed strategy. Instead, OSD adopted the position that the existing  Mark XII system satisfies the services\u2019 current air-to-air and ground-to-air cooperative IFF Q&A system requirements. Its current strategy is an evolutionary upgrade of Mark XII equipment to provide improved reliability and maintainability and greater upgradeability, while over the next couple of years defining, under a continued Navy-led effort, in coordination with our allies, what a Mark XII follow-on wave form might look like. The upgradeability of the new Mark XII system would allow for the addition of Mode S capability and implementation of the Mark XII follow-on wave form, should the services later decide that the current wave form no longer satisfies their requirements.", "If the Program Objective Memorandum proposal had been adopted, it would have alleviated any risk of delay in Mark XII efforts due to low prioritization.

The Navy\u2019s initial time lead in development resulted in the Navy and Army programs being unsynchronized. The current delays in defining a Mark XII follow-on wave form, however, provides an opportunity for a jointly managed effort. The original Navy time lead is what led to (1) the Navy\u2019s uncertainty about likely mid- and long-term ground identification systems and (2) the Navy\u2019s inability to consider in its COEA the equipment necessary to obtain interoperability with those ground identification systems. Schedule changes in separate efforts could again result in difficulties obtaining full consideration of interoperability issues. Separate service efforts risk delays in the development and fielding of cooperative IFF Q&A systems due to time and resource expenditures to obtain \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d interoperability, if required.

Since the Army has not yet made a procurement decision for the near-term BCIS, the expenditure of $15.2 million to acquire 70 systems beyond the 70 necessary to accomplish the goals for the demonstration risks millions of dollars on a system that may never be fielded. If the Army can accomplish its goals for the demonstration with 70 systems, as Army officials have repeatedly informed us, then only 70 systems are needed. Furthermore, the Army did not produce and does not have an analysis to support a requirement to demonstrate 140 BCIS units.

Such a determination should be possible once the BCI COEA is completed.

We appreciate that DOD shares our concern that the requirements for aircraft and battlefield identification should not be addressed in isolation. While this was one of the reasons the Combat Identification Task Force was formed, and we believe the task force\u2019s efforts were a step in the right direction, we do not believe the task force adequately addressed our concerns regarding the cohesiveness of the structures and plans created to manage the services\u2019 aircraft and battlefield cooperative identification efforts. 2. The management actions discussed represent a continuation of the stovepipe management of the ground and air identification efforts discussed in our report. The Army-led development of a cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA) for battlefield identification separate from the Navy-led similar analyses planned to help define what a new air identification wave form might look like perpetuates the stovepipe development scheme identified in our report. 3. As explained in our report, we focussed our evaluation on the services\u2019 cooperative identification of friend or foe (IFF) question and answer (Q&A) system efforts because the services are approaching major decision points in the acquisition process for those systems. To address DOD\u2019s concern, we have added information to the body of our report indicating that the services\u2019 cooperative IFF Q&A system development efforts are a part of a much broader array of efforts that should help minimize friendly fire incidents. 4. At the time our draft report was written, we were aware of the task force\u2019s efforts. We determined that while those efforts may have been motivated by many of the same concerns expressed in our report, it did not appear that the task force was going to address the issues related to our findings. Based on more recent briefings on the task force\u2019s outcome, it still does not appear that those issues were addressed. Specifically, based on the information we have received in briefings on the task force\u2019s efforts, the task force\u2019s final product will not (1) address needed management changes to provide needed cohesiveness in the services\u2019 cooperative identification development efforts; (2) dictate a joint, single COEA for those efforts; and (3) address the Army\u2019s plan to acquire more near-term systems than are needed to reach a production decision. 5. While the task force has developed an overall architectural framework for combat identification, it does not appear to provide the management structure needed to assure a cohesive effort to attain the architecture\u2019s goals. The architecture provides direction to the services. However, in the past, DOD has provided direction that was subsequently ignored. For example, as noted in our report, while DOD has placed a high priority on combat identification efforts, the Navy did not place a high priority on the Cooperative Aircraft Identification (CAI) effort and underfunded it. 6. The management and funding arrangements being established do not adequately address our concerns. The joint advanced concepts technology demonstration and advanced technology demonstrations planned are to demonstrate candidate battlefield identification systems, that is, ground-to-ground and air-to-ground solutions. The planned demonstrations are to focus on battlefield identification solutions, not on battlefield and aircraft identification solutions and their interoperability. Furthermore, the planned demonstrations will not address the underlying management structure\u2019s division of responsibility between the Navy and the Army and the risks that are associated with that division. The continued use of the current management plan and structure with its division of responsibility between the Army and the Navy still risks the selection of suboptimal solutions, unnecessary program delays, and the acquisition of systems that may not be interoperable across the services. 7. The Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s (OSD) role as the top level manager of these demonstrations and the funding of these demonstrations under an OSD line do not adequately address our concerns regarding the cohesiveness of the Army\u2019s and the Navy\u2019s efforts and the need for truly joint management. Under the current DOD plan, that is, the joint demonstrations, the Army and the Navy will continue to manage and fund separate developmental efforts for their respective areas of responsibility. Continued use of separate funding lines for those efforts will continue to pose interoperability risks and risks to the timely accomplishment of the most cost and operationally effective solutions. 8. While the evolutionary nature of the upgrade process and the reliance on commercial technology may or may not make centralized funding desirable, the DOD\u2019s adopted strategy includes working with U.S. allies to define what a new wave form might look like. The services\u2019 new wave form definition efforts will be a joint effort under a Navy lead, just as the Navy\u2019s original CAI effort was. We maintain our position that funding the services\u2019 new aircraft wave form definition and ground identification efforts under a single funding line would help ensure coordinated aircraft and ground cooperative IFF Q&A systems\u2019 development. 9. As we indicated in our report, while the Army and the Navy have worked to coordinate their efforts, the current management structure and plan perpetuate the stovepipe development of cooperative IFF Q&A systems. As noted in our report, in commenting on an earlier draft of the management plan for the cooperative IFF Q&A development efforts, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition stated \u201c. . . I am concerned that the \u2019stovepipe\u2019 management scheme shown . . . will not enable possible equipment interoperability and commonality to be realized between aircraft and battlefield systems.\u201d The General Officers\u2019 Steering Committee on Combat Identification, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, and the Joint Combat Identification Office were all defined in the draft and final management plans. Despite these coordinating bodies, we agree with the Under Secretary\u2019s assessment and believe the current management structure continues to perpetuate that stovepipe management scheme. 10. We have added information on the role of the General Officers\u2019 Steering Committee on Combat Identification to our report. 11. A prioritized list of identification initiatives with service funding commitments did not prevent the Navy from placing a lower priority on its CAI effort than DOD placed. As we note in our report, while DOD has made development of combat identification systems a high priority, the Navy, through its funding process did not make the CAI effort a high priority. Again, a single OSD funding line for both the Navy\u2019s new wave form and the Army\u2019s battlefield combat identification system (BCIS) efforts would help ensure coordinated aircraft and ground cooperative IFF Q&A systems development efforts and appropriate funding given DOD\u2019s prioritization of those efforts. 12. While DOD\u2019s adopted Mark XII upgrade strategy has superseded the Navy-led COEA, the continued research and development of air and ground systems without performing a joint COEA still risks the selection and development of systems that may not represent the most cost and operationally effective solutions. DOD\u2019s adopted strategy for upgrading the Mark XII includes working with U.S. allies to define what a follow-on  Mark XII wave form might look like. In providing oral comments on a draft of this report, agency officials indicated that the new wave form air identification effort would include cost and operational effectiveness type analyses. Those analyses should be done as a part of a joint aircraft and ground identification COEA to ensure that the most cost and operationally effective ground and air solutions are selected giving due consideration to the interoperability issue.", "We recognize that commonality between air and ground identification systems may or may not be attainable or desirable from a cost and operational effectiveness standpoint. In fact, a joint COEA may support the use of different technologies for air and ground systems. The performance of a joint COEA, however, will not only help ensure the consideration of technological commonality between air and ground solutions but also the cost and operational effectiveness of solutions to provide interoperability between differing air and ground solutions. Because the Navy-led joint service new wave form air identification effort is to develop cost and operational effectiveness type analyses and the Army-led joint service ground identification effort is developing a formal COEA, it appears that minimal adjustment would be required to combine the two efforts to obtain a joint COEA ensuring due consideration of the interoperability issue. In addition, the final product of a joint COEA would present a service-wide, unified vision of the air and ground solution(s) to be pursued and the means, if determined attainable and desirable, by which air and ground interoperability will be obtained. 13. DOD\u2019s comment indicates that 70 systems are adequate for conducting the demonstration if 140 systems are not available. Since the Army has yet to determine whether it will procure the near-term BCIS, the expenditure of $15.2 million to acquire 70 systems beyond the 70 systems necessary to accomplish the goals for the demonstration risks millions of dollars on a system that may never be fielded. 14. At issue here is not whether the demonstration of more systems will have value, but rather the value of what is gained against the cost and the risk that the Army may never procure and field the BCIS. The Army did not produce and does not have an analysis to support a requirement to demonstrate 140 BCIS units. If the Army can accomplish its goals for the demonstration with 70 systems, as Army officials have repeatedly informed us, then only 70 systems are needed. There is no debating that more units will provide more operational experience and data. This, however, should not be the basis for acquiring more systems than are needed to accomplish the goals of the demonstration. \u201cBelieve it is imperative that during Force XXI we not only evaluate how well BCIS works but the total impact BCIS has on the way we operate. Platforms are currently prioritized to give us the ability to look at this total impact even if we don\u2019t get the entire 140 systems we are currently planning for.\u201d", "19. We have clarified our recommendation in view of DOD\u2019s comments. We believe that the acquisition of near-term systems should be limited to the minimum quantity required to complete any testing needed to make a production decision. Furthermore, the Army should not be allowed to acquire more near-term systems than that limit until a COEA based determination has been made that the near-term system, if deemed desirable, can be integrated, that is, made interoperable, with the mid- and long-term combat identification and aircraft solutions. 20. We recognize that commonality between air and ground identification systems may or may not be attainable or desirable from a cost and operational effectiveness standpoint, just as interoperability of differing air and ground systems may not be determined attainable or desirable. Nothing in our report dictates commonality. It does, however, argue that a joint COEA should be completed to assess this issue before moving forward. 21. As we pointed out in our response to DOD in our prior report, our recommendation will not prevent the Army\u2019s acquisition of the near-term system and will not require the Army to wait until long-term systems are fielded. As stated in our prior report, we believe it would be prudent for the Army to make its production decision for the near-term system taking into consideration its decision for its mid- and long-term solution(s). Such a determination should be possible once the BCI COEA is completed. Since that COEA is currently scheduled to be completed in fiscal year 1997 and the BCIS production decision is not scheduled to occur until late fiscal  year 1997 or early fiscal year 1998, our recommendation would not delay the fielding of the near-term system. Our current recommendation extends the recommendation in our prior report to include a determination on interoperability with the new air identification wave form being defined.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
