LCS is intended to operate with a crew that is smaller than  comparable surface combatants.

This number was augmented by civilian contractor  technical experts who could assist with troubleshooting and some  maintenance. However, as shown in table 3, even with these additional  people the deployment provided indications that the crew strained to keep  up with duties. Further, the ship is currently at capacity in terms of the  number of crew members it can accommodate. Therefore, any increase  in crew size would require a significant redesign of the seaframes and  would necessitate a revision to the maximum 50-person manning  requirement, which has been validated by the Joint Requirements  Oversight Council. Officials from the office of the Chief of Naval  Operations told us after the deployment that they are not considering any  further revision to the manning requirements for the ship, although some  manning studies are under way to assess the rank and billet structure for  the mission packages and aviation detachment.", "Additionally, some of USS Freedom\u2019s equipment is unique to that ship,  unique to the Freedom variant, or unique to LCS class, which we were  told made some repair efforts cumbersome and slow. For example, crew  members told us that in some cases they had to track down spare parts  that were sometimes available only in foreign countries rather than being  able to find them in Navy inventories. While some of this may be a first-of- class issue, replacement of some ship systems with more reliable ones or  with systems that are more commonly found in the Navy inventory may  also reduce these burdens on the crew in the future. According to the  LCS program office, replacing these less reliable systems should mean  that future deployments of other ships from the Freedom class should not  incur the same number of failures as USS Freedom.

According to Navy  officials, preliminary studies on the habitability changes should be  completed this year, and more detailed design work will not occur until  fiscal year 2015. The Navy has established a weight working group with  Navy and shipyard representatives that program officials said is intended  to try and identify ways to offset weight growth from some of these design  changes.", "Additionally, once a ship is delivered and handed over to the fleet, fleet  operators and maintainers assume responsibility for these weight  management processes, which continue throughout the ship\u2019s service life.  For ships that are weight constrained\u2014meaning, at or nearing their naval  architectural limits for displacement\u2014these weight management  processes are typically more robust and costly. For instance, a Navy  instruction states that weight must be kept within naval architectural limits  and provides that for ships that are weight constrained, any additional  weight must be compensated for by removing weight from the ship.  Inclining experiments must usually be completed following maintenance  periods to ensure the ship\u2019s naval architectural limits remain unbreached.

However, weight  challenges exist on the mission packages as well, and weight and space  constraints are limiting the extent to which the Navy can accommodate  new mission package systems. Similar to the seaframes, the Navy also  tracks and manages mission package weights. Mission packages  (regardless of which type) are required to consume no more than 180  metric tons when installed aboard a seaframe. Of this 180-metric-ton  allocation, 105 metric tons are allotted to the actual mission package  equipment, whereas 75 metric tons are reserved for fuel to power that  equipment. However, LCS requirements documents do not include a  service life allowance requirement for mission packages, and based on  current weight estimates, room for future growth on the final increments  ranges from approximately 14 metric tons for some configurations of the  MCM mission package to none for the ASW mission package. According  to Navy officials, future additions to mission packages\u2014beyond the  systems currently planned for increment 4 configurations\u2014will be offset  by removing existing systems, described below, to the extent required to  meet the 105 metric ton weight limitation. For MCM, Navy officials stated  that they cannot include all the current increment 4 systems that they are  buying in a package at one time, so they have recently developed two  options with different system configurations. Figure 3 highlights current  mission package weights that are estimated for each increment of  mission package capability, including the two MCM options but excluding  potential weight reduction efforts.", "At present, the Navy anticipates that the equipment associated with an  increment 4 SUW package will require slightly less than the 105-metric- ton allotment. This estimate is contingent on surface-to-surface missile  systems not yet selected delivering within the assigned weight margins.", "The Navy has identified a weight reduction plan to provide an additional 5  metric tons.", "Navy weight estimates for increment 4 of the MCM mission package,  however, do not reflect all the systems being acquired for that package.  Space and weight constraints have required the Navy to modify how it  intends to outfit increment 4 of the MCM mission package. Although the  Navy plans to acquire all the systems planned for that increment, space  and weight limitations will not allow LCS seaframes to carry all of these  systems at one time. According to LCS program officials, MCM mission  commanders will have either (1) the Unmanned Influence Sweep System  and the unmanned surface vehicle that tows it, or (2) the minehunting  Surface Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Undersea Vehicle\u2014called  Knifefish\u2014available\u2014but not both systems. As a result, LCS seaframes  outfitted with the increment 4 MCM package may have decreased  minesweeping or mine detection capability. These scenarios would  preclude LCS from meeting its MCM minesweeping performance  requirements; Knifefish is a new capability that was recently added to the  program, and officials from the mission module program office stated that  it is not a capability currently defined in LCS requirements documentation.  The Navy has identified some options for weight reduction for this  package that could bring the combined weight with these two systems  included together to just under 105 metric tons, but physical space  constraints would still prohibit both being carried together.", "Further, ASW mission package equipment is also estimated to exceed its  105-metric-ton allotment by approximately 4 metric tons. In response, the  Navy has identified weight reduction options within that package that it  estimates will shed a combined 10 metric tons of weight. Several of these  options require redesign of existing systems, which could introduce risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deficiencies in Contractor Reports Have Hindered Navy Oversight of LCS Weight Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has faced challenges obtaining accurate and complete weight  estimates from the contractors. The Navy\u2019s primary mechanism for  tracking seaframe weights are quarterly weight reports, which are  produced and delivered by each of the LCS prime contractors per  contract requirements. These reports provide data on the physical  characteristics of seaframes under construction, including the magnitude,  location, and distribution of weight within each ship. These data are  based on estimated and calculated weights derived from design  drawings, historical data, and vendor-furnished information, and are  updated with actual component weight information during construction by  the shipbuilder. Under the terms of their contracts, LCS prime contractors  are required to prepare and report data within weight reports in  accordance with Navy and industry recommended practices, which  include using the Navy\u2019s Expanded Ship Work Breakdown Structure  (ESWBS) classification system to structure and summarize data.  ESWBS facilitates the grouping of materials, equipment, and ship  components in a consistent reporting format, which in turn positions Navy  reviewers to audit the contractors\u2019 work. At their highest level, ESWBS  groupings are organized around major systems of the ship, such as the  hull structure and propulsion plant, but ESWBS groupings are broken  down to include individual components of these respective systems, such  as diesel engines.", "An inclining experiment is important as it represents the point where  weight data transitions from estimated or calculated data into actual data.  According to Navy officials, when the weight of a ship is determined at an  inclining experiment, the weight totals should be very close to those  identified in the preceding weight reports. Acceptable deviation is  considered to be only 0.5 percent or less, according to Navy technical  experts. In the LCS program, however, inclining experiments for the first  two seaframes revealed weight growth that the prime contractors had not  fully accounted for within their weight reports. For example, the LCS 1  inclining experiment that followed that ship\u2019s initial post-delivery work  periods revealed that the ship weighed approximately 90 metric tons  more than expected. However, it was unclear to the prime contractor  where this excess weight was located or how it was distributed within the  ship, though Navy program officials told us that they now believe it was  due largely to additional insulation and paint. In response, Lockheed  Martin increased its weight estimates for LCS 3 and worked with the Navy  to evaluate and resolve the 90 metric ton discrepancy. As part of these  analyses, Lockheed Martin was able to assign much of the weight growth  to individual ESWBS accounts, and subsequently inclined LCS 3 to within  1 percent of that ship\u2019s revised weight estimate. However, full resolution  of the 90 metric tons weight discrepancy remains incomplete. Weight  reports for LCS 5 and follow-on ships identified over 23 metric tons of  weight that Lockheed Martin and the Navy have not yet identified as  belonging within specific ESWBS accounts. Similar to LCS 1, LCS 2\u2019s  inclining revealed an approximately 5 percent deviation from expected  weight, and General Dynamics\u2019 Bath Iron Works and Austal USA have  over 13 metric tons of weight, outside of the ESWBS accounts, on later  Independence variant seaframes. Carrying forward excess weight can  have impacts on the ships over the course of their service lives, and may  have impacts on construction of follow-on seaframes. In order to remedy  persisting deficiencies in the weight reports, Navy officials stated that the  administrative contracting officer\u2014responsible for ensuring that the  contractor is fulfilling the contract under the specified terms, including  price, schedule, and quality\u2014could withhold a percentage of progress  payments. To date, however, Navy officials report that they have not  pursued such withholds in the LCS program.", "As part of the terms of the block buy contracts for LCS seaframes, the  Navy is required to review and comment on weight reports within 60 days  after they are submitted by a prime contractor. During the past 2 years,  the Navy has, in several cases, provided detailed comments back to the  contractors on weight reports that it identified as deficient. Comments  back to the prime contractors identified fundamental classification and  estimating errors and the use of outdated weight information, among  other reporting deficiencies, which the Navy judged as time sensitive and  critically important to address (see appendix II, which contains excerpts  from Navy comments on contractor weight reports). The Navy often  requested LCS prime contractors to modify and resubmit the report within  30 days\u2014consistent with the terms of the contracts.", "However, the prime contractors have not addressed the Navy\u2019s  comments and resubmitted weight reports, largely because the Navy\u2019s  review is typically taking longer than 60 days. One contractor stated that  the Navy\u2019s review took 6 to 12 months. According to Navy officials,  reviews of weight reports now take less than 6 months. Nevertheless, by  the time that the Navy\u2019s comments for one particular report are submitted  to the contractor, the contractor has often already submitted the next  quarter\u2019s weight report. As a result, LCS contractors stated to us that they  generally do not make revisions to the previously submitted reports. Thus,  issues raised in the Navy\u2019s comments are not immediately addressed by  the contractors. These revisions can affect weight estimates, but cannot  be identified until a corrected weight report has been submitted. As a  result, serious issues within weight reports persist that could obscure  timely identification of negative weight trends within one or both seaframe  variants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risk of LCS Concurrency Remains\u2014with Mission Package Procurement Exceeding Levels Needed for Operational Testing", "paragraphs": ["As we previously reported, the Navy\u2019s acquisition approach to the LCS  program involves a significant degree of concurrency; that is, the Navy is  buying the ships while key concepts and performance are still being  tested. Since we issued our report in July 2013, the Navy received  approval from DOT&E for the LCS test and evaluation master plan  (TEMP), which sets forth the testing that must be completed to ensure  that the program meets requirements. In order to determine the degree to  which the information from test events would be available to inform the  Navy\u2019s decision to purchase additional seaframes, we compared the  Navy\u2019s current acquisition strategy\u2014which calls for releasing a request  for proposals in 2015 in support of a planned 2016 award of future  seaframe contracts\u2014with the program\u2019s test schedule as outlined in the  most recent TEMP. Figure 4 illustrates the test events that will be  completed before and after these acquisition events.", "As shown in figure 4, we found that a number of significant test events as  outlined in the TEMP will not be completed in time to inform the  development or release of a request for proposals or the award of follow- on contract(s), or they will be completed on one variant but not both.  Many of these test events are part of operational testing. Operational  testing includes live-fire testing, which provides timely assessment of the  survivability and lethality of a weapon system. The significance of  conducting operational testing is reflected by the fact that statute requires  a program to complete realistic survivability tests and initial operational  testing before starting full rate production. The Navy plans to continue  buying seaframes before completing operational test events that  demonstrate the capability of the seaframes, that is, equipped with  mission packages that can meet initial requirements. Other tests  highlighted in the figure include shock and survivability tests, which  demonstrate that the ship designs can safely absorb and control damage.  Realistic survivability tests are required by statute before a program  proceeds beyond low-rate initial production.", "Moreover, based on current test plans, DOT&E has concerns about the  adequacy and nature of some tests, which led to lengthy revisions of  earlier versions of the TEMP. Due to these concerns, DOT&E issued a  conditional approval letter stating that the test plan was not adequate to  support later phases of operational testing, and that the out-years of the  program are still not well defined. Final performance requirements are  defined in the program\u2019s capabilities development document, and last  year the Navy developed requirements for increment 2 SUW and  increment 1 MCM to support testing. However, no requirements currently  exist for the other increments. DOT&E granted the Navy approval to  move to the operational testing of increment 2 SUW and increment 1  MCM as described in the TEMP, which the Navy plans to begin in 2014  and 2015, respectively, but DOT&E required the Navy to update and  resubmit the TEMP to support testing for later increments. As such, the  above schedule may change with subsequent TEMP submissions.", "To help mitigate the concurrency in the LCS program\u2014in particular to  better align planned contractual actions with obtaining knowledge through  some of these test events\u2014we recommended in July 2013 that the Navy  reassess its acquisition strategy. Specifically, we recommended that the  Department of Defense (DOD) limit future seaframe acquisitions until it  completed a full-rate production review. We also recommended that DOD  report to Congress on the relative advantages of each seaframe variant  for each key LCS mission prior to awarding any additional seaframe  contracts. In its written response, DOD did not agree with our  recommendations aimed at slowing the pace of seaframe procurements.  DOD cited the need to buy ships at the planned pace to keep pricing low  and saw no value in reducing production pending the full-rate production  decision. DOD agreed that the Navy could, if requested by Congress,  report on the performance of each seaframe variant against current LCS  requirements, but did not address the need to provide an assessment of  the relative costs and advantages and disadvantages of the variants  against operational and mission needs.

We  also recommended in July 2013 that the Navy only buy the minimum  quantities of mission module systems required to support operational  testing. DOD did not agree with this recommendation, stating that mission  package procurements were at a rate necessary to: support (1)  developmental and operational testing of the two seaframe variants with  each mission module increment; (2) fleet training needs; and (3)  operational LCS ships. In its memorandum on the Navy\u2019s Remote  Minehunting System (RMS) operational assessment and Milestone C  decision, DOT&E raised similar concerns, stating for example that the  Navy should strictly limit any production of RMS, including the Remote  Multi-mission Vehicle (RMMV), until greater system maturity and reliability  are demonstrated on the version of RMS that will be initially fielded.", "We also recommended in July 2013 that the Navy ensure that the  program baseline submitted for the mission modules\u2019 Milestone B  establish program goals for cost, schedule, and performance for each  mission module increment.

Completing further developmental and  operational test events will continue to provide the Navy will valuable data  with which it can evaluate the performance of systems and make  adjustments, as needed. The Navy still has a great deal of learning to do  about the ships, the integrated capability that they are intended to provide  when equipped with the mission packages, and how the overall LCS  concept will be implemented. Not having adequate knowledge\u2014such as  the results of additional deployments and key operational test events\u2014  may result in the Navy buying ships that are more costly or burdensome  to manage over the course of their service lives. Events such as rough  water trials, shock and total ship survivability trials are intended to provide  confidence that the ships will last their intended lifespan and are  survivable, while deployments and operational testing of initial mission  packages help provide confidence that the LCS will meet its performance  requirements. Moving forward without this information complicates  potential design changes to seaframes or mission packages.", "As we have concluded in past work, the Navy\u2019s continued approach of  procuring the ships before proving their capabilities through testing  increases the risks of costly retrofits or reduced performance.

DOD officials stated that  creating a break in the production of the seaframes would increase  program costs and have significant industrial base considerations. We are  not advocating a production break, but we do believe it is conceivable that  subsequent seaframe unit cost increases could be lower than the  potential increases in overall program costs if testing uncovered the need  for costly retrofits, redesign, and/or requirements changes that would then  have to be made to ships in production. We chose to use the release of  the RFP as a decision point because we believe that drafting an RFP that  is based on key knowledge of LCS performance serves as an important  risk mitigation tool for the government. Specifically, if the government  goes forward with an RFP that is not fully informed by the results of the  important test activities we identified in our recommendation, any  changes that might be later identified as necessary would have to be  reflected in an amended RFP, which could delay the award of contracts  and potentially cause a production break. The department noted that a  Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) review is planned in the fiscal year  2016 time frame and that the Board will approve the Navy\u2019s acquisition  strategy for LCS before additional seaframe contracts are awarded. DOD  stated that this review will take into account the progress of testing for  both seaframes, and that every item we identified in our recommendation  will be completed prior to the DAB except for the completion of the full-  scale ship shock trials. We believe it will be important that the department  makes certain that the DAB review occurs at a point when the Navy can  be directed to pause and revise its acquisition strategy and the RFP for  LCS if necessary to ensure it reflects the most current knowledge gained  from testing and deployments. It is possible that continued testing could  inform changes to the numbers of each variant procured, changes that  would need to be incorporated into the acquisition strategy before the  DAB authorizes the Navy to continue to buy more seaframes.", "Further, we continue to believe that the Navy needs to identify a means to  conduct a full-scale ship shock trial before committing to contracts for  further seaframes.
