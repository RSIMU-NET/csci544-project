EAS allows state and local officials limited ability to produce public alerts via television and radio. Weaknesses with EAS include lack of reliability of the message distribution system; gaps in coverage; insufficient testing; and inadequate training of personnel. Further, EAS provides little capability to alert specific geographic areas. EAS does not ensure message delivery for individuals with hearing and vision disabilities, and non-English speakers. FEMA has projects under way to address some of these weaknesses with EAS. However, to date, little progress has been made and EAS remains largely unchanged since GAO's previous review, completed in March 2007. As a result, EAS does not fulfill the need for a reliable, comprehensive alert system. Initiated in 2004, FEMA's IPAWS program is intended to integrate new and existing alert capabilities, including EAS, into a comprehensive \"system of systems.\" However, national-level alert capabilities have remained unchanged and new technologies have not been adopted. IPAWS efforts have been affected by shifting program goals, lack of continuity in planning, staff turnover, and poorly organized program information from which to make management decisions. The vision of IPAWS has changed twice over the course of the program and strategic goals and milestones are not clearly defined, as IPAWS operated without an implementation plan from early 2007 through June 2009. Consequently, as state and local governments are forging ahead with their own alert systems, IPAWS program implementation has stalled and many of the functional goals of IPAWS, such as geo-targeting of messages and dissemination through redundant pathways to multiple devices, have yet to reach operational capacity. FEMA conducted a series of pilot projects without systematically assessing outcomes or lessons learned and without substantially advancing alert and warning systems. FEMA does not periodically report on IPAWS progress, therefore, program transparency and accountability are lacking. FEMA faces coordination issues and technical challenges in developing and implementing IPAWS. Effective public warning depends on the cooperation of stakeholders, such as emergency managers and the telecommunications industry, yet many stakeholders GAO contacted knew little about IPAWS and expressed the need for better coordination with FEMA. FEMA has taken steps to improve its coordination efforts, but the scope of stakeholder involvement is limited. FEMA also faces technical challenges related to systems integration, standards development, the development of geo-targeted and multilingual alerts, and alerts for individuals with disabilities. For example, the standard intended to facilitate integration of systems is still under development and is not widely used. As a result of these coordination and technical hurdles, integration with state and local systems will likely be a significant challenge due to potential incompatibility, and FEMA does not yet have logistical plans to integrate these systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A comprehensive system to warn Americans about public safety  emergencies allows people to take actions designed to save lives and  reduce damage. The current Emergency Alert System (EAS) provides the  President and authorized officials with limited capability to transmit  emergency messages to the public via television and radio. The antiquated  methods employed by EAS date back to 1963, exposing the system to  weaknesses, including questionable reliability and versatility. In 2006, an  executive order gave the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the  responsibility of modernizing the public alert and warning systems to  ensure the capability of distributing alerts through varied  telecommunications modes and based on factors such as geography. The  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the entity within DHS  responsible for the program, is working on the Integrated Public Alert and  Warning System (IPAWS), which is intended to eventually integrate EAS  into a larger warning network. When completed, EAS is expected to be  superseded by the IPAWS \u201csystem of systems,\u201d which will form the  country\u2019s comprehensive public alert system. In March 2007, we reported  on identified limitations of EAS and the challenges of developing the new  integrated system. Building on our previous work, you asked us to  provide information on the status of the nation\u2019s emergency alert and  public warning systems and FEMA\u2019s IPAWS program. For this report, we  examined (1) the current status of EAS, (2) the progress made in FEMA\u2019s  efforts to modernize and integrate alert and warning systems, and (3) the  issues and challenges involved in implementing an integrated public alert  and warning system.", "To meet these objectives, we conducted a Web-based survey of emergency  management directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in  March and April 2009, with 46 states and the District of Columbia  responding for an overall response rate of 92 percent.

FEMA is responsible for administering EAS at the national  level, while FCC manages EAS participation by media-related  communications service providers. FCC provides technical standards and  support for EAS, rules for its operation, and enforcement within the over- the-air broadcast, cable, and satellite broadcasting industries. Presidential,  or national-level, EAS alerts use a hierarchical distribution system to relay  important emergency messages. As the entry point for national level EAS  messages, FEMA is responsible for distributing presidential EAS alerts to  National Primary stations, often referred to as Primary Entry Point (PEP)  stations. Broadcasts of these national-level alerts are relayed by the PEP  stations across the country to radio and television stations that  rebroadcast the message to other broadcast stations and cable systems  until all EAS participants have been alerted. This retransmission of alerts  from EAS participant to EAS participant is commonly referred to as a  \u201cdaisy chain\u201d distribution system. FCC rules require EAS participants to  install FCC-certified EAS equipment. Radio and television broadcast  stations, cable companies, wireless cable companies, direct broadcast  satellite, and satellite radio generally must participate in the system and  transmit alerts initiated by the President. State and local governments  determine the content and transmission procedures of their alerts, in  conjunction with local broadcast radio and television stations. These  procedures are specified in state EAS plans filed with FCC. In 2007, FCC  adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to explore EAS-related  issues, such as how non-English speakers may best be served by national,  state, and local EAS; and to reexamine the best way to make EAS  accessible to persons with disabilities.", "Organizations that participate in EAS planning and administration include  the Primary Entry Point Administrative Council (PEPAC), the Society of  Broadcast Engineers, and associations such as the National Association of  Broadcasters and individual state broadcasting associations. States and  localities organize emergency communications committees whose  members often include representatives from broadcasters or local  television and radio stations. These committees agree on the chain of  command and other procedures for activating EAS alerts.", "In June 2006, the President issued Executive Order 13407, entitled Public  Alert and Warning System, effecting a policy that the U.S. have a  comprehensive integrated alert and warning system, and detailing the  responsibilities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in meeting this  requirement. The order also specified the level of support expected from  other departments and agencies in meeting the requirements for a more  robust federal warning system. The Secretary of Homeland Security was  ordered to \u201censure an orderly and effective transition\u201d from current  capabilities to the system described by the executive order, and to report  on the implementation of the system within 90 days of the order, and on at  least a yearly basis, thereafter. The FEMA IPAWS program was initiated in  2004 and the development and implementation of IPAWS has become the  programmatic mechanism to carry out the executive order. IPAWS is  defined by FEMA as a \u201csystem of systems,\u201d which is intended to eventually  integrate existing and new alert systems, including EAS. That is, EAS is  expected to be superseded as the nation\u2019s primary alert function by  IPAWS, with EAS acting as one of its component parts and as one of  IPAWS\u2019s mechanisms to disseminate alerts. Another intended partner  system is NOAA\u2019s National Weather Radio (NWR). NWR broadcasts  National Weather Service forecasts and all-hazard warnings. Non-weather  emergency messages are broadcast over NWR at the request of federal,  state, and local officials in time-critical situations when public safety is  involved.", "The Warning, Alert, and Response Network Act of 2006 (WARN Act)  required FCC to adopt relevant technical standards, protocols, procedures,  and other technical requirements to enable commercial mobile service  providers (wireless providers) to issue emergency alerts. The act  established an advisory panel called the Commercial Mobile Service Alert  Advisory Committee (CMSAAC), to recommend the technical  specifications and protocols that will govern wireless providers that  participate in emergency alerting. The CMSAAC was chaired by then-FCC  Chairman Kevin J. Martin and included 42 other members, representing  stakeholders in all levels of government and the private sector. FCC  adopted most of the recommendations made by the committee regarding  the required capabilities of wireless providers to transmit alerts, as well as  the proposal to develop a Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS).", "Figure 1 displays the conceptual architecture of IPAWS, with EAS, NWR,  and CMAS as mechanisms for disseminating alerts.", "The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an open, non-proprietary digital  message format being used as a standard for new, digitized alert networks  using multiple technologies. CAP is compatible with multiple applications  and telecommunication methods, and has been developed for use by  emergency management officials in sending all types of alert messages.  CAP can be used as a single input to activate multiple warning systems,  and is capable of geographic targeting and multilingual messaging.  FEMA\u2014required by the executive order to adopt alert standards and  protocols\u2014intends to adopt CAP and to publish its IPAWS CAP v1.1-EAS  Profile (CAP Profile) standard. In an FCC report and order released in July  2007, FCC promulgated new rules, including a requirement for all  mandatory EAS participants to accept messages using CAP, no later than  180 days after FEMA adopts the CAP standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EAS Remains the Nation\u2019s Primary Public Alert and Warning System, But Unaddressed Weaknesses Limit its Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["EAS remains the primary national-level public alert system and serves as a  valuable public alert and warning tool.

Nonetheless, as we previously reported, EAS  exhibits longstanding weaknesses that continue to limit its effectiveness.  In particular, the reliability of the national-level relay system\u2014which  would be critical if the President were to issue a national-level alert\u2014 remains questionable due to a lack of redundancy among key  broadcasters, gaps in coverage, insufficient testing of the relay system, and  inadequate training of personnel.

EAS has never been  used to transmit a national-level alert, but instead has evolved into an  important public alert and warning tool for state and local governments.  State and local emergency operations managers can request activation of  EAS for state and local public alert and warning needs. EAS participants  transmit state and local alerts via radio and television or other media  facilities, such as cable or satellite. These alerts include weather warnings,  AMBER Alerts, or other emergency communications, such as evacuation  notices. EAS participants may decide individually whether to transmit  alerts that originate at the state or local level. Approximately 90 percent of  all EAS messages are weather alerts generated by NOAA\u2019s National  Weather Service (NWS). NWS broadcasts forecasts, warnings, watches,  and other non-weather hazard information, and supplies such information  to broadcast and cable entry points designated in approved EAS state and  local plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Alert Distribution and Dissemination Hinder EAS", "paragraphs": ["EAS has longstanding weaknesses that have not been resolved since we  reported on them in March 2007. These weaknesses continue to limit the  effectiveness of EAS and include (1) a lack of redundancy, (2) gaps in  coverage, (3) a lack of testing, and (4) inadequate training for EAS  participants. In addition to these weaknesses, EAS is also hampered by  how alerts are disseminated to the public.", "Lack of redundancy. FEMA lacks alternative means of reaching EAS  participants should its primary connection fail. Specifically, FEMA can  distribute national-level alerts to 35 PEP stations (which serve as the entry  points for Presidential alerts) and to 860 public radio stations across the  country via EAS phone lines and satellite connectivity, respectively.  However, FEMA lacks an alternative means of reaching these participants  if those primary connections fail. Furthermore, if a primary connection to  a PEP station failed, all of the other EAS participants that rely on that  station via the daisy chain relay system would fail to receive alerts. This  lack of redundancy could have serious consequences. For example, if a  PEP station were disabled during a disaster in a major metropolitan area,  an EAS alert would likely fail to reach a sizable portion of the population  because FEMA, potentially, would not have access to other stations in that  area.", "Gaps in coverage. Gaps in PEP station broadcast coverage could hinder  the successful dissemination of EAS alerts, as some broadcast stations  might have difficulty in monitoring their assigned PEP station because the  station is geographically distant. Some states, such as Maine, are not  covered at all by the PEP system and would have to pick up a national- level message from an alternate source, such as Public Radio. This might  not be a fully reliable option, however. Unlike PEP stations, public radio  stations do not necessarily have extra fuel and generators on-site to help  ensure continuous operations following a disaster. Some broadcasters we  contacted expressed concern that other factors might impede their ability  to receive alerts from PEP stations. For example, some PEP broadcast  signals are too weak to overcome geographical impediments, such as  mountains; due to interference, broadcast signals generally do not travel  as well during the day as at night and, therefore, have inconsistent EAS  coverage; and high definition radio signals can overpower or distort PEP  broadcast signals. Some states, such as Washington, have developed  systems to augment the PEP network to ensure that EAS messages are  disseminated throughout the state, but not every state has taken such  action. As shown in figure 2, PEP daytime broadcast coverage leaves large  geographic areas uncovered by EAS. FEMA officials noted that there is a  significant difference between daytime and nighttime coverage. FEMA  estimated that 82 percent and 75 percent of the population are covered by  nighttime and daytime PEP signals, respectively.", "Lack of testing. FEMA does not perform ongoing national-level tests of the  daisy chain relay system to ensure that it would work as intended during a  national-level alert. FCC requires stations to test their EAS equipment  and FEMA is required to perform weekly tests of connections to the 35  PEP stations, but there is no requirement for a national-level test of the  relay system. In January 2007, in response to our ongoing work at that  time, FEMA conducted a national-level EAS test. According to FEMA, the  test demonstrated an effective satellite connection to public radio stations.  However, three PEP stations failed to receive and effectively rebroadcast  the national-level test message due to hardware and software issues,  which FEMA stated have since been resolved. FEMA has not held another  test since 2007, although DHS agreed with the intent of our previous  recommendation that FEMA develop and implement a plan to verify the  dependability and effectiveness of the relay distribution system. DHS had  also stated that FEMA would begin to conduct new quarterly \u201cover-the-air\u201d  tests, but these have not taken place. In addition, FEMA has no plans for  testing the relay distribution system. Consequently, there is no assurance  the national-level relay would work should the President need to activate  EAS to communicate with the American people. The recent failure of an  accidental national-level alert suggests that problems remain in the relay  system. In this incident, a national-level (Presidential) alert, intended as a  test, was inadvertently initiated in Illinois. Despite this false alarm, as  intended for a national-level alert, the broadcast airways were \u201cseized.\u201d  However, the alert failed to be properly disseminated by all EAS  participants. In particular, cable companies, which should disseminate  such an alert in an emergency situation, failed to receive it. According to  FEMA officials and industry stakeholders, the failure was due to a  malfunction of cable providers\u2019 EAS equipment. While FEMA officials say  this situation has since been rectified, no testing has been done to confirm  that the equipment used by cable companies would work properly.  Coupled with the results from the January 2007 test, these events raise  concerns about the national-level relay system and further highlight the  need for additional testing.", "Inadequate training for EAS participants. Another longstanding  weakness of EAS is inadequate training for EAS participants, both in using  EAS equipment and in drafting EAS messages. In 2007, we reported that  several EAS stakeholders, including state and local officials, identified  inadequate training as a limitation of EAS and cited a need for additional  instruction in equipment use and message creation. Our current work  indicates that such training is still lacking. For example, a state official  told us that users and message originators need additional training to  know how to properly craft and initiate a message, especially since  emergency managers vary in their level of expertise. Similarly, a number of  respondents to our state survey of emergency managers cited a need for  training. For example, one state emergency management representative  suggested that training courses be established for emergency managers,  broadcasters, and cable providers. To address training inadequacies, we  previously recommended that FEMA develop a plan to verify that EAS  participants have the training and technical skills to issue effective EAS  alerts. DHS agreed with the intent of the recommendation and noted that  FEMA would improve training for EAS operators, as well as make the  system more user-friendly. According to FEMA, it is currently analyzing  and assessing EAS operator training needs, but it has not yet implemented  any new training initiatives.", "In addition to the aforementioned weaknesses, EAS is also hampered by  how alerts are disseminated to the public. Much as gaps exist with PEP- station coverage and through weaknesses in EAS participants\u2019  distribution, large portions of the population remain uncovered because  EAS relies on certain media, such as radio and television broadcast, to  provide alerts. Specifically, EAS\u2019s reliance on broadcast and other media  currently exclude other communications devices, such as cell phones. In  addition, it remains difficult for EAS to reach distinct segments of the  population. For example, alerts are typically provided only in English and  alerting mechanisms provide unequal access for persons with disabilities.  In particular, individuals with hearing and vision disabilities may be  subject to inconsistent aural and visual information in EAS alerts. Further,  effective public alerting via EAS is also hindered by its limited ability to  target alert messages to specific geographic locations. For example, a local  emergency manager told us that a message generated by his county would  be automatically sent to 10 neighboring counties, potentially causing  unnecessary alarm for alert recipients in surrounding areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Introduced Projects to Address Some of EAS\u2019s Operational Weaknesses, but Little Progress Has Been Made", "paragraphs": ["FEMA officials stated that projects are under way to address some of  EAS\u2019s operational weaknesses. For example, to improve EAS coverage,  FEMA is planning to expand the number of PEP stations from 35 to 69 by  2011. However, since the PEP expansion effort was initiated in 2006, of  three PEP stations scheduled for addition in 2007, FEMA completed only  one in 2008, with the other two only partially completed. At the time of  our review, FEMA had selected six additional area locations for new PEP  stations and initiated negotiations with radio stations in three of the areas.  FEMA cited several challenges in expanding the number of PEPs.  Specifically, officials told us that the process is often slowed by  negotiations with broadcast stations, soil sampling, and construction. In  addition, PEPAC representatives said regulatory procedures, such as those  requiring stations to house fuel on-site, lengthen the process.", "To add redundancy and improve the reliability of the relay system, FEMA  is also developing the Digital Emergency Alert System (DEAS). DEAS is  expected to provide additional connections with EAS entry points\u2014the  PEP stations\u2014and provide for the direct transmission of a voice, video, or  text alert to stations using the public broadcast system satellite network.  According to FEMA, DEAS was successfully piloted twice. However,  despite concluding the pilots in 2007, FEMA had not begun implementing  DEAS at the time of our review. FEMA planned to deploy DEAS in 2008 to  13 states and 1 territory, including those that participated in the second  pilot; followed in 2009 by a deployment to 16 additional states prone to  weather hazards, and then to all states. However, DEAS deployment did  not occur and FEMA did not provide an explanation for this delay.  Currently, FEMA plans to implement DEAS using a phased approach  beginning in mid-2009.", "Other FEMA initiatives related to EAS include the integration of XM  satellite transmission paths and the implementation of CAP. Specifically,  FEMA plans to deliver national-level EAS messages from FEMA to PEP  stations by establishing a satellite connection via XM Satellite Radio to  complement its existing phone connection. FEMA targeted completion of  XM satellite connectivity to key EAS sites by 2007; however, it is now  scheduled for completion in 2009. While no reason was provided for the  apparent delay, FEMA noted that it is currently working on certification  and accreditation issues. Separately, FEMA is working to develop and  implement the CAP Profile; however, FEMA has not defined how CAP will  work within EAS, including how EAS participants will rebroadcast a CAP  message. Further, CAP is not currently capable of carrying a live audio  message. Alternatively, to satisfy the requirement to carry a presidential  message, EAS participants will be required to link to a FEMA server to  stream audio messages. Finally, broadcasters expressed concern that CAP  is not ready to be used with EAS, thereby leading broadcasters to question  its utility, as well as the necessity of obtaining CAP-compliant equipment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While FEMA Has IPAWS Initiatives Under Way, Progress in Implementing an Integrated Alert System Has Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["FEMA began initiatives related to IPAWS in 2004, yet national-level alert  capabilities have remained unchanged and new standards and  technologies have not been adopted.

Table 1 displays the functions of the executive order, FEMA\u2019s  ongoing projects aimed at satisfying those functions, and the status and  progress of the projects.", "While there are IPAWS projects under way designed to meet the  requirements of the executive order, these projects have shown little  progress. Many IPAWS initiatives have been ongoing for several years with  little functional contribution to the improvement or modernization of  public alert and warning. In fact, some of the projects cited by FEMA as  initiatives satisfying the requirements of the executive order have been  under development since the inception of IPAWS and have yet to be  completed. For example, one intention of IPAWS is to integrate various  alert systems into a \u201csystem of systems.\u201d There are both federally- and  locally-operated alert systems, which are to be integrated under IPAWS.  On the federal level, NOAA directs the NWS alerting network; and at the  state level, 42 emergency management directors who responded to our  survey reported existing or planned systems in their state. According to  FEMA briefings and documents, it is the intention that local, state, and  tribal systems be interoperable with IPAWS; however, states and localities  operate their own distinct systems. In fact, of the 42 state survey  respondents with alert systems, only 11 have systems that have been  integrated with or are automatically triggered by the existing EAS. At  present, the extent of efforts to integrate state and local systems is a  nationwide inventory of systems and there are not yet any architectural or  logistical plans to integrate these systems. In effect, as deployment of state  and local alert systems continues, integration into the IPAWS system could  become increasingly complicated and difficult.", "As another example, FEMA\u2019s efforts to have IPAWS deliver warnings  through diverse media have been limited. As early as 2005, FEMA planned  efforts to provide warning messages to subscribers via email and to  telephones, text message devices, cell phones, pagers, and Internet  desktops. These capabilities were tested under various IPAWS pilot  projects, but the development and implementation of the methods were  discontinued when the pilots were completed. At present, IPAWS efforts  to expand alert dissemination through methods other than standard radio  and television broadcast are limited to participation in CMAS, a cellular  broadcast text alert initiative. FEMA has accepted the responsibility for  collecting and disseminating alerts, but it is unclear, at this point, how  CMAS will be integrated with IPAWS.", "FEMA has missed numerous timelines that it set for IPAWS initiatives.  Various projects were originally intended to be completed to form the  foundation of IPAWS, but have experienced delays and are still not yet  functional.

According to emergency management and industry  stakeholders, FEMA has not sufficiently met this responsibility. About half  of the state survey respondents reported that FEMA had not provided  them with a clear understanding of the IPAWS vision or program goals and  66 percent were somewhat or very dissatisfied with FEMA\u2019s level of  consultation and coordination. Ultimately, among states, there is a general  lack of satisfaction with FEMA\u2019s outreach and a clouded understanding of  what IPAWS actually is. Although survey respondents generally evaluated  FEMA as having done little to no outreach, education, and coordination,  FEMA has made recent progress in these efforts.

The IPAWS program vision has changed several  times, slowing progress toward an integrated system. FEMA originally  planned to build an infrastructure to deliver state and local alerts through  multiple pathways. However, according to FEMA officials, in the second  quarter of calendar year 2007, the vision changed to focus exclusively on  dissemination of presidential messages and setting alert and warning  technical standards. In early 2009, the vision of the program shifted to  again focus on a comprehensive system that included infrastructure for  state and local alerts.

It also involves ensuring that the project team has the skills  and knowledge needed to manage the project and obtaining stakeholder  commitment to the project plan. Furthermore, agencies can use  performance information to make various types of management decisions  to improve programs and results. Although the executive order requires  an implementation plan to be updated yearly, from early 2007 through  June 2009, the IPAWS effort operated without a designated  implementation plan and no specific processes for systems development  and deployment. The current implementation plan, completed in June  2009, does not adequately satisfy the project management and planning  practices essential for effective program execution. In contrast to the plan  from 2006, this plan provides few program details.

We found organized IPAWS program  information that officials might use for decisionmaking and establishing  project plans is also lacking. Throughout the course of our work, FEMA  officials told us that many key IPAWS documents did not exist or were  irretrievable. Moreover, a consultant at FEMA who is assessing IPAWS  has found that there is no cogent organization system to locate program  information, that information exists in multiple locations across FEMA  office spaces, and that data searches on program information take an  inordinate amount of time and effort. The consultant also found more  robust and realistic documented internal controls are necessary.", "We requested documentation on FEMA and DHS reporting requirements  or performance measures for which the IPAWS program prepared  documented updates of its progress. However, neither FEMA nor DHS  regularly report on IPAWS. FEMA was able to provide a performance  information worksheet and spreadsheet, but this documentation provided  only vague program parameters, without progress updates on reaching  specific goals or milestones. FEMA has taken steps to assess the IPAWS  program and has contracted with a consultant to perform a full  assessment of the IPAWS program and to implement internal controls and  performance measures. However, the absence of accurate periodic  reporting on IPAWS leaves valuable program information unavailable.  Such information would help increase program transparency, establish  greater program accountability, and assure a reasonable assessment of  return on financial investments. Additionally, periodic reporting on IPAWS  would provide FEMA\u2019s private sector partners and those in government at  the federal, state, and local level with information necessary to help  establish an integrated alert and warning system. Such reporting would  also assist the Congress as it oversees issues related to public alert and  warning.", "Staff turnover. Progress toward an integrated alert system has also been  slowed by frequent changes in organizational leadership of the IPAWS  program office and other staffing related issues. During our review, IPAWS  was operating under an acting director\u2014its third director since the  program began\u2014and at the time of our review was searching for a  permanent director. According to FEMA, a new director took charge of the  program on August 3, 2009. Additionally, according to FEMA officials, high  turnover of program staff has made it difficult to consistently manage  IPAWS programs. FEMA\u2019s heavy use of contract employees has also  resulted in concerns from stakeholders. In one state, emergency  management officials participated in an IPAWS project, relying solely on  contract staff without actually knowing that FEMA was involved. Another  state official said that IPAWS is dominated with outside contractors who  do not fully understand alert and warning needs. At the program office  itself, there is a preponderance of contract staff. As of June 2009, 27  contractor staff and 5 FEMA IPAWS staff positions were filled out of 11  noncontract full-time equivalent positions that were available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Program Accountability for IPAWS Projects Has Contributed to Inconclusive Results and Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["To demonstrate the integration and expansion of new alerting  technologies, and to work toward the functionality described in the  executive order, FEMA has implemented a series of IPAWS pilot projects,  but they have ended inconclusively, with few documented lessons learned.  The IPAWS pilots were first introduced in 2004, prior to Executive Order  13407, and focused on testing various alerting systems in different areas of  the country with the intent that successfully piloted technologies could  eventually be used in a fully integrated \u201csystem of systems.\u201d At various  stages of our work, FEMA provided different accounts of the number and  breadth of the pilot projects, as well as inconsistent documentation on the  goals, costs, and results of the full IPAWS pilot programs. Specifically,  FEMA documents and interviews revealed inconsistent information on the  purpose of the pilot programs and how they supported broader IPAWS  goals. According to FEMA officials, the pilot projects were intended to be  discrete tests of alert capability, with clear goals and specified durations.  However, there is a dearth of documentation describing the actual plans  and results of the pilots. Although we requested reports documenting the  plans, lessons learned, and technological or operational outcomes, for  most pilot projects, such formal documentation was never produced.  Rather, the extent of the documentation FEMA provided on the pilots  includes general briefing slides with broad program descriptions. FEMA  equipment deployed during the pilots was left, for the most part, unused  with pilot participants. According to FEMA officials, there is an inventory  accounting for the equipment and the equipment is intended to be  repurposed in the future. As a result of the lack of project assessments,  reporting, and documentation, it is unclear which aspects of the IPAWS  projects, if any, are currently being utilized or are planned to be utilized in  the future or whether the projects informed actions or decisions with  respect to IPAWS programming. Initial findings from an IPAWS program  assessment, performed by a FEMA consultant, revealed that, in most  cases, key project deliverables, for which the government contracted,  could not be accounted for. FEMA\u2019s consultant was unable to locate or  verify the status of deliverables for 18 of the 28 projects it identified. The  consultant was able to verify only partial completion of 6 other projects,  while the status of deliverables for the 4 other projects was incomplete,  ongoing, not available, or unknown.", "Responses from our survey of state emergency management directors  indicate that most of the 12 states that reported participating in the pilot  projects reacted unfavorably when asked about the outcomes and lessons  learned from the pilots. Lack of coordination, poor management,  incomplete execution, and short project duration were cited, among other  things, as lessons learned or outcomes from the pilots. Figure 5 identifies  the states who reported participating in IPAWS pilot projects, including  select open-ended feedback provided by states.", "Some states cited positive outcomes and were generally more optimistic  about their participation. For example, one state was encouraged by the  promise of new alerting technology being pilot tested and said that the  pilot technologies proved effective and reliable and should be components  of an overall strategy.

In addition, given that the IPAWS vision relies  heavily upon state and local investment in CAP-based warning systems,  organizations at these levels of government have a range of interests in  IPAWS planning efforts. In fact, many respondents to our state survey seek  opportunities to contribute to IPAWS planning and consider collaboration  among all levels of government to be imperative to the delivery of public  alerts and warnings.", "Executive Order 13407, in laying out FEMA\u2019s IPAWS role, recognized the  need for stakeholder involvement for an effective alert system to work and  required FEMA to \u201cconsult, coordinate, and cooperate with the private  sector, including communications media organizations, and federal, state,  territorial, tribal and local governmental authorities, including emergency  response providers.\u201d Many stakeholders we contacted from various levels  of government and the private sector expressed support for a  collaborative, consensus-based forum that could increase the flow of  information and best represent stakeholder interests. In March 2007, we  recommended that FEMA establish a forum for stakeholders involved with  emergency communications to discuss issues related to IPAWS, with  representation from federal agencies, state and local governments, private  industry, and the affected consumer community. DHS agreed with the  intent of this recommendation, noting that FEMA would continue to work  with stakeholders through meetings, conferences, and other forums. As  recently as May 2008, FEMA said it intended to create a stakeholder  subcommittee under an appropriate DHS departmental advisory  committee in compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act  (FACA). Also, FEMA informed us of plans to establish state advisory  committees. However, FEMA subsequently told us that neither the federal  advisory subcommittee nor state advisory committees have been  implemented and there are no current plans to establish such groups.", "While there is broad consensus regarding the need for coordination,  FEMA\u2019s efforts to date have been insufficient, according to many  stakeholders we contacted. For example, broadcaster associations and  local government officials were unaware of IPAWS program goals and  milestones. Also, the majority of our state survey respondents received  little to no information from FEMA and communicated with FEMA to little  or no extent. Further, only one survey respondent indicated that FEMA\u2019s  communication and coordination efforts have provided him with a clear  understanding of the IPAWS vision and program goals, with the majority  of respondents having little or no understanding of the program. Local  officials we contacted had little to no communication with FEMA, were  generally unaware of the IPAWS program, and overall, lacked an  understanding of the CAP alert standard.", "FEMA officials acknowledged that they have, thus far, insufficiently  engaged state-level stakeholders and have recently taken steps to increase  their communication and collaboration efforts. Many of FEMA\u2019s recent  initiatives are driven by its July 2008 \u2013 September 2009 IPAWS Stakeholder  Engagement Plan, which describes FEMA\u2019s strategy for establishing,  developing, and maintaining partnerships with alert and warning  stakeholders. Among other things, this plan details FEMA\u2019s intent to  continue its participation in alert and warning and emergency  management conferences; to engage relevant congressional committees;  to build relationships with FEMA Regions, which can pass information to  state and local government officials; and to build relationships with other  organizations and media outlets. In addition, FEMA launched an updated  Web site in March 2009, which allows users to submit questions regarding  the IPAWS program. The Web site lacks detailed program information,  however.", "In figure 6, we display the survey responses of state emergency  management directors on the extent to which they believe FEMA officials  adequately communicated or coordinated with state and local  governments with respect to public alert and warning programs. States  largely reported inadequate levels of training, testing, and alert exercises,  as well as inadequate public education efforts. The survey results indicate  that a set of stakeholders crucial to establishing a public alert and warning  system do not believe FEMA is communicating and collaborating  adequately.", "According to our survey results, overall, 31 states were either somewhat  dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the level of consultation,  coordination, and communication shown by FEMA with respect to its  public alert and warning programs. Many stakeholders we contacted and  respondents to our state survey desire greater dialogue with FEMA and  want FEMA to better coordinate its efforts with public and private  partners. Some of these sentiments were echoed by federal partners, such  as NOAA, which noted that coordination could be improved. The DHS  Office of Science and Technology, which cited its relationship with FEMA  as a primary challenge to developing an integrated alert system, told us  that FEMA\u2019s frequent periods of transition made planning difficult. To  improve federal coordination and assert its lead role in federal alert and  warning programs, FEMA has established memorandums of agreement  and understanding with federal partners and meets regularly with them.  The IPAWS stakeholder engagement plans call for FEMA to host annual  alert and warning summits with its federal partners, starting as soon as the  first quarter of fiscal year 2009, and FEMA also formed three working  groups to review and validate requirements for the CAP Profile. FEMA  said it plans to eventually expand the scope of these working groups  beyond CAP to solicit feedback on the continued development and  implementation of IPAWS.", "Although some of FEMA\u2019s communication and coordination efforts appear  promising, their effectiveness is not yet clear. For example, one survey  respondent has been encouraged by his state\u2019s inclusion in FEMA\u2019s  Practitioner\u2019s Working Group, yet nonetheless reported a lack of  communication and coordination with FEMA. The scope and range of  stakeholder involvement in each new effort is limited and, as such, FEMA  remains without a mechanism to bring together all interested  stakeholders. This raises the possibility that many stakeholders will  remain uninformed of FEMA\u2019s efforts pertaining to IPAWS and leaves  FEMA without a means to thoroughly collaborate on a range of alert and  warning issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical and Other Challenges Have Not Been Fully Addressed", "paragraphs": ["FEMA faces an array of technical and other challenges in developing and  implementing IPAWS that have not been fully addressed. These challenges  include (1) integrating systems; (2) adopting CAP standards; and (3)  developing and implementing geo-targeted and risk-based alerting, alerts  for individuals with disabilities, and multilingual alerts.", "Integrating IPAWS with state and local systems. As states and local  governments develop and deploy their own alert systems, a key challenge,  according to stakeholders, is the integration of IPAWS with these  disparate alert systems. In our survey, 42 states responded that they have  implemented or plan to implement alternate methods to disseminate  emergency alert information outside of EAS, such as email or text alerts.  Current and planned capabilities vary widely, however. In addition, 20  state respondents indicated that their states have no plans to wait for  information or guidance from the federal government before investing in  emergency alert and warning systems. States that are moving ahead  without federal guidance and investing in alert methods cited a  responsibility to provide their citizens with emergency communications.  The prevalence of alternate alerting methods at the state level that lack  compatibility with federal investments could lead to increased diversity  among systems, making future integration more difficult. To address  challenges related to integrating IPAWS with state and local alert systems,  FEMA is planning to inventory and evaluate federal, state, local, territorial,  and tribal alert and warning capabilities by surveying approximately 3,500  emergency operations centers. This effort, initiated in late 2008, is required  by the 2006 executive order, and will be carried out over a 3-year period  ending in 2012, according to FEMA.", "Adopting CAP standards. Integration of IPAWS and state and local  systems hinges largely on whether these systems use the same alert  standards. FEMA intends to adopt CAP as the standard by which  information will be transported among alerting systems. Currently, only 10  respondents to our state survey are using CAP, indicating that the prospect  for seamless integration of existing systems may be limited. However, 42  states responding to our survey plan to use CAP in future investments in  emergency alert and warning equipment, suggesting that the use of CAP  will expand. Several survey respondents cited funding as an obstacle to  CAP usage and system integration, reporting that further investment  would be required to make necessary system upgrades. Additional  challenges to integration exist at the local level due to the potential  diversity among systems and similar financial constraints. For example,  one state survey respondent indicated that cities are purchasing  notification systems, yet the state has set no standards for such systems.  FEMA officials acknowledged that federal grant programs would likely be  necessary to support IPAWS deployment, and are currently exploring the  use of grant programs to make funding available to states and local  jurisdictions for the procurement of CAP-compliant equipment.", "Developing and implementing tailored alerting: geo-targeted and risk- based alerting, alerts for individuals with disabilities, and multilingual  alerts. CAP messages can be disseminated with the multiple streams of  information necessary to facilitate tailored alerting, and according to  FEMA, adoption of the CAP Profile is the first step in developing the  flexibility to provide such alerts. However, the current CAP Profile under  consideration does not address multiple languages or special needs. Risk- based alerting\u2014that is, the capability to tailor alerts based on a person\u2019s  threat risk or level of danger\u2014is a requirement of the executive order, yet  FEMA does not have plans to address this functionality. FEMA noted that  state and local practitioners have developed innovative warning systems  and methods for alerting those with disabilities and non-English speakers.  To address these challenges, in 2009 and 2010, FEMA intends to plan,  engineer, and implement capabilities to extend alerts to these groups."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Emergency communications are critical in crisis management and for  protecting the public in situations of war, terrorist attack, or natural  disaster; yet, FEMA has made limited progress in implementing a  comprehensive, integrated alert system as is the policy of the federal  government. Management turnover, inadequate planning, and a lack of  stakeholder coordination have delayed implementation of IPAWS and left  the nation dependent on an antiquated, unreliable national alert system.  FEMA\u2019s delays also appear to have made IPAWS implementation more  difficult in the absence of federal leadership as states have forged ahead  and invested in their own alert and warning systems.", "The IPAWS program has been slowed and has suffered setbacks due to a  lack of consistent program goals, clear performance measures, and  program management information. In the absence of systematic  performance measures, project milestones and schedules have been left  undefined and little progress has been made in achieving the objectives of  Executive Order 13407, which called for a comprehensive solution in the  way public alert and warning is conducted in the United States. In order  that IPAWS achieve the federal government\u2019s public alert and warning  goals, it is essential that FEMA define the specific steps necessary in  realizing a modernized and integrated alert system. While the executive  order requires an implementation plan to be updated yearly, separately,  periodic reporting on progress toward achieving an integrated public alert  and warning system would improve program transparency and  accountability. Such reporting would match program goals to their  respective timelines and provide government and private sector  stakeholders with information necessary to help establish an integrated  alert and warning system.", "EAS, one of the mainstays for public alerting, and the only operational  aspect of IPAWS, has remained largely unchanged since our previous  review in 2007. Although projects are under way to address longstanding  weaknesses, the lack of reliability of alert distribution and dissemination  functions to the public limits EAS\u2019s effectiveness. Specifically, a lack of  training and national-level testing raises questions about whether the relay  system would actually work during a national-level emergency. Previously,  we recommended that FEMA work in conjunction with FCC to develop  and implement a plan to verify (1) the dependability and effectiveness of  the EAS relay distribution system, which is used to disseminate national- level alerts; and (2) that EAS participants have the training and technical  skills to issue effective EAS alerts. As sufficient action on EAS testing and  training has not been taken and since IPAWS is years away from full  implementation, these recommendations remain applicable to help ensure  EAS is capable of operating as intended. Further, as IPAWS is developed  and deployed, it is important that the dependability of those systems be  verified and that IPAWS participants are adequately trained.", "Effectively implementing an integrated alert system will require  collaboration among a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including those at  the federal, state, and local levels; private industry; and the affected  consumer community. Executive Order 13407 requires such collaboration.  As states and localities invest in their own alert systems in advance of  IPAWS deployment, it is critical that FEMA coordinate with stakeholders  to help facilitate the integration of these alert systems. We previously  recommended that FEMA establish a forum for the diverse stakeholders  involved with emergency communications to discuss emerging and other  issues related to the implementation of an integrated public alert and  warning system. While FEMA has established stakeholder \u201cworking  groups,\u201d a robust forum of diverse public alert stakeholders does not exist  and further action on stakeholder engagement is necessary.
