DSS is unable to provide this assurance because its performance goals and measures do not relate directly to the protection of classified information. While DSS maintains files on contractor facilities' security programs and their security violations, it does not analyze this information. Further, the manner in which this information is maintained--geographically dispersed paper-based files--does not lend itself to analysis. By not analyzing information on security violations and how well classified information is being protected across all facilities, DSS cannot identify systemic vulnerabilities and make corrective changes to reduce the risk of information compromise. When a contractor facility reports a violation and the possible compromise of classified information, DSS does not always follow established procedures. After receiving a report of a possible information compromise, DSS is required to determine whether compromise occurred and to notify the affected government agency so it can assess any damage and take actions to mitigate the effects of the suspected compromise, compromise, or loss. However, DSS failed to make determinations in many of the 93 violations GAO reviewed and made inappropriate determinations in others. In 39 of the 93 violations, DSS made no determinations regarding compromise. For 30 of the remaining 54 violations, DSS's determinations were not consistent with established criteria. As a result, government agencies are not being kept informed of possible compromises of their information. In addition, weeks or months can pass before government agencies are notified by DSS of possible information compromises because of difficulties in identifying the affected agencies. In 11 out of 16 instances GAO reviewed, it took DSS more than 30 days to notify the affected agency that its information had been lost or compromised. DSS relies on contractor facilities to identify the affected government agencies, but some facilities cannot readily provide DSS with this information because they are subcontractors that have to obtain the identity of the government agency from the prime contractors. In one case, 5 months passed before a subcontractor facility could provide DSS with the identity of the government agency whose information was suspected of being compromised. Such delays limit the government agencies' opportunity to assess and mitigate any damage from loss or compromise."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Contractors for the Department of Defense (DOD) perform a multitude of  services, ranging from designing advanced weapons used by U.S. forces  around the world to providing translation services for prisoner  interrogations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Because a large portion of their  work is vital to national security, contractors often require access to  classified information. However, with contractor access comes the  possibility that classified information will be compromised and national  security will be harmed. Over the last several years, there have been  several reported incidents of contractors handling classified information  carelessly, losing it, and even providing it to unauthorized persons. These  incidents have occurred at a time when foreign entities are increasing their  attempts to obtain information from U.S. industry on militarily critical  technologies, such as encryption devices or target recognition components  for missiles. Further, the risk of compromise has grown with the increased  use of the Internet to transfer information almost anywhere in the world.", "Given the risk of information compromise, contractors are required to  have security programs that provide DOD and other agencies with  assurances that classified information will be appropriately safeguarded.  The National Industrial Security Program (NISP) establishes requirements  that contractors\u2019 programs must meet and a process for ensuring that  contractors adhere to the requirements. DOD\u2019s Defense Security Service  (DSS) administers the NISP on behalf of DOD and 24 other federal  agencies. DSS grants clearances to contractor facilities so they can access  and, in some cases, store classified information. DSS then monitors over  11,000 facilities\u2019 security programs to ensure that they meet NISP  requirements and to assure government customers that their classified  information is appropriately safeguarded.", "In a report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2004, the Senate Committee on Armed Services directed us to  review the NISP and DOD\u2019s oversight of contractors\u2019 programs to protect  sensitive information and technology. In response, we assessed (1) DSS\u2019s  oversight of contractor facilities\u2019 implementation of the NISP and  (2) DSS\u2019s adherence to required procedures after a security violation and  possible compromise of classified information.

The goal is to  ensure that contractors\u2019 security programs detect and deter espionage and  counter the threat posed by adversaries seeking classified information.  According to DSS, attempts by foreign agents to obtain information from  contractors have increased over the last several years and are expected to  increase further. The NISP is the governmentwide program to assure  federal agencies that contractors adequately protect classified  information. The NISP was established by executive order in 1993 to  replace industrial security programs operated by various federal agencies.  Under the national program, contractor facilities must be cleared prior to  accessing classified information and must implement certain safeguards to  maintain their clearance. DOD is responsible for clearing facilities and  monitoring contractors\u2019 protection of classified information. DOD, with  concurrence from the Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, and Central Intelligence Agency, issued the National  Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) in 1995. The  NISPOM prescribes the requirements, restrictions, and safeguards that  contractors are to follow to prevent the unauthorized disclosure\u2014or  compromise\u2014of classified information.", "DSS administers the NISP on behalf of DOD and 24 other agencies through  its Industrial Security Program. DSS\u2019s Industrial Security Program, which  is one of DSS\u2019s three core mission areas, oversees more than 11,000  contractor facilities to assure U.S. government customers that their  classified information is protected. By clearing a facility, DSS has  determined that the contractor facility is eligible to access classified  information at the same or lower classification level as the clearance  granted\u2014Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Under the NISP, a facility is  a grouping of buildings related by function and location that form an  operating entity. Facilities include manufacturing plants, laboratories,  offices, and universities. They range in size from small offices that are  owned and operated by one person to huge manufacturing complexes that  are one of many owned by a large corporation. According to DSS, about  half of the cleared facilities have been approved by DSS to store classified  information on site, while the other facilities access classified information  at a government site or at another facility approved for storage.", "DSS\u2019s industrial security representatives serve as the primary points of  contact with cleared facilities and are responsible for ensuring that  contractors have security programs that comply with the NISPOM. The  240 industrial security representatives are assigned to 23 field offices  spread throughout the country, where field office chiefs supervise their  work. Representatives\u2019 oversight involves educating facility personnel on  security requirements, accrediting information systems that process  classified information, approving classified storage containers, and  assisting contractors with security violation investigations. DSS  representatives also conduct periodic security reviews to assess whether  contractor facilities are adhering to NISPOM requirements and to identify  actual and potential security vulnerabilities. Security reviews are  scheduled annually for facilities that store classified information and every  18 months for facilities that do not have classified information on site. In  overseeing and assisting contractors, the representatives are to follow the  procedures contained in the Industrial Security Operating Manual, which  DSS issued to guide its personnel in administering the NISP. For example,  the manual specifies how representatives should conduct security reviews  to evaluate the quality of a facility\u2019s security program and how contractor  facilities\u2019 reports of security violations should be handled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS Does Not Evaluate the Effectiveness of Its Oversight", "paragraphs": ["DSS relies on performance goals and measures that do not provide it a  basis for assuring government customers that its oversight of contractor  facilities mitigates the risk of information compromise.

DSS\u2019s industrial security  mission, as stated in its current Fiscal Year 2000-2005 strategic plan, is to  (1) ensure that all contractor facilities overseen by DSS properly protect  classified information in their possession and (2) assure government  customers that facilities are eligible to receive classified information and  have systems in place to protect the classified information. However, DSS  currently does not have performance goals and measures that would  indicate whether DSS is fulfilling this mission.", "DSS assesses its industrial security program based on the:    percentage of security reviews completed,    percentage of security reviews that covered all pertinent areas of  contractors\u2019 security programs,  length of time needed to clear contractor facilities for access to  classified information, and  length of time needed to clear contractor personnel for access to  classified information.", "Such indicators are important. For example, according to DSS officials,  the indicator pertaining to the completion of security reviews provides  government customers assurances that industrial security representatives  are monitoring their contractors. The timeliness of clearances also matters  because the facility and its personnel cannot access classified information  in support of a government contract until DSS has cleared them. For each  of the indicators, DSS established specific performance goals. While DSS  did not meet all of its goals related to the timeliness of contractor facility  and personnel clearances, it met or exceeded the goals related to security  reviews. For example, DSS\u2019s goal is to conduct annual security reviews of  98 percent of the facilities that store classified information on site. In fiscal  year 2002, the most recent year for which data are available, DSS reported  meeting this goal.", "DSS also reported that it exceeded the goal of having 75 percent of its  security reviews cover all pertinent areas within contractor facilities\u2019  security programs. Based on a review of selected security review reports,  DSS determined that 86 percent of its security reviews conducted in fiscal  year 2002 covered all pertinent areas and accurately reflected the  contractor facilities\u2019 overall security posture. However, DSS measured its  achievement of this goal based on field office chiefs\u2019 selection and review  of about 550 of the approximately 9,000 reports completed by industrial  security representatives. This review does not focus on the quality of the  facilities\u2019 security programs or the representatives\u2019 review of those  programs. Instead, it is used to determine the completeness of the reports.", "These current goals and measures alone do not enable DSS to determine  whether its oversight is effectively ensuring that contractors protect  classified information. There are no goals related to how well facilities are  protecting classified information, which would provide an indication as to  whether DSS is achieving its mission. For example, while DSS evaluates  the completeness of security review reports submitted by industrial  security representatives, it does not evaluate its performance in terms of  the ratings and number of findings that result from security reviews. Nor  does DSS evaluate its performance in terms of the frequency of security  violations and information compromises occurring at contractor facilities.  By not assessing its performance based on factors such as facility  compliance with NISPOM requirements, DSS cannot determine whether  its oversight efforts are contributing to an increase or decrease in  facilities\u2019 compliance and the protection of classified information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS\u2019s Lack of Analysis Limits Its Ability to Determine If Its Oversight Reduces the Risk of Information Compromise", "paragraphs": ["DSS maintains records on how well contractor facilities protect classified  information but does not analyze these records.

Industrial security representatives maintain  a file folder on each facility they oversee. According to DSS officials, the  information contained in these file folders represents the official record on  each contractor facility. The folders are the primary means for  documenting information on facilities\u2019 security programs and  representatives\u2019 interactions with those facilities. The folders contain, in  paper copy form, information such as the facility\u2019s clearance level, identity  of the facility owner, results of the last two security reviews, and facility\u2019s  reports on security violations. Folders are kept with their respective  industrial security representatives throughout the country.", "An analysis of the types of security violations reported by facilities, their  causes, or corrective actions taken would require a manual review of each  file folder. According to DSS officials, DSS has not conducted such an  analysis in recent years nor has it made any other attempt to identify the  most common violations of the NISPOM or their causes. As a result, DSS  does not know whether certain types of violations are increasing or  decreasing or why such changes may be occurring. For example, DSS  officials told us that anecdotal evidence indicates that there are an  increasing number of security violations involving unsecured e-mail  transmission of classified information. However, DSS has no basis for  knowing what percentage of facilities have had such violations or how  significant any increase has been.", "By not analyzing the information contained in the file folders, DSS is  unable to identify patterns of security violations across all facilities based  on factors such as the type of work conducted at the facility, the facility\u2019s  government customer, or the facility\u2019s corporate affiliation. Officials at  several contractor facilities informed us that their security procedures are  developed and managed at the corporate level and, therefore, all facilities  owned by the corporation follow the same procedures. As a result,  security problems at one facility may indicate a more general,  corporatewide vulnerability. For example, an industrial security  representative attributed a series of violations at a facility owned by a  large corporation to that facility\u2019s inadequate security education program.  However, facility security officials told us that their education program  was developed at the corporate level, rather than by that facility. Because  DSS does not track violations and their causes across facilities, there was  no way to readily determine whether use of the corporate security  education program resulted in violations at other facilities.", "DSS recently created a new database to track the number of security  violations reported by facilities. Industrial security representatives are  required to enter into the database which facility reported the violation,  which field office is responsible for the facility, and the industrial security  representative\u2019s determination regarding whether information was  compromised. According to DSS officials, DSS will use the new database  to calculate the number of security violations nationwide and by region  and to track the amount of time representatives take to make a  determination after receiving facilities\u2019 violation reports. However,  because of the limited data it will contain, the database cannot be used to  identify common types and causes of security violations reported by  facilities.", "DSS also does not analyze information on the quality of facility security  programs, such as ratings and the number and types of findings from  DSS\u2019s security reviews. While DSS officials expressed interest in  eventually analyzing security review ratings and findings, they told us the  new database currently lacks this capability. DSS has not manually  reviewed the file folders and analyzed security review ratings to  determine, for example, whether the number of facilities meeting NISPOM  requirements is increasing or if security programs for facilities owned by  one corporation have consistently lower ratings than those owned by  another corporation. DSS also has not analyzed the security review  findings to identify the number and most common types of findings.

The industrial security representative  is to then review this information and, using the criteria specified in DSS\u2019s  Industrial Security Operating Manual, make one of four final  determinations: no compromise, suspected compromise, compromise, or  loss. Table 1 outlines the criteria for each determination.", "If a determination other than no compromise is made, the Industrial  Security Operating Manual directs the representative to inform the  government customer about the violation so a damage assessment can be  conducted. However, as shown in figure 1, for 39 of the 93 security  violations that we reviewed, industrial security representatives made no  determinations regarding the compromise or loss of classified  information. For example, in two cases where the same facility reported  the improper transmission of classified information via e-mail, DSS made  no determinations even though the facility reported the possibility of  compromise in both cases. In eight cases at another facility, employees  repeatedly failed to secure a safe room to ensure the protection of  classified information. DSS made no determinations in any of the eight  cases. In the absence of a determination, the industrial security  representatives did not notify the government customers of these  violations. The government customers, unaware of the violations, could  not take steps to assess and mitigate any damage that may have resulted.", "For 54 of the 93 violations we reviewed, representatives made  determinations regarding the compromise or loss of information, but the  majority were not consistent with the criteria contained in DSS\u2019s Industrial  Security Operating Manual.

For example, in nine cases, the same facility reported that classified  material was left unsecured, and the facility did not rule out compromise.  In each of these cases, the industrial security representative did not rule  out compromise but used an alternative determination. Senior DSS  officials informed us that industrial security representatives should not  make determinations other than the four established in the Industrial  Security Operating Manual because the four have specific meanings based  on accepted criteria. By not following the manual, representatives have  introduced variability in their determinations and, therefore, their  decisions of whether to notify the government customer of a violation.", "Among the 30 reported violations for which inappropriate determinations  were made, industrial security representatives notified the affected  government customers in 5 cases so the customers could assess and  mitigate any resulting damage. These cases included three violations  involving classified material that was left unsecured at the same facility.  For the remaining 25 reported violations, the customers were not made  aware of the violations even when the violations were similar to those  reported to other customers.", "The failure of representatives to always make determinations consistent  with the Industrial Security Operating Manual is at least partially  attributable to inadequate oversight. The Standards and Quality Branch is  the unit within DSS responsible for ensuring that industrial security  representatives properly administer the NISP. Branch officials regularly  test and review field office chiefs and representatives on NISP  requirements, particularly those related to granting clearances and  conducting security reviews. According to DSS officials, the results of  these tests and reviews are used to design training courses that address  weaknesses in job skills. However, the Standards and Quality Branch does  not test or review how representatives respond to reported violations and  make determinations regarding compromise. As a result, DSS does not  know the extent to which representatives understand and are consistently  applying Industrial Security Operating Manual requirements related to  violations and, therefore, cannot make necessary revisions to training and  guidance.", "In addition, field office chiefs are responsible for supervising and ensuring  the quality of industrial security representatives\u2019 day-to-day oversight of  contractors. However, there is no specific requirement in the Industrial  Security Operating Manual for field office chiefs to review their industrial  security representatives\u2019 determinations regarding reported security  violations. We found no evidence that chiefs reviewed the cases in which  the representatives either did not make determinations or made  determinations that were inconsistent with the manual. Further, chiefs  may not fully understand the manual\u2019s criteria for determinations. For  example, one field office chief we met with tracked the industrial security  representatives\u2019 processing of reported security violations by using a  categorization sheet containing the inappropriate determination  \u201ccompromise not precluded.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS Is Not Always Able to Quickly Notify Government Customers about Violations", "paragraphs": ["While the Industrial Security Operating Manual does not specify a time  requirement for notifying government customers when classified  information has been lost or compromised, DSS is frequently unable to  notify customers quickly because of difficulties in identifying the affected  customers. DSS notified government customers regarding 16 of the 54  reported violations for which representatives made determinations. Figure  2 shows that for 11 of these 16 violations, DSS did not notify the customer  for more than 30 days after the contractor reported that information was  lost, compromised, or suspected of being compromised. In one case,  5 months passed before an industrial security representative was able to  notify a government customer that its information was suspected of being  compromised.

However, when the facility is  operating as a subcontractor, it may not be aware of the government  customer\u2019s identity. In such instances, the subcontractor may have to  work with the prime contractor to identify the government customer to  provide the industrial security representative with this information. In one  case we reviewed, a subcontractor made repeated attempts over a 5- month period to obtain the affected government customer\u2019s identity from  the prime contractor. In another case, an official with a subcontractor  facility informed us that it was extremely difficult and time-consuming for  him to identify the affected government customer, which took  approximately 2 months.

While agreeing that its performance measures are not results- oriented, DOD stated that DSS is able to provide assurances regarding the  protection of classified information through its security reviews. For  99 percent of security reviews, according to DOD, contractors were found  to be satisfactorily protecting classified information. Additionally, DOD  indicated that the problems we identified with security violations and  possible information compromises were purely administrative. DOD stated  it assumes that DSS\u2019s current processes for handling security violations  and possible information compromises did not leave classified information  at risk.", "While contractors are ultimately responsible for protecting the classified  information entrusted to them, DSS is charged with ensuring that  contractors fulfill this obligation. Our review focused on how effectively  DSS\u2019s oversight ensures that contractors protect classified information. As  explained in our report, DSS does not assess the effectiveness of its  oversight based on how well contractors are protecting information from  compromise nor does it analyze data to identify systemic vulnerabilities in  contractors\u2019 protection of classified information. Therefore, DSS cannot  provide adequate assurances that its oversight ensures the protection of  classified information. DSS is also hindered in its ability to identify and  implement corrective changes to reduce the risk of information  compromises resulting from security violations.

Also, by focusing only on security review ratings, DOD is  overlooking other indicators\u2014such as security review findings and  incidents of possible compromise\u2014that could enable DSS to improve its  oversight. Further, the rating may not be an adequate measure of  effectiveness. First, an industrial security representative can rate a  facility\u2019s security program as satisfactory even if the facility does not fully  comply with the NISPOM and its failure to do so could logically lead to  information compromise. Second, because DSS does not track information  on security review ratings and violations, it cannot establish whether there  is a correlation between a facility\u2019s rating and the frequency and  seriousness of that facility\u2019s violations and information compromises.  Finally, as we noted in our report, DSS\u2019s security review quality metric is  based not on the quality of reviews, but rather on the completeness of  industrial security representatives\u2019 reports. Also, the manner in which field  office chiefs select reports for the quality review is not statistically valid  and, therefore, DSS cannot draw conclusions about the quality of security  review reports nationwide based on that quality review.", "The problems we identified with DSS\u2019s response to security violations and  possible information compromises go beyond administrative processing.  Our findings focus on whether DSS has fulfilled its oversight  responsibilities. As DOD noted in its comments, DSS is responsible for  determining whether a violation has resulted in compromise, ensuring that  the contractor took corrective action, and notifying the government  customer. Yet, as discussed in our report, industrial security  representatives failed, in 39 of the 93 security violations we reviewed, to  determine whether the violations resulted in the loss, compromise, or  suspected compromise of classified information. For an additional 30  violations, representatives made inappropriate determinations, which  created variability in their decisions on whether to notify the government  customer of a violation. Absent a determination consistent with the  Industrial Security Operating Manual, one cannot draw conclusions on  whether the contractor conducted an adequate inquiry into the violation  and took corrective action to prevent its recurrence. Therefore, we cannot  agree with DOD\u2019s assumption that weaknesses in DSS\u2019s handling of  security violations did not leave classified material at risk.

We also assessed DSS\u2019s performance goals  and measures contained in its strategic plan and annual report against our  reports related to the Government Performance and Results Act and  internal controls. We discussed the development of DSS goals, objectives,  and performance metrics with DSS officials. To become more familiar  with the roles and responsibilities of DSS staff, particularly as they relate  to maintaining information on facility security programs, we reviewed  DSS\u2019s training materials, the Industrial Security Operating Manual, and  selected facility file folders. We also discussed with DSS officials at  headquarters and field locations how they use the information in the  facility file folders to manage the industrial security program and oversee  contractor facilities.", "To assess adherence to required procedures by DSS after a security  violation and possible compromise of classified information, we used a  case study approach. Using DSS\u2019s Facilities Database, we selected cases  from all facilities participating in the NISP as of March 2003. We reviewed  the data and identified facilities that reported to DSS security violations  since January 1, 2001, and selected 13 cleared facilities that varied  according to size, clearance level, and geographic location. For those  13 facilities, we reviewed DSS\u2019s official facility file folders and identified  93 reported violations. For those violations, we examined DSS\u2019s actions to  determine whether industrial security representatives and field office  chiefs handled these reports in accordance with the Industrial Security  Operating Manual. We also spoke with representatives and chiefs  regarding the actions they take after receiving violation reports. We  analyzed the information in DSS\u2019s files on the 13 facilities and their  violations to identify the determinations made by industrial security  representatives, how frequently government customers were contacted,  and the timeliness of government customer notification. In addition, we  visited the facilities selected for our case study and interviewed those  facilities\u2019 security officials to obtain clarification and additional  information about the reported security violations and actions taken by  DSS. Because we did not take a statistical sample of facilities, the results  from our analyses cannot be generalized. We also did not assess the  reliability of the Facilities Database as a whole. However, we confirmed  that the data used to select the 13 cases, specifically the facility size and  clearance level, were consistent with the information in the facility files  we reviewed.", "We performed our review from March 2003 through January 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Defense\u2019s letter  dated February 12, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Our report recognizes that contractors are responsible for protecting  classified information entrusted to them. However, the focus of the report  is how well DSS is fulfilling its mission to ensure that contractors are  protecting classified information. We clearly state that DSS\u2019s inability to  assess whether it is fulfilling its mission does not necessarily mean that  contractors are not protecting the classified information entrusted to  them.  2. We are uncertain of how DOD determined that 99 percent of cleared  contractors were awarded satisfactory ratings nor do we know what time  period this percentage covers and whether it has varied over time.  However, for DSS to effectively manage its oversight, it needs to regularly  analyze data and examine trends regarding the protection of classified  information over time instead of producing the data to fulfill a one-time  information request.  3. The results of our case studies can and do indicate serious weaknesses  in how DSS oversees contractor facilities even though they cannot be  generalized because, as discussed in appendix I, we did not take a  statistical sample.   4. Our report identifies shortcomings in DSS\u2019s ability to evaluate whether it  is fulfilling its mission, make informed management decisions, and ensure  that industrial security representatives properly resolve security violations  and possible information compromises. Our report offers specific  recommendations for improvement, all of which DOD agreed to  implement.   5. It is unclear from DOD\u2019s comments what other measures DSS relies on  to determine success in accomplishing its mission. Our review assessed  the goals and measures established by DSS and found that they do not  provide a basis for determining whether DSS is fulfilling its mission.  6. Maintaining the prime contract numbers for all tiers of contracts in a  new information management system may not be sufficient to ensure that  government customers are readily notified of a loss or compromise. In at  least two cases we reviewed, industrial security representatives informed  subcontractor facility officials that, in addition to the prime contract  number, the name and complete address of the government customer and  a point of contact needed to be provided before DSS could process the  violation. In one case, an official at a subcontractor facility informed the  representative that such information was not readily available on the  DD Form 254, which is designed to provide a contractor with the security  requirements and classification guidance needed for the performance of a  classified contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Johana R.
