This report examines, among other things, (1) how DOE offices evaluated M&O contractor performance in fiscal years 2006 through 2016; (2) the extent to which DOE's fiscal year 2016 M&O contractor PERs provide information on contractors' technical, administrative, and cost performance; and (3) the results of DOE's M&O contractor performance evaluations for fiscal years 2006 through 2016.", "GAO reviewed performance evaluation documents for 21 of the 22 DOE M&O contracts; analyzed DOE policies, procedures, and guidelines, and federal regulations; analyzed technical, administrative, and cost aspects of M&O contracts' 2016 PERs; and interviewed DOE officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2006 through 2016, six offices within the Department of Energy (DOE) generally used one of three different approaches to evaluate management and operating (M&O) contractor performance. Although these approaches varied in the performance criteria and methodologies used for determining contractor ratings and incentives, all the offices annually set expectations for contractors and assessed performance.", "In analyzing DOE's fiscal year 2016 Performance Evaluation Reports (PER), GAO found that these reports provided less information on M&O contractors' cost performance than on contractors' technical and administrative performance. The cost information provided in the PERs often was not detailed, did not indicate the significance of the performance being described, and applied only to specific activities. Further, the information is of limited use for acquisition decision-making, such as deciding whether to extend the length of a contract, because it does not permit an overall assessment of cost performance. A key reason PERs did not include more cost performance information is that the DOE offices' policies do not require specific assessments of cost performance or discuss how to ensure cost information is useful for future acquisition decision-making. By updating policies to require inclusion of quality cost performance information in PERs, DOE offices could better assess M&O contractors' costs, improve acquisition decision-making, and ensure performance evaluations fully address required elements.", "Based on GAO's review of DOE M&O contractor performance evaluations from fiscal years 2006 through 2016, DOE generally provided high performance ratings and more than 90 percent of available performance incentives (see figure). Ratings for some areas of contractor performance, as well as ratings for contractor performance at specific DOE sites, varied from this trend. For example, three times during this period contractors received 50 percent or less of available award and incentive fees due to a major accident and safety and security issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to DOE, including to each of the six DOE offices to update their policies requiring that PERs include quality information to enable an overall assessment of M&O contractor cost performance.

DOE relies extensively on M&O  contracts to manage and operate many of its government-owned,  contractor-operated sites. DOE\u2019s diverse missions are carried out at  these sites, including developing, maintaining, and securing the nation\u2019s  nuclear weapons capability and conducting basic energy and science  research and development. According to DOE\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 Agency  Financial Report, DOE spends approximately 90 percent of its annual  budget on contracts. As we and the DOE Inspector General have  previously found, DOE and its contractors face several management  challenges involving large future costs, including nuclear weapon  modernization, environmental liabilities, and aging and degraded  infrastructure. Because of DOE\u2019s reliance on M&O contracts, contract  management is critical to the agency\u2019s ability to successfully and cost- effectively meet these challenges.", "DOE manages and oversees its M&O contractors through a variety of  means, including a performance evaluation process that evaluates  contractor performance, reports on those evaluations, and rewards or  penalizes contractors. Contractor performance evaluation reports cover a  wide range of activities due to the significant size and scope of M&O  contracts. These reports help form the basis of a contractor\u2019s  performance record, which DOE and other agencies consider in awarding  future contracts. Further, when an M&O contract has reached the end of  its contract term, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DOE  policy require DOE to consider the contractor\u2019s technical, administrative,  and cost performance before deciding whether to extend the contract or  open it up for competitive bids.", "DOE\u2019s history of inadequate management and oversight of its contractors  has led us, since 1990, to designate aspects of the department\u2019s contract  management as a high-risk area vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement. In January 2009, to recognize progress made at  DOE\u2019s Office of Science, we narrowed the focus of the department\u2019s high- risk designation to two DOE offices: the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA) and the Office of Environmental Management  (EM). In February 2013, we further narrowed the focus of DOE\u2019s high- risk designation to major projects and contracts (i.e., those with values of  at least $750 million) within these two DOE offices, to acknowledge  progress made in managing smaller-value efforts.", "Our recent reports and those from the DOE Inspector General, as well as  from commissions, task forces, and other outside groups, have  highlighted ongoing challenges with DOE\u2019s contracting and contract  management. For example, the Congressional Advisory Panel on  Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise (also known as the  Augustine-Mies Panel) and the Commission to Review the Effectiveness  of the National Energy Laboratories (CRENEL) recommended various  measures for reforming DOE\u2019s M&O contractor management and  oversight, including DOE\u2019s use of performance incentives. DOE also  recognizes that it has faced long-standing challenges in managing its  contracts, as outlined in a recent memo from the Deputy Secretary calling  for comprehensive reforms to improve acquisition management.", "You asked us to review DOE\u2019s performance management of its M&O  contracts.

We also reviewed  documentation for the remaining contract\u2014the Bettis and Knolls Atomic  Power Laboratories\u2019 M&O contract\u2014but excluded it from our analysis  because the contract did not have award fee and annual performance  evaluation reports comparable to the other DOE M&O contracts. We did  not examine performance evaluations or incentives provided outside the  main M&O contract performance evaluation reports for contracts that had  separate contract line items for certain projects with separate  performance evaluations. We also interviewed DOE officials to gain a further understanding of the department\u2019s performance evaluation  processes and results.", "To examine how DOE offices have evaluated M&O contractor  performance and the extent to which these offices have policies and  procedures to guide these processes, we reviewed DOE\u2019s policies and  procedures for performance evaluations, as well as policies and  procedures from each of the six DOE offices with M&O contracts. We  also reviewed annual performance evaluation plans and performance  evaluation reports from fiscal years 2006 through 2016. We selected  this period to provide 10 years of data on M&O contractors, and fiscal  year 2016 was the latest year for which data were available when we  began our engagement.", "To evaluate the extent to which performance evaluation reports provided  information on each of the performance areas outlined in the FAR\u2014 technical, administrative, and cost\u2014we performed content analysis of 22  DOE fiscal year 2016 performance evaluation reports for M&O  contractors. We examined the quality of the cost performance  information contained in the DOE fiscal year 2016 performance  evaluation reports by comparing the information contained in those  reports to the definition DOE provided for \u201cquality\u201d in its Information  Quality Guidelines. These guidelines apply to information DOE makes  available publicly, which includes many performance evaluation reports.", "To examine the results of DOE\u2019s M&O contractor performance  evaluations for fiscal years 2006 through 2016, we analyzed performance  ratings and incentives awarded in performance evaluation reports, fee  determination letters, and other performance evaluation documents. To  compare performance ratings and incentives provided to contractors at  M&O sites, we analyzed and provided information by \u201ccontract rating  sites\u201d rather than individual contractors or physical sites, because the  individual contractors and how certain sites align with the contracts  changed over time. Accordingly, we analyzed 24 distinct contract rating  sites covered by 21 M&O contracts in place as of fiscal year 2016. There  are three more contract rating sites than the number of contracts in 2016;  two were because two individual contracts were consolidated into one  contract during the period we covered\u2014we analyzed the two individual  contracts from prior to 2014 separately from the current consolidated  contract\u2014and the third was because two DOE offices separately  evaluated the performance of a single contractor that performed activities  for each of those offices.", "To analyze and summarize performance ratings and incentives awarded,  we used rating, award fee, and incentive fee information from 239  performance evaluations at the 24 contract rating sites. We did not  include fee ratings from years in which award or incentive fees were not  available.

DOE relies on contracts in general, and M&O  contracts in particular, to do this work. According to DOE\u2019s Fiscal Year  2017 Agency Financial Report, the department spends approximately 90  percent of its annual budget on contracts, and in fiscal year 2016 DOE  managed contracts valued at more than $24 billion. Of that amount, DOE  spent approximately 80 percent on its M&O contracts.", "The work is closely related to the  agency\u2019s mission and is of a long-term or  continuing nature, and there is a need to  ensure its continuity and for protection  covering the orderly transition of  personnel and work in the event of a  change in contractors. and sites that are contaminated from decades of nuclear weapons  production and nuclear energy research.", "The Office of Fossil Energy (FE) manages the nation\u2019s Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, which is an emergency stockpile of oil stored in  underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana.", "NNSA, a separately organized agency within DOE, is responsible for  maintaining and enhancing the safety, reliability, and performance of  the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile, promoting international  nuclear safety and nonproliferation, and supporting U.S. leadership in  science and technology, among other things.", "The Office of Nuclear Energy\u2019s (NE) primary mission is to advance  nuclear power as a resource capable of making major contributions in  meeting the nation\u2019s clean energy supply and energy security needs.", "The Office of Science (SC) supports scientific research for energy and  the physical sciences both by supporting (1) such research, and (2)  the development, construction, and operation of scientific user  facilities.", "These DOE offices use M&O contracts to carry out their research and  development, nuclear weapons production, and other missions. For  example, for research and development, DOE is the nation\u2019s single  largest funding source for basic physical sciences research, supporting  research in energy sciences, advanced scientific computing, physics, and  other fields. For weapons production, NNSA uses production sites to  maintain, evaluate, repair, and dismantle both the nuclear and non- nuclear components for nuclear weapons; manufacture weapons  components; and process tritium, a key isotope used to enhance the  power of nuclear weapons. DOE also uses M&O contracts for sites  dedicated to other types of missions, including nuclear waste disposal  and an emergency stockpile of oil. Figure 1 and appendix II provide  additional information on DOE\u2019s M&O contracts.", "In August 2016, we identified three key attributes associated with DOE\u2019s  M&O contracts. First, M&O contracts have a limited competitive  environment\u2014we found that about half of DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2015 M&O  contract spending was on contracts awarded noncompetitively or that  received a single offer at the time they were competed. In addition, M&O  contracts include longer terms than other federal contracts, so they are  competed less frequently. Second, DOE M&O contracts have broad  scopes of work that cover nearly all aspects of work at a site. In particular,  though mission activities of M&O contractors can be highly technical,  mission support activities generally accounted for about 25 to 50 percent  of contractors\u2019 total costs in fiscal year 2015, and encompassed such  things as managing infrastructure, facilities, and grounds; security; and  the internal audit function. Third, M&O contracts and DOE management  practices contribute to a closer relationship between contractors and the  government. For example, M&O contractors are generally more  integrated with DOE in how they are paid and in their accounting systems  than other types of contractors. With regard to payment, rather than  traditional bill payment methods including invoices, payment approval and  authorization, and disbursement of funds, M&O contractors can draw  funds directly from federal accounts through \u201cletter of credit financing.\u201d", "With regard to accounting systems, as we reported in August 2016, DOE  requires M&O contractors to follow DOE\u2019s Accounting Handbook and  integrate their costs and liabilities in DOE\u2019s accounts each month. DOE  officials said that this provides visibility into contractor accounts and  allows DOE to monitor the appropriateness of the contractors\u2019 withdrawal  of funds in near real time. According to DOE officials, this integration  carries over into how the value of contracts are determined\u2014rather than  establishing the cost of the contract at the time of contract award, the  value of the M&O contract is determined by the amount annually  obligated on the contract by DOE, consistent with DOE\u2019s annual  congressional appropriations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentives in M&O Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Cost-reimbursement type contracts allow the agency to contract for work  when circumstances do not allow the agency to sufficiently define its  requirements or estimate its costs to allow for a fixed-price contract.  Under a fixed-price contract, a contractor accepts responsibility for  completing a specified amount of work for a fixed price. In contrast, under  cost-reimbursement contracts, the government reimburses a contractor  for allowable costs incurred, to the extent prescribed by the contract. The  government may also pay a fee that is either fixed at the outset of the  contract or adjustable based on performance criteria set out in the  contract.", "In September 2009, we reported that cost-reimbursement contracts are  considered high risk for the government because of the potential for cost  escalation and because the government pays a contractor\u2019s costs of  performance regardless of whether the work is completed. As such,  cost-reimbursement contracts are suitable only when (1) circumstances  do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for  a fixed-price type contract; or (2) uncertainties involved in contract  performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy  to use any type of fixed-price contract. One major reason for the inability  to accurately estimate costs is the lack of knowledge of the work needed  to meet the requirements of the contract, such as with research contracts,  which necessarily involve substantial uncertainties. The DOE Acquisition  Regulation (DEAR) states that cost-plus-award-fee (cost reimbursement)  contracts are generally the appropriate contract type for M&O contracts  and that the agency can choose among a number of different contract  types for its M&O contracts.", "Under the FAR, cost-reimbursement contracts may include specific  incentives, such as arrangements intended to improve contractor efforts  and discourage inefficiency and waste. Table 1 provides definitions of  incentives commonly included in DOE\u2019s M&O contracts.", "Generally, according to DOE officials, award fees and incentive fees are  intended to motivate M&O contractor performance on an annual basis, as  outlined in annual performance evaluation plans. All DOE M&O contracts  GAO analyzed also include \u201cconditional payment of fee\u201d clauses that  permit the agency to reduce an otherwise earned fee if it determines that  the contractor\u2019s performance did not meet minimum requirements, such  as those related to safety, health, or the environment. Under the award  term incentive, contractors can earn one additional year of performance  under the contract for each year they exceed certain thresholds in their  annual performance evaluations. (See apps. III through VIII for additional  information on the incentives included in each M&O contract, by DOE  office.)", "In addition, other elements of contract administration or oversight, while  not formally incentives, can influence contractor performance. For  example, option periods\u2014which are established in the contract\u2014enable  the government to unilaterally extend the performance period and  performance of services. According to DOE officials, other potentially  important influences on contractor behavior include public reputation and  the ability to compete for follow-on DOE or other government contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Evaluation and Award Fee Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The FAR, DEAR, DOE\u2019s Acquisition Guide, and DOE policies provide  requirements and guidance for DOE\u2019s annual performance evaluations of  contractor performance. Under the FAR, all contracts providing for award  fees must be supported by an award fee plan that establishes procedures  for evaluating award fees and an Award Fee Board to conduct award fee  evaluations. A Fee Determining Official makes the final determination  regarding the amount of award fee the contractor earns during the  evaluation period. Additionally, the FAR generally calls for entities that  administer contracts providing award fees to use a set of ratings from  Excellent to Unsatisfactory, which include performance descriptions and  associated available award fee percentages (see Table 2 below). Award  fee ratings are associated with a range of percentages of the total  available award fee that DOE offices may award to a contractor based on  the contractor\u2019s assessed performance.", "DOE offices develop two primary documents to guide and report  assessments of contractors\u2019 performance for each fiscal year: a  Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan (PEMP) and a  Performance Evaluation Report (PER). The PEMP is to be developed at  the beginning of each fiscal year\u2014which is the beginning of the  evaluation period\u2014and is to establish expectations for contractor  performance and describe how the responsible DOE office will evaluate  and measure performance against those expectations. The PEMP  provides the blueprint for what performance is expected of contractors,  how contractors\u2019 performance will be evaluated, and how the evaluations  will be used to determine award fees, award terms, and any other  incentives. The PER is to be developed at the end of each evaluation  period\u2014which typically is the end of the fiscal year\u2014and is the  responsible DOE office\u2019s evaluation of contractor performance, in which  DOE documents the performance rating and, in some cases, the fees and  other incentives that will be awarded to the contractor. Figure 2 shows the  general steps of DOE\u2019s performance evaluation of contractors.", "Further, under the FAR and DOE policy, the department is to consider  technical, administrative, and cost performance during acquisition  planning. The FAR provides that, for M&O contracts, replacement of an  incumbent contractor is largely based on an expectation of meaningful  improvement in performance or cost; thus, an agency or department  should consider three categories of performance\u2014technical,  administrative, and cost\u2014when deciding whether to extend or compete a  contract at the end of the contract\u2019s term. According to DOE officials,  the annual performance evaluation process and the related PER are  important sources of information for making these decisions. Thus, the  PER should include relevant information on an M&O contractor\u2019s  technical, administrative, and cost performance. For DOE, the M&O  contract PER is also important because DOE uses information from the  PER to update a contractor\u2019s past performance information in the  Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which  DOE and other agencies use to understand a contractor\u2019s performance  history and to inform their evaluations of future contract proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracting and Performance Challenges Involving DOE\u2019s M&O Contracts", "paragraphs": ["A number of commissions, task forces, and other outside groups have  identified challenges involving DOE\u2019s M&O contracts.

The 2014  Augustine-Mies report focused on NNSA and made numerous  recommendations for comprehensive reforms, including addressing  dysfunctional government-M&O contractor relationships, improving  oversight of M&O contractors, and reforming award fee and performance  incentive structures. CRENEL, taking a broader view of all 17 national  laboratories across DOE, in 2015 found a similar erosion of trust between  DOE and some of its M&O contractors while noting that some  laboratories, in particular those under SC, had better, more effective  relationships. The CRENEL report recommended reforms to the  management and oversight of M&O contractors and performance  incentive structures. In addition to challenges, CRENEL also noted that  SC\u2019s annual performance evaluation and planning processes were robust  and suggested that they be adapted by other DOE offices.", "NNSA\u2019s and EM\u2019s contract management remains on our High-Risk List  for government operations vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement.

These reports include the following examples:", "Since 2005, during various reviews, we found that cost accounting  practices used by NNSA\u2019s M&O contractors have varied, making it  difficult for NNSA to compare costs across its sites or accurately  identify the total costs across its nuclear security enterprise and to  obtain reliable cost data. In January 2017, we reported on the  importance of reliable enterprise-wide cost information to effective  management and oversight and found that the plan NNSA submitted  to Congress in 2016 to improve and integrate its financial  management, as required by Congress in 2013, did not provide a  useful road map for guiding NNSA\u2019s efforts. We recommended that  NNSA develop a plan for producing cost information that fully  incorporates leading planning practices. NNSA agreed, and we are  monitoring implementation of the recommendation.", "In October 2014, we reported on actions taken to address challenges  with the Uranium Processing Facility under construction at the NNSA  Production Office Sites (specifically at the Y-12 National Security  Complex), which is managed by the M&O contractor at that site. A  challenge with this facility was that in July 2012 the M&O contractor  concluded that required equipment would not fit into the facility as  designed and that addressing this issue would cost an additional $540  million. NNSA\u2019s analysis of the factors that contributed to this issue  identified several causes, including project oversight deficiencies\u2014 specifically, failure to ensure that requests and directives from NNSA  to the contractor were implemented.", "In May 2015, we reported on NNSA\u2019s use of contractor assurance  systems to conduct oversight and evaluate the performance of M&O  contractors. Contractor assurance systems are designed and used  by M&O contractors to oversee their own performance and to self- identify and correct potential problems. We found that NNSA had not  fully established policies or guidance for using information from these  systems to conduct oversight of M&O contractors and that NNSA  therefore did not have standards for ensuring that contractors are  overseen consistently. We recommended that NNSA establish  policies and guidance for using information from contractor assurance  systems for the oversight of M&O contractors; NNSA concurred with  the recommendations and has taken some steps to establish policies  and guidance, though it has not yet fully addressed our  recommendations.", "In March 2017, we reported that DOE needed quality data to manage  its risk of fraud and recommended that DOE require contractors to  maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that are  reconcilable with amounts charged to the government. DOE did not  concur with the recommendation and has not taken steps to  implement it. Because DOE does not require its contractors to  maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that are  reconcilable with amounts charged to DOE, it is not well positioned to  employ data analytics as a fraud detection tool.

The Science and Energy Lab and NNSA  approaches use primarily subjective criteria, and the Site Specific  approach uses primarily objective criteria. Subjective criteria are generally  qualitative statements that describe desired contractor performance,  according to DOE officials. For example, a subjective criterion that SC  used during fiscal year 2016 was for contractors to \u201cprovide effective and  efficient strategic planning and stewardship of scientific capabilities and  program vision.\u201d In contrast, DOE officials explained that objective criteria  generally describe performance that may be measured on a \u201cpass/fail\u201d or quantitative basis. For example, FE used objective criteria such as  developing a strategic plan by a specific date or ensuring that all phases  of construction were mechanically complete regarding the conversion of a  tank.", "Performance criteria under the Science and Energy Lab and NNSA  approaches share a similar structure of three tiers of criteria: goals,  objectives, and notable outcomes (called key outcomes under NNSA\u2019s  approach). The criteria are also mostly subjective and broad enough to be  consistent across all the contracts of the responsible DOE office. Based  on our review of DOE documents and information, SC and EERE have  used the Science and Energy Lab approach since fiscal year 2006 and  NE since fiscal year 2007. NNSA used the NNSA approach in fiscal  years 2013 through 2016.", "Under the Science and Energy Lab and NNSA approaches, goals are  general overarching statements of the desired outcomes for each major  performance area under the contract and constitute the highest  performance criteria used to evaluate contractor performance. Based on  documentation describing these approaches, goals are to be composed  of at least two objectives, which are statements of desired results for an  organization or activity and that discuss specific actions the contractor will  undertake to accomplish a goal. Each office uses its respective goals and  objectives consistently for each of its M&O contracts (EERE and NE each  have only one site) and generally cover the same functional areas across  the offices, though some NNSA goals focus specifically on NNSA\u2019s  nuclear weapons and national security missions. For complete lists of  goals and objectives used by the offices using the Science and Energy  Lab and NNSA approaches, see appendixes III, VI, VII, and VIII.", "The third tier performance criteria used to evaluate contractor  performance is the notable outcome, which, according to agency  documents, is intended to focus the contractor on specific items that  officials identified as the most important initiatives or highest risk issues  the contractor must address. According to DOE documents, notable  outcomes differ from goals and objectives in that they (1) are usually  objective, (2) are specific to each contractor, and (3) change from year to  year. However, not all goals and objectives have associated notable  outcomes. Figure 3 provides an example of the relationship between a  goal and its related objectives and notable outcomes for SC\u2019s  Brookhaven National Laboratory contractor for fiscal year 2016.", "Our review of agency documents found that the Site Specific approach  consists primarily of objective performance criteria that are specific to  each contract, as well as a few broader, objective criteria. This is in  contrast to the other two DOE approaches to performance evaluation,  which primarily rely on broad, subjective criteria and a few objective  criteria. Based on our discussions with agency officials, both EM and FE  have generally used this Site Specific approach since fiscal year 2006.  For both offices, objective performance criteria are defined based on  quantifiable metrics (e.g., a contractor\u2019s demonstrated waste processing  rate) and milestones (e.g., whether a contractor completed a task on or  before a scheduled date). For example, one of FE\u2019s fiscal year 2016  objective performance criteria for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve M&O  contract is whether facilities and systems functioned at a level adequate  to meet program requirements based on average scores from its  Maintenance Performance Appraisal Rating tool. Further, our review of  agency documents showed that the Site Specific approach uses  subjective performance criteria for aspects of performance that may be  difficult to capture objectively\u2014such as determining how effectively  measures a contractor has taken have prevented harm to workers, the  general public, and the environment. (See apps. IV and V for examples of  the objective and subjective criteria EM and FE use.)", "Prior to fiscal year 2013, NNSA also used the Site Specific approach, and  it had specific, objective performance criteria that varied by contract.  Based on our review of agency documents, NNSA\u2019s performance criteria  were generally divided into four performance areas: (1) mission, (2)  operations, (3) business, and (4) multi-site. According to NNSA officials,  as a result of \u201clessons learned\u201d efforts, NNSA updated this approach to its  current one to provide more succinct, structured, and consistent reporting  by ensuring that all NNSA M&O contractors have identical goals and  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodologies Used to Determine Contractor Ratings", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of DOE documents, rating methodologies vary  across the three approaches\u2014the Science and Energy Lab approach  uses a detailed, formulaic methodology; the NNSA approach determines  ratings at a series of management meetings; and in the Site Specific  approach, ratings depend primarily on whether the contractor  accomplishes specific tasks.", "Based on our review of agency documents, under the Science and  Energy Lab approach, stakeholders\u2014including officials from  headquarters, field offices, and internal and external customers\u2014 generally evaluate contractor performance against the criteria for each  objective and notable outcome (\u201clab customers\u201d evaluate objectives under  science and technology goals only). Their evaluations, in the form of  narratives and numerical scores, are entered into a web-based  information collection tool that aggregates the scores using a series of  calculations and weights to generate ratings that are then approved by  the Fee Determining Official for the responsible DOE office. For  example, for SC, once individual stakeholders enter objectives\u2019 scores  into the Laboratory Rating Tool, those scores are then weighted and  added together through a predetermined formula to provide an overall  rating of contractor performance for each goal. Under this approach, the  Laboratory Rating Tool aggregates the objective scores into numerical  goal ratings and corresponding letter grades from 4.3 (A+) to 0 (F) for the  contractor. Notable outcomes are rated on a \u201cpass/fail\u201d basis, meaning  that the contractor either met or did not meet them. Receiving a passing  rating for the notable outcome is required for the contractor to earn a B+  or better for the notable outcome\u2019s associated objective. Thus, although  notable outcomes are not given their own numerical score or letter grade,  they can have a significant effect on a contractor\u2019s objective ratings and,  ultimately, goal ratings. (See apps. III, VII, and VIII for examples of the  weighting and calculations involved in aggregating ratings for EERE, NE,  and SC M&O contractors.)", "Based on our review of agency information, the methodology for the  NNSA approach to determine contractor ratings entails officials holding a  series of meetings to review various internally developed periodic reports  and other inputs (e.g., contractor self-assessments and inspection  reports). The participants in these meetings include field office managers,  program managers, and NNSA executive leadership who collaboratively  review contractor performance and determine ratings. According to NNSA  officials, at these meetings NNSA collaboratively reviews all M&O  contracts across the NNSA complex, thereby allowing officials to weigh  and compare performance. The Fee Determining Official determines the  final performance ratings for each M&O contractor using rating categories  from the FAR: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Satisfactory, and  Unsatisfactory. NNSA does not use numerical calculations to score and  weigh individual objectives or goals. Instead, NNSA officials use  professional judgment to determine overall goal ratings.", "Based on our review of agency information, under the Site Specific  approach, field office officials rate contractor performance against  objective performance criteria quantitatively or pass/fail and rate  subjective performance criteria using FAR award fee categories. That is,  they evaluate performance against objective performance criteria as  completed or not completed\u2014for example, whether the contractor  packaged 10 waste drums during the fiscal year. For the subjective  performance criteria, officials assign ratings using the FAR rating  categories in a similar manner to the NNSA approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodologies Used to Determine Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of DOE documents, the three performance  evaluation approaches also use different methodologies for determining  award and incentive fees, and two offices use similar methods to  determine whether the contractor receives award term. Based on our  review of agency documents, under the Science and Energy Lab  approach, once ratings are determined, several additional detailed  calculations determine how much of the available award fee is provided to  the contractor. Precisely how ratings are weighted to determine fee differs  by DOE office, but generally performance in technical areas is more  important in determining the amount of fee the contractor earns. For  example, SC determines award fees based on the contractor\u2019s final  science and technology area rating and adjusts that fee if the final  management and operations area rating is 3.0 (grade B) or below. (See  app. VIII for additional information on SC\u2019s fee determination, app. III for  EERE, and app. VII for NE.)", "Based on our review of agency information, under the NNSA approach,  officials assign goals specific portions of the available award fee for each  contract at the beginning of the fiscal year. At the end of the fiscal year,  officials determine ratings and fees at the same time in the collaborative  meeting with NNSA leadership. For example, for the Los Alamos National  Laboratory contractor in fiscal year 2016, the nuclear weapons goal was  30 percent of fee, and the operations and infrastructure goal was 35  percent. As discussed earlier, the Fee Determining Official makes the  final determination on the ratings and also determines how much fee to  provide the contractor within the range defined by the FAR rating  (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory). In fiscal year  2016, NNSA awarded the Los Alamos National Laboratory M&O  contractor an \u201cExcellent\u201d rating for the nuclear weapons goal, which is  associated with the contractor earning from 91 to 100 percent of the  available fee for that goal. To determine the overall award fee for the  contract, NNSA adds up the award fees for all of its goals. (See app. VI  for an example of a NNSA fee determination letter.)", "Our review of DOE documents showed that the Site Specific approach  has a different process for determining incentive and award fees,  depending on whether the fee is tied to objective or subjective  performance criteria. According to agency officials and documents, the  Site Specific approach generally provides more money toward incentive  fees tied to objective criteria than to award fees tied to subjective  criteria\u2014about 60 to 75 percent of available fee money goes to incentive  fees. Incentive fees tied to objective performance criteria are awarded  based on completion of the specific tasks or quantitative targets defined  by the performance criteria. For example, one of the objective  performance criteria for EM\u2019s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) M&O  contractor in fiscal year 2016 was to develop a maintenance and  engineering program, called the Material Condition and Aging  Management Program, and complete certain program activities. EM set  a maximum incentive fee of $500,000 in the PEMP to be awarded upon  completion of the activities.", "In regard to award fees that are tied to subjective performance criteria  under the Site Specific approach, offices using this approach take a  similar method to the NNSA approach, in that they determine ratings and  fees simultaneously. Specific portions of an available award fee are  assigned to subjective performance criteria at the beginning of the fiscal  year and documented in the PEMP, and officials then determine the  percentage of fee to award and corresponding ratings from the FAR  award fee categories for each subjective performance criterion. The final  decision on the percentage of the available fee awarded for subjective  performance criteria is made by the Fee Determining Official, who is  generally an on-site official. The overall fee awarded is the sum of the  individual objective incentive fees and subjective award fees. (See apps.  IV and V for examples of how fee is assigned to specific criteria under the  Site Specific Approach.)", "With regard to award term, for the SC and NNSA contracts that had  award term as an incentive, the contracts defined the conditions for  receiving it, and those conditions generally included meeting certain  rating thresholds, based on our review of documents from those offices.  For SC, the contractor (1) was to earn at least a 3.5 (A-) science &  technology area rating and a 3.1(B+) management & operations area  rating, and (2) have no individual goal ratings below 3.1(B+) for science &  technology area goals and 2.5 (B-) for management & operations area  goals. The contracting officer is to prepare and submit a standardized  document along with an annual contractor performance evaluation  presentation for review through program officials, and the Director of the  Office of Science is to make the final award term determination. For  NNSA contracts, the contractor generally must (1) earn a rating of \u201cVery  Good\u201d or better in four of the six goals and receive no rating of  \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or lower in any goal, and (2) meet any additional  requirements as specified in the contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "All DOE Offices but NNSA Have Clearly Documented Approaches, Which May Lead NNSA to Inconsistently Collect and Use Performance Information in Contractor Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["All of DOE\u2019s offices have documented policies outlining their performance  evaluation approaches, and all but NNSA have documented how  information is to be collected and used to make rating determinations.  SC, EERE, NE, FE, and EM have included in their documented policies  and performance evaluation plans detailed procedures for collecting  information on contractors\u2019 performance that outline, among other things,  how officials are to gather input from internal and external stakeholders  and how the officials are to use that information in making rating  determinations. For example, under SC\u2019s Laboratory Performance  Appraisal Process and PEMP Preparation Guidance (SC\u2019s Appraisal  Guidance), stakeholders are to provide evaluations using SC\u2019s web- based information collection tool, the Laboratory Rating Tool, to provide  scores and narratives on contractor performance. As a result, SC\u2019s  contractor performance evaluation approach clearly traces where  performance information comes from and how the information is used in  determining contractors\u2019 final ratings.", "Similarly, EM and FE document how officials are to collect information  and use it in PEMPs or other performance evaluation plans. For example,  EM\u2019s PEMP for the WIPP M&O contract provides step-by-step  procedures for how field office officials are to assess contractor  performance against each performance criterion. These procedures guide  the flow of information from contractor to field office officials, who are to  check and validate the information and provide rating and fee  recommendations to the on-site Fee Determining Official. Similarly, field  office officials at EM\u2019s Savannah River Site and FE\u2019s Strategic Petroleum  Reserve also have detailed procedures for assessing and distributing  information regarding performance. Such detailed written procedures can  provide better assurance to agencies that officials are consistently  gathering and using performance evaluation information and that one can  trace the ultimate performance rating in the PER to the underlying  performance information.", "In contrast to the detailed documented policies of other DOE offices,  during the period of our review NNSA\u2019s documented policy did not always  match its performance evaluation approach, and the policy did not contain  procedures for how officials should collect and use information so that  one can trace the performance rating to the underlying performance  information. As noted above, NNSA changed from using the Site Specific  performance evaluation approach that focused on objective performance  criteria to the agency\u2019s current approach in fiscal year 2013. However,  NNSA did not update its policy to reflect this change until December  2016. Thus, in fiscal years 2013 through 2016, NNSA was using a  policy intended to evaluate site-specific objective performance criteria and  incentive fees rather than the broad, office-wide subjective performance  criteria that NNSA was using during those 4 fiscal years.", "NNSA brought its policy into alignment with its performance evaluation  approach in December 2016 by issuing its Corporate Performance  Evaluation Process for Management and Operating Contractors policy  (NAP-4C). NAP-4C provides a general framework under which NNSA  officials provide input into the contractor performance evaluation process;  the policy also provides a general schedule for implementing the  performance evaluation approach, as well as general references to  information collection.", "However, NAP-4C does not include detailed procedures for how  performance information should be collected and used, and according to  NNSA officials, individual NNSA offices and officials determine how they  collect and distribute information. This means information may be  collected inconsistently across the agency, depending on individual  offices\u2019 preferences. For example, NAP-4C states that officials should  \u201cleverag information from contractor assurance systems . . . to monitor  performance\u201d but does not discuss how and when officials should use this  information to ensure performance information is traceable to rating  determinations.", "In May 2015, we reported on the importance of tracing performance  information from contractor assurance systems to performance  evaluations. We reported that a senior NNSA official told us NNSA  could not track the extent to which information from contractor assurance  systems was used in evaluating contractor performance because it could  be difficult to identify the sources of information used in performance  evaluations. We recommended that NNSA revise policy, guidance, and  procedures on performance evaluation to fully address how and under  what circumstances those responsible for evaluating M&O contractors\u2019  performance should use information from contractor assurance systems  for this purpose. NNSA concurred with our recommendation and issued  revised policy for contractor oversight but has not yet developed guidance  or procedures for how to use information from contractor assurance  systems in its performance evaluation process. We continue to follow up  on this recommendation.", "In addition to NAP-4C, NNSA\u2019s Fee Determining Official issued  implementation guidance for the fiscal year 2016 performance evaluation  cycle. This implementation guidance directs relevant NNSA officials to  follow a series of templates for interim reports to the contractor and  provides the format of the final PER and specific dates for those reports.", "The guidance does not include procedures as to how officials throughout  NNSA are to collect or use information to create the content for those  templates. For example, the guidance\u2019s Interim Feedback Report  schedule states that the \u201cprogram/functional offices provide input to field  offices.\u201d There is no discussion of how the program/functional office is to  provide such input, what types of input are important, or how the input is  to be used. Similarly, NNSA\u2019s PEMPs also do not discuss how officials  should collect or use performance information.", "In the absence of documented, detailed procedures, NNSA may not  consistently collect and use performance information from program  managers and field office officials for contracts in a given fiscal year and  may therefore inconsistently apply NNSA\u2019s evaluation process. For  example, we identified two instances in which the NNSA Fee Determining  Official made handwritten changes to proposed award fee amounts  during fiscal year 2012 without documenting in the PER the basis for the  changes, such as by identifying the performance information that would  support the handwritten changes to create traceability between the award  fee amounts and its supporting performance documentation. These  changes awarded (1) Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2019s contractor a year  of award term, even though the contractor had not met the established  rating threshold for award term, and (2) Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory\u2019s contractor a higher award fee that also qualified the  contractor for award term it otherwise would not have received. With  these changes, these contractors received award terms and fees in a  manner inconsistent with how award terms and fees were assessed for  other M&O contractors. According to NNSA officials, this type of action  would not happen currently because the agency\u2019s approach is rooted in a  policy (NAP-4C) and implementation guide that is supported by a more  collaborative decision-making process. However, even under the new  policy, because NNSA does not have clearly documented procedures  specifying how officials are to collect or use performance information,  NNSA leadership cannot have assurance that there is clear traceability  between the contractor evaluation and its underlying support.", "Federal standards for internal control state that management should  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, such  as by clearly documenting internal control in management directives,  administrative policies, or operating manuals. NNSA has a documented  policy, but this policy does not clearly specify how to collect and use  contractor performance information to evaluate contractor performance.  NNSA officials stated that in their opinion their policy was still effective  and robust without detailed procedures for its implementation. However,  without developing and documenting clear procedures for implementing  NAP-4C that specify the process for collecting contractor performance  information and how officials are to ensure this information can be traced  to rating determinations, NNSA leadership does not have reasonable  assurance that the agency is consistently evaluating contractor  performance and that it is using relevant performance information as  intended."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Evaluation Reports Could Better Assess M&O Contractors\u2019 Cost Performance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 M&O Contractor Performance Evaluation Reports Provided Less Information on Contractors\u2019 Cost Performance than on Other Types of Performance", "paragraphs": ["We found that DOE offices\u2019 fiscal year 2016 PERs provided less  information on M&O contractors\u2019 cost performance\u2014evaluations of the  contractor\u2019s spending, budgeting, strategic sourcing, and costs, including  the contractor\u2019s cost-effectiveness\u2014and provided more information  regarding technical and administrative areas of performance.

First, the  information consisted of statements that lacked detail, such as \u201cwithin  budget,\u201d and did not address the significance of the performance  described. For example, cost performance-related statements such as  \u201cover/under budget\u201d and \u201ccost savings/cost overrun\u201d did not commonly  provide information on the amount saved or lost, making it difficult to  identify the significance of what was reported. Information on cost  effectiveness was also rare\u2014cost-effectiveness information was included  in about 11 percent of the instances in which cost performance was  discussed (48 of 441 instances). Second, cost performance information  commonly applied to specific activities under the contract, such as  construction activities, rather than to achievement of overall operating  efficiencies. When cost performance information is limited to specific  activities, it is not possible to assess a contractor\u2019s overall cost  performance based on information in the PER.", "We identified one reason and DOE officials identified three additional  reasons why more cost performance information was not provided in  DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2016 PERs. We believe all of these contribute to why  the cost performance information that was included was often not useful  for acquisition decision-making:", "DOE offices\u2019 policies and PEMPs did not specifically require  PERs to include cost performance information and did not  discuss how to ensure that cost information is useful for  acquisition decision-making. Based on our review, DOE offices\u2019  policies did not specifically require that PERs include cost  performance information, nor did they discuss information quality. In  addition, DOE offices\u2019 PEMPs\u2014which serve as a general blueprint for  the type of performance information that offices should include in the  corresponding PER\u2014generally did not include specific cost  performance criteria or explicitly call for evaluations of contractors\u2019  cost performance.

There were three exceptions in which PEMPs included specific cost  performance criteria: EM\u2019s WIPP M&O contract, NE\u2019s Idaho National  Laboratory, and FE\u2019s Strategic Petroleum Reserve M&O contract.", "Although SC does not have explicit cost performance goals or  objectives, according to SC officials, cost performance is listed as a  factor to consider in SC\u2019s PEMPs\u2019 descriptions of how to evaluate  certain performance criteria. However, SC officials told us that PER  performance descriptions may not include cost information for these  criteria unless there were notable cost overruns or the contractor was  doing an exceptionally good job in these areas. SC officials stated this  is, in part, to keep PERs shorter and streamlined. However, when  PERs are silent on cost performance, there is no formal documented  record of M&O contractor cost performance.", "M&O contract missions made it difficult for DOE to assess  contractor cost performance, resulting in less cost performance  information in PERs. According to DOE officials, it is difficult to  assess the costs of the scientific and research missions covered by  many M&O contracts. For example, according to DOE officials, it is  difficult to develop cost estimates for research activities because it is  not always certain when scientific breakthroughs will occur or how  long they will take. DOE uses cost-reimbursement contracts for its  M&O contracts, in part because it is not possible to know with  certainty and in advance how much research and development efforts  will cost or what level of effort will be required.", "While we agree that assessing cost performance for scientific and  research activities may be difficult, M&O contractors also carry out a  variety of other activities for which costs may be more readily  assessed. For example, a sizeable portion of the costs under M&O  contracts are for administrative or mission support and other business  operations activities, such as personnel, business processes, human  resources, procurement, and security. In our previous work, we found  that such administrative and support activities accounted for about 25  to 50 percent of M&O contractor costs in fiscal year 2015.Similarly,  SC\u2019s fiscal year 2016 annual laboratory plans identify areas, such as  infrastructure and information systems, as the major cost drivers for  that year. We have found that other agencies assess cost  performance for contractors performing such administrative  activities. DOE officials we interviewed agreed that measuring cost  performance in these areas would be more feasible than measuring it  for its scientific and research missions.", "The M&O contract type made it difficult to some degree for DOE  to assess contractor cost performance. According to DOE officials,  certain aspects of how DOE implements cost-reimbursement M&O  contracts create challenges to evaluating cost performance. Some  officials described these challenges as the result of \u201cthe budget-based  nature\u201d of M&O contracts. Specifically, according to DOE officials,  M&O contract budgets (the amount contractors are allowed to spend)  are not set up front in the original contract. Rather, according to DOE  officials, M&O contract budgets are commonly determined by the  amount DOE obligates to the contract on an annual basis, based  mostly on annual congressional appropriations to the relevant DOE  programs. Further, these officials noted, because much of DOE\u2019s  appropriated funds are available until expended rather than expiring at  the end of the fiscal year for which they were appropriated, M&O  contractors may be able to carry over those funds to spend in future  fiscal years. According to DOE officials, DOE reviews M&O  contractor estimates when developing its budget request, including  determining how much work is required by its contractors to execute  the program scope outlined in the budget request. Agency officials  also noted that, with regard to cost reimbursement contracts, the  federal government is legally required to reimburse contractors for all  allowable costs up to the approved budget amount.", "We have previously reported that cost-reimbursement contracts carry  a high risk for the federal government, resulting in the potential for  cost escalation, as some expenditures may be allowable under the  contract but may not be cost effective. We recognize that M&O  contracts are unique in many ways. Nevertheless, the manner in  which DOE allocates funds to the contract, and the requirement to  reimburse contractors for allowable costs do not, by themselves,  affect DOE\u2019s ability to assess contractor cost performance.", "Some cost performance evaluation conducted outside of the  annual performance evaluation process is not included in PERs.  DOE officials told us they perform some activities related to contractor  cost performance outside the performance evaluation process for  M&O contracts, though information on these activities is not always  included in PERs. For example, according to DOE officials, some  M&O contractors participate in group purchasing efforts, where  contractors coordinate purchases to drive up competition and drive  down costs. Also, DOE offices generally monitor M&O contractor  indirect costs to ensure they do not escalate without reason. In  particular, SC\u2019s M&O contractors include a \u201cCost of Doing Business\u201d  section in their annual laboratory plans, in which SC contractors report  on indirect costs. According to SC officials, SC also uses its reviews  of the Cost of Doing Business sections as opportunities to discuss  options to reduce operational costs. SC officials stated that an internal  process in which SC\u2019s laboratories compete and are awarded work, in  part, also serves to control costs. According to DOE officials, efforts  such as group purchasing and indirect cost monitoring and reporting  are not commonly included in PERs because the agency considers its  existing performance criteria to be sufficiently broad to assess  contractor performance.", "Though these efforts may be important to address contractor costs  and information from the efforts could inform assessments of cost  performance, they do not, on their own, represent DOE office\u2019s  evaluation of contractor\u2019s cost performance. In addition, PERs are  important records of DOE offices\u2019 evaluations of contractor  performance because, according to agency officials, DOE uses the  PERs to inform acquisition decisions and help form the basis for a  contractor\u2019s performance record.", "We and the DOE Inspector General have identified how important it is for  DOE to obtain quality cost information and use it to evaluate cost  performance. For example, for more than a decade, we have reported  that some DOE offices have experienced challenges obtaining quality  information that could enable the offices to make better-informed  decisions about programs\u2019, and therefore DOE\u2019s, budgetary needs.  Furthermore, we reported in July 2012 that NNSA based much of its  congressional budget request on contractor-generated budget proposals,  which the agency often did not thoroughly evaluate. More recently,  according to a 2017 DOE Inspector General report, challenges in  evaluating cost performance have contributed to NNSA\u2019s and its M&O  contractors\u2019 difficulty in demonstrating the anticipated cost savings for the  NNSA Production Office Sites contract. DOE created this contract by  consolidating the contracts for the Y-12 National Security Complex and  the Pantex Plant into a single contract for the explicit purpose of saving  costs.", "While collecting quality information on, measuring, and reporting on cost  performance for M&O contracts may be challenging, this information is  important for two reasons. First, the FAR, DOE policy, and CPARS  highlight the importance of information on contractor\u2019s cost performance  for acquisition decision-making. As we previously noted, the FAR and  DOE policy provide that decisions to extend or compete an M&O contract  be based on an expectation of meaningful improvement in performance  or cost, including consideration of a contractor\u2019s technical, administrative,  and cost performance. In addition, according to DOE officials, they largely  copy information from PERs into the federal government database on  contractors\u2019 past performance, CPARS, which agencies use to inform  their awarding of contracts. CPARS has several performance criteria that  agencies are required to complete, one of which is \u201ccost control.\u201d This is  challenging to address, according to DOE officials, because PERs do not  typically include an explicit evaluation of cost performance even though,  also according to DOE officials, PERs are the primary source of  information entered into CPARs.", "Second, as we reported in 2009, there are inherent risks to the  government from cost-reimbursement contracts such as DOE\u2019s M&O  contracts, particularly with cost escalation because the government is  required to pay the contractor\u2019s allowable costs regardless of whether the  contractor completes the work. Because of these risks, we found that  these types of contracts involve significantly more government oversight  than do fixed-price contracts. This is, in part, because the agency needs  to monitor contractor costs to provide a reasonable assurance that  efficient methods and effective cost controls are used.", "As we previously noted, FAR, DOE guidance and policy, and CPARS  highlight the importance of quality information on contractor\u2019s cost  performance. In addition, federal standards for internal control state that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks, such as by clearly documenting internal control in  management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals.", "DOE offices have policies on contractor performance evaluation, but  these do not specifically require that PERs include quality cost  performance information that can be used to make an overall assessment  of cost performance. By updating policies to require inclusion of quality  cost performance information in PERs to enable an overall assessment of  a contractor\u2019s cost performance, DOE offices could strengthen their  oversight of M&O contractor costs. For example, DOE offices could better  inform acquisition decisions such as whether to extend or compete a  contract, complete CPARS with greater ease, inform incentives for  contractor performance, and uncover opportunities for federal cost  savings. This is particularly important given that these cost- reimbursement type contracts carry risks of cost escalation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Generally Awarded M&O Contractors High Ratings and Most Available Performance Incentives, Except in Cases of Significant Safety or Security Incidents", "paragraphs": ["In reviewing DOE\u2019s M&O contractor performance evaluations for fiscal  years 2006 through 2016, we found the results of the evaluations to  generally include high performance ratings and most available  performance incentives, including a median of 94 percent of available  award and incentive fees.

Contractors  at more than half of the 24 contract rating sites (17 of 24) received  award and incentive fee percentages consistent with only Excellent or  Very Good ratings for all fiscal years from 2006 through 2016. As  discussed above, while the precise approaches for determining ratings  and fees vary by DOE office, ratings and fees are directly linked in all  three approaches: Fee is either determined through a formula based on  ratings, or DOE offices determine ratings and fees at the same time.

When including those fixed  fees, the percentage of total fee awarded rises, with median fee  percentages rising above 90 percent for three of the sites.", "Contract rating sites rarely received less than 75 percent of available  award fee.", "In addition to awarding contractors high percentages of available fees,  DOE offices generally awarded M&O contractors most of the available  award term incentives. Several DOE and contractor officials we  interviewed noted that award term is perhaps the most valuable incentive  from a contractor perspective because an extra year of work on the  contract represents much more revenue for them than fees. SC and  NNSA\u2014the two offices with contracts that had award term\u2014awarded 92  percent of award term years available, or 76 out of 83 possible award  term years. Specifically, SC included award term in seven contracts and  awarded M&O contractors with 95 percent of potential award term years,  and NNSA included award term in four contracts and awarded contractors  with 83 percent of potential award term years (see Table 5 below). Three  of the unearned award term years are attributable to the contractor at Los  Alamos National Laboratory, which also had a fourth award term year that  NNSA revoked retroactively. According to NNSA officials, upon not  earning an award term for the fourth time, Los Alamos\u2019s contractor\u2014in  accordance with the terms of the contract\u2014had all of its award terms  revoked, and NNSA decided to recompete the contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Performance Sometimes Had Lower Ratings, with Some Issues Resulting in Fee Reductions Outside of the Performance Evaluation Process", "paragraphs": ["Within the pattern of high overall performance ratings, ratings for  administrative performance have generally been lower than ratings for  technical performance, and some administrative performance issues\u2014 particularly safety issues and accidents\u2014resulted in fee reductions  outside the performance evaluation process, as noted in table 6 below.  For example, since fiscal year 2013, when NNSA adopted common  performance goals across its contract rating sites, about 83 percent of  possible goal ratings (134 of 162) had been rated Very Good or better. Of  the 28 goal ratings below Very Good, 22 (79 percent) were in  administrative goals. In many cases, incidents that led to lower ratings  involved site operations issues, such as in safety and security. Similarly,  the contractors at the 10 SC contract rating sites and one NE contract  rating site also showed generally higher technical performance ratings  with 9 of 11 contract rating sites having higher average technical area  scores than administrative area scores (the two other contract rating sites  had average technical area scores that were about equal to the average  administrative scores).", "From our review of DOE documents and discussions with officials, one  factor that may be an important influence in the difference between  technical and administrative scores at SC and NE rating sites is that the  Science and Energy Lab performance evaluation approach does not  incentivize administrative performance above a B+. As discussed above,  contractors generally receive additional award fee for higher ratings, but  under the Science and Energy Lab approach, in the administrative area,  all scores of B+ and above lead to the same amount of award fee.  Therefore, a contractor whose only difference was an administrative  score of B+ versus A+ would receive the same amount of award fee.  According to DOE officials, this structure is meant to encourage  contractors to reinvest cost savings into technical performance rather  than improving administrative systems that already meet expectations.", "Relatively low performance in certain areas can be balanced out in overall  ratings by strong performance ratings elsewhere. Of nine occasions since  fiscal year 2013 that an NNSA contractor received at least one  Satisfactory goal rating (below 50 percent), the overall rating for the  contractor remained Good or Very Good, and contractors were provided  the majority of their fees in all but one case (the contractor for Los Alamos  National Laboratory in fiscal year 2014, which we discuss further below).  For example, following the break-in of trespassers and related security  lapses at Y-12 in 2012, NNSA provided the M&O contractor with  Satisfactory ratings in operations in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. However,  Very Good and Excellent ratings in other areas meant NNSA provided an  overall rating of Good to the contractor in those years, and the contractor  received more than 50 percent of available award fees. For SC, in the five  occasions since fiscal year 2006 in which a contractor received at least  one goal rating of C (2.0) or below, overall area scores remained As and  Bs and fees above 75 percent, except for one instance. On that occasion,  Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in 2016 received multiple goal  ratings of C, which led to a technical score of C+ and a fee of 68 percent.  This 2016 rating for Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory is also the only  case from fiscal years 2006 through 2016 of a Satisfactory-level goal  rating in a technical area goal, as the others were all in the administrative  areas of site operations or leadership.", "The extent to which a single area of performance affects overall ratings is  influenced by the broad scope of activities under an M&O contract, the  broad types of performance required under the contract, and the weights  used to determine overall ratings and incentives. According to DOE  officials, one way the Science and Energy Lab approach addresses these  factors is to include all the ratings provided by each stakeholder and for  each objective in the PER. In this way, while a C from one stakeholder or  objective may be weighted out overall, the grade and the feedback  associated with it are still provided to the M&O contractor and clearly  visible to readers of the reports.", "Another way that DOE offices have addressed individual performance  deficiencies that may get balanced out in overall ratings is through  additional fee reductions. Most offices have reduced fees outside the  performance evaluation process to address specific performance  deficiencies\u2014generally administrative concerns, such as safety issues.  In particular, all offices except EERE have reduced fees that would have  been provided from performance evaluation results, relying on contract  clauses that allow for fee reductions. Such clauses allow DOE offices to  unilaterally reduce fees for the evaluation period if, for example, the  contractor fails to meet performance requirements of the contract relating  to environment, safety, and health. For example, NE used such clauses  in 7 of the 11 years we reviewed to reduce the fee provided to the Idaho  National Laboratory M&O contractor. FE has also frequently used fee  reductions to address issues outside its predominantly objective  performance criteria. SC, NNSA, and EM have also occasionally used  additional fee reductions outside the performance evaluation process. For  all offices, fee reductions generally resulted from administrative  performance issues\u2014safety issues and accidents\u2014rather than technical  performance. These fee reductions ranged from $10,000 to $35 million,  and while the fee received by the contractor was lowered, the original  ratings were not revised. In most cases, these reductions were for 10  percent or less of award and incentive fees provided and less than $1  million dollars; however, they represented large portions of contractors\u2019  fees in a few cases.

The 6.9 percent of fees  awarded represented an additional reduction of fees from the amounts  the contractor earned for meeting a portion of its objective criteria targets  and receiving Satisfactory ratings in all four subjective criteria. WIPP did  not resume waste disposal operations until 2017.", "LANL, 2014. LANL\u2019s contractor received none of the available award fee,  and no DOE fixed fee, in fiscal year 2014 due to its improper oversight  and packaging of the waste drum that exploded at WIPP. Of $63,406,380  in available fee, LANL\u2019s contractor received about $6.3 million in fixed fee  associated with work completed under contract with other federal  agencies that, according to NNSA officials, could not be revoked. Similar  to WIPP\u2019s contractor, this represented an additional reduction of fees  from the amounts that would have resulted from an overall Satisfactory  rating (including an Unsatisfactory for operations and infrastructure;  Satisfactory for science, technology and engineering; Satisfactory for  leadership; and Very Good for the two mission goals). In addition to losing  fee and award term, the waste portion of the LANL contract was  withdrawn from the M&O contract and contracted out separately by EM.", "In all three cases, in the year following the 50 percent or less in award  and incentive fees, performance ratings returned to at least Good levels  and contractors received at least three-quarters of available award and  incentive fees. With regard to the WIPP accident involved in two of the  three cases, efforts to recover from the waste drum incident and return to  full operations have cost hundreds of millions to date and are estimated to  cost more than $600 million in total, all of which will be costs to the  taxpayer. The combined unearned and reduced fee for both contractors  amounted to $64,788,464, or about 10 percent of total estimated costs to  the government. In addition to fee reductions, NNSA officials stated that  the WIPP accident played a significant role in NNSA\u2019s decision to not  exercise the last 7 years of possible award term on the LANL contract  and thus recompete the contract in 2018. According to NNSA, those 7  years translate into approximately $17 billion in work and up to $500  million in fee the LANL contractor could have earned.

These annual  performance evaluations also provide valuable information for contract  management and acquisition decisions, such as whether to renew or  compete expiring M&O contracts.

Without  developing and documenting clear procedures for implementing NAP-4C  that specify the process for collecting contractor performance information  and how officials are to ensure this information can be traced to rating  determinations, NNSA leadership does not have reasonable assurance  that it is consistently evaluating contractor performance and that it is  using relevant performance information as intended.", "The cost performance information included in DOE offices\u2019 fiscal year  2016 PERs is of limited use for acquisition decision-making in that this  information does not permit making an overall assessment of M&O  contractors\u2019 cost performance.

DOE officials identified challenges in evaluating M&O contractors\u2019 cost  performance and ways this evaluation may occur outside of the annual  performance evaluation process. These challenges contribute to why  there is less cost performance-related information in PERs than for other  types of performance. While collecting, measuring, and reporting quality  cost performance information may be challenging, such information is  important for fully assessing contractor performance and managing the  inherent risks of cost-reimbursement contracts. By updating their policies  to require quality cost performance information in PERs to enable an  overall assessment of M&O contractor cost performance, the six DOE  offices with M&O contracts could strengthen their oversight of costs for  contracts worth about $20 billion a year and use this information to  improve acquisition decision-making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making seven recommendations to DOE offices:  The Administrator for the National Nuclear Security Administration should  develop and document clear procedures for implementing NAP-4C,  specifying the process for collecting contractor performance information  and describing how officials are to ensure this information can be traced  to rating determinations.
