The level of warning provided motorists at these crossings differs widely\u2014from no visible warning devices to active devices such as lights and gates. According to the Department of Transportation (DOT), the very existence of these crossings poses a major challenge to growing rail traffic and higher speeds for both passenger and freight rail operations.", "To deal with these problems, the states can use funds they receive under the section 130 program to improve railroad crossings using a variety of methods. They can separate railroad crossings by building overpasses and underpasses, install passive (crossbucks or surface markings) or active (flashing lights and gates) warning devices, or improve the pavement surface. Since the Rail-Highway Crossing Program began, states have undertaken more than 28,600 improvement projects\u2014primarily by installing signs and markings, flashing light signals, and automatic gates and improving crossing surfaces. In addition, there are about 35,000 grade separations\u2014bridges with the roadway above or below the railroad\u2014located on public crossings.", "According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the basic levels of safety devices in the order of their increasing effectiveness are passive warning devices, automatic flashing lights, automatic flashing lights with gates, and grade separations (underpass/overpass).

The construction of these overpasses and underpasses effectively eliminates the risk of accidents. However, grade separations are more expensive than active warning devices, and accordingly their use is often limited. For example, in 1991 the states obligated $108 million in federal funds to install active warning devices, such as flashing lights or lights and gates, at 2,400 crossings. In that same year, the states obligated $42 million in federal funds to partially pay for grade separations at 75 crossings.

Although crossing closures eliminate the safety problem, this approach has raised intensive opposition at the local level.", "In 1992, the Federal Railroad Administrator recommended the closure of 25 percent of the nation\u2019s railroad crossings because the crossings were either redundant or unnecessary. Reducing the number of railroad crossings is a goal also endorsed by DOT, AAR, AASHTO, the National Association of Regulatory and Utility Commissioners, and Operation Lifesaver. In 1994, AASHTO found that the nation had two railroad crossings for every mile of track and that in heavily congested areas, the average approached 10 crossings every mile. AASHTO noted that many of these crossings were unnecessary and could be consolidated with little or no adverse impact on the traveling public. A closed crossing effectively eliminates the risk of motor vehicle accidents and fatalities. It also eliminates the future costs of maintaining the crossing or upgrading the crossing\u2019s protection when increased traffic volume necessitates greater protection.", "However, closing crossings often becomes a matter of considerable local debate. For example, in 1994 FRA found that in 11 states, local opposition was the greatest impediment to closing crossings. This problem was consistently cited among state transportation officials in the five states we reviewed. In general, local opposition centers on several issues. Businesses near the crossing fear financial losses, particularly if public access would be cut off in one direction. Citizens raise concerns about fire, police, and ambulance response time, and farmers oppose closures that alter access to their fields. Finally, state officials cite financial disincentives to closing crossings. While railroad crossing improvements such as lights and signals are eligible for 100-percent federal funding, the costs associated with closures require a 10-percent local match\u2014a match that some localities have been unwilling to make.", "In response to the financial disincentives to closing crossings, DOT proposed in 1994 to eliminate the local match and give local communities up to a $15,000 award for closing public railroad crossings. The section 130 program would provide one-half of the up to $15,000 award, and the railroads would provide the other half. However, state officials we interviewed stated that the $15,000 incentive was too low to be effective. FHWA officials responded that states have used both section 130 and other federal-aid funds to help pay for closures and noted that if the incentive is coupled with the elimination of the local match required for closure projects, more local communities may be induced to close crossings.", "Although DOT\u2019s proposal may provide greater financial incentives to close crossings, the authority to open and close crossings remains a state and local responsibility. The federal government exercises no regulatory authority in this area. Currently, there are no federal standards or guidelines that describe under what circumstances a crossing should be closed. Therefore, a state body with the authority and willingness to close crossings often becomes the key factor to successful closings. The Illinois Commerce Commission provides a good example of what can be accomplished over time by aggressive state action. The Commission has had the authority to order crossings closed for safety reasons alone, following a public hearing. In 1955 through 1993, the Commission closed 678 public railroad crossings\u2014about 17.4 closed crossings each year. This number compares to the national average of about five crossings closed per state each year, which is based on a 1994 Alabama Highway Department survey of states with active closure initiatives. Greater state action to close crossings is therefore an important element in the overall approach to reducing railroad crossing fatalities and accidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT Is Funding Innovative Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Innovative technologies offer useful options to improve railroad crossing safety, particularly in rail corridors (along a specific train route, highway, or geographic boundary) and at the most dangerous rail-highway crossings. DOT is supporting the development of several innovative technologies for railroad crossings through FRA\u2019s High-Speed Rail program. These technologies represent the next step in improving safety at crossings. Some of these systems are designed to positively prevent a motor vehicle from entering the crossing; therefore, they provide a higher level of safety than warning lights and gates. However, innovative technologies are likely to cost more than active warning devices, the most common engineering solution to crossing problems. Although their costs limit widespread application under the Rail-Highway Crossing Program, these technologies are generally less expensive than grade separations.", "Table 3.3 compares the costs of two standard methods the states use to improve crossings\u2014grade separations and flashing lights and gates\u2014to the four innovative technologies sponsored by DOT. The four innovative technologies\u2014Four Quadrant Gates, Friendly Mobile Barriers System, Low-Cost Grade Separation, and Dragnet Vehicle Arresting Barrier\u2014are at different stages of development or deployment and have projected costs of between $500,000 and $1 million per crossing.", "The Four Quadrant Gates technology is an ongoing project in Connecticut. The approach installs four gates, rather than the traditional two gates, at a crossing. In addition, advanced circuitry in the gates and along the rail lines provide an early warning system for the engineer of any oncoming trains. If the gates are malfunctioning or a vehicle is stuck between the four gates, the system warns the engineer in time to stop the train before it reaches the crossing. FRA currently estimates this system will cost $1 million per crossing.", "The Friendly Mobile Barriers system, being developed in Virginia, consists of a barrier wall that rises up from the roadway after standard gates have come down. The barrier effectively prevents a vehicle from entering the crossing by blocking the road. The system is designed to absorb the energy of a vehicle which strikes it, thus averting fatal injury to the occupants. FRA currently estimates the cost to install this system at one crossing at $1 million.", "The Low-Cost Grade Separation Project in Florida is an attempt to develop a grade separation that can be constructed at less cost and in half the time of conventional grade separations. The new design will use soil rather than concrete to shore up the walls supporting the bridge portion of the separation. FRA estimates that a Low-Cost Grade Separation will cost $950,000 per crossing; however, costs may vary at different locations.", "The Illinois Dragnet Vehicle Arresting System augments existing crossing gates with a net restraining barrier lowered from roadside towers. The net, designed to stop a moving vehicle, uses technology currently in place in Chicago to prevent vehicles from improperly entering reversible highway lanes. The Dragnet Vehicle Arresting Barrier test cost $950,000, but Illinois DOT officials estimate that the system will cost $500,000 per crossing when it is commercially deployed.", "The innovative technologies are unproven and will cost more than existing flashing lights and gates, which cost about $150,000 for each crossing. Furthermore, the states\u2019 section 130 apportionments are too small for widespread application of these technologies. For example, the $1 million needed to deploy four quadrant gates at a single crossing would deplete the annual section 130 apportionments of nine states. On the other hand, as an alternative to the estimated $3 million cost of a grade separation, innovative technologies may prove useful to improve safety at dangerous crossings that continue to have accidents despite the presence of traditional lights and gates.", "Grade separations are generally more expensive than many of these innovative technologies, but the costs differ throughout the nation. A 1993 state engineering study of 60 grade separations along a rail corridor between Chicago and St. Louis found an average cost of $3 million per separation; the costs ranged between $2 million and $5.4 million. The range resulted from differences in the number of highway lanes, railroad tracks, and bridge length. According to FHWA officials, the high costs explain why few grade separations are funded with section 130 funds; 31 states receive annual program allotments of less than $3 million\u2014the average cost of one separation. As a result, grade separations often must be cost-justified on a basis other than the safety impact on accidents, fatalities, and injuries.

With the identification of Principal Rail Lines by FRA and the National Highway System (NHS) by the Congress, natural candidates for corridor reviews may soon exist.", "Analyzing railroad crossing corridors offers the states and railroads many advantages in assessing railroad crossing safety. For the states, the corridor approach allows diagnostic teams to perform more on-site reviews of crossings and to identify and improve potentially hazardous crossings before they become high-risk situations. Corridor reviews can identify redundant crossings as candidates for closure in conjunction with safety upgrades of the remaining crossings. In addition, both the states and the railroads benefit from reduced paperwork since they can develop a single master agreement to cover improvements at several crossings. For the railroads, the advantages include (1) designing and installing signal circuits in a common and comprehensive way, rather than customizing each signal circuit; (2) reducing labor costs through the more efficient scheduling of work crews and reduced travel time; and (3) reducing procurement and shipping costs by ordering equipment and materials in larger quantities. These advantages can reduce project costs for the states.", "A drawback to the states\u2019 use of the corridor approach is that a state could spend a large portion of its railroad crossing dollars in a specific geographic area. This could be at the expense of other parts of the state that also have relatively hazardous crossings but do not have defined corridors. The problem is complex because the section 130 program requires the states to develop and use a priority ranking system that numerically orders each crossing on the basis of the potential risk of an accident. Under the corridor approach, teams review all the crossings for improvement or closure, even those which are not high on the priority ranking. As a result, by applying a corridor approach, a state can achieve wider coverage of improvements and discover candidates for closing, but it will not always improve those crossings with the highest rankings.", "While FHWA has encouraged the use of the corridor approach by the states, we found that the states used different methods in selecting corridors for crossing improvements. For example, Indiana solicited requests from local governments for corridor improvement projects, while Ohio selected corridors that included crossings near the top of the state\u2019s priority ranking list. While FHWA officials believed some variation of a corridor approach was common among the states, they did not know how many states actually used the corridor approach nor in what form.", "The corridor approach may become more important because of DOT\u2019s actions defining rail corridors and expected congressional action defining the NHS. FRA has defined a national network of existing Principal Rail Lines. Principal Rail Lines carry passenger traffic and the heaviest rail traffic and will correspondingly have higher potential for crossing accidents. In addition, the Congress will designate the NHS in 1995. The NHS, composed of the nation\u2019s interstate system and other high-volume highways, will carry over 40 percent of all vehicle miles travelled and 70 percent of commercial truck traffic. The confluence of these systems will define geographic areas in the states that combine heavy vehicle and rail traffic and thereby produce greater potential for crossing accidents and fatalities. These areas may offer the starting point for applying the corridor approach to improving railroad crossing safety. In addition, DOT has proposed eliminating all railroad crossings on the NHS and establishing a $15 million incentive program to encourage the states to use the corridor approach more extensively.

NHTSA does not maintain information on whether the states had used section 402 funds for railroad crossing safety initiatives.

While the action plan cites eliminating crossings as a goal, it does not estimate the cost to separate the grades at NHS/PRL intersections. In chapter 3, we found that grade separation costs could vary between $2 million to $5 million at individual crossings. Therefore, the cost of grade-separating all NHS/PRL crossings would be between $4.5 billion and $11.3 billion. While eliminating these crossings is a long-term goal, grade separations will constitute a major infrastructure investment commitment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluation Component Would Help Assess Effectiveness of Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The action plan also lacks a process for assessing the effectiveness of ongoing or completed proposals in reducing accidents. Lacking such a process, DOT risks (1) spending its resources on proposals of questionable value at the expense of potentially more useful actions and (2) missing opportunities for improving ongoing proposals. Follow-up studies, qualitative or quantitative, could help DOT evaluate whether the $15,000 incentive is high enough to entice localities to agree to close crossings, how many crossings the incentives helped close, and the cost savings and risk reductions these closures achieved; efforts to promote corridor reviews were leading to increases in the number of crossings being improved or closed; educational proposals were improving motorists\u2019 behavior at railroad motorists were obeying railroad crossing traffic laws as a result of enhanced law enforcement efforts; and research efforts were developing and implementing cost-effective proposals for improving railroad crossing safety.", "Evaluation can identify mid-course corrections needed to make initiatives more effective. For example, as discussed in chapter 3, DOT\u2019s plan proposed providing local governments a $15,000 cash incentive to close crossings. However, state officials indicated that the incentive may be too low to prompt local jurisdictions to close crossings. If this proposal is instituted, the DOT plan includes no means to identify how many crossing closures result or whether the amount of the incentive should be changed.", "DOT also proposes a number of efforts directed at educating truck and bus drivers about the dangers present at railroad crossings. However, at present, the action plan includes no way of determining the results of these efforts. Although evaluating each of these proposals individually may be difficult, groups of proposals could be analyzed by DOT to determine whether motorists\u2019 awareness or behavior changed as a result of implementing these actions. DOT could then use this information to decide whether more educational efforts are needed or certain efforts should be dropped. DOT officials stated during our exit conference on this report that they were beginning discussions among the modes responsible for the action plan as to how an evaluation component could be incorporated into the action plan proposals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s Rail Crossing Safety Action Plan, has laid out a series of federal/state/private sector partnerships across a spectrum of issues critical to rail crossing safety. DOT has made progress in implementing many of the proposals cited in its plan. However, to complete the plan, DOT depends not only on the active support of its modal agencies but on the support of the states and the Congress as well. The success of key proposals in the plan, such as better targeting of funds to the states, increased use of the corridor approach, and closing unneeded and redundant crossings, hinges, in large part, on how well DOT can work with the states and the Congress to help it implement the proposals. Only through a genuine partnership can federal and state governments and the rail industry achieve a significant improvement over current levels of safety.", "To clarify the nature of this partnership and the level of commitment needed to achieve the plan\u2019s goal of reducing accidents and fatalities by 50 percent before 2004, it is critical for DOT to develop cost estimates and to arrange for funding sources for its proposals. Before undertaking goals requiring long-term financial support and policy changes, DOT should establish the level of resources required from the Congress to meet the objectives. Similarly, follow-up information is needed to assess the proposals\u2019 effectiveness in meeting the goal. Until DOT has (1) identified clearly the costs associated with the plan, (2) developed a strategy to assess the impact and effectiveness of the initiatives in improving railroad crossing safety, and (3) arranged for financial resources and policy changes needed to implement the initiatives, DOT\u2019s success in achieving the goals set forth in its action plan will remain uncertain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the DOT action plan and improve railroad crossing safety, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation, in cooperation with the states, develop cost estimates and identify funding sources for action plan evaluate the cost and effectiveness of the action plan as it is implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["FRA believed the tone and content of the report did not give adequate credit to DOT for developing and implementing the action plan. We have modified the report where appropriate. While we recognize that the plan is an important DOT initiative, the value of the plan ultimately lies in its success in reducing accidents. Because DOT is still in the process of gaining congressional approval and implementing the plan, we could not yet assess the impact of all the initiatives on safety. Implementing our recommendations should enhance the plan by providing important information on funding sources and the plan\u2019s effectiveness in achieving its goals."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
