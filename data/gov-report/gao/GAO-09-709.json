While it is impossible to know how many firearms are illegally smuggled into Mexico in a given year, about 87 percent of firearms seized by Mexican authorities and traced in the last 5 years originated in the United States, according to data from Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). According to U.S. and Mexican government officials, these firearms have been increasingly more powerful and lethal in recent years. Many of these firearms come from gun shops and gun shows in Southwest border states. U.S. and Mexican government and law enforcement officials stated most firearms are intended to support operations of Mexican DTOs, which are also responsible for trafficking arms to Mexico. The U.S. government faces several significant challenges in combating illicit sales of firearms in the United States and stemming their flow into Mexico. In particular, certain provisions of some federal firearms laws present challenges to U.S. efforts, according to ATF officials. Specifically, officials identified key challenges related to restrictions on collecting and reporting information on firearms purchases, a lack of required background checks for private firearms sales, and limitations on reporting requirements for multiple sales. GAO also found ATF and Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the primary agencies implementing efforts to address the issue, do not effectively coordinate their efforts, in part because the agencies lack clear roles and responsibilities and have been operating under an outdated interagency agreement. Additionally, agencies generally have not systematically gathered, analyzed, and reported data that could be useful to help plan and assess results of their efforts to address arms trafficking to Mexico. U.S. law enforcement agencies have provided some assistance to Mexican counterparts in combating arms trafficking, but these efforts face several challenges. U.S. law enforcement assistance to Mexico does not target arms trafficking needs, limiting U.S. agencies' ability to provide technical or operational assistance. In addition, U.S. assistance has been limited due to Mexican officials' incomplete use of ATF's electronic firearms tracing system, an important tool for U.S. arms trafficking investigations. Another significant challenge facing U.S. efforts to assist Mexico is corruption among some Mexican government entities. Mexican federal authorities are implementing anticorruption measures, but government officials acknowledge fully implementing these reforms will take considerable time, and may take years to affect comprehensive change. The administration's recently released National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy includes, for the first time, a chapter on combating illicit arms trafficking to Mexico. Prior to the new strategy, the U.S. government lacked a strategy to address arms trafficking to Mexico, and various efforts undertaken by individual U.S. agencies were not part of a comprehensive U.S. governmentwide strategy for addressing the problem. At this point, it's not clear whether ONDCP's \"implementation plan\" for the strategy, which has not been finalized, will include performance indicators and other accountability mechanisms to overcome shortcomings raised in our report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, violence along the U.S.-Mexico border has escalated  dramatically as the administration of President Felipe Calderon has sought  to combat the growing power of Mexican drug trafficking organizations  (DTO) and curb their ability to operate with impunity in certain areas of  Mexico.

According to  the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) 2009 National Drug Threat  Assessment, Mexican DTOs represent the greatest organized crime threat  to the United States, controlling drug distribution in at least 230 U.S. cities,  and gaining strength in markets they do not yet control. In response to this  growing threat, in March 2009, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) announced it planned to increase resources on the U.S.-Mexico  border, including more personnel and greater use of available  technologies, among other elements.", "In response to your request that we review U.S. efforts to stem the flow of  arms trafficking into Mexico, we examined (1) what data are available on  the types, sources, and users of these arms; (2) key challenges that  confront U.S. government efforts to combat illicit sales of firearms in the  United States and to stem the flow of these arms across the Southwest  border into Mexico; (3) challenges faced by U.S. agencies collaborating  with Mexican authorities to combat the problem of illicit arms; and (4) the  U.S. government\u2019s strategy for addressing the issue.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed program and  project status reports, and related information.

We  visited and met with officials from three major Southwest border cities\u2014 San Diego, California, and El Paso and Laredo, Texas\u2014and their Mexican  counterpart cities to explore the challenges faced by law enforcement  officials to stem the flow of arms smuggling across the border. We also  traveled to Mexico City and Monterrey, Mexico, to meet with U.S. embassy  and consulate officials responsible for implementing programs to combat  arms trafficking and Mexican government officials responsible for related  activities. We did not review Mexican firearms laws, and to the extent that  we comment on these in this report, we relied on secondary sources. We  also reviewed ATF, ICE, and CBP data on seizures of southbound firearms  and cases involving arms trafficking to Mexico. We determined the data  provided to us by various U.S. agencies on these topics were sufficiently  reliable to provide an overall indication of the magnitude and nature of the  illicit firearms trade.

These efforts  have targeted areas, particularly along the U.S.-Mexican border, where  DTOs have exerted most influence. By pursuing and detaining the leaders  of these criminal organizations, Mexican authorities have disrupted DTOs\u2019  internal power structures and territorial control. The DTOs have  countered government pressure with increased violence against law  enforcement entities. The government\u2019s efforts to disrupt drug trafficking  operations also appear to have intensified conflicts among DTOs over  access to lucrative trafficking routes to the United States. The result has  been an escalation of drug-related assassinations, kidnappings, and other  violent crimes. While the majority of the casualties have been individuals  involved in the drug trade in some way, victims also include law  enforcement officers, journalists, and innocent bystanders. Gun violence  in Mexico has increased dramatically in the last 2 years, with the number  of drug-related murders more than doubling from around 2,700 in 2007 to  over 6,200 in 2008. The drug-related murder rates for the first quarter of  2009 remain high and thus the yearly total for 2009 will likely be close to  the 2008 level. See figure 1.", "Growing criminal activity in Mexico, particularly in communities across  the Southwest border, has raised concerns that the violence might spill  over to the United States. Since 2006, DOJ\u2019s annual National Drug Threat  Assessment has reported Mexican DTOs and criminal groups are the most  influential drug traffickers and the greatest organizational threat to the  United States. Law enforcement reporting indicates Mexican DTOs  maintain drug distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors in at  least 230 U.S. cities. See figure 2. Mexican DTOs control most of the U.S.  drug market and are gaining strength in markets they do not yet control.  President Obama has expressed concern about the increased level of  violence along the border, particularly in Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana, and  has called for continued monitoring of the situation to guard against  spillover into the United States.", "Since the 1970s, the United States has collaborated with Mexican  authorities and provided assistance to Mexico to combat transnational  crimes associated with drug trafficking, including illicit firearms  smuggling. However, counterarms trafficking efforts have been a modest  component of broader bilateral law enforcement cooperation. U.S. and  Mexican officials also told us that, in the past, the Mexican government  considered illicit arms trafficking a problem that originated in the United  States and thus needed to be dealt with by U.S. authorities. However, the  Mexican government has taken on a greater focus in combating arms  trafficking in recent years. For example, Mexico\u2019s Secretary of Public  Security noted, \u201cthe arms issue \u2026 is a subject that was not considered  when discussing drug trafficking, however today it is part of the dialogue  we have with our colleagues from the United States.\u201d Moreover, Mexican  officials told us they now regard illicit firearms as the number one crime  problem affecting the country\u2019s security, and they are intent on working  with their U.S. counterparts to address the threat posed by weapons  smuggling.", "DOJ\u2019s ATF and DHS\u2019s ICE are the two primary agencies combating illicit  sales and trafficking of firearms across the Southwest border. For over 40  years, ATF has implemented efforts to combat arms trafficking within the  United States and from the United States to other countries as part of its  mission under the Gun Control Act, and it is the only entity within the  U.S. government able to trace firearms recovered in crime in Mexico.

Through Project  Gunrunner\u2014ATF\u2019s key effort to address arms trafficking to Mexico\u2014the  agency has conducted investigations to identify and prosecute individuals  involved in arms trafficking schemes and has provided training to Mexican  law enforcement officials on firearms identification and tracing  techniques, among other efforts. According to ICE, for over 30 years,  ICE\u2014and previously the U.S. Customs Service\u2014has implemented efforts  to enforce U.S. export laws, and ICE agents and other staff address a range  of issues, including combating the illicit smuggling of money, people,  drugs, and firearms. Examples of ICE\u2019s arms trafficking-related activities  include its efforts to raise public awareness through the dissemination of  posters and brochures to educate FFLs and firearms purchasers about U.S.  laws related to firearms and smuggling, as well as ICE\u2019s more recent effort  to expand seizures of firearms destined for Mexico on the U.S. side of the  border. ICE enhanced its efforts on arms trafficking to Mexico through  Operation Armas Cruzadas, announced in 2008.

It also has a responsibility for securing  and facilitating trade and travel while enforcing hundreds of U.S.   regulations, including immigration and drug laws; as such, CBP is involved  in intercepting contraband firearms to Mexico.", "DOJ\u2019s U.S. Attorneys serve as the nation\u2019s principal litigators under the  direction of the U.S. Attorney General. U.S. Attorneys handle criminal  prosecutions and civil suits in which the United States has an interest,  including cases against individuals who violate federal criminal laws  related to firearms trafficking.

As is inherently the case with  various types of illegal trafficking, such as drug trafficking, the extent of  firearms trafficking to Mexico is unknown; however, according to ATF, a  large number of guns are seized from criminals by the military and law  enforcement in Mexico, and information on many of these guns is  submitted to ATF for the purposes of tracing their origins and uncovering  how the guns arrived in Mexico. ATF maintains data on the firearms that  are seized in Mexico and submitted for a trace, and, from these firearms  trace requests, ATF officials told us, they are often able to detect  suspicious patterns and trends that can help identify and disrupt arms  trafficking networks on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.", "Using ATF\u2019s eTrace data, which currently serves as the best data we found  available for analyzing the source and nature of firearms trafficked and  seized in Mexico, we determined over 20,000, or 87 percent, of firearms  seized by Mexican authorities and traced from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal  year 2008 originated in the United States.

In 2008, of the almost 30,000  firearms that the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s office said were seized, only  around 7,200, or approximately a quarter, were submitted to ATF for  tracing. U.S. and Mexican government and law enforcement officials  indicated Mexican government officials had not submitted all of the  firearms tracing information due to bureaucratic obstacles between the  Mexican military and the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office and lack of a  sufficient number of trained staff to use eTrace. For instance, at one point,  State officials told us, the Government of Mexico had only one staff person  collecting gun information and entering it into eTrace. Further, as ATF  pointed out, not all guns seized in the United States are submitted by U.S.  entities to ATF for tracing either, due to some of the same type of  bureaucratic and resource challenges faced in Mexico. Consistent with the  results of eTrace data, U.S. law enforcement officials who had worked on  arms trafficking in Mexico and along the U.S.-Mexican border told us their  experience and observations corroborated that most of the firearms in  Mexico had originated in the United States. Furthermore, U.S. and  Mexican government and law enforcement officials also stated this  scenario seemed most likely, given the ease of acquiring firearms in the  United States; specifically, they told us they saw no reason why the drug  cartels would go through the difficulty of acquiring a gun somewhere else  in the world and transporting it to Mexico when it is so easy for them to do  so from the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Firearms Seized in Mexico Are Increasingly More Powerful and Lethal", "paragraphs": ["While existing data does not allow for an analysis of trends of all firearms  seized in Mexico, according to U.S. and Mexican government officials, the  firearms seized in Mexico have been increasingly more powerful and lethal  in recent years.

In addition to these firearms that are  successfully traced back to a retail dealer, some ATF officials told us,  based on information from their operations and investigations, many  seized guns also come from private sales at gun shows, though it is  impossible to know this exact number due to the lack of records kept for  such purchases, which is discussed further below.", "The illicit purchase of firearms in the United States happens in various  ways depending upon where the purchase takes place.", "Gun shops and pawn shops.

These straw purchasers are  individuals with clean records who can be expected to pass the required  background check and who are paid by drug cartel representatives or  middlemen to purchase certain guns from gun shops. Because the straw  purchasers are legitimately qualified to purchase the guns, they can be  difficult to identify by gun shop owners and clerks, absent obvious clues  that would signify that a straw purchase is happening. For instance, ATF  officials were tipped off to straw purchases when older women purchased  multiple AK-type semiautomatic rifles, or individuals who seemed to know  little about guns made purchases off of a written shopping list. In far fewer  cases, ATF officials stated, corrupt gun shop owners or staff facilitate  these illicit purchases. ATF officials told us they have not estimated what  percentage of firearms trafficked to Mexico result from such illegal actions  on the part of the gun shop owners or staff, but ATF has identified gun  shop personnel who sold guns they knew would be trafficked to Mexico,  as well as instances where gun shop personnel have altered their records  to mask the disappearance of guns from their inventory after being sold  illegally.", "Gun shows.

Key law enforcement officials stated  restrictions on establishing a federal firearms registry lengthen the time  and resources required by ATF to complete a crime gun trace and can limit  the success of some traces. ATF officials added that information ATF is  able to maintain on certain firearms purchases, such as information on  some multiple firearms purchases, enables ATF to more quickly trace  those firearms if they turn up in crime because the information is already  entered into a searchable database.", "According to ATF, from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2008, it took the  agency an average of about 14 days to complete a trace of a firearm  recovered in Mexico to the first retail purchaser. However, officials stated  investigative leads obtained from trace results are most useful within the  first few days following a firearm seizure, in part because the sort of  conspiracies often associated with firearms trafficking tend to change  personnel frequently and, as a result, an individual found to be responsible  for the purchase of a particular firearm may no longer have ties to the  principal gun trafficker directing the scheme.", "DOJ documents and ATF officials also noted secondary firearms\u2014 firearms resold following the first retail purchase from an FFL, or \u201cused  guns\u201d\u2014are commonly trafficked to Mexico. Federal law permits the  private transfer of certain firearms from one unlicensed individual to  another in places such as at gun shows, without requiring any record of  the transaction be maintained by the unlicensed individuals, an FFL, or  other law enforcement authority. Secondhand firearms may also be sold  to and purchased from FFL pawnshops. Although pawnshops maintain  records of any secondhand firearm transfers, ATF cannot directly trace  the firearm from the first retail sale at an FFL to the pawnshop. Through  the firearms trace process, ATF can follow the records of a firearm from  the manufacturer or importer to the first retail sale at an FFL; however, if  the firearm was resold from one individual to another or through a  pawnshop, there is a break in the chain of records, and ATF must then  consult with the last recorded purchaser of the firearm to determine the  continuing disposition of the firearm. As a result, ATF officials stated that,  while ATF may be able to trace a firearm to the first retail purchaser, it  generally has no knowledge of any secondhand firearms purchases from  gun shows or pawnshops\u2014where many traffickers buy guns\u2014without  conducting further investigation, which may require significant additional  resources and time.", "Lack of required background checks for private firearms sales. Federal  firearms law prohibits certain persons from possessing or receiving  firearms. A 1993 amendment to the Gun Control Act (the Brady Handgun  Violence Prevention Act) required background checks be completed for all  nonlicensed persons seeking to obtain firearms from FFLs, subject to  certain exceptions. These background checks provide an automated  search of criminal and noncriminal records to determine a person\u2019s  eligibility to purchase a firearm. However, private sales of firearms from  one individual to another, including private sales at gun shows, are not  subject to the background checks requirement and, therefore, do not  require the seller to determine whether the purchaser is a felon or other  prohibited person, such as an illegal or unlawful alien. DOJ documents  and ATF officials stated that, as a result, many firearms trafficked to  Mexico may be purchased through these types of transactions by  individuals who may want to avoid background checks and records of  their firearms purchases.", "Limitations on reporting requirements for multiple sales. Under the  federal multiple sale reporting requirement, an FFL that sells two or more  handguns within 5 business days to an individual must report information  on the transaction to ATF. The federal reporting requirement was  established to cover multiple sales of handguns, following studies showing  that handguns sold in multiple sales to the same individual purchaser were  frequently used in crime. ATF has identified multiple sales or purchases of  firearms by a nonlicensee as a \u201csignificant indicator\u201d of firearms  trafficking, and officials noted the federal multiple sale reporting  requirement helps expedite the time required by ATF to complete a crime  gun trace. ATF officials added that information ATF received from FFLs  on multiple sales has provided critical leads for some investigations of  arms trafficking to Mexico. However, the requirement does not apply to  purchases of long guns. As a result, although according to ATF data  about 27 percent of firearms recovered in Mexico and traced from fiscal  year 2004 to fiscal year 2008 were long guns, ATF does not have  information in its multiple sales database on any long guns recovered in  crime in Mexico that may have been purchased through a multiple sale. In  addition, law enforcement officials noted traffickers are aware of how to  avoid the federal reporting requirement by spreading out purchases of  handguns at different FFLs. For example, traffickers can effectively  purchase two or more guns within 5 business days without having such  purchases reported as long as they purchase no more than one gun at any  individual FFL."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Coordination Hampers ATF and ICE Efforts to Combat Arms Trafficking to Mexico", "paragraphs": ["Some officials we met with from ATF and ICE\u2014the two primary agencies  combating arms trafficking to Mexico\u2014noted the agencies have worked  well together on various efforts to address the issue; however, we found  ATF and ICE have not consistently coordinated their efforts to combat  arms trafficking. ATF has stated it aims to address arms trafficking to  Mexico in collaboration with domestic and Mexican law enforcement  partners, including Mexican government entities, as well as U.S. agencies  such as ICE and DEA. Specifically, a 2007 ATF document outlining its plan  for Project Gunrunner stated ATF would incorporate ICE, CBP, and other  participating agencies in joint initiatives, to expand information sharing  and coordinated operations. According to ICE, its BEST initiative was  largely developed to facilitate cooperation and bring together resources of  ICE, CBP, and other U.S. and Mexican law enforcement entities to take a  comprehensive approach to address border violence and vulnerabilities.  However, an outdated interagency agreement and jurisdictional conflicts  have led to instances of poor coordination between the two agencies.  Officials from both agencies in Washington and in the field cited examples  of inadequate communication on investigations, unwillingness to share  information, and dysfunctional operations. As a consequence, it is unclear  whether ATF and ICE are optimizing the use of U.S. government resources  and minimizing duplication of efforts to address the issue.", "ATF and ICE officials we interviewed had differing views of their  respective roles and responsibilities for addressing arms trafficking to  Mexico. ATF officials stated ATF\u2019s relative experience on firearms issues  and broad range of relevant authorities under which it operates\u2014including  its role in tracing crime guns and regulating the firearms industry\u2014make it  the logical U.S. agency to lead efforts to combat arms trafficking to  Mexico. For example, ATF enforces provisions of federal firearms laws  related to    prohibited persons in possession of a firearm,    knowingly giving or selling a firearm to a prohibited person,    a lawful purchaser acquiring a firearm on behalf of an unlawful purchaser  (known as a \u201cstraw purchase\u201d),   dealing in firearms without a license,  and  the unlawful interstate transfer of firearms in certain instances.", "Although ICE officials acknowledged ATF had more years of experience  on firearms issues, they told us they viewed ATF\u2019s role as focused on  firearms trafficking on the U.S. side of the border, while ICE has the  primary role in cases involving firearms smuggled across the U.S. border  into Mexico. ICE enforces provisions related to the illegal export or  smuggling of goods, including firearms and ammunition, from the United  States into Mexico in the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 and its  implementing regulations, the International Trafficking in Arms  Regulations; the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of  2005; and the Export Administration Act and its implementing  regulations, Export Administration Regulations; among other  authorities.", "In the locations we visited during our audit work, officials cited examples  of how unclear roles and responsibilities have hindered communication  and cooperation during some operations. Examples are as follows:    Several officials told us they felt the agencies were not taking sufficient  advantage of each other\u2019s expertise to more effectively carry out  operations, such as ATF\u2019s expertise in firearms identification and  procedures for conducting surveillance at gun shows, and ICE\u2019s  experience dealing with export violations and combating money  laundering and alien smuggling, which ICE officials noted also may be  relevant to cases of arms trafficking.", "Information on intelligence related to arms trafficking to Mexico was not  being shared by the agencies at the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC),  which was established to facilitate coordinated intelligence gathering and  dissemination among member agencies related to Southwest border  efforts to address drug, alien, and weapons smuggling. The 9/11  Commission Report asserted intelligence sharing is critical to combat  threats to the United States and that intelligence analysts should utilize all  relevant information sources. According to ATF, its \u201cgun desk\u201d at EPIC  was established as a conduit or clearinghouse for weapons-related  intelligence from federal, state, local, and international law enforcement  entities, including weapons seizure information from ICE, CBP, and  Mexican authorities. ICE stated its Border Violence Intelligence Cell  (BVIC) was established at EPIC to coordinate weapons smuggling  investigations and other related efforts with partner agencies and facilitate  timely information sharing and analysis. However, ATF officials we met  with at EPIC told us that, although they thought it was important for the  two agencies\u2019 efforts to be integrated at EPIC, they had minimal  interaction with BVIC staff. Additionally, senior ICE officials at  headquarters told us that, in the past, ATF has taken information shared by  ICE and used it to lead its own investigations; as a result, ICE has  subsequently been reluctant to share information with ATF at EPIC.  Although CBP had a representative assigned to the gun desk during our  site visit in January 2009, the ATF official in charge of the gun desk stated  ICE did not have a representative at the gun desk as of May 1, 2009. After  reviewing a draft of this report, ATF and ICE officials at headquarters  noted ICE had requested permission from ATF to assign a representative  to the gun desk in the past 6 months, and ATF permitted the assignment at  the end of May; they stated an ICE analyst had been assigned to the gun  desk as of June 1, 2009, which may contribute to improved coordination  between the two agencies at EPIC in the future.", "The agencies have not coordinated and collaborated on some covert  operations, potentially compromising the effectiveness of these efforts.  For example, ATF officials stated that, in some cases, ICE did not follow  standard procedures ATF has established for conducting operations at gun  shows. ATF officials told us of one case in which ICE did not coordinate  with ATF on an operation at a gun show, which led to an ICE agent  unknowingly conducting surveillance on an ATF agent who was pursuing  a suspect trafficker. ICE officials stated that, in another case, ATF had  conducted \u201ccontrolled delivery\u201d covert operations in an attempt to identify  organizations receiving illicit weapons in Mexico, without coordinating  with ICE. The ICE officials said ATF did not notify them of their  operations, including preclearing the controlled export of the weapons,  which could have put ATF\u2019s operation in conflict with ICE, CBP, or  Mexican government law enforcement and raised the risk that weapons  smuggled to Mexico as part of the operations would end up in the wrong  hands and be used in crime.", "In some cases, ATF and ICE refused to provide required documentation to  assist each other in arms trafficking investigations, according to ICE  officials. ICE officials stated, in some cases, ATF officials would not  provide necessary statements for cases ICE was investigating that  involved interstate firearms violations. As a result, the officials said they  would not provide a required immigration certificate to ATF for arms  trafficking cases ATF was investigating that involved an immigration  violation.", "Although ICE established BEST teams to facilitate interagency  coordination and an integrated approach to address border issues, ATF  and ICE officials indicated ATF has had minimal participation on the  BEST teams. ICE officials stated that, as of May 2009, ATF was working  with 4 of the 10 Southwest border BEST teams. ATF stated in February  2009 it had not permanently assigned any agents to BEST teams, but some  ATF agents had been available on an as-needed or part-time basis to assist  with BEST efforts to stop the illegal export of weapons from the U.S. A  senior ATF official subsequently told us resource constraints prevented  ATF from fully participating in the Southwest border BEST teams, but the  official said ATF recently agreed to assign one ATF agent to each of the  Southwest border BEST teams that are located where ATF also has a field  office.", "ATF, ICE, State, and other relevant officials we met with at the U.S.", "Embassy in Mexico City agreed on the potential usefulness of creating an  interagency, bilateral operational arms trafficking task force to conduct  joint operations and investigations including both U.S. and Mexican  government officials. However, ATF and ICE could not agree on who  would take the lead, or whether they would co-lead, the effort. Senior ICE  officials told us ICE preferred not to co-lead an interagency task force  with ATF unless ATF could provide an equivalent level of resources, and  ATF had relatively fewer resources in Mexico. The officials also said ICE  wanted to minimize coordination meetings that would be required with an  interagency task force. While a senior ATF official stated ATF and ICE  agreed at an April conference in Mexico to create an interagency task  force including both agencies that would be led by the Mexican  government, senior ICE officials said the interagency task force would be  led by ICE, and ICE is also moving forward with its own plans to create  several bilateral taskforces comprising relevant ICE and Mexican officials  at key locations in Mexico, without ATF involvement.", "ATF and ICE officials acknowledged the need to better coordinate their  efforts to leverage their expertise and resources, and to ensure their  strategies are mutually reinforcing, particularly given the recent expanded  level of effort to address arms trafficking. In our past work, we have found  that in an interagency effort where interagency collaboration is essential,  it is important that agencies have clear roles and responsibilities and that  there be mechanisms to coordinate across agencies. Officials from both  agencies stated ATF and ICE are in the process of updating a 1978 MOU  that existed between ATF and Customs (before the 2003 creation of ICE),  and the agencies are working to improve coordination and cooperation.  ATF officials said the new MOU will more clearly define the agencies\u2019  statutory jurisdictions and reflect changes in some laws since the previous  MOU was created. A draft copy of the MOU we obtained also included  some guidelines for coordinating investigations and resolving interagency  conflicts. A senior ATF official suggested that, in the future, it would be  helpful if ICE and ATF officials in charge of field offices could develop  more detailed standard operations procedures for their respective  locations, based on the MOU. However, ATF and ICE have not reached  formal agreement on the MOU to date, and officials said they have not  established other formal coordination mechanisms to facilitate high-level  information sharing and integrate strategies for addressing arms  trafficking to Mexico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors Limit the Potential to Detect and Seize Southbound Weapons at U.S. Mexican Border", "paragraphs": ["We conducted site visits to three locations along the U.S.-Mexico border  (Laredo/Nuevo Laredo, San Diego/Tijuana, and El Paso/Juarez) and to  Monterrey and Mexico City, Mexico, between September 2008 and January  2009. In March 2009, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced a new  Southwest border security initiative that will expand screening technology  and add personnel and canine teams that can detect weapons and  currency for southbound inspections at ports of entry, among other  efforts. Although we have not reviewed these new plans, our review of  operations found various factors limit the potential for southbound  inspections to reduce the flow of arms at the Southwest border.", "While ATF and ICE play important roles in investigating cases of arms  trafficking to Mexico, CBP is responsible for the ports of entry at the U.S.- Mexico border, and its efforts include intercepting southbound illicit  firearms at the border. Although CBP reported that from fiscal year 2005  to fiscal year 2008 some weapons were seized as a result of southbound  inspections along the U.S.-Mexico border, in general, such inspections  have yielded relatively few seizures. According to agency officials we met  with, in general, southbound inspections of vehicles and persons have not  been a high priority for the U.S. government and have resulted in relatively  few weapons seizures.  For example, in fiscal year 2008, CBP reported 35  southbound weapons seizures occurred at 10 of the 25 land ports of entry  along the Southwest border, involving a total of 70 weapons.  The other  15 ports of entry did not report any southbound weapons seizures.", "Efforts to increase southbound weapons seizures at the Southwest border  are limited by several factors, including resource and infrastructure  limitations, drug traffickers\u2019 surveillance capabilities, and the limitations  of Mexican government efforts.", "Resource and infrastructure limitations. Although CBP officials stated  CBP does not track the overall number of southbound inspections  conducted at Southwest border crossings, officials stated such inspections  have generally been periodic and ad hoc, depending on available resources  and local intelligence. For example, at one border crossing we visited,  CBP officials stated law enforcement agencies typically conducted about  one to two southbound operations per month. Officials noted southbound  border crossings generally lack the infrastructure available at northbound  crossings for screening vehicles and persons, such as overhead canopies,  inspection booths, X-ray units, and other technologies. CBP officials we  met with at the San Ysidro border crossing from San Diego to Tijuana,  Mexico, noted there are 24 northbound lanes at that crossing, with  inspection booths and screening technologies that enable them to process  about 110,000 vehicles and pedestrians crossing from Mexico into the  United States every day with an average 1-1.5 hour wait per vehicle.  However, the officials said there are only 6 southbound lanes, none of  which have the inspections infrastructure northbound lanes have, and the  majority of vehicles cross into Mexico without stopping on either side of  the border. Because of the lack of southbound infrastructure at this border  crossing, officials said they use orange cones and concrete barriers to  designate inspection areas during southbound operations (see fig. 7).", "To increase southbound inspections, law enforcement officials told us  significant additional resources for personnel, equipment, and  infrastructure along the Southwest border would be required beyond what  is already spent conducting northbound screenings. For example, as of  March 2009, Laredo, Texas, was the only CBP location along the  Southwest border with a permanent team of individuals available to  conduct southbound inspections at local border crossings. CBP noted  that, under the new security initiative, it plans to conduct more regular  southbound operations, in collaboration with other law enforcement  entities. However, officials stated some border crossings lack the  additional space that would be required to expand southbound  infrastructure in order to accommodate primary and secondary screening  areas while limiting the impact on traffic. For example, we visited one  border crossing in El Paso, Texas, that is adjacent to park land not owned  by CBP, which CBP officials said would preclude any efforts to expand  southbound infrastructure at that crossing. Officials added that the new  Southwest border security initiative will include efforts to survey existing  southbound infrastructure to assess needs for functionality and worker  safety, but they said any efforts to expand southbound infrastructure  under the new security initiative would be long-term, since projects  generally take 7-10 years.", "Drug traffickers\u2019 surveillance capabilities. Law enforcement officials  stated they typically only have about 45 minutes to an hour to conduct a  southbound inspections operation before drug traffickers conducting  surveillance at the border detect the operation and tell potential  traffickers to wait for the operation to end before attempting to cross. As a  result, officials said inspections are typically conducted during random  brief intervals over a certain time period, such as 2 to 3 days.", "Limited Mexican southbound operations. Although Mexican customs  aims to inspect 10 percent of vehicles crossing into Mexico on the Mexican  side of the border, they have generally inspected much less than that to  date. U.S. and Mexican officials noted, Mexican customs typically has  focused more on inspections of commercial vehicles for illicit goods,  which result in the payment of a fine, than on inspections for illicit  weapons. Officials said this variance was due to several factors, including  Mexico\u2019s general lack of capacity for detecting illicit weapons, as well as  concerns about corruption and the risks faced by Mexican officials  involved in a seizure of illicit firearms. However, the Mexican government  is taking some steps to improve inspections, such as enhancing  background checks and vetting staff involved in inspections, and putting in  place new processes, equipment, and infrastructure to improve the  security, efficiency, and effectiveness of inspections.", "DHS\u2019s new Southwest border security initiative has the potential to  mitigate some of the limitations we found with existing border operations.  We did not review efforts under the new initiative, and it is too early to tell  whether and to what extent these recent efforts may effectively stem the  flow of illicit weapons at the U.S.-Mexico border. Additionally, even if  southbound operations were significantly expanded along the Southwest  border, they might still result in a relatively small percentage of the  weapons intended for Mexico being seized. For example, in comparison,  even with the level of screening that is currently conducted on vehicles  and persons coming into the United States from Mexico, the U.S.   interagency counternarcotics community has noted only a portion of illicit  drugs crossing into the United States from Mexico are seized at the  border."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Lack Complete Data to Help Plan and Assess Results of Efforts to Address Arms Trafficking to Mexico", "paragraphs": ["With the exception of information maintained by ATF on traces of  firearms seized in Mexico, in general, U.S. agencies were not able to  provide comprehensive data to us related to their efforts to address arms  trafficking to Mexico. We found agencies lack recent systematic analysis  and reporting of aggregate data related to arms trafficking, which could be  used to better understand the nature of the problem and to help plan and  assess ways to address it. Additionally, while agencies provided some  information on efforts to seize firearms, and initiate and prosecute cases  of arms trafficking to Mexico, they were not able to provide complete and  accurate information related to results of their efforts to address  trafficking to Mexico specifically.", "As mentioned previously, ATF maintains some data on firearms that are  seized in Mexico and submitted for a trace, which can be used to help  characterize arms trafficking patterns and trends. For example, ATF has  used this information to identify primary trafficking routes from the  United States to Mexico and to identify types of firearms frequently  recovered in crime in Mexico. ATF also provided data we requested on the  number of traces that were linked to a multiple handgun sale and on  firearms that had been reported lost or stolen. However, ATF was unable  to provide data to us on the number of arms trafficking to Mexico cases  involving straw purchasers or unlicensed sellers because the agency does  not systematically track this information. ATF was also unable to provide  information we requested on the number of traces completed for firearms  recovered in Mexico that were linked to FFL gun dealer sales at gun shows  from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2008, although the agency began a new  effort to track this information in its firearms tracing system in June 2008.  Multiple sales, straw purchasers, trafficking by unlicensed sellers, and gun  shows have been cited in prior ATF reports and by ATF officials as  sources or indicators for firearms trafficking in general and to Mexico in  particular.", "For example, in 1999 and 2000, the Department of the Treasury and ATF  released three reports that included analyses of firearms trafficking trends  based on ATF investigations. The reports included information such as  primary reasons for initiating firearms trafficking investigations, sources  of illegal firearms, types of traffickers identified in investigations, and  trafficking violations commonly associated with investigations. Law  enforcement agencies and the National Academy of Sciences have stated  the type of information related to arms trafficking included in the reports  can be used by Congress and implementing agencies to more accurately  assess the problem and to help target and prioritize efforts.  One of the  three reports, released in February 2000, stated it was to be the first in an  annual series. However, it has not been updated, and similar analyses and  reporting have not been completed since the three reports were released.", "Senior ATF officials stated ATF had not recently compiled reports  including an analysis of aggregate data on firearms trafficking due to a  provision in their appropriation that was in place from fiscal year 2004 to  fiscal year 2007 that restricted the sharing of this type of information.  The officials stated an update would be useful and, since the  appropriations restrictions were relaxed in 2008, ATF was considering  such an update in the future, though no funding was requested for this  activity in ATF\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget.", "ICE officials also acknowledged the importance of compiling this type of  information, and they noted that, for the first time in March 2009, ICE,  CBP, and DHS intelligence staff had compiled an assessment providing an  overview of southbound weapons smuggling trends, such as primary  smuggling routes and destination states for firearms in Mexico. The  assessment included an analysis of 212 southbound weapons seized by  CBP and ICE in the Southwest border states in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal  year 2008, as well as data from the Mexican government on firearms  seizures in Mexico between 2006 and 2008 and data from ATF on a portion  of traces ATF completed for firearms recovered in Mexico in 2007 and  2008. However, the assessment notes that it \u201cdoes not provide an all  inclusive picture of\u2026firearms smuggling\u201d from the United States to  Mexico. ICE stated it worked closely with ATF intelligence staff in  developing the assessment. Nevertheless, the senior ATF intelligence  official cited by ICE as its primary ATF contact for the assessment told us  while ATF answered specific questions from ICE, such as regarding ATF\u2019s  firearms trace process, ATF was not asked to provide comprehensive data  and analysis or significant input into the assessment\u2019s overall findings and  conclusions. In addition, although ICE officials stated that the assessment  had been completed in March 2009, senior ATF officials we met with in  April, including the Chief of ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center, had just  received a copy for the first time. We found the assessment only includes a  subset of trace statistics we were able to obtain from ATF on firearms  recovered in crime in Mexico and traced over the last 5 years. The senior  ATF intelligence official told us that it would make sense for future  assessments to be developed jointly, in order to leverage more  comprehensive data and analysis available from both agencies; however,  he noted that until both agencies improve their interagency coordination,  developing a joint assessment was unlikely.", "Law enforcement agencies also reported tracking some information  related to results of their efforts to address arms trafficking to Mexico to  date, such as data on firearms seizures and cases initiated, but they lack  complete data on results of their efforts to combat arms trafficking to  Mexico specifically and have not systematically reported information on  results of their efforts. Examples follow:    Firearms seizures. Law enforcement agencies could not provide complete  data on the number of firearms seizures they made involving arms  trafficking to Mexico. ATF reported to us it acquired 8,328 firearms in the  four Southwest border states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, and  Texas) in fiscal year 2008 as evidence in support of criminal investigations  (through abandonment, purchase, or seizure), related to its Southwest  border enforcement efforts. However, a senior ATF official stated the  agency is not able to readily retrieve data on whether a firearm was  headed north or south, or, for example, whether an agent determined a  firearm was being trafficked to Mexico or was seized for some other  reason. In addition, seizures of firearms in other states that may relate to  arms trafficking to Mexico are not reflected in the above number.  Similarly, ICE reported to us it seized a total of 1,767 firearms in those  same states in support of criminal investigations related to its Southwest  border enforcement efforts in fiscal year 2008, including 152 firearms  designated as having transited through or being destined for Mexico. ICE  officials said agents have not consistently indicated in ICE\u2019s data tracking  system when a seizure relates to Mexico, so the latter number is likely less  than the actual number of firearms seized related to Mexico. They added  that seizures of firearms in other states that may relate to arms trafficking  to Mexico also would not be reflected in the data. Additionally, while CBP  reported to us it seized a total of 70 southbound firearms at official land  ports of entry along the Southwest border in fiscal year 2008, it noted not  all southbound weapons seizures necessarily relate to arms trafficking,  such as in instances when an individual is arrested at the border due to an  outstanding warrant and the individual also had a weapon.", "Cases initiated. Law enforcement agencies could not provide complete  data on cases they initiated involving arms trafficking to Mexico. ATF  reported to us it initiated 280 cases nationwide related to arms trafficking  to Mexico in fiscal year 2008. However, a senior ATF official stated some  cases involving weapons that were exported to another country, such as  Guatemala, and were later recovered in crime in Mexico would not be  included in the above number, because the intermediate location would be  recorded as the destination country in ATF\u2019s data tracking systems;  therefore, the number provided is likely fewer than the actual number of  cases. The official also noted ATF\u2019s data systems do not capture  information on reasons for initiating cases, such as whether a case was  initiated based on information provided from a confidential informant or  based on findings from an FFL inspection. ICE reported to us it initiated  103 cases involving Mexico-related weapons smuggling in fiscal year 2008.  However, ICE officials stated some cases that do relate to arms trafficking  to Mexico are not included in the data since ICE agents have not  consistently indicated whether a case is related to Mexico in ICE\u2019s data  tracking system. They also noted their data systems do not capture  information on specific reasons for initiating cases, such as whether a case  was initiated following a highway interdiction on the U.S. side of the  border or based on information provided from a confidential informant.  However, ICE was able to provide a breakdown to us of cases by referring  agency. For example, ICE reported 15 of the cases involving weapons  smuggled to Mexico were initiated following a weapons seizure by CBP at  an official port of entry, and 16 were initiated following a referral from  ATF.", "Prosecutions. Agencies were also unable to provide complete data on  prosecutions of cases involving arms trafficking to Mexico. Officials from  DOJ\u2019s Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) stated their national  database for tracking criminal cases does not have a category specific to  Mexico arms trafficking cases. They said there is not a simple way to  determine which cases involve arms trafficking to Mexico since cases may  involve various defendants and charges, and no charges are specific to  arms trafficking to Mexico. They added that, to date, most of the cases  U.S. Attorneys Offices have prosecuted relating to arms trafficking to  Mexico have been referred to U.S. Attorneys by ATF. ATF reported to us  it referred 73 cases involving arms trafficking to Mexico for prosecution in  fiscal year 2008. ATF officials stated although their data systems track  the outcome of all cases, including firearms trafficking cases in general, or,as another example, for cases related to Southwest border violence (which  may involve arms trafficking as well as other related offenses) they do not  readily track the outcome of arms trafficking to Mexico cases specifically.  However, based upon further review and analysis, ATF was able to  generate some information for us on the outcome of the 73 cases:  specifically, as of September 30, 2008, 22 cases were pending a  prosecutorial decision, 46 had been accepted for prosecution, and 5 had  not been accepted for prosecution. In addition, ATF reported 47 of the  cases had been indicted, and 33 had resulted in convictions. While ICE  was not able to provide data on the number of cases involving arms  trafficking to Mexico that it referred for prosecution, it reported 66 cases  involving Mexico-related weapons smuggling had been indicted, and 47  had resulted in convictions in fiscal year 2008. ICE officials noted some  narcotics, money laundering, or human trafficking cases may also result in  charges related to weapons smuggling that are not reflected in this data.

ATF currently has 3 agents in Mexico, and ICE  has 12, though ICE agents are required to work on a wide variety of issues  and, at the time of our field work in Mexico, none was exclusively  dedicated to arms trafficking issues. In May 2009, ICE officials told us that  one ICE agent in Mexico would now be dedicated to arms trafficking.  Where they can, these ATF and ICE agents work with their Mexican  counterparts to assist at crime scenes and to gain access to firearms  information necessary to conduct gun traces. As part of this, ATF has  worked with Mexican law enforcement to collect gun data for submission  to eTrace. Once they have received the data on the guns through eTrace,  ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center in West Virginia conducts the gun traces  and returns information on their findings to the submitting party. In  addition, ATF uses that trace information to launch new investigations or  inform existing ones. ATF officials told us these investigations are the  means by which ATF shuts down arms trafficking networks.", "However, despite these efforts, overall ATF and ICE assistance has been  limited, according to Mexican and U.S. government officials. For example,  due to ATF\u2019s resource limitations, it has provided only a portion of the  training ATF officials told us is needed to federal, state, and local law  enforcement and to the Mexican military. In addition, though ATF and ICE  have provided operational assistance in investigations, and though ATF  has assisted in the collection of firearms information for submission to  ATF\u2019s eTrace when Mexican law enforcement and military seize firearms,  ATF and ICE have been significantly limited in what assistance they can  provide. For instance, there are several firearms seizures in Mexico every  week, but in a country as large as Mexico, neither ATF nor ICE have  enough staff in multiple locations to assist with the vast majority of gun  seizures that take place.", "Also, U.S. assistance has been limited due to the incomplete use to date of  eTrace by Mexican government officials. The inputting of firearms  information into eTrace provides an important tool for U.S. law  enforcement to launch new, or to further existing, arms trafficking  investigations in the United States, which can lead to the disruption of  networks that traffic arms into Mexico, according to ATF officials. In  addition, the data inputted into eTrace currently serves as the best data we  found available for analyzing the source and nature of the firearms that are  being trafficked and seized in Mexico. However, because Mexican  government officials have only entered a portion of the information on  firearms seized, the eTrace data only represents data from these gun trace  requests, not from all the guns seized. U.S. and Mexican government and  law enforcement officials told us Mexican government officials\u2019 failure to  submit all of the firearms tracing information could be attributed to  several factors, including the following:    Mexican officials only recently began to fully appreciate the long-term  value to Mexico of providing gun trace information to ATF;  the Mexican military serves as the central repository for all seized guns in  Mexico, while the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s office is responsible for  maintaining information on seized firearms, and coordinating access to the  guns in order to collect necessary information has presented some  challenges, according Mexican government officials; the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s office is understaffed and has not had  sufficient resources to clear the eTrace backlog, according to U.S. and  Mexican government officials;   only some of the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s office staff had received  ATF-provided training on identification of firearms and on using the  eTrace system; and   eTrace has been provided only in an English language version.", "Recent trends in submissions of trace requests to ATF\u2019s National Tracing  Center indicate Mexican government officials have begun to input more  information using eTrace. ATF officials attribute this increased use of  eTrace by Mexican government officials to the training and outreach the  agency has provided over that period of time, and they hope this number  will continue to grow as Mexican government officials become more  aware of the long-term benefits to Mexico of submitting firearms trace  requests, participate in ATF firearms identification and eTrace training,  and devote more resources to gathering the firearms information and  entering it into eTrace.", "Nonetheless, the ability of Mexican officials to input data into eTrace has  been hampered because a Spanish language version of eTrace has still not  been deployed across Mexico. In September 2008, ATF and State officials  told us eTrace would soon be deployed across Mexico. However, ATF  officials told us that to date the eTrace system is still being adapted to  include all planned changes\u2014such as the ability to enter more than one  last name for a suspect or other party and to enter addresses that are  differently configured from those in the United States\u2014and that they were  not sure when Spanish eTrace would be deployed across Mexico. U.S. and  Government of Mexico officials told us it was important to complete the  development of Spanish eTrace and immediately deploy it across Mexico  because providing it and the necessary training for it to all relevant parties  in Mexico would likely improve Mexican government officials\u2019 use of the  system.", "In addition, according to U.S. law enforcement and embassy officials, no  needs assessments regarding arms trafficking were conducted in advance  of Merida Initiative funding and, as a result, some needs that have been  identified have not been addressed. The United States has recently  provided significant funding for assistance to the Government of Mexico  under the Merida Initiative; however, the Initiative currently provides  general law enforcement and counternarcotics assistance to Mexico but  has not focused on arms trafficking. State told us that the initial allocation  of assistance was more general in order to enable it to be provided to get  the money out for use in Mexico more quickly. Going forward, State told  us that with additional time they could potentially develop and seek  funding for more specific programs or efforts to assist Mexico in  combating arms trafficking. State\u2019s Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) in  Mexico City administers Merida Initiative funding for Mexico and had  been able to use some of the Initiative\u2019s monies in support of ad hoc arms  trafficking initiatives conducted by U.S. law enforcement agencies and  other U.S. entities at the embassy. However, there were specific needs  identified by Mexican and U.S. government officials that were not being  met, including the following:    Mexican government officials we met with consistently stated their  agencies needed training from U.S. law enforcement on firearms  trafficking. They said ATF had provided some training that was very useful  to their agencies, including training on identifying firearms, discovering  trafficking trends, or developing firearms trafficking cases and that their  agencies did not have their own courses on the issue. However, there had  only been a few training sessions and only a small percentage of Mexican  government officials to date had received the training. ATF, ICE, and  embassy officials agreed more training was needed but said they had  minimal resources to devote to address the problem. NAS officials at the  embassy told us they were able to take some of the Merida Initiative  money for building general capacity and use it to support some training  with an arms trafficking application. However, these amounts were small,  and the money was not designated in such a way that an arms trafficking  curriculum or training program could be developed on a large scale and  funded through Merida Initiative monies. Both U.S. and Mexican  government officials told us designing and providing a comprehensive  training program could be very helpful in boosting Mexican law  enforcement capacity to combat arms trafficking.", "Mexican government officials, as well as U.S. law enforcement and  embassy officials, told us another currently unmet need was the  development of a bilateral, interagency investigative task force for arms  trafficking. While the embassy uses a law enforcement working group to  share general, nonoperational information on a whole range of law  enforcement issues in Mexico, there was no group of U.S. and Mexican  law enforcement officials working jointly at an operational and  investigative level on combating arms trafficking. Mexican and U.S.  government and embassy officials told us that such a task force would  include a group of vetted Mexican law enforcement and government  officials working jointly with U.S. counterparts in relevant law  enforcement agencies, such as ATF, ICE, and others, on identifying,  disrupting, and investigating arms trafficking on both the Mexican and U.S.  sides of the border. Such types of vetted units, called Special  Investigative Units, work with DEA on counternarcotics operations in  Mexico. DEA officials we met with told us that these units are time,  energy, and resource intensive, but that they are essential for success in  their efforts. However, there is no dedicated money that can be used for  establishing and maintaining such a group for combating arms trafficking.  NAS officials we met with in Mexico City who were administering funds  for the Merida Initiative told us they had been able to provide some  funding for various projects that had an arms trafficking application.  However, funding a standing bilateral, interagency task force would  require significant money that would need to be consistently available year  to year. As such, these officials told us that, to date, they had not been able  to use Merida Initiative funding to develop and maintain such an arms  trafficking task force. In addition, NAS officials said that when the  embassy had supported the possibility of creating such a task force, ATF  and ICE each insisted on leading such an effort and refused to work under  the other\u2019s leadership, preferring instead to run their own agency units  with the Mexican government. Embassy officials told us they were unsure  whether any such units would be created in the future without significant  dedicated funding and agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Corruption among Some Mexican Officials Have Hampered U.S. Efforts to Provide Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Since taking office in December 2006, President Calderon has recognized  the need to address the problem of organized crime and the corruption it  creates throughout Mexican government and society.

For example, some  high ranking members of federal law enforcement have been implicated in  corruption investigations, and some high publicity kidnapping and murder  cases have involved corrupt federal law enforcement officials.  Furthermore, corruption is more of a problem at the state and local levels  than federal, according to U.S. and Mexican government officials. The  Mexican military, however, is generally considered to be less vulnerable to  corruption than law enforcement, according to U.S. and Mexican  government officials. As a result, the Calderon administration has used the  military extensively to disrupt drug cartel operations and seize illicit  firearms and to assist or replace local law enforcement when they are  overwhelmed or deemed corrupt. For example, in late 2008, President  Calderon\u2019s administration terminated around 500 officers on Tijuana\u2019s  police force and brought in the military to fill the gap until new officers  who had been sufficiently vetted could be hired and trained.", "U.S. government and law enforcement officials told us that corruption  inhibits their efforts to ensure a capable and reliable partnership with  Mexican government entities in combating arms trafficking. For instance,  U.S. law enforcement officials we met with along the Southwest border  and in Mexico told us they attempt to work with Mexican counterparts in  law enforcement, the military, and Attorney General\u2019s Office whenever  possible. However, incidents of corruption among Mexican officials  compel them to be selective about the information they share and with  whom they share it. For example, in 2006, the Government of Mexico  reported that it had dismissed 945 federal employees and suspended an  additional 953, following aggressive investigations into public corruption.", "Similarly, CBP officials told us that, on the border, collaboration between  Mexican and U.S. counterparts has been limited due to concerns about  corruption among Government of Mexico customs officers.

The Mexican military has been brought  in to work along the border, due to the corruption within Mexican  customs, according to Mexican and U.S. government officials. The  Government of Mexico is implementing anticorruption measures,  including polygraph and psychological testing, background checks, and  salary increases for federal law enforcement and customs officers, and has  implemented reforms to provide some vetting for state and local officers  as well.

NTC data on  firearms seized in Mexico, however, is not comprehensive. The data is  based chiefly on trace information submitted through ATF\u2019s eTrace  system. As mentioned earlier in this report, over the last 5 years, about  one-quarter to one-third of the illicit firearms seized in Mexico had  information submitted through eTrace, and not all of these were  successfully traced. Notwithstanding its limitations, NTC data was  sufficiently reliable to permit an analysis of where the firearms seized in  Mexico that could be traced had been manufactured and whether they had  been imported into the United States before arriving in Mexico. For those  arms that were traced to a retail dealer in the United States before being  trafficked to Mexico, NTC data also contained information on the states  where they had originated. Based on the trace data and discussions with  ATF and other law enforcement officials, we were able to develop an  analysis of the type of retail transactions involved in the initial marketing  of the firearms in the United States before they were trafficked to Mexico.", "NTC trace data also contained information allowing identification of the  types of firearms (e.g., caliber and model) that were most commonly  seized in Mexico and subsequently traced. We corroborated this  information in extensive discussions with U.S. and Mexican law  enforcement officials. However, as noted earlier in the report, because  firearms seized in Mexico are not always submitted for tracing within the  same year they were seized, it was not possible for us to develop data to  track trends on the types of firearms trafficked or seized. Similarly, we  were unable to obtain quantitative data from U.S. or Mexican government  sources on the users of illicit firearms in Mexico. However, there was  consensus among U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials that most  illicit firearms seized in Mexico had been in the possession of organized  criminal organizations linked to the drug trade. The involvement of  criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking in the trafficking of  illicit firearms into Mexico was confirmed by law enforcement intelligence  sources.", "To learn more about trends in illicit firearms seizures in Mexico, we  obtained data from the Mexican Federal Government\u2019s Planning, Analysis  and Information Center for Combating Crime\u2014Centro Nacional de  Planeaci\u00f3n, An\u00e1lisis e Informaci\u00f3n para el Combate a la Delincuencia\u2014 (CENAPI) on seizures from 2004 to the first quarter of 2009. To determine  the geographical distribution of firearms seized in Mexico, we obtained  data from CENAPI on seizures by Mexican federal entity\u201431 states and  the Federal District of Mexico City. We did not assess the reliability of data  provided by CENAPI, but we considered this data generally acceptable to  provide an overall indication of the magnitude and nature of the trends in  arms seizures since 2004.", "To identify key challenges confronting U.S. government efforts to combat  illicit sales of firearms in the United States and to stem the flow of these  arms across the Southwest border into Mexico, we interviewed cognizant  officials from the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) ATF, Executive Office for  U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA), and the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA); the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP); and the Department of State (State) regarding their relevant efforts.", "We reviewed and analyzed DOJ and DHS documents relevant to U.S.  government efforts to address arms trafficking to Mexico, including  funding data provided to us by ATF, CBP, and ICE; the 1978 Memorandum  of Understanding (MOU) between CBP and ATF and a draft version of a  revised MOU between ATF and ICE; data from ATF, CBP, and ICE on  firearms seizures; data from ATF and ICE on efforts to investigate and  prosecute cases involving arms trafficking to Mexico; and agency reports  and assessments related to the issue. We also reviewed relevant prior GAO  reports, Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports and  memorandums, and reports from DOJ\u2019s Office of Inspector General related  to ATF\u2019s efforts to enforce federal firearms laws. We reviewed provisions  of federal firearms laws that agency officials identified as relevant to U.S.  government efforts to address arms trafficking to Mexico, including the  Gun Control Act of 1968, the National Firearms Act of 1934, and the Arms  Export Control Act of 1976. We did not review Mexican firearms laws and  to the extent that we comment on these in this report, we relied on  secondary sources.", "To explore challenges faced by U.S. agencies collaborating with Mexican  authorities to combat illicit arms trafficking, we visited U.S.-Mexico border  crossings at Laredo and El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California. In these  locations, we interviewed ATF, CBP, DEA, and ICE officials responsible  for overseeing and implementing efforts to stem the flow of illicit arms  trafficking to Mexico and related law enforcement initiatives. We observed  U.S. government efforts to develop and share intelligence related to arms  trafficking to Mexico at the El Paso Intelligence Center. We also  conducted fieldwork in Mexico City, Monterrey, Nuevo Laredo, and  Tijuana, Mexico. In Mexico, we met with ATF, CBP, DEA, ICE, and State  officials working on law enforcement issues at the U.S. embassy and  consulates. We interviewed Mexican government officials engaged in  efforts to combat arms trafficking from the Attorney General\u2019s Office  (Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica), including CENAPI; the Ministry  of Public Safety (Secretaria de Seguridad P\u00fablica); the Ministry of  Defense (Secretar\u00eda de la Defensa Nacional); and Customs (Servicio de  Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria).

In fiscal year 2008, ATF traced 7,198 firearms seized in  Mexico. Of these, 6,854 were linked to specific states or the Federal  District. However, 344 firearms were traced in fiscal year 2008 that could  not be linked to a specific state where they may have been seized.

We disagree that our use of the 87 percent statistic is misleading. Our  report clearly states that the number of firearms traced by ATF  represents a percentage of the overall firearms seized in Mexico. More  importantly, ATF trace data for each year since 2004 identified that  most of the firearms seized in Mexico and traced came from the United  States. Our recommendation to the U.S. Attorney General and the  Secretary of State to expedite further enhancement of eTrace and  work with the Government of Mexico to expand its use is designed to  shed further light on the origin of guns seized in Mexico. 2.  We have added additional information to the text of the report to  clarify ATF\u2019s role in DHS\u2019s recent assessment. While ICE stated it  worked closely with ATF intelligence staff in developing the  assessment, the senior ATF intelligence official ICE cited as its  primary ATF contact for the assessment told us that ATF provided  some information to ICE for its assessment, but ATF was not asked to  provide comprehensive data and analysis or significant input into the  assessment\u2019s overall findings and conclusions. We found the  assessment only includes a subset of trace statistics we were able to  obtain from ATF on firearms recovered in crime in Mexico and traced  over the last 5 years. The senior ATF intelligence official told us that it  would make sense for future assessments to be developed jointly, in  order to leverage more comprehensive data and analysis available  from both agencies; however, he noted that until both agencies  improve their interagency coordination, developing a joint assessment  was unlikely. 3.  We did not comment in the report on whether any of ICE\u2019s databases  enable the agency to capture, track, and provide statistical information  on all ICE investigations, as well as associate seizures and  enforcement actions against individuals linked to criminal behavior.  However, as we noted in the report, ICE was unable to provide  comprehensive statistical information specifically on cases involving  arms trafficking to Mexico.  4.  Contrary to DHS\u2019s assertion that ICE and ATF enjoy an excellent  working relationship in their efforts to combat arms trafficking to  Mexico, ATF, ICE, and State officials we met with along the Southwest  border, in Mexico, and at headquarters cited problems with ATF and  ICE working well together. These officials included senior officials at  ICE\u2019s Office of International Affairs in Washington, from ICE\u2019s Attach\u00e9  office in Mexico City, and from ICE\u2019s office at the U.S. Consulate in  Tijuana, Mexico. 5.  It was not within the scope of our audit to review specific ICE  investigations or their disposition, and we did not comment on this in  our report. Our report noted that, in general, ICE was not able to  provide comprehensive data to us related to its efforts to address arms  trafficking to Mexico. For instance, ICE was not able to provide  complete data on the seizure of firearms destined for Mexico, the  number of cases it initiated related to arms trafficking to Mexico, or  the disposition of cases ICE submitted for prosecution. Also, DHS\u2019s  recent assessment of southbound weapons smuggling trends, which  could be used to better understand the nature of the problem and to  help plan and assess ways to address it, notes that it \u201cdoes not provide  an all inclusive picture of\u2026firearms smuggling\u201d from the United States  to Mexico. In addition, as we noted in comment 2, it only contains a  subset of the data we were able to obtain from ATF relevant to the  issue. 6.  As noted in the report, GAO has found that one of the key elements  that should be part of any strategy is clearly identifying an agency\u2019s  objectives and establishing mechanisms for determining progress  toward those objectives. Neither CBP\u2019s strategic plan, nor other CBP  reports and publications, make mention of illicit firearms, focusing  instead on other CBP efforts screening people and goods entering the  United States.
