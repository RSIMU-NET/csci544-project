GAO has previously reported that restructuring and rebuilding the Army will require billions of dollars for equipment and take years to complete. For this report, GAO assessed the extent to which the Army has (1) developed a plan to link funding with results and (2) evaluated its modular force designs. GAO analyzed Army equipment and personnel data, key Army reports, planning documents, performance metrics, testing plans, and funding requests. GAO also visited Army Training and Doctrine Command, including selected Army proponents and schools; Army Reserve Command; and the National Guard Bureau."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army will have established over 80 percent of its modular units by the end of 2008 but does not have a results-oriented plan with clear milestones in place to guide efforts to equip and staff those new units. The Army has been focused on equipping and staffing units to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; however, the equipment and personnel level of non-deployed units has been declining. The Army now anticipates that modular units will be equipped and staffed in 2019--more than a decade away--but has provided few details about what to expect in the interim. And while the Army projects that it will have enough equipment and personnel in the aggregate, its projections rely on uncertain assumptions related to restoring equipment used in current operations, as well as meeting recruiting and retention goals while simultaneously expanding the Army. Further, GAO's detailed analysis of Army data shows that the Army could face shortfalls of certain modern equipment. Such items are important because the success of the modular design rests in part on obtaining key enablers needed for modular units to function as planned, such as equipment to provide enhanced awareness of the battlefield. GAO has previously reported that the Army lacks a funding plan that includes interim measures for equipping and staffing the modular force, making it difficult to evaluate progress. Without a plan for equipment and staffing that links funding with results and provides milestones, the Army cannot assure decision makers when modular units will have the required equipment and staff in place to restore readiness. Finally, without this plan the Army risks cost growth and further timeline slippage in its efforts to transform to a more modular and capable force. The Army uses several approaches in testing unit designs and capabilities, but these efforts have not yielded a comprehensive assessment of modular forces. Testing the force is intended to determine whether modular units are capable of performing missions across the full spectrum of conflict. The Army has focused its testing efforts on combat units conducting ongoing counterinsurgency operations. However, gaps in the Army's testing could affect its forces' ability to deliver needed capabilities. First, the Army has not fully assessed the effectiveness of its support units because the doctrine that would define how modular support units will train, be sustained, and support the fight has not been completed. This doctrine provides a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of support units. Further, the Army has not assigned a focal point the responsibility for integrating assessments across activities, such as equipping and training. Second, the Army tested the capability of modular designs primarily unconstrained by resources, not at the level of personnel and equipment that the Army plans to provide units. Lacking an analysis of the capabilities of the modular force at levels that it plans to have, the Army will not be in a position to realistically assess whether the capabilities that it is fielding can perform mission requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During a period of continuing high demand for military capability, the  Army is undertaking a significant transformation of its organization and  force structure as well as an expansion of its force by more than 74,200  military personnel. One major initiative of this transformation\u2014referred to  as Army modularity\u2014is the redesign of units from a large division-based  structure to a brigade-based structure. An important difference between  the new modular brigade combat teams and the previous division-based  brigades is an increased capability to operate independently enabled by  embedded combat support functions such as military intelligence,  reconnaissance, and logistics. Although somewhat smaller in size than the  divisional brigades, the new modular brigades are envisioned to be just as  capable because they will have different equipment\u2014including key  enablers such as advanced communications and surveillance equipment\u2014 and a broad mix of personnel. Continuing operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan led the Defense Department to expand the Army to help  reduce the stress on the force and meet increasing strategic demands. This  initiative, called Grow the Force, will increase equipment and personnel  needs, and we have reported that the full costs to restructure and rebuild  the Army are large but uncertain.", "The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007  directed the Comptroller General to provide to congressional defense  committees an annual assessment, among other things, of the Army\u2019s  progress equipping and staffing modular units in the active and reserve  components, progress by the Army in conducting further testing and  evaluation of the Army\u2019s modular unit designs, and the use of funds by the  Army for equipping its modular units. In accordance with this mandate for  fiscal year 2008, we provided a briefing to your offices in March 2008 on  our preliminary observations. This report expands on the information  reported in those briefings and addresses in more detail the extent to  which the Army (1) has developed a comprehensive plan that links results  to investments with defined milestones and (2) has tested and evaluated  its modular force design.", "To assess the Army\u2019s plan to guide its efforts to equip and staff the  modular force, we analyzed relevant Army plans and reports to Congress  for equipping and staffing the modular force. We developed in conjunction  with the Army a means for analyzing key equipment and personnel  enablers of the modular force. Based on our review of Army modularity  studies and reports, we defined key enablers as those pieces of equipment  or personnel that are required for the organization to function as planned,  providing the modular design with equal or increased capabilities  compared with the previous divisional structure in areas such as a unit\u2019s  firepower, survivability, and intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance. To  develop a preliminary list of key equipment and personnel enablers, we  reviewed key Army modularity reports and obtained official comments  from the Department of the Army and Army Training and Doctrine  Command (TRADOC), which is responsible for the design and evaluation  of modular units. We then submitted the preliminary list to the  Headquarters, Department of the Army, for official input and held  subsequent discussions with Army officials. Our identification and analysis  of fifteen key equipment enablers compares total Army (active, National  Guard, and Reserve) equipment authorizations and design requirements  for the operating and institutional forces with total Army on-hand  quantities in April 2007 with planned equipment deliveries and projected  equipment on hand in fiscal year 2012. Our identification and analysis of  nine key personnel enablers compares active Army personnel  authorizations and design requirements for the operating and institutional  forces with active Army on-hand personnel strength in April 2007 and  projected personnel strength for fiscal year 2012 (see app. I for details on  our analysis of key equipment and personnel enablers). The Army\u2019s fiscal- year 2007 to 2012 equipment and personnel plans were the most recent  data available to us when we developed this analysis. The Army provided  updated data on the status of the Army\u2019s equipment as compared to the  design requirement as of June 29, 2008. We did not assess the reliability of  this 2008 data. However, the 2008 data were generally consistent with the  data we analyzed in 2007. To assess the extent to which the Army has  tested and evaluated the design of the modular force, we examined  TRADOC\u2019s modular force assessment process and plans to evaluate  modular combat and combat support unit designs. Although we did not  independently test the reliability of Army data electronically, we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report based on discussions with Army officials about the data quality  control procedures used to ensure the reliability of the relevant equipment  and personnel databases. We conducted this performance audit from April  2007 to September 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The  scope and methodology used in the report are described in more detail in  appendix II.", "We conducted this review as part of a continuing body of work related to  the Army\u2019s transformation to the modular force. In December 2007, we  reported that the Army is making progress establishing modular units in  the active and reserve components but has not established sufficient  management controls to provide accountability for results for establishing  modular units and expanding the force. In response to that report, the  Secretary of Defense agreed with our recommendations to improve  management controls and develop a comprehensive Army strategy and  funding plan for staffing and equipping modular units. We also found that  while the Army is evaluating lessons learned from its ongoing  counterinsurgency operations, it lacks a comprehensive plan to determine  whether fielded modular unit designs meet the Army\u2019s original goals for  modular units across the full spectrum of conflict. In January 2008, we  reported that the Army did not develop a transparent and comprehensive  funding plan for its estimated $70.2 billion Grow the Force initiative that  would allow decision makers to understand the full magnitude of the  funds needed and weigh competing defense priorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s modular restructuring initiative began in 2004 as part of the  overall transformation of the Army and was informed by earlier Army  studies, such as the Striker Brigade Combat Team effort. The foundation  of the modular force is the modular brigade combat team. A primary goal  of the restructuring was to increase the number of available brigade  combat teams to meet operational requirements while maintaining combat  effectiveness that is equal to or better than previous division brigades.  Modular combat brigades have one of three standard designs\u2014heavy  brigade, infantry brigade, or Stryker brigade. In addition, combat support  and combat service support formations have a common design that can be  tailored to meet varied demands of the combatant commanders. As  opposed to the Army\u2019s legacy units, the standardized modular unit designs  are being implemented in the National Guard and Army Reserves with the  same organizational structure, equipment, and personnel requirements as  active duty units. The Army plans to have reconfigured its total force\u2014to  include active and reserve components\u2014into the modular design.", "With the assistance of the Army, GAO identified the types of personnel and  equipment that will enable the brigade-based modular force to be as  capable as its predecessor, the division-based force. These key equipment  enablers are classified by category, such as tactical radios. Within each  category we identified the different equipment items that provide that  capability; for example, in the tactical radio category, there are 317  different types of equipment (see table 1).", "We also classified key personnel enablers by category, such as  psychological operations, and within each category we examined specific  types of officer and enlisted skills. For example, within the psychological  operations category we identified psychological operations officers and  enlisted psychological operations specialists as key personnel enablers of  the modular force (see table 2).", "As part of the redesign of the modular force, the Army is developing unit  blueprints that identify design requirements for equipment and personnel.  The design requirement, also known as the Objective Table of  Organization and Equipment or objective requirement, represents the  Army\u2019s goal of a fully modernized level of equipment and staffing for each  type of modular unit and is unconstrained by resources. Because the  Army\u2019s design requirements represent a future objective that is continually  updated and refined over time, the Army establishes an interim  requirement, known as the Modified Table of Organization and Equipment,  and authorizes equipment and personnel levels across the Army based on  its current inventory of equipment and personnel, planned procurement  timelines, and anticipated funding. The Army expects to use this modified  list of equipment and personnel for the foreseeable future to guide the  conversion of existing divisions to modular brigades. In sum, the design  requirement is the level that the Army would like each unit to have in the  long-term, whereas the authorized level is what the Army can afford in the  interim.", "The Army also considered DOD\u2019s strategic plan as it restructured to a  brigade-based force. For example, the Army\u2019s Brigade Combat Team  designs were intended to be effective across the full spectrum of conflict,  including global war, major theater war, smaller scale contingencies,  insurgency/counter-insurgencies, and stability and support operations.  Full spectrum of conflict includes a span of threats ranging from low  intensity conflict, where the major threats are from ambush and  skirmishes carried out by insurgents, to high-intensity conflict, where an  enemy operates large numbers of armored vehicles and advanced  weapons. DOD\u2019s most recent strategic plan, the 2006 Quadrennial  Defense Review, now refers to Army combat power in terms of brigade  combat teams rather than number of divisions, consistent with the Army\u2019s  new structure. In addition, the Army will create a number of different  types of modular support units, and multifunctional and functional  support brigades, which will provide, for example, intelligence, logistics,  communications, and other types of important support capability to  brigade combat teams.", "The Army has traditionally evaluated units\u2019 designs and capabilities, such  as support units and support capability, across a number of domains or  areas: doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and  facilities (DOTMLPF). Doctrine describes how DOD fights, trains, and  sustains it forces and is generally the starting point for assessing  capabilities. Organization refers to the design of units\u2014how many and  what types of personnel and materiel (equipment) a unit needs to provide  a specific capability. Training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and  facilities are also important components in building and sustaining  capabilities. By looking across the domains, the Army can evaluate how  proposed changes in one area can affect other areas and the units\u2019 overall  capability. For example, the Army may evaluate the effect of adding more  or different types of materiel or equipment on the capability of a unit to  determine whether such changes would require changes in a unit\u2019s  doctrine, organization, or training requirements. TRADOC is responsible  for developing designs of modular units and evaluating whether modular  combat and support units will be capable of successfully conducting  operations across the full spectrum of conflict. Other organizations within  the Army have responsibilities for personnel, equipment, and facilities that  are also critical to building and maintaining the modular force.", "The Secretary of Defense announced an initiative in January 2007\u2014 referred to as the Grow the Force initiative\u2014to expand the size of the  Army by about 74,200 military personnel to meet increasing strategic  demands and to help reduce stress on the force. This planned expansion  includes building six additional active modular brigade combat teams and  additional modular support units, which will require a substantial increase  in funding for personnel, equipment, and infrastructure.

When developing its personnel or equipment  plans, the Army must consider a number of factors. First, the Army gives  priority to meeting the needs of deployed forces, and these requirements  depend on dynamic operational conditions. For example, the surge of  forces into Iraq in 2007 required the Army to equip and staff additional  units quickly. Second, the Army must consider the wear and tear of  ongoing operations on its equipment and make assumptions about how  much equipment currently in use can be repaired. Third, the Army must  determine how much equipment to buy to replace worn-out equipment  and modernize the force. Finally, the Army has to decide how to distribute  equipment and personnel across its remaining units within acceptable  levels of risk.", "Army officials told us that they use internal tracking systems to plan  procurements of equipment and assess projected levels against  requirements; however, visibility outside the Army over the progress in  equipping and staffing the force is limited. The Army has not provided  congressional decision makers with this detailed information.

In its fiscal year  2008 report, the Army submitted a list of requested fiscal year-2009- funding amounts for selected equipment. However, the Army did not  provide comprehensive information that is necessary to determine the  progress it is making in equipping modular forces.

For example, the Army projects that it will exceed its  authorized level of medium tactical vehicles by fiscal year 2012, but its  projections include continued use of more than 12,500 obsolete two-and- one-half-ton medium trucks that are not deployable overseas. As table 3  shows, our analysis of Army data found that when older equipment is  excluded, shortfalls are projected in selected types of modern equipment  within the key equipment categories. For example, our analysis showed  significant shortages projected for three systems that make up the tactical  internet: the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System and the Single  Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System.

Our prior  work on recruiting and retention as well as equipping modular units have  identified some potential difficulties that could arise in implementing an  increase in the size of the Army at a time when the services are supporting  ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. For example, our prior work  has identified shortages in mid-level officers for a larger force.", "Repair and restore deployed equipment: Equipment is currently  experiencing significant wear and tear in overseas operations, reducing  the equipment\u2019s expected service life. It is uncertain whether it is  economically feasible to repair and restore equipment that has been  deployed overseas, also known as equipment reset, to preserve its service  life. An Army procurement official confirmed that the Army\u2019s equipment  projections rest on some uncertain assumptions related to the ability to  reset the force.", "Recruiting and retention of personnel: While the services have generally  met their recruiting and retention goals, several factors suggest that  challenges for recruitment and retention are likely to continue. For  instance, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in February  2008 before the Senate Armed Services Committee that recruiters have  difficulty meeting their accession goals because of a decline in the  willingness of persons in a position of influence to encourage potential  recruits to enlist during a time of war. Another factor that DOD has  reported contributing to the Army\u2019s recruiting challenges is that more than  half of today\u2019s youth between the ages of 16 and 21 are not qualified to  serve in the military because they fail to meet the military\u2019s entry  standards. Further, the Army has experienced decreased retention among  officers early in their careers and shortages within certain specialty areas  such as military intelligence (see app. I for a detailed analysis of the  Army\u2019s projections for specific personnel that are critical to the modular  force).", "Availability of personnel: A growing number of Army personnel are  unavailable for assignment because they are in training or are students, are  transiting between positions, or are in a \u201cholding facility\u201d due to medical,  disciplinary, or pre-separation reasons. Historically, about 13 percent of  the Army\u2019s end-strength has been unavailable. However, the number of  service members who are unavailable now is likely to be greater because  the number of personnel unavailable due to war wounds has increased  over the past several years.", "Availability of Funding: The Army\u2019s ability to execute its equipment and  personnel plans rests on several assumptions related to future costs and  available funding. DOD has relied on a combination of regular  appropriations and supplemental funding to finance the transition to  modularity. How long supplemental funding will be available for this  purpose is unclear. We have previously reported that DOD tends to  understate future costs in its equipment plans by employing overly  optimistic planning assumptions in its budget formulations. A growing  governmentwide fiscal imbalance could limit growth in defense funding  and force choices among competing defense priorities, and rising costs for  acquisition programs could require DOD to reassess the types and  quantities of equipment it procures in the future. A senior Army official in  the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs stated that significant  increases in costs to procure equipment required for current operations,  such as armored vehicles, represents another factor that may lead the  Army to procure less equipment than expected. Moreover, personnel costs  are rising dramatically, and as the costs for military pay and benefits grow,  questions arise whether DOD has the right pay and compensation  strategies to cost-effectively sustain the total force in the future.", "While Congress has provided substantial funding in response to DOD  requests, our analysis has shown the Army has not adequately  demonstrated to Congress how it intends to invest future funding to  procure the modern equipment and provide staff with critical skills that  will enable modular units to operate most effectively and when it can  expect all modular units to have the equipment and personnel they are  authorized. Decision makers may not be fully informed of the Army\u2019s  equipment status because the Army has not developed a comprehensive  equipment and personnel plan that details the equipment the Army has in  its inventories as compared with the equipment required for units to  operate effectively in their modular designs and that sets milestones  against which to measure the Army\u2019s progress equipping and staffing the  modular force with key enablers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Not Fully Evaluated the Capabilities of the Modular Force across the Full Spectrum of Conflict", "paragraphs": ["The Army uses a variety of approaches in testing unit designs and  capabilities, but these efforts have not yielded a comprehensive evaluation  of modular forces.

These  areas are interrelated\u2014for example, adding more or different types of  materiel or equipment can change the capability of a unit that would need  to be reflected in the unit\u2019s organization or doctrine.

Doctrine represents an approved guidebook that details how units are  expected to operate, how they will be organized, trained, and equipped to  perform their missions. Army officials stated that without doctrine it is  difficult to assess a unit because doctrine provides the standards by which  a unit is evaluated. Even though many support units have been converted  to modular designs, the Army has not yet completed the doctrine that is  basic to developing strategies to train and equip units. For example,  doctrine for logistics units had not been completed, and the Army did not  have a firm estimate for when it will be completed. Similarly, doctrine for  all military intelligence and signal units was incomplete, and military  intelligence officials were uncertain when this might be finalized. In 2005,  the Army Science Board cited the lack of completed doctrine for modular  support units as one issue that might limit effectiveness of the modular  force. These officials explained that the Army cannot be sure that unit  training is appropriate if doctrine is incomplete, because doctrine provides  the standards by which the Army assesses unit training. Without approved  doctrine, the Army cannot be assured that its efforts to assess and train  modular units are adequate.", "Once doctrine is in place, the Army can evaluate support units across the  other domains of the DOTMLPF domains. In contrast to its approach for  combat units, however, the Army has not identified an organization  responsible to ensure that integrated assessments of its support units are  performed across the DOTMLPF domains that affect the unit\u2019s capabilities.  For combat brigades, the Army has designated experienced officials  within TRADOC\u2019s infantry and armor centers, called capabilities  managers, who act as focal points for evaluating combat unit designs and  coordinating comprehensive assessments of these units across the  DOTMLPF domains to determine how best to mitigate potential risks with  changes to doctrine and unit design, resolve training and equipping issues,  and incorporate lessons learned. By assigning responsibility and authority  for assessing forces to the capability managers, the Army has created a  focal point for evaluating unit capabilities that clarifies lines of  accountability and helps ensure that the designs of support units are fully  tested across the DOTMLPF domains. For example, the Stryker Brigade  Combat Team capability manager monitors the status of doctrine for  Stryker units and lessons learned from current operations and updates as  necessary doctrine and unit design as needed. Similarly, TRADOC  established a capability manager for the Infantry Brigade Combat Team  formation who, among other things, monitors the development of  assessments across the DOTMLPF domains to ensure these areas are  integrated and that the infantry unit design supports operational  requirements. For example, the commander of one infantry brigade  combat team stated that the infantry capability manager could help resolve  concerns regarding training and equipment issues before deploying units  to support the global war on terror. Without a responsible focal point to  ensure that assessments across the DOTMLPF domains are conducted in  an integrated fashion, the Army runs a risk that support units will not have  the capabilities needed to support the modular force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Not Comprehensively Tested the Modular Force Based on Authorized Equipment and Personnel Levels", "paragraphs": ["TRADOC conducts computer simulations to test and evaluate the  capability of the modular force based on designed equipment and  personnel levels but does not perform these tests based on either  authorized or available equipment or personnel levels. According to the  Army, TRADOC assessed the modular force in 2004 based on the  resources, equipment, and personnel specified in the modular unit design,  not the authorized levels that would reflect the equipment and personnel  that the units will actually have. During this assessment process, TRADOC  identified some risks related to this modular transformation process and  identified enablers,  such as those we discussed earlier in this report, that  would be needed to mitigate these risks. For example, when TRADOC  used computer modeling tools to assess the combat capabilities of  modular combat units, it determined that there was a risk associated with  having two combat-focused, or maneuver, battalions in a modular combat  brigade, as opposed to the three maneuver battalions that made up a  combat brigade in the previous divisional structure. Based on this analysis,  the Army made adjustments in the design of the units, such as adding  battlespace awareness equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles and  increasing the number of intelligence personnel, before accepting the  modular designs. However, the Army\u2019s design represents an ideal future  objective that is unconstrained by resources.", "Measured against the design level, the Army is projecting significant  shortfalls in a number of different equipment and personnel areas. Since  the Army accepted the modularity concept based on the design level, these  shortfalls could also affect the capabilities modular units can deliver to  combatant commanders. As table 4 shows, our analysis of selected key  enabler equipment projections against design requirements found that the  Army projects it will have less than half of the design requirement for  some key equipment, such as battle command equipment, fire-finder  radars, tactical and high frequency radios, and medium-wheeled vehicles.  (For details of this analysis, see table 7 in app. I.)", "According to the Army, such enablers are critical to the modular force.  During the development of the new modular brigade combat team designs,  the Chief of Staff of the Army directed the Army to develop designs that  would be \u201cas capable as\u201d the legacy designs the Army wanted to replace.  Working under Army TRADOC, in 2004, the Army Task Force Modularity  assessed several brigade combat team design alternatives and concluded  that selected key enablers largely determined the performance of each of  the alternatives. As a result, the Army made some changes to modular  unit blueprints and assumed that modern equipment\u2014including advanced  battle command systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and top of the line  intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance equipment that provide a brigade  commander enhanced situational awareness\u2014would be available for these  units. These changes were meant to mitigate the risks associated with  smaller but more numerous brigades; the Army created four modular  brigade combat teams out of three former divisional brigades and reduced  from three to two the number of battalions within a combat brigade. The  Army approved an initial brigade combat team design, which senior Army  leaders assessed as \u201cgood enough\u201d for the Army\u2019s modular restructuring.", "Since the initial 2004 assessment of the modular brigades, the Army has  used a case-by-case review process to analyze specific shortfalls and  identify any needed risk mitigation strategies. These assessments have  been focused on supporting ongoing counterinsurgency operations.  However, because these assessments focus on a few specific shortfalls  and do not examine how all the equipment and staffing work together in  modular force across the full spectrum of conflict, it is unclear whether  the currently authorized personnel and equipment achieve the capability  that was originally envisioned."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Restructuring and modernizing the Army amid ongoing operations  presents a complex and growing challenge. To date, the Army has received  billions of dollars in regular and supplemental appropriations that have  helped to prepare deploying units, but these investments have not yet  translated into improved readiness for non-deployed units. As operations  have continued, the target date for rebuilding the Army has slipped  considerably and is now more than a decade away. We previously  recommended that the Army establish management controls to assess  progress in achieving its goal of fully equipping the modular force and  report this information to Congress, and the Army agreed. However, in its  2008 report to Congress, the information the Army provided focused  primarily on the 2009 budget year and did not include the detailed, year-by- year information that would represent the comprehensive management  controls that are needed to demonstrate progress in equipping and staffing  the modular force. Without detailed planning for results that includes  interim targets for equipping and staffing the modular force and clearly  links investments with goals for equipping and staffing modular units,  DOD and Congress will not have the information needed to fully assess the  Army\u2019s progress or determine the impact of any shortfalls. Moreover,  without the information the Army needs to show progress toward its goals,  the Army could face difficulties competing for increasingly scarce  resources in the future and risks additional slippage in its timeline for  rebuilding the Army.", "The Army\u2019s transition to the modular design has provided flexibility in  supporting ongoing operations, but the effectiveness of the design across  the full range of potential conflicts and with potential shortfalls in key  equipment and personnel is still unknown. Understandably, the Army has  focused its evaluation efforts on combat brigades supporting ongoing  operations, although these are primarily counterinsurgency operations and  do not represent the full spectrum of potential conflicts. However,  although the integration of support forces with combat brigades is a key  factor to the success of the modular design, the underpinning doctrine for  modular support forces has yet to be completed. And, unlike its approach  for combat forces, the Army has not yet identified an organization or focal  point to be responsible for conducting integrated assessments of support  forces across the DOTMLPF domains. By conducting an assessment of the  total force against the full spectrum of requirements and identifying  capability gaps in combat and support units, the Army can identify options  that balance short-term needs with long-term risks.

DOD disagreed with our recommendation to  report detailed information on the Army\u2019s progress in equipping and  staffing the modular force. The department agreed with our  recommendations to develop a plan for completing doctrine for modular  support forces and establishing a focal point for assessing modular  support units\u2019 designs. However, the department stated that its current  processes adequately address these issues. The department partially  agreed with our recommendation to assess the capabilities of the modular  force. However, DOD stated that the Army assesses the capabilities of the  force in many ways and that its current assessments are adequate and that  additional actions are not necessary. As discussed below, we continue to  believe that the actions we recommended are important to improve the  Army\u2019s ability to identify gaps in personnel and equipment and target  investments to improve capabilities more efficiently as well to manage the  transition of support forces to modular designs and operations. Therefore,  we have raised these actions as matters for congressional consideration.", "DOD stated that our first recommendation to develop and report to  Congress a results-oriented plan that provides detailed information on the  Army\u2019s progress in providing the modular force with key equipment and  personnel enablers is not needed because the department\u2019s budget, yearly  acquisition reporting, and congressionally required reporting provide  information on the status and plans for equipping and manning the force.  In addition, DOD stated that yearly goals and projections for on-hand  equipment and personnel are highly variable, given fluctuations attributed  to unit position in the Army Force Generation cycle, equipment repair and  reset plans, and planned modernization acquisitions. Although we agree  that the Army provides Congress with information on planning, budgeting,  and acquisitions systems, these systems do not constitute a coherent plan  that provides sufficient information on the agency\u2019s progress in equipping  and staffing the modular force. Without the benefit of a clear plan and  milestones against which to assess progress, the Army cannot assure  Congress that it is on a path to restore readiness or when it will have the  equipment and personnel it needs. The Army has relied heavily on  supplemental funding to support its transition to modularity, and the Army  has placed its priority for equipping and staffing on deploying forces.  However, in light of pressures on the federal budget, the Army needs to  make clear how it will use the funding it requests, when the Army expects  to be able to fully resource its forces in accordance with its force  generation cycle and the extent to which improvements are being  achieved in the interim. Therefore, we have elevated this to a matter for  congressional consideration, suggesting that Congress consider directing  the Army to include in its annual report on modularity detailed  information on equipment and personnel levels, progress toward  equipment and staffing goals, and risks associated with any shortfalls.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of the Army  develop a plan, including timelines, for completing doctrine for modular  support forces but stated that its current assessments are adequate.  However, DOD\u2019s response did not address two specific issues we raised:  (1) the doctrinal manuals for support forces are not complete and (2) no  plan with milestones for completing the manuals has been developed. In  its comments, DOD stated that it had published Field Manual 3-0,  Operations and that this manual included doctrine for modular support  forces. We agree that Field Manual FM 3-0 serves as broad-based direction  for all Army doctrine; however, it does not include specific modular  support force doctrine that defines how modular support units will train,  be sustained, and fight. As the report discusses, the Army\u2019s Training and  Doctrine Command has published, in separate field manuals, doctrine for  each of the types of modular combat units that details how these units will  train, be sustained, and fight. Our report highlights the need for the  support-unit-specific doctrine to provide the standards by which support  unit training can be evaluated. Until the Army develops a plan to complete  such doctrine that includes a timeline and designates appropriate  authority and responsibility, it is not clear that priority will be placed on  this effort. We believe that the actions the department has taken do not  meet the intent of our recommendation to improve the assessment of  support forces and that our recommendation has merit. Therefore, we  have elevated this to a matter for congressional consideration, suggesting  that Congress consider requiring DOD to report on the Army\u2019s progress in  developing specific doctrine for modular forces, including support forces,  in its annual report on Army modularity.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Army establish an  organizational focal point to ensure that integrated assessments of  modular support units\u2019 designs are performed across the doctrine,  organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and facilities  domains.

However, our recommendation was not directed toward the  responsibilities or authorities of senior Army leadership. Rather, our  recommendation focuses more narrowly on the need to address the  current lack of integrated assessments of modular support units. Our  recommendation was intended to encourage as a best practice the Army\u2019s  current strategy of appointing a focal point for ensuring integrated  assessments of modular combat units and to highlight how applying this  strategy could improve the integration of assessments for support units.  We recognize that there are a number of ways that the Army could address  the intent of this recommendation to improve integration of assessments  for support forces, so we have not elevated this as a matter for  congressional consideration at this time. However, we continue to believe  that employing the best practice of appointing a focal point for integration  would improve the Army\u2019s ability to integrate assessments across domains  for each type of support unit.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation to assess the capabilities  of the modular force based on the amount and type of authorized  equipment and personnel in order to identify capability shortfalls between  authorized and design levels and to revise authorized levels where  appropriate. In its comments, DOD stated that the Army assesses the  capabilities of the force in many ways and that modular brigades are  assessed based on the missions assigned and the ability to accomplish  these missions given personnel, training, and equipment available. Further,  DOD stated that the Army is currently assessing its capabilities and no  new direction is needed. We agree that the Army performs many types of  assessments of force capabilities. However, although the Army provided  us documentation of its assessments of modular combat force designs  with the level of equipment called for in the unit design, we found no  evidence that the Army has assessed the modular forces with the  equipment that these forces can realistically expect to have given the  personnel and equipment available. As our report discussed, we identified  significant shortfalls in the Army\u2019s projected equipment and personnel  when measured against the design levels. Further, the Army has focused  its testing and evaluation efforts thus far on conducting ongoing  counterinsurgency operations. We continue to believe that until the Army  begins to test units with realistic personnel and equipment levels and  across the full spectrum of conflict, the Army faces risks associated with  shortfalls of key equipment should a different type of capability be needed  in future operations in a different kind of conflict.

Because the  Army lacks a mechanism to measure progress equipping and staffing the  modular force, we developed in conjunction with the Army an analysis of  key equipment and personnel enablers of the modular force. Based on our  review of key Army modularity studies and reports, we defined key  enablers as those pieces of equipment or personnel that are required for  the organization to function as planned, providing the modular design with  equal or increased capabilities to the previous divisional structure in areas  such as a unit\u2019s firepower, survivability, and intelligence-surveillance- reconnaissance performance. To develop a preliminary list of key  equipment and personnel enablers, we reviewed key Army modularity  reports using this definition and received input from Army Training and  Doctrine Command (TRADOC), which is responsible for the design and  evaluation of modular units, and Army Combined Arms Support  Command. In addition, our selection methodology required that equipment  and personnel must be assigned to at least two types of modular units  (brigade combat teams, multifunctional support brigades, or functional  support brigades) to qualify as a key enabler. We excluded certain types of  equipment that are important to brigade combat teams, such as Abrams  and Bradley tanks, because they are present in both the new brigade  designs as well as the previous divisional structure. After we identified a  preliminary list of key enablers, we submitted the list to the Headquarters,  Department of the Army, for official input and held a follow-up discussion  with an Army official to discuss the Army\u2019s responses. Based on our  analysis and this discussion, we developed a final list of key equipment  and personnel enablers of the modular force (See app. I for a list of key  equipment and personnel enablers of the modular force). An Army  procurement official identified the specific equipment line items  associated with each of the key equipment enablers. Our analysis of key  equipment enablers compares total Army (active, National Guard, and  Reserve) equipment design requirements and authorizations for the  operating and institutional forces against total Army on-hand quantities in  fiscal year 2007 and planned equipment deliveries by fiscal year 2012.  However, our analysis excludes planned procurements funded by  emergency supplemental requests for fiscal year 2008 because this data  had not been entered into the Army equipment databases at the time of  our request. Our analysis of key personnel enablers compares active Army  personnel design requirements and authorizations for the operating and  institutional forces against active Army on-hand personnel strength in  fiscal year 2007 and projected personnel strength for fiscal year 2012.   This analysis excludes about 13 percent of authorized end strength for the  modular force because of military personnel who are in the transient,  transfers, holdees, students category, according to Army personnel  officials. The Army\u2019s fiscal year 2007 to 2012 equipment and personnel  plans were the most recent data available to us when we developed this  analysis. Data retrieved from Army databases reflect equipment levels as  of April 23, 2007, and personnel levels as of April 30, 2007. We shared the  data with Department of the Army officials and provided them an  opportunity to identify actions the Army intends to take to address  equipment and personnel shortfalls. To assess the reliability of relevant  Army equipment and personnel databases, we discussed data quality  control procedures with Army officials responsible for managing the  relevant equipment and personnel databases. Although we did not  independently test the data electronically, we determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. The Army provided  updated data on the status of the Army\u2019s equipment as compared to the  design requirement as of June 29, 2008. We did not assess the reliability of  this 2008 data.

We also  met with officials at TRADOC analysis centers and subject-matter experts  at Army proponents and centers, for example, the Signal Center, to  understand their efforts to develop and assess the design of the modular  force. Further, we visited the Future Force Integration Directorate and the  Army Evaluation Task Force at Fort Bliss to examine the Army approach  to assessing the future modular force.
