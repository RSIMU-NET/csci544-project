The first metric tracks the time taken from the receipt of a country's request for an item to when a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) is sent to the partner country for approval. As shown in the table, this metric is based on the complexity of the requests, and although DOD's timeliness has improved, it is still short of the 85 percent goal. The second missed metric is the time the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) takes to review and approve FMS cases. The review time in 2016 was more than the 1 day goal. The third metric is the time DOD takes to deliver the first item to the recipient country; however, DSCA does not collect data on this metric and therefore does not know if it is meeting the goal. DOD officials cited several factors that adversely affect their ability to meet the timeliness goals, such as changing customer requirements or delays due to policy concerns regarding particular sales. However, because DOD has not collected data on one metric and has not identified the underlying causes for not meeting its goals, it does not know the extent to which these or other factors are impacting program delivery.", "During fiscal years 2009 through 2016, the FMS workload increased and while the three military services' FMS workforces generally increased, DSCA's FMS workforce decreased. DSCA officials do not believe the size of their workforce has impacted timeliness; but the data provided to GAO shows that DSCA's timeliness has decreased as the size of its FMS workforce has decreased. A key principle of strategic workforce planning is that an agency's workforce must be aligned with its workload. However, DSCA lacks workload measures for its FMS workforce as a whole, and therefore cannot ensure that its workforce is sufficient to meet programmatic goals. Moreover, despite a DOD requirement, DSCA has not yet developed a workforce plan that could help identify any skill or competency gaps in its workforce. Officials said they planned to do so by the end of May 2018.", "DOD has a taken some steps to address recommendations to improve the FMS process, but additional actions are still needed. For example, DOD implemented three of GAO's prior recommendations, such as establishing performance metrics, but has yet to establish a metric to assess timeliness of the acquisition phase. DOD has partially implemented several of the recommendations made by an internal DOD task force. For example, DOD has partially implemented the recommendations to enhance the skills of the FMS workforce. In addition, DSCA's efforts to standardize data that are maintained separately by the military services on a new information system have fallen behind schedule."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DSCA (1) collect data on delivery of items or services, (2) analyze FMS performance metric data to determine why goals have not been met, (3) develop a DSCA workforce plan, and (4) develop DSCA workload measures.

FMS and pseudo-FMS transactions follow the same five- phase process, but the roles, responsibilities, and actors involved can  differ. For example, in the assistance request phase for FMS cases, the  partner country identifies its needs and drafts a letter of request. For a  pseudo-FMS case, the U.S. combatant commands and in-country  security cooperation organizations identify needs and draft the request.

The first metric tracks the time taken  from the receipt of a partner country\u2019s request to the transmission of a  completed LOA to the partner country for approval. DOD\u2019s timeliness has  improved, but it is not meeting this metric\u2019s goal of 85 percent of LOAs  sent to partner countries within established time frames. DOD tracks  performance and establishes goals based in part on the complexity of the  cases. Specifically, simple cases that involve routine or repeat purchases  of the same item, such as spare parts, training, and technical support,  have an anticipated offer date (AOD) goal of 45 days. Standard cases  that include purchases by experienced users of FMS, such as a purchase  of a Blackhawk helicopter with all associated equipment and services,  have an AOD goal of 100 days. Complex cases involve factors that are  expected to substantially impact the time taken to complete the LOA or  involve significant modifications and, therefore, have an AOD goal of 150  days. For example, the sale of new F-35A Joint Strike Fighter  Conventional Take Off and Landing aircraft, which includes spares,  support equipment, technical orders, contractor services, program  management, software support, and training, would be categorized as  complex. Table 1 shows the percentage of FMS cases meeting the  timeliness goal for each type of LOA. In addition, appendix II provides  information on how FMS time frames compare with pseudo-FMS time  frames.", "The second metric is the time taken for the review of FMS cases as they  are processed through DSCA headquarters. DSCA established this  performance measure in late 2013, with a goal of 1 day. However, we  found that, based on data provided by DSCA, it is not meeting this 1-day  headquarters review goal, and its performance with respect to this goal  has declined over time. The DSCA-provided data show that in fiscal year  2016, the average review time was approximately 1.97 days, up from  1.47 days in 2014. DSCA officials said that they would revisit the goal if  the average approval time were to exceed 2 days. Table 2 shows the  average time DSCA has taken to approve LOAs from fiscal year 2014 to  2016.", "DSCA officials cited various factors adversely affecting the timeliness of  FMS cases, including shifting partner country requirements and delays  due to policy or financial reasons. For example, they reported that sales  have been put on hold as the United States tried to influence human  rights policies in some countries. In addition, DSCA officials said that  when pseudo-FMS cases, such as those to build partner capacity, are  prioritized due to the possibility that the availability of appropriated funds  may expire, traditional FMS cases are delayed as the workforce shifts  priorities. DSCA could not identify the amount of time these factors can  add to the FMS process. While DSCA hosts meetings with the military  departments periodically to review data, the evidence DSCA provided to  document the results of these meetings did not include an analysis to  identify the underlying causes of the failure to meet goals. DSCA  officials said that, collectively, the information systems of the  implementing agencies and DSCA could potentially be used to determine  the amount of time that each factor costs in the process but that doing so  would be time-consuming and difficult. However, because they have not  conducted this analysis, DSCA officials could not substantiate the relative  importance of the various factors affecting the timeliness of the FMS  process.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should  establish activities to monitor performance measures and indicators.  These may include comparisons and assessments relating different sets  of data to one another so that analyses of the relationships can be made  and appropriate actions taken. These standards also require that  management conduct reviews at the functional or activity level to  compare actual performance to planned or expected results throughout  the organization and analyze significant differences.

DSCA  established a goal that 50 percent of all LOAs for a given purchaser  country deliver the first article, service, or training within 180 days. This  goal recognized that a number of complex systems cannot be produced  within 180 days, but the majority of cases do not involve complex  acquisitions.

However, DSCA officials also noted that because the military  departments do not present case line data uniformly, the data cannot be  compared to one another. For example, while the Army\u2019s logistics system  requires each item to be requisitioned separately, and typically identifies  each component in a weapons system as a separate case line, the other  military departments do not. According to DSCA, workload trends can  be affected by several factors, including partner country budgets,  exchange rates, prices of staple goods, import and export restrictions,  and regional instability. As a result, we used case line data to show  workload trends for each of the services separately, along with their  individual workforce trends in full-time equivalents (see tables 3, 4, and  5).

The Task Force produced two reports. In its first report, the Task  Force made more than 50 recommendations addressed to the Secretary  of Defense for improving security cooperation processes. The second  report provided information on the status of the recommendations. Our  review of these two reports identified 17 recommendations that the Task  Force addressed to DSCA. We found that DOD had implemented one  recommendation and partially implemented 16 recommendations, as  summarized in table 7.", "One of the Security Cooperation Reform Task Force recommendations  was that DOD \u201cmaintain an inventory of high-demand and long lead-time  items via the Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF).\u201d The SDAF is a  revolving fund that allows DOD and State to purchase select types of  defense equipment and services in anticipation of partner countries\u2019  future FMS needs. The fund reduces the amount of time it takes the  United States to provide some items and enhances U.S. readiness by  reducing the need to divert assets to meet urgent partner needs. The best  candidates for purchase through SDAF are items that take a long time to  purchase, make, and deliver. According to documents provided by DSCA,  the use of the SDAF over the last 5 years has facilitated the sale of about  $584 million in procurements to purchase equipment for about 45  countries worldwide. For example, the DSCA response shows that the  SDAF has been used to purchase a stock of night vision devices that  typically have procurement lead-times of more than 18 months. DSCA  reports that this has allowed the United States to transfer the devices  more quickly to meet the urgent needs of partner countries, including  Afghanistan and Iraq. Overall, SDAF has cut FMS procurement lead- times for key equipment by 6 months or more, according to the  documents provided by DSCA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DSCA Partially Implemented 16 Task Force Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["DSCA officials provided some evidence that actions had been taken to  address the remaining 16 recommendations.

The task force recommended the ERGTs to  provide rapid support to partner countries and the U.S. country teams in  developing high-quality, precise requirements for security cooperation  cases. According to DSCA officials, the expeditionary teams were  popular with partner country officials who were relatively inexperienced  with the FMS process. DSCA officials said that the expeditionary teams  have been used only three times because forming and deploying the  teams turned out to be expensive and disruptive to the processing of  other FMS cases. DSCA was unable to provide documentation for the  number of times and for which countries ERGTs were used, what results  were obtained from using ERGTs, or a formal determination of the  effectiveness of using the ERGTs.", "Another recommendation called for DSCA to \u201cupdate the Security  Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) and amend the Defense  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)to direct that  implementing agencies\u2014in specific instances when sensitive or classified  materials are being transported\u2014use a clear, comprehensive \u201cpre-case  transportation assessment\u201d document for assessing transportation and  distribution requirements following receipt of a Letter of Request and  before issuance of an LOA.\u201d According to DSCA officials, the change to  the SAMM was in the final stages of being approved as of May 2017.

In that time, the FMS workforce and workloads of the three  military departments have grown significantly, while the DSCA workforce  has decreased. Since 2009, DOD has implemented a number of reforms  designed to improve its capacity to deliver FMS assistance in a timely  manner. However, although performance for the program has improved,  two of the performance measures set for the program are generally not  being met. DSCA has not sufficiently analyzed the reasons for not  meeting these goals. For the third metric established to monitor the  timeliness of the delivery phase, DSCA is not collecting data and  therefore does not know how it is performing against this goal. Without a  comprehensive analysis of the entire FMS process facilitated by the  collection of data, DOD is unable to identify the reasons it is not meeting  its performance goals and to target efforts to address those reasons.", "Further, as part of its Vision 2020 strategy, DSCA reported that it would  develop a strategic workforce plan by October 2017 but as of July 2017,  DSCA had not yet begun developing the plan.

DOD commented that collecting data on when the  first spare part or support equipment is delivered does not provide  meaningful data. DOD also stated that DSCA will work with the  implementing agencies to establish a metric that will be useful in  tracking the delivery of defense articles and services to recipient  countries. Based on these comments and following discussions with  DSCA officials, we revised the recommendation to clarify the steps  DSCA should take.", "In partially concurring with our second recommendation, DOD stated  that it will continue to gather and analyze data on performance metrics  for which it has established timelines and where the data are available  in security assistance or cooperation data systems. While we agree  that these actions are useful for DOD to oversee the execution of  security assistance, we continue to believe that DOD needs to  improve its analysis of performance data in order to identify the root  causes of any delays and determine the steps needed to improve the  timeliness of the process.", "In concurring with our third recommendation to develop a workforce  plan for DSCA, DOD stated that DSCA is working with DOD\u2019s  Washington Headquarters Services on workforce planning. DOD also  stated that DSCA is working to determine hard-to-fill positions and lay  out a plan for filling such positions and identifying gaps caused by  attrition. In addition, DOD stated that it planned to obtain contractor  support by the end of 2017 in order to develop a human capital  strategic plan and planned to publish the strategy within 8 months of  obtaining contractor support.", "In disagreeing with our fourth recommendation, DOD noted that there  are not enough measureable requirements within a headquarters  activity to provide meaningful workload determinations, that the  workload at headquarters is independent of FMS volume, and that the  broad responsibilities across the agency have little relevance from  one area to another. We have clarified the report to reflect that  agencies can develop more than one workload measure and to more  clearly refer to the development of appropriate workload measures for  the agency\u2019s FMS workforce.

In  addition, appendix II provides information about how the timeframes for  processing FMS compare with the timeframes for processing certain  security cooperation cases authorized under Title 10 of the U.S. Code  and various public laws.", "To perform our assessment, we first identified the principal agencies and  components that process FMS. Although 14 U.S. government agencies  and DOD components process FMS cases, the Departments of the Army,  Air Force, and Navy process 95 percent of all FMS cases. For this  reason, our review focuses on the FMS cases processed by these military  departments. Because the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA)  also plays a key role in the FMS process, we also included DSCA in our  assessment. We also collected data and met with officials of the Defense  Logistics Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency to  better understand the role these agencies play in supporting the FMS  process. In addition, we collected data from and met with officials from  the Department of State, which is responsible for supervising and  directing FMS.", "We reviewed established DSCA and military department performance  goals and determined the extent to which those goals were being met,  and, where applicable, the factors contributing to agencies not meeting  those goals. We interviewed officials from State, DSCA, and the military  departments and reviewed guidance in the Security Assistance  Management Manual to identify existing performance goals across FMS  case development and case execution and to identify the information  DSCA and the military departments collect to assess their performance  against established goals. We reviewed GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control  to assess the requirement for managers to compare actual  performance data to planned or expected results. For all performance  goals that we identified, we interviewed agency officials about how  performance was measured according to established goals and collected  data on how performance results were communicated throughout the  security assistance community. To assess the extent to which established  performance goals have been met, we reviewed and summarized  performance data and interviewed officials from DSCA. We reviewed data  on military department case development performance in terms of mean  case development time and DSCA\u2019s anticipated offer date standards for  fiscal years 2010 through 2016. For the information presented in table 1,  the performance statistics are based upon the following number of cases:  We met with Navy and Air Force officials about systems for tracking  timeliness of case execution. Where the team\u2019s review of case  performance data showed that agencies were not meeting established  performance goals, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed data on  cases whose processing times surpassed established goals to assess  what factors affected case duration. We interviewed officials from DSCA,  State, and the military departments to build a qualitative understanding of  the factors that have historically affected FMS case development and  execution times.", "To assess DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 through 2016 workload and workforce  trends, and workforce planning efforts, we obtained fiscal year 2009  through 2016 workload and workforce data from DSCA and the military  departments. In referring to the FMS workforce, we refer to DOD officials  who process FMS and whose salaries are paid for with funding from the  FMS Administrative Surcharge Account and not DOD officials who help  process FMS whose salaries are paid for with appropriated funds. We  also do not include officials assigned to security cooperation  organizations at U.S. embassies throughout the world. The FMS  Administrative Surcharge Account is part of the FMS Trust Fund, which is  used to collect, among other things, payments from foreign partners for  purchases of equipment and services through the FMS system. For  DSCA, we asked DSCA officials to provide us with data on the workforce  that processes FMS and not the workforce that supports the FMS  workforce by providing training and other services. We obtained both  authorized and actual FMS workforce data for DSCA and the military  departments, as well as some authorized and actual mission critical  occupation data. The Army, Air Force, and Navy all use the same  process and structure for both FMS and pseudo-FMS cases; for that  reason, we collected fiscal year 2009 through 2016 authorized and actual  pseudo-FMS workforce data. To address the extent to which DOD\u2019s  existing workforce plans address the FMS workforce, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2010-2018 and Fiscal Year 2013-2018 strategic workforce  plans. In addition, we reviewed DOD\u2019s April 2010 Defense Acquisition  Workforce Improvement Strategy, and its Fiscal Year 2016-2021  Acquisition Workforce Strategic Plan to determine the extent to which  these plans specifically address the FMS workforce. We also reviewed  various military department strategic plans, including the Air Force\u2019s 2010  to 2018 strategic workforce plan, to examine the extent to which they  address the FMS workforce. In addition, we reviewed DSCA\u2019s \u201cVision  2020\u201d strategic plan. We interviewed appropriate officials from DSCA and  the military departments.", "To assess the actions taken by DOD to address recommendations made  since 2009 to improve FMS processing, we conducted searches for and  queried relevant DOD officials about audits, studies or reports making  recommendations or suggesting reforms to improve the FMS process  since 2009. We identified and reviewed a total of two prior reports by  GAO, one report by the State Inspector General, and three reports by  the DOD Office of the Inspector General, as well as two reports by DOD\u2019s  Security Cooperation Reform Task Force concerning aspects of the  Foreign Military Sales program. To determine the extent to which DOD  implemented the recommendations we requested documents providing  the details of the implementation including the number of times the  recommendation or reform was implemented, the results, and any  analysis of the results. We also interviewed DOD officials to ask them  about the recommendations and what was done by way of  implementation to determine the extent to which they had implemented  the recommendations. The ratings we used in this analysis are as follows:  \u201cNot Implemented\u201d means DOD provided no evidence that the  recommended actions were taken. \u201cPartially Implemented\u201d means that  DOD provided evidence that some portion of the recommended actions  was taken. This includes recommendations for which DOD provided only  testimonial evidence that the recommendation had been implemented.  \u201cImplemented\u201d means that DOD provided evidence that the  recommended actions were taken such as changes in policy, the  collection and use of data, records of transactions, results of initiatives  conducted, or records of reforms implemented. We discussed the  recommendations contained in these reports with appropriate DSCA  officials. In addition, we reviewed a memo discussing the status of  DSCA\u2019s Security Cooperation Enterprise Solution and met with DSCA  officials to discuss the status of the system.", "We collected the data used in our analyses from a number of DOD  systems. The data used to assess the extent to which DOD has met  performance goals with respect to the timeliness of the FMS process  were collected from DSCA\u2019s Defense Security Assistance Management  System (DSAMS), and the Army\u2019s Centralized Integrated System- Integrated Logistics system. The data used to assess workload and  workforce trends were collected from DSCA\u2019s DSAMS, and DSCA\u2019s  Business Objects Enterprise Reporting System and BeSMART systems,  as well as the Air Force\u2019s Security Assistance Manpower Requirements  system, and DOD\u2019s Defense Civilian Personnel Data System. To assess  the reliability of the performance, workload, and workforce data collected,  we reviewed existing information about the data and the systems that  produced them. We also interviewed agency officials knowledgeable  about the data and the systems that produced the data using a standard  set of questions. We found that the data provided to us were generally  reliable for purposes of our analysis, but that there were also some  limitations in the use of the data. For example, the military departments  differ in the definition of a \u201ccase line,\u201d which makes it impossible to  compare case line workload data by military department.

Foreign partners may pay the  U.S. government to administer the acquisition of materiel and services on  their behalf through the FMS program. The United States also provides  grants to some foreign partners through the Foreign Military Financing  (FMF) program to fund the partner\u2019s purchase of materiel and services  through the process used for FMS. In recent years, Congress has  expanded the number of security cooperation programs to include several  new programs with funds appropriated to the Department of Defense  (DOD), as well as administered and implemented by DOD, that focus on  building partner capacity. In this report, we refer to these programs as  \u201cpseudo-FMS\u201d cases. FMS and pseudo-FMS transactions follow the  same process, but the roles, responsibilities, and actors involved can  differ. One important difference highlighted by DOD and Department of  State (State) officials is that with FMS, there is a much greater level of  involvement on the part of the partner country in defining requirements  and developing the Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOA). As a result,  the amount of time it takes to develop FMS cases on average will tend to  exceed the time it takes for pseudo-FMS cases. According to DOD and  State officials, there may also be differences in the types of equipment  that tend to be provided via FMS as opposed to pseudo-FMS cases. For  example, pseudo-FMS is not typically used to provide complex weapons  systems with long production cycles such as advanced fighter aircraft.", "According to DOD and State officials, pseudo-FMS cases are often  prioritized because the funds used for these programs generally are only  available for obligation for 1 or 2 years, depending on the program. These  officials note that funds for traditional FMF programs do not have such  time constraints. As a result, pseudo-FMS cases are, on average,  processed faster than FMS cases. Army and Air Force officials noted that  pseudo-FMS cases tend to be more labor intensive than FMS cases for  several reasons. For example, according to Air Force officials, pseudo- FMS cases often involve items that frequently require a new contract  because the item is not part of the Air Force inventory. For that reason,  Air Force officials noted that they cannot modify an existing contract to  add additional items. Army officials said that pseudo-FMS cases require  more work because of the nature of expiring funds. This requires an  acceleration of almost all their processes.", "Figure 3 shows the average number of days it took to complete the case  development phase, which is measured by the processing time from  \u201cLetter of Request Receipt\u201d to \u201cDocument sent to purchaser.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Fiscal Years 2009-2016 Army, Air Force, and Navy Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Pseudo-FMS Workload", "paragraphs": ["Tables 9, 10, and 11 present Army, Air Force, and Navy workload data  using six of the seven measures.
