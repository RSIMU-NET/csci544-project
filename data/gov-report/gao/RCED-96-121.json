However, significant differences in the studies\u2019 objectives, methodologies, time frames covered, costs considered, types and extent of pollutants considered, and other factors produced widely varying estimates of costs per ton of pollutant removed, a common cost-effectiveness measure. Also, each of the studies evaluated somewhat different control measures and made different assumptions about the extent of the pollution and control measures already in use. These differences make comparisons of results between the studies very difficult. (App. II identifies the four studies that we reviewed and contains tables showing the cost-effectiveness estimates that were made by the various organizations.)", "For example, EPA estimates that removing volatile organic compounds using available control measures would cost from about $600 to $6,000 per ton of compounds removed.

Generally, in the studies that we reviewed, low vapor pressure gasoline was not included as an alternative control measure, but according to refining industry officials, it has the potential to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) at a lower cost than RFG. In a February 17, 1994, memorandum to an official in one area considering this option, EPA stated that RFG offers a number of benefits, besides VOC reductions that are due in part to the low vapor pressure of RFG, that low vapor pressure gasoline does not, including the reduction of air toxics and nitrogen oxides (when RFG phase II becomes effective) as well as federal enforcement of the RFG program.

In the early weeks of the program, retail prices for RFG were as much as 12 cents a gallon more than those for conventional gasoline. However, March 1996 data indicate that the average gap between RFG and conventional prices had narrowed to about 5 cents per gallon.

EIA data indicate that for all uses of oxygenates in gasoline, including the RFG program, about 384,000 barrels per day of oxygenates will be blended with gasoline in the year 2000 and about 394,000 barrels per day in 2010. These projections compare with about 309,000 barrels per day of oxygenates that EIA reports were used in 1995. Adjusting for the lower energy density of oxygenates, the projected level of oxygenate use will potentially displace about 305,000 barrels per day of petroleum used to produce gasoline in 2000 and about 311,000 barrels per day in 2010. (See app. IV for additional information on EIA\u2019s projections, along with the energy densities and volume blending ratios of the various oxygenates.)", "It is important to note that the above petroleum displacement estimates do not account for differing amounts of petroleum that may be used in the production process for ethanol and the other types of oxygenates. The extent to which petroleum will be used to produce oxygenates depends on several variables and, therefore, is difficult to predict. The greater the amount of petroleum that is used to produce oxygenates, the less petroleum will be displaced. As such, our estimates are likely to be somewhat higher than the displacement that will be actually experienced.", "Furthermore, the displacement estimates do not include any possible increases or decreases in refinery outputs made possible by using oxygenates in the refining process. The use of oxygenates could allow some refineries to operate their reformers at lower temperatures, thus increasing the amount of gasoline produced. Doing so, however, may result in reductions in the other petroleum-based products produced, making the total petroleum displacement potential difficult to assess. According to DOE, EIA, and petroleum industry officials, any increase in the finished products related to lower reformer operating temperatures would vary on the basis of the different refinery configurations but, in total, would likely be relatively small. One EIA analysis concludes that, not counting the volume displacement discussed above, the amount of petroleum used in the refining process may actually increase when using oxygenates, but that the increase is not statistically significant.", "The 1992 Energy Policy Act requires the Secretary of Energy to determine the technical and economic feasibility of replacing 10 percent of projected motor fuel consumption with nonpetroleum alternative fuels by the year 2000 and 30 percent by 2010. Using the EIA\u2019s projected oxygenate use discussed earlier and adjusting for energy density differences, oxygenates would displace about 3.7 percent of the 8.21 million barrels per day of the projected gasoline consumption in 2000 and about 3.6 percent of the 8.64 million barrels per day by 2010. In terms of meeting the act\u2019s 10- percent and 30-percent petroleum replacement goals, this amount of displacement will account for about 37 percent of the motor fuel replacement goal for the year 2000 and about 12 percent of the 2010 goal.", "Your office also asked us to estimate the level of petroleum displacement if all gasoline sold was reformulated. EIA\u2019s projections assume that about 35 percent of all gasoline will be reformulated and another 5 percent will contain some level of oxygenates for other purposes. Assuming the same percentage share for the different types of oxygenates, and other assumptions that EIA used in projecting future oxygenate consumption, we estimate that about 762,000 barrels per day of petroleum would be displaced in the year 2000 and 777,000 barrels per day in 2010, if all gasoline were reformulated. This would amount to about 9.3 percent of projected gasoline consumption in the year 2000 and about 9 percent in 2010.

According to DOE, private companies, using proprietary technologies coupled with zero- or low-cost feedstocks and taking advantage of existing facilities to reduce capital costs, believe they can produce ethanol for 60 to 80 cents per gallon in certain applications. Based on further research in developing lower-cost feedstocks and in improving the process of converting biomass to ethanol, DOE\u2019s goal is to produce ethanol at a cost of $0.67 per gallon by 2010, in current dollars. Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers cautioned us, however, that reaching cost-reduction goals can depend on how much ethanol will need to be produced. For example, DOE has the objective of deploying technologies, by 2010, that could contribute to a national annual production capacity of 518 million barrels of petroleum-equivalent fuels in subsequent years. If that much ethanol were actually in market demand, it would require about 30 million to 50 million acres of land, depending on crop yields and conversion efficiency. As croplands are increasingly used to produce biomass, land costs could increase due to greater competition for land resources. Increasing land costs and other factors, such as regional biomass crop yield differences, could drive the cost higher than $0.67 per gallon.", "According to a 1993 USDA analysis and USDA officials, improvements in enzyme and production technologies have reduced the cost of producing a gallon of corn-based ethanol from about $2.50 in 1980, to less than $1.34 in 1992, measured in 1995 dollars, a reduction of about 46 percent in real terms. USDA officials told us that they could not estimate the current cost of producing ethanol because of fluctuations in the price of corn.

This amount consists of a demand of 3 billion gallons per year to be used as an oxygenate and 11 billion gallons per year for ethanol to be used as a replacement fuel for gasoline. This long-term projection is based on achieving a market price for ethanol that is predicted to be competitive with the price of gasoline.", "DOE\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program Office also provided us with an estimate of transportation biofuels use, which shows an increasing use of biofuels from 126 million gallons in the year 2000 to 4.6 billion gallons and 10.8 billion gallons, respectively, in 2010 and 2020.

However, USDA\u2019s 1993 analysis showed that further expansion of ethanol from corn is limited because of the high price of corn and the fact that corn has many alternative uses.

According to EPA, while it is encouraging states to use RFG where its use is now optional, it expects that the amount of petroleum displaced by the use of oxygenates in future years will be modest. The reasons cited by EPA were that the oxygenate requirements of the RFG program do not change over time, the number of areas participating in the RFG program has remained fairly stable, and the number of areas participating in the wintertime oxygenated fuels program have been decreasing as the program succeeds in bring areas into attainment for carbon monoxide.", "EIA projections show a 24.3- and 27.5-percent increase in oxygenate use in 2000 and 2010, respectively, over 1995 levels. According to EIA, these increases are based on several factors, including California\u2019s recent statewide adoption of more severely reformulated gasoline requirements and projected increases in gasoline consumption, including RFG. In addition, the projections took into consideration the declining use of oxygenates in the wintertime oxygenated fuels program and do not include the expanded use of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Finally, EIA assumed a constant market share of about 35 percent for RFG throughout the forecast period.

EIA\u2019s projections of oxygenate use do not include the future use of ethanol as an alternative fuel. 12. We said in our report that the petroleum displacement estimates do not account for differing amounts of petroleum that may be used in the production of ethanol and other types of oxygenates. We also said that the extent to which petroleum will be used to produce oxygenates depends on several variables and, therefore, is difficult to predict. According to EIA officials, factors affecting the extent of petroleum use to produce oxygenates include the type of oxygenate and different assumptions about the source of raw materials and the energy used to produce the oxygenates and the vapor pressure of the blended fuel. We also pointed out that the greater amount of petroleum that is used to produce oxygenates, the less petroleum will be displaced. More detailed information on the extent of petroleum used to produce oxygenates can be found in the Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s April 1995 report referred to in appendix I. 13.

The increase in ETBE use did not show up in the year 2000 because the lowest amount of oxygenate usage reflected was 1,000 barrels per day. However, EIA\u2019s forecast of oxygenate use to the year 2015 shows that ETBE usage increases after the year 2000.

We agreed with this comment and have revised the report. 2. We agreed with this comment and have revised the report. 3. The cost-effectiveness studies that we reviewed use VOC reductions as a proxy for ozone reductions. We state in our report that VOCs and NOx emissions are two of the more prevalent pollutants emitted by automobiles and are precursors to ozone pollution. We recognize in the background and other sections of the report that RFG helps to reduce VOC, NOx, and air toxics emissions. 4. We state in the referenced paragraph that RFG offers a number of benefits that low vapor pressure gasoline does not, including the reduction of air toxics and nitrogen oxides. We have revised this paragraph to make it clear that these benefits are in addition to VOC reductions, which are due in part to the lower vapor pressure of RFG. 5. This comment also responds to USDA\u2019s comment 15. Our report does not indicate that API believes that low vapor pressure gasoline is a cheap ozone control measure or that lowering the vapor pressure represents a major cost. In the text following table II.2 that USDA refers to, we point out that in cities that already use a low vapor pressure gasoline, the cost-effectiveness of adding a RFG requirement is higher. This is because some of the benefits of RFG was already obtained by using the low vapor pressure gasoline. 6. We agreed with this comment and have revised the report. 7. In this section, we gave the range of the price estimates for RFG compared to conventional gasoline prices\u2014the low estimate cited by DOE and the high estimate cited by API. Appendix III.1 cites some of the reasons for the API higher price estimates. While API\u2019s estimate is in the high end of the range of estimates, it is largely within the range of prices actually experienced during the initial months of the RFG program. We agree, however, that to the extent API\u2019s estimated costs are higher than the actual costs experienced, its estimated costs to reduce pollutants would also be higher than actual. 8. We agreed with this comment and have revised the report. 9. While additional estimates of the cost-effectiveness of reformulated gasoline have been reported, and other estimates can be calculated, our objective was to identify and present cost-effectiveness data contained in major federal and other studies. Therefore, we made no change to the report. 10. We discussed this issue in detail with representatives from DOE and industry and concluded that varying industry practices make it difficult to assess the amount of petroleum used to produce oxygenates. As such, the displacement numbers presented likely represent the most petroleum displacement that can be expected. We revised the report to make this point clearer. 11. As our report indicates, the use of oxygenates could allow some refineries to operate their reformers at lower temperature, thus increasing the amount of gasoline produced. We also point out, however, that DOE, EIA, and industry officials believe that any such increases industrywide are likely to be relatively small. 12. Addressing potential price changes of crude oil and gasoline resulting from the displacement of crude oil by oxygenates was beyond the scope of our review. While there may have been some downward pressure on crude oil prices resulting from less demand as oxygenates were introduced, the overall impact on gasoline prices has been an increase in price as discussed in our report. 13. According to the author of DOE\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory study containing the information in question, USDA is incorrect in its position that renewable fuels such as ethanol necessarily emit fewer greenhouse gases than conventional gasoline. The author pointed out that there are differing opinions regarding the amount of energy required to produce ethanol and that USDA\u2019s estimation is lower than that of EPA and DOE. According to the author, USDA\u2019s estimation of greenhouse gas emissions by reformulated gasoline neglect to account for a number of sources of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions resulting from the production and transport of the fuel. For instance, carbon dioxide emissions result from oil used by farming equipment, oil used to transport corn to ethanol plants, the production of fertilizer, and the burning of coal used in producing ethanol in processing plants. 14. Our report focused on the results of cost-effectiveness analyses done by EPA, API, Radian Corporation, and Sierra Research. We recognize in our report that a number of variables can affect the benefits and cost-effectiveness of the different measures for controlling VOCs and other air pollutants. We also point out that the costs and benefits across these studies are not measured uniformly, making it difficult to make comparisons among the control measures. However, the objective of our work was not to conduct our own analysis of the control measures, controlling for all the factors that may affect the results. We also discussed this issue in the agency comments section of our report. 15. See our response to comment 5. 16. The API study did not address whether the NOx cost estimates affect the winter particulate matter benefits associated with NOx controls. 17. The API study measured all VOC and NOx reductions in percentages rather than tons of reduction. 18. The API study did not indicate whether modernization costs were included as part of the cost estimates. 19. See our response to comment 7. 20.

Accordingly, we obtained information on the use of oxygenates and its petroleum displacement potential from EIA and DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Alternative Fuels Policy.

During this assignment, we informed your office that we had not been able to identify any such studies. According to the DOE officials we talked with, the petroleum refining industry and associations representing the petroleum industry, the costs and benefits of using oxygenates versus aromatics would vary greatly from refinery to refinery and are dependent on the economic and plant-capacity factors of each refinery. This makes it difficult to generalize about the appropriateness of refining decisions on using oxygenates or aromatics.
