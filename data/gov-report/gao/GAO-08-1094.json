For example, Department of Management officials told us  that the dual control over procurement prevents the strategic management  of procurement. These officials stated that the Department of  Management\u2019s procurement division has overall responsibility for UN  procurement, but lacks authority or jurisdiction over peacekeeping  missions. DFS officials agreed that the continued divided management  structure for field procurement is problematic. These officials said that  each field procurement crosses between the Departments of Management  and Field Support multiple times, which is inefficient and leaves open the  question of which department is ultimately accountable and responsible  for the procurement.

Eighteen of the 20 chief procurement  officers we interviewed outlined challenges or difficulties stemming from  the division of responsibilities for field procurement. For example, DFS  does not have full operational control and authority for field procurement  because it does not approve individual cases, according to one chief  procurement officer. The Department of Management\u2019s Procurement  Division does review cases before they are submitted to the Headquarters  Committee on Contracts, but is not operationally accountable for late  procurements in the field, according to another chief procurement officer.  As a result, one field procurement officer told us that, even when a  procurement delay impacts a mission\u2019s operation, it is possible that no one  can be held accountable because procurement staff followed the rules and  procedures of their departments. Eighteen of the 20 chief procurement  officers we interviewed also expressed confusion or uncertainties over the  division of responsibilities between the two departments as well as which  department they should seek guidance from. For example, several chief  procurement officers told us that the Procurement Division indicated that  they should not communicate with the division on procurement questions,  but should instead ask DFS. However, DFS has only a two-person office to  assist field missions with their procurement concerns, and several of the  chief procurement officers said that DFS lacks the resources needed to  sufficiently support field procurement.

Department of Management officials stated that transferring authority and  resources for procurement to DFS would weaken internal controls by  including the field requisitioning and procurement functions within the  same department. These officials also said that the procurement division  within the Department of Management should be given overall  responsibility for all UN procurement, including in the field. DFS officials,  however, stated that they should be provided the authority and staff to  conduct field procurement. These officials said that procurement  procedures need to be improved to reflect the realities of conducting  procurement in the field. They pointed out that expediting field  procurement was central to the Secretary-General\u2019s peacekeeping reform,  and the continuation of the status quo on field procurement raises the  question of why DFS was created.

These training modules covered topics including the  fundamentals of UN procurement, contract and supplier relations, and  ethics in procurement. According to the Department of Management, a  joint procurement training program provided training to over 850 staff  responsible for procurement activities at various locations.

Some  chief procurement officers also emphasized to us that because of the high  turnover of field procurement staff, training must continue to be offered to  the field and must not be a one-time event. Several procurement chiefs  also discussed a need to expand training for other mission staff involved in  the procurement process\u2014particularly requisitioners. In May 2008, the  UN approved a Procurement Division training framework document that  covers the division\u2019s longer-term plans and objectives for procurement  training.

Another official stated that when the  manual was written the operational requirements in field were not taken  into account. This official added that during a war, it is not always possible  to go through a long bidding process for fuel or food and that sometimes  time frames need to be condensed to meet local conditions.
