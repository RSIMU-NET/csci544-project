Only the 2001 administrative expenses were lower, reflecting the termination of a key contract. In real terms, FRTIB's administrative expenses in 2006 were at a 7-year low. Throughout this period more than half of FRTIB's administrative expenses went towards purchasing services from outside entities--private contractors and other government agencies. The next largest share of FRTIB's budget was for miscellaneous expenses, such as printing and information technology. Additional administrative expenses were spent on compensation of FRTIB's 65 employees, rent, and travel. FRTIB has established practices that are consistent with federal regulations--for acquisition, compensation, and travel. There are some areas, however, that suggest opportunities for future savings. The amount FRTIB pays per square foot is consistent with average rental rates that the General Services Administration (GSA) cites for nearby available properties. However, FRTIB rents more space per employee than GSA would recommend. Given recent downsizing, FRTIB has begun looking into consolidating its office space. Additionally, opportunities exist to reduce the travel expenses of TSP board members traveling to Washington, D.C. FRTIB's current method of benchmarking TSP participants' investment fees against those charged by 401(k) plans is a very important measure for participants--and the TSP compares favorably on this measure. However, looking only at an aggregate measure provides insufficient information to judge whether individual activities are being conducted either to achieve the best performance or in the most efficient manner. Benchmarking by individual activity permits an organization to compare its performance with standards or \"best in class\" in a specific activity."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)\u2014created in 1986\u2014is a key component of  the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (FERS).

It is managed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment  Board (FRTIB), an independent agency in the executive branch governed  by five Presidentially appointed board members. Similar to private sector  401(k) pension plans, TSP allows federal employees to contribute a  portion of their current compensation through payroll deductions and  invest among a menu of options.", "As part of a broader request on the oversight of FRTIB, you asked that we  examine the administrative expenses of FRTIB. Specifically, we reviewed  (1) the administrative expenses of FRTIB and the key components of these  expenses, (2) whether the administrative expenses are the result of  practices consistent with applicable federal regulations, and (3) FRTIB\u2019s  current method of benchmarking administrative expenses.", "To identify the administrative expenses of FRTIB, we reviewed the  President\u2019s budget, FRTIB\u2019s audited financial statements, FRTIB\u2019s budget  documents from board meeting notes and FRTIB\u2019s written responses to  questions we submitted. To analyze the components of administrative  expenses, we used the projections contained in FRTIB\u2019s annual budget  documents. FRTIB officials confirmed that these projections were  analogous to what appears in budget documents for other agencies as  \u201cactuals.\u201d For the purposes of this review, and consistent with how FRTIB  presented its budget to the board members for approval, we considered all  expenses other than investment expenses to be administrative. We used  budget object classifications to categorize FRTIB\u2019s administrative  expenses. These categories can broadly fit into six groups: services  purchased from private contractors, services purchased from government  agencies, miscellaneous expenses, compensation, rental of space, and  travel. There is some overlap in the descriptions. For example, the  mission-related telephone service for the call centers should fall under  services purchased from private contractors rather than miscellaneous  expenses. However, because FRTIB budget data aggregate these expenses  with charges such as postage and other miscellaneous expenses, we were  unable to isolate the specific portion related to telephone services. To  judge whether the administrative expenses of FRTIB are the result of  practices consistent with federal regulations, we identified the regulations  that guide FRTIB\u2019s expenses for activities, such as acquisition, and  reviewed the Department of Labor\u2019s audits of FRTIB. To analyze FRTIB\u2019s  current benchmarking practices, we reviewed a benchmarking study cited  by FRTIB, notes from board meetings, and our relevant related work. We  conducted our work in Washington, D.C. between October 2006 and May  2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Membership is open to  federal and postal employees, members of Congress and their staff,  members of the uniformed services, and members of the judicial branch.  Participants are eligible for deferred federal (and in certain cases, state)  income taxes on employee contributions and earnings. For employees  covered by FERS, agencies make contributions to employees\u2019 TSP  accounts. Agencies automatically contribute 1 percent of an employee\u2019s  salary during each pay period to the TSP. Agency contributions for any  employee who remains employed by the federal government until \u201cvested\u201d  become part of that employee\u2019s retirement savings. Some employees are  vested after 2 years of service; all other employees are vested at the end of  3 years of service. Agencies also match FERS employee contributions to  the TSP up to a total of 5 percent of the employee\u2019s basic pay. As of  November 2006, FRTIB managed about $200 billion in assets for 3.5  million participants and beneficiaries.", "FRTIB\u2014which administers the TSP\u2014is an independent agency in the  executive branch. As of the close of fiscal year 2006, FRTIB employed  about 65 people. Some functions\u2014such as enrollment and training of  participants\u2014are handled by other federal agencies rather than FRTIB.  These other agencies\u2019 payroll and personnel offices act as the points of  contact for TSP participants; these offices may assist with enrollment and  alteration of contribution percentages. Additionally, the Office of  Personnel Management has established a training program for retirement  counselors of federal agencies. FRTIB is overseen by five Presidentially  appointed board members and is charged with establishing policies for the  investment and management of TSP funds and with creating  administrative policies for the TSP.", "FRTIB\u2019s administrative expenses are funded by (1) forfeited agency  contributions and (2) assessments against net earnings of the Thrift  Savings Fund. The 1 percent automatic agency contribution for FERS  employees who leave before vesting are forfeited to the TSP. To finance  the remainder of the FRTIB\u2019s administrative expenses, FRTIB assesses  fees against the net earnings of the Thrift Savings Fund. FRTIB is required  by law to use the forfeited funds before assessing fees against the net  earnings of the Thrift Savings Fund. In both 2004 and 2005 these forfeited  agency contributions covered about 13 to15 percent of administrative  expenses; assessments against net earnings of the Thrift Savings Fund  were set at a level to cover the remaining 85 to 87 percent.", "Outside contractors manage all investment funds other than the G fund.  FRTIB has contracted with Barclays Global Investors (Barclays) to  manage the F, C, S, and I funds. The L funds\u2014which were introduced in  August 2005\u2014were designed by another private company, Mercer  Investment Consulting. Consistent with generally accepted accounting  principles, FRTIB\u2019s financial statements list these investment expenses as  adjustments to investment income; they are not included in the line item  for administrative expenses.", "The cost to participate in a retirement fund is measured as an expense  ratio of the total administrative expenses charged to a fund during a  specific time period, divided by that fund\u2019s average balance for that  specific time period. According to a 2005/2006 Deloitte Consulting 401(k)  benchmarking survey, the average expense ratio for 401(k) plans was 75  basis points. In comparison, FRTIB charged participants only 4 basis  points in fiscal year 2006.", "According to FRTIB, it reviews its administrative expenses regularly  through a variety of means. First, an independent entity audits  administrative expenses as part of a larger financial audit of FRTIB.  Second, the Department of Labor examines administrative expenses as  part of its periodic FRTIB Administrative Staff review, which it conducts  approximately once every 3 years. Third, as required by statute, board  members prepare and submit to the President and Congress an annual  budget. Fourth, each month since 2003, FRTIB has provided monthly  reports to the Executive Director for review. Lastly, according to FRTIB, it  contracts for all major TSP administrative services.

Until 2005 these were purchased primarily from government agencies\u201499  percent of which were record-keeping and call center services provided by  the National Finance Center. During fiscal years 2005 and 2006 the  National Finance Center terminated its contracts with FRTIB, which began  purchasing these services from a private contractor.

For travel, FRTIB is  bound by federal travel regulations. However, this is one place where  opportunities may exist to reduce travel expenses by holding monthly  board member meetings by teleconference where appropriate. FRTIB  leases its own space directly rather than going through GSA.

As figure 3 shows, from fiscal year 2000 through  fiscal year 2004 FRTIB spent more money purchasing services from other  government agencies than from private contractors. In shifting the  acquisition of call center services from the National Finance Center to a  private contractor in 2005, the balance was reversed. In 2006, the National  Finance Center terminated all remaining services that it was providing to  FRTIB. With the termination of the National Finance Center contracts, the  only remaining major services purchased from another government  agency were payroll and personnel services provided by the U.S.  Department of the Interior.", "Another change within FRTIB\u2019s expenses for services purchased from  private contractors occurred in 2001. In 2001, FRTIB terminated a contract  with American Management Systems, Inc., a private sector firm hired to  design, develop, and implement a record-keeping system for the TSP that  would provide daily investment updates. FRTIB then hired Materials,  Communication & Computers, Inc. to complete the work that American  Management Systems was unable to complete.", "Although we did not review the reasonableness of FRTIB\u2019s individual  contracts, we reviewed its process for acquiring goods and services.  Overall, it follows a process that seeks to assure reasonable expenses.  First, FRTIB is subject to the FAR\u2014which governs acquisition activities.  Second, FRTIB has one contract specialist and one purchasing agent on  staff to ensure that acquisition occurs according to statute and regulation.  Additionally, other staff are responsible for management and oversight of  the individual contracts. For example, the agency\u2019s Chief Information  Officer is responsible for managing a record-keeping contract and the  Director of the Office of Participant Services is responsible for managing  the two call center contracts. Each of these individuals monitors contracts  through site visits and remotely. FRTIB plans to send agency directors for  additional monitoring site visits in 2007. The travel expenses for these  monitoring visits are included under travel and discussed later in this  report.", "The Department of Labor provides additional oversight of FRTIB\u2019s  contracts through its periodic audits. In 2005, the Department of Labor  reported that FRTIB had reexamined service providers to find ways to  increase services while decreasing costs. For example, FRTIB found that it  could cut expenses in half by transferring information technology  operations from the National Finance Center to SI International, a private  contractor. The Department of Labor reviewed one call center in August  2006 and, according to FRTIB, the department is also planning to review  another call center service contract in 2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Miscellaneous Expensess", "paragraphs": ["In the years since 2003, a variety of factors have led to increased  miscellaneous expenses. (See fig. 5 below.)", "In fiscal year 2004, miscellaneous expenses jumped to about $14 million, in  part because FRTIB updated aging software and hardware. Second, in  fiscal year 2005 FRTIB\u2019s printing expenses increased from about $1 million  to about $11 million. FRTIB told us that this was a one-time extra expense  to print information about a series of new TSP funds, the Lifecycle (L)  funds. Lastly, in fiscal year 2006, FRTIB projected a ninefold increase from  about $1 million to about $9 million in expenses for communications. This  was to pay for providing information to TSP plan participants about new  passwords and account numbers to replace the use of Social Security  numbers in the system. FRTIB also said that this spike would permit  increased communications about the L funds. Although overall  miscellaneous expenses began to decrease in 2006, it is unclear if  expenses will continue to decrease or remain elevated.", "Although we did not review FRTIB\u2019s individual contracts, it is required to  follow the same regulations as other federal agencies regarding  acquisition. As discussed above, FRTIB is required to follow the FAR and  is routinely audited by the Department of Labor. Also, FRTIB has the  ability to purchase goods through GSA.

The Executive Director is  compensated according to level three of the Executive Schedule.  Additionally, 7 staff members are part of the Senior Executive Service.  These Senior Executive Service positions are all approved by the Office of  Personnel Management. Each of the 5 board members\u2014who are not  otherwise officers or employees of the federal government\u2014are  compensated at the daily rate of basic pay for level IV of the Executive  Schedule for each day the board member is engaged in performing a  function for FRTIB."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rent", "paragraphs": ["FRTIB\u2019s total rent expenses remained relatively constant until fiscal year  2005.

FRTIB rents its own office space,  which means it does not need to go through GSA. However, GSA rents  space on behalf of many federal agencies and thus has a rich database of  local rent prices. Accordingly, we compared the amount that FRTIB pays  per square foot in fiscal year 2007 with the average rates that GSA cited for  nearby available properties. At $28 per square foot in 2007, the per square  foot rental rate\u2014which includes operating expenses such as utilities,  building security, maintenance, and cleaning\u2014is in line with average  market rates for nearby available properties with comparable square  footage.", "Currently, FRTIB rents more than 47,000 square feet. At its present staff  size, FRTIB rents more space per person than GSA would recommend.  Based on FRTIB\u2019s mission, a GSA official told us that FRTIB\u2019s space needs  are likely similar to a model that proposes 368 rentable square feet per  person. At its current staffing level of 65 employees, FRTIB\u2019s headquarters  provides more than 670 square feet per person, about 300 square feet more  per person than GSA would recommend. This calculation, however, is  somewhat misleading because of the recent personnel downsizing at  FRTIB. In the 7 years covered by our review, employment at FRTIB  peaked at 111 staff members. Yet, even at its peak staffing, FRTIB rented  about 430 square feet per person, about 60 square feet more per person  than GSA would recommend. In light of recent declines in staff numbers,  and consistent with good management practices, at a September 2006  board meeting FRTIB staff indicated that they would look into  consolidating space at the headquarters location."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 7 fiscal years, travel expenses varied considerably, ranging  in current year dollars from a low of about $80,000 in fiscal year 2001 to a  high of about $255,000 in fiscal year 2003.

Although about 20 percent of FRTIB\u2019s trips  were to other federal agencies to conduct training and make  presentations, since the host agency often paid for these trips, they  accounted for only about 5 percent of travel expenses.", "In fiscal year 2006, FRTIB spent about $27,000 to bring board members to  Washington, D.C. These expenses are associated with travel from  locations as disparate as Alaska and New York, and require, in general, a 2- night stay in Washington, D.C. Although FRTIB reports that it has not  issued any first or business class tickets to any employee, it has on  occasion issued a first or business class ticket to a board member traveling  from Alaska when coach fares were not available. Although the law  requires monthly meetings, and the practice has generally been to meet in  person, on occasion members of the board have participated in these  meetings by telephone\u2014some more than others.

The use of telecommunications has increased throughout both  government and the private sector.

Nor does our report suggest that the competitive bidding process  be abandoned\u2014we concur that it helps assure good performance at  competitive costs. Nor do we dispute that FRTIB\u2019s processes have led to  outstanding performance for TSP participants at competitive costs.

We also reviewed GAO guidance for  assessing the acquisition function at federal agencies. To compare the  rent that FRTIB pays for its headquarters office with the amount that other  federal agencies would pay for downtown office spaces we reviewed  FRTIB\u2019s current lease. We then compared the parameters of the lease with  a database of properties from the General Services Administration (GSA).  Because GSA rents office space for other agencies, it has access to a rich  database of available properties and current rents. To review the  compensation of FRTIB staff members, we analyzed the Office of  Personnel and Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data File, a file of all  personnel actions in the federal government. This allowed us to identify  the pay plans that FRTIB uses to compensate employees, the positions  held by FRTIB staff, as well as actual staffing levels for the time period  covered by our analysis. To analyze travel expenses, we compared the  travel records that FRTIB gave to us for fiscal year 2006 to expected travel  expenses for locations given standard per diem rates and negotiated air  fares. We also reviewed FRTIB\u2019s responses to questions we submitted.", "To analyze FRTIB\u2019s current benchmarking practices, we reviewed a  benchmarking study cited by FRTIB, notes from the board members\u2019  meetings, relevant GAO work, and FRTIB responses to questions we  submitted.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., between October 2006 and  May 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  Our report states that FRTIB leases its own space directly rather than  going through GSA\u2014we did not indicate nor imply that FRTIB is  required to use GSA for leasing services.  2.  Our report acknowledges that in-person meetings are valuable and  may be important for some discussions. However, consistent with  FRTIB\u2019s commitment to managing the TSP in the interest of  participants and beneficiaries of TSP, we note that use of  telecommunications offers opportunities to further reduce expenses.  Our recommendation states merely that FRTIB should consider  expanding its use of telecommunications as appropriate.  3.  The FRTIB\u2019s comments on our benchmarking recommendation reflect  a misunderstanding of our point. Our report notes that benchmarking  should go beyond a comparison of TSP\u2019s investment fees (cost to  participants) with those of other 401(k) plans. It does not suggest that  benchmarking would lead to changes in contracts during the contract  period. Nor does our report suggest that the competitive bidding  process be abandoned\u2014we concur that it helps assure good  performance at competitive costs. Further, we do not dispute that the  FRTIB\u2019s processes have led to outstanding performance for TSP  participants at competitive costs. Nor should the mention of call  centers as one example of an activity in which other agencies also  engage be read as a criticism of FRTIB\u2019s call center operations. To the  contrary, companies and agencies that are viewed as leaders in their  operations use benchmarking.", "Benchmarking is widely accepted in the private sector and in much of  the public sector as a \u201cbest practice\u201d in evaluating performance of  specific activities. It offers a way to compare a specific function or  activity to the same or similar one in other businesses or agencies. The  essence of benchmarking is the process of identifying the highest  standards of excellence for products, services, or processes, and then  making the improvement necessary to reach those standards\u2014 commonly known as best practices. We have developed a body of  work\u2014best practice reviews\u2014that provides guidance to help public  sector organizations become world-class.", "Such benchmarking of best practices could be helpful to FRTIB. For  example, as the term of a contract for call center operations nears  completion and the FRTIB considers the design of the successor  contract, it could look at the scope or services, performance measures  used and performance attained, and costs of other excellent call  centers in developing the criteria for that next contract.  4.  Our report states that looking only at investment fees offers an  incomplete picture of administrative expenses and that looking at total  administrative expenses in the aggregate provides incomplete  information for judging whether individual activities are being  conducted in the most efficient matter. We did not discuss or opine on  FRTIB\u2019s disclosure of administrative expenses.  5.  Our report notes that benchmarking should go beyond a comparison of  TSP\u2019s investment fees (cost to participants) with those of other 401(k)  plans. It does not suggest that it is FRTIB\u2019s responsibility to ensure  that private sector 401(k) plans adopt similar levels of public  disclosure.  6.  See comment 3.  7.  We agree that telephone services for the call centers are mission- related services. However, because budget data provided by the FRTIB  aggregates such expenses with charges such as postage and other  miscellaneous expenses, we were unable to separate these expenses  from others in this category. Nonetheless, we have clarified the report  to indicate that expenses associated with telephone service for call  centers, although mission-related, were included under miscellaneous  expenses.  8.  We revised the report text as suggested.  9.  We revised the report text as suggested.  10. We revised the report text as suggested.  11. We disagree with FRTIB\u2019s comment that it is not subject to the federal  procurement rules. First, FRTIB is an executive agency under 41 U.S.C.  \u00a7 405(a) and thus subject to the FAR. Moreover, we are unaware of  any, and FRTIB has not identified any, express exclusion for FRTIB.  Second, FRTIB cites as support a 1987 internal memo that states \u201cOne  of the most important criteria applied by the courts and agencies, in  determining the applicability of acquisition regulations is the source of  funds being expended.\u201d The memo concludes that FRTIB does not pay  its administrative expenses with appropriated funds. In a 2002 contract  dispute with one of its contractors, the United States Court of Federal  Claims rejected each one of FRTIB\u2019s arguments that its administrative  expenses are not payable out of appropriated funds. Since the FAR  applies to acquisitions by contract with appropriated funds, and the  FRTIB has not addressed the court\u2019s ruling, we stand by the position  that FRTIB is subject to the FAR.  12.
