BLS has projected that 8.2 percent of existing water operators will need to be replaced annually between 2016 and 2026. Although BLS projections are intended to capture long-run trends, rather than to forecast precise outcomes in specific years, this predicted replacement rate is roughly similar to the predicted rate of 10.9 percent for all workers across the U.S. economy. Limited information is available to determine whether retirements, or other workforce needs, are affecting drinking water and wastewater utilities' ability to comply with the Safe Drinking Water and Clean Water acts. At a national level, neither the water utilities' industry associations nor the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has analyzed whether there is a relationship between unmet workforce needs and compliance problems. EPA relies on states to inspect utilities to ensure compliance with the acts. EPA's inspection guidance documents, for both drinking water and wastewater, advise states to examine the quality and quantity of staff operating and maintaining water utilities. However, the guidance does not advise states to examine future workforce needs. GAO has found that future workforce needs can be identified through strategic workforce planning, which involves developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve program goals. By adding questions to EPA's inspection guidance on strategic workforce planning, such as the number of positions needed in the future, EPA could help make this information available for states to assess future workforce needs. Information on future workforce needs could help states and utilities identity potential workforce issues and take action as needed.", "Representatives from 11 selected water utilities reported that by using various approaches, they were generally able to meet their current workforce needs but faced some challenges in doing so. Representatives from the selected utilities said that they recruit operators using word of mouth, websites, newspapers, and partnering with local technical schools. However, representatives from small utilities said that even with these approaches, they had difficulty hiring certified operators and instead hired and trained entry-level employees. Additionally, representatives from large utilities said they face difficulties in recruiting skilled workers, such as electricians and mechanics, part of a larger national pattern.", "Five federal agencies that GAO reviewed\u2014EPA and the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Labor (DOL), Education, and Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014have programs or activities that can assist utilities with their workforce needs in several ways, including through guidance, funding, and training. EPA has worked with DOL and industry groups to develop a water-sector competency model to support industry training and with VA to help place disabled veterans in water industry jobs. In addition, USDA funds personnel who travel to rural utilities to provide hands-on assistance through its Circuit Rider program. Four of five small utilities GAO interviewed said they used this program and other USDA technical assistance for training operators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that EPA add strategic workforce planning questions, such as the positions and skills needed in the future, to its inspection guidance documents.

EPA regulates  drinking water and wastewater quality through the implementation of the  Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, respectively, and both  acts authorize EPA and the states to provide technical assistance to  water utilities, which can be used to increase the technical knowledge and  abilities of water operators. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  provides technical assistance to rural utilities through its Rural Utilities  Service Water and Environmental Programs. Other federal agencies,  including the Departments of Education, Labor (DOL), and Veterans  Affairs (VA), have programs that offer support to employers and workers  in a number of industries, and those programs are available to water  utilities.

We included both large and small utilities in our selection based  on our initial interviews with industry representatives that suggested that  large utilities and small utilities have experienced different challenges. We  asked officials of the selected utilities whether workforce challenges had  affected their abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the  Clean Water Act at their utilities and whether they anticipated effects on  utility operations in the future. The information from those interviews is not  generalizable to the national population of water utilities; it is intended to  provide illustrative examples of difficulties selected water utilities have  experienced in complying with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean  Water Act that they attributed to workforce challenges. We also obtained  EPA data on compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean  Water Act for the selected utilities. We have previously reviewed the  quality of EPA compliance data.

We identified five federal agencies that  conduct activities or provide funding related to the water utility workforce:  EPA, USDA, Education, DOL, and VA. We interviewed officials with these  agencies about current or past federal programs and policies related to  water utilities\u2019 workforce needs. We did not attempt to identify all  programs that can provide assistance to water utilities for workforce  planning or recruitment, but we determined based on interviews at the  five agencies that we had identified the programs for which providing  such assistance was a primary purpose or likely use. Additionally, we  interviewed representatives from the selected utilities we contacted to  determine whether and how they had used various federal programs or  assistance to augment other planning and recruitment strategies and  what problems, if any, they had in using the programs.

For example, drinking water service may be  provided by one utility, and wastewater service may be provided by a  separate utility, or a single utility may provide both services. Regardless  of the configuration, a utility can be owned and managed by a  municipality, county, independent district or authority, private company, or  not-for-profit water association, among others. Utilities may serve a city  and neighboring area, a county, or multiple counties. As of January 2016,  there were about 52,000 drinking water and 16,000 wastewater utilities in  the United States. These water utilities vary widely in the number of  people they serve, but the majority of water utilities in the United States  serve fewer than 10,000 people.", "Water utilities employ a broad range of workers, including water  operators; engineers; customer service representatives; accountants;  legal support; and skilled technical occupations, such as electricians,  machinists, and instrument technicians.

A study commissioned by the American Water Works  Association estimated that 55 percent of water utility employees are water  operators; of the remainder, 20 percent work in customer service and  metering, and 25 percent work in administration of various kinds. The  number of water operators at individual water utilities depends partly on  the size of the population the utility serves. Large utilities may have  dozens of water operators supported by a staff of customer service  representatives, electricians, instrument technicians, machinists, and  plumbers. In contrast, utilities in rural communities may have a single  water operator who is sometimes tasked with additional duties.", "Water operators at drinking water utilities run the equipment, control the  processes, and monitor the plants that treat water to make it safe to drink.  Water operators at wastewater utilities do similar work to remove  pollutants from domestic and industrial wastewater before it is reused or  released into a receiving body of water. Many duties of water operators  are technical and water operators need knowledge, skills, and abilities in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The list of  academic competencies described in the DOL Water and Wastewater  Competency Model for employment in the drinking water and wastewater  industry includes calculating averages, ratios, proportions, and rates;  translating practical problems into useful mathematical expressions; and  understanding biology, chemistry, and physics. Water operators need to  be able to prepare chemicals and confirm chemical strength, adjust  chemical feed rates and flows, and understand software and equipment  used for industrial process control, such as supervisory control and data  acquisition software and systems.

Industry representatives  we interviewed told us that as drinking and wastewater treatment  processes become more technologically advanced, water operators  increasingly will need to have more advanced technical skills.", "Water operators must meet specialized certification requirements, which  are overseen by state regulators. A number of 2-year and 4-year colleges  offer programs across the country that provide training for individuals  seeking certification as water operators. For drinking water operators,  regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act establish minimum  standards for certifications. Each state must implement a water operator  certification program that meets the requirements of these guidelines or  that is substantially equivalent to these guidelines. The Clean Water Act  does not have similar minimum requirements for wastewater operators,  and certification standards are established by the states.

These inspections support  EPA\u2019s monitoring of compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and  Clean Water Act. EPA provides states with guidance for evaluating the  utilities. Inspections of drinking water utilities include eight areas of  review: water sources, treatment plants, distributions systems, finished  water storage, pumping facilities, monitoring plans and treatment records,  management and operations, and water operator compliance with  certification requirements. The inspections also function as an opportunity  for state agencies to educate drinking water operators about proper  monitoring and sampling procedures and to provide technical assistance.  The goal of the inspections is to ensure that the utility can supply safe  drinking water.

EPA requires states to report some inspection information, including  whether there are management issues at a utility. EPA officials told us that, on the basis of their conversations with state regulators, they believe  states are collecting information about workforce adequacy during state  inspections of drinking water utilities. For wastewater utilities, EPA  officials stated that in the course of conducting an on-site inspection,  inspectors will ask plant managers and staff questions about staffing and  should note concerns in their inspection reports. EPA officials said that  collecting workforce information at the state level is beneficial for the  states and the drinking water utilities so that they can take steps to  implement strategies to address the utilities\u2019 workforce needs. The  officials said state regulators can find patterns in utilities\u2019 compliance  reporting data that alert them to the likelihood that a utility is experiencing  operational issues, such as losing a certified water operator. In those  instances, an EPA official told us, state regulators work with the utility to  help identify solutions, such as locating a nearby water operator who can  contract with the utility on a part-time basis until it can hire a permanent  water operator. EPA officials further stated that they believe state  regulators are using the workforce information to help build capacity at  drinking water utilities and prioritize training.", "However, the EPA inspection guidance that states currently use in  conducting sanitary surveys for drinking water utilities and compliance  inspections of wastewater utilities outlines criteria for evaluating existing  workforce issues but does not address workforce issues that could affect  utility operations, and potentially compliance, in the future. The guidance  contains suggested assessment criteria that focus on whether there is an  adequate number of qualified staff in the existing workforce to perform the  work required. For example, the guidance for drinking water utilities states  that the utility should have enough personnel to enable continuous  operation of the treatment plant at all times and that staff should be able  to perform operations and maintenance tasks regularly with little or no  overtime hours. The inspection guidance does not contain similar  questions that focus on whether there will be an adequate number of  qualified staff in the future workforce to perform the work required.

The representatives of large  utilities reported that they used some of the approaches to varying  degrees, but none of these representatives reported using all of them.  The two most commonly used approaches of the selected large utilities (4  of the 6) were a partnership with one or more local community colleges to  offer water treatment education, followed by reaching out to recruit  veterans (3 of the 6).

The utility that  indicated the problem was decreasing cited two steps it had taken to  address it: expanding its geographical search and improving its internal  training program. Five of the selected large utilities reported that replacing  retiring water operators was currently a problem, and three of them  indicated that it could become one over the next 5 years for reasons such  as water operators having to perform rotating shift work and fewer  qualified candidates than in the past.

For example, EPA\u2019s national Training and Technical Assistance for Small  Systems competitive grant provides, on average, $12 million per year to  give managerial and financial training to utilities, particularly small utilities.  Additionally, officials stated that between 1997 and 2012, EPA provided  $134 million to help utilities train their water operator workforce and  enable their water operators to gain certification through the Operator  Certification Expense Reimbursement Grants program; however, this  program ended in 2012.

For  example, in 2010 EPA partnered with the American Water Works  Association and the Water Environment Federation to highlight the need  for qualified professionals to enter the drinking water and wastewater  industry. As part of those efforts, EPA produced a set of videos called  \u201cWater You Waiting For?\u201d to encourage high school and vocational  technical school students to consider employment in the industry. EPA  officials also told us that based on industry requests, EPA has taken the  lead in coordinating with other federal agencies to help develop a pool of  potential certified water operators. EPA has also collaborated with DOL,  USDA, and VA to assist drinking water and wastewater utilities in meeting  their workforce replacement needs. For example, in 2009, EPA worked  with DOL and industry groups to develop a competency model for the  water sector, which was updated in 2016. The model defines the  necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities for prospective water  professionals and can be used by educational institutions and industries  to encourage prospective job seekers to consider a career in the water  and wastewater industry by helping job seekers develop a career  pathway and associated training and career advancement strategies that  meet industry skill needs.

Among other  things, USDA and EPA agreed to develop strategies for overcoming  challenges specific to recruitment and retention of small utility water  operators and to promote the use of contract water operators to fill  workforce gaps in rural communities. As part of this effort, USDA and  EPA also agreed to focus on the sustainability of rural utilities by  coordinating activities and financial assistance resources to increase the  technical, managerial, and financial capacity of rural drinking water and  wastewater systems nationwide.

In fiscal year  2016, 24 nonprofit organizations received funding totaling about $20  million to provide technical assistance to rural water utilities. In addition,  under the Circuit Rider program, the Rural Utilities Service contracts with  the National Rural Water Association to provide staff in each of the 50  states who offer technical assistance on day-to-day operational,  managerial, and financial issues. Specifically, according to the National  Rural Water Association, staff known as \u201ccircuit riders\u201d work on site with  rural water utility personnel to troubleshoot problems, evaluate alternative  technological solutions, recommend operational improvements, assist  with leak detection, respond to natural disasters and other emergencies,  and provide hands-on training, among other things.

All Occupational Employment Statistics estimates in this report are  presented along with their 95 percent confidence level.", "The Current Population Survey is a monthly survey of households  conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for BLS. It is a sample survey of  60,000 eligible households representing the civilian noninstitutional  population ages 16 and older in the 50 states and the District of  Columbia. The basic monthly survey gathers demographic characteristics  of people in each sampled household and information to determine  whether they are employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. The  survey collects information on workers\u2019 occupations and ages. The  Current Population Survey estimates presented in this report are subject  to sampling error. To account for this error, we present all Current  Population Survey estimates in this report along with their 95 percent  confidence intervals. Data that would allow us to calculate true sampling  errors were not specifically provided by the Current Population Survey.  Instead, we followed Current Population Survey guidance to estimate  sampling errors. We used generalized variance functions, parameters,  and factors published by the Current Population Survey to calculate  approximate standard errors and confidence intervals. As a result, the  confidence intervals presented in this report provide a general order of  magnitude and are approximations of the true sampling errors.", "To assess the reliability of BLS projections, we reviewed relevant  documentation and information from BLS staff for the most recent  projections available and reviewed the BLS employment projections in the  Occupational Outlook Handbook. The Handbook includes employment  projections developed by BLS\u2019 Employment Projections program; BLS  develops its projections from statistical and econometric models,  combined with subjective analysis, and designs these projections to  provide a focused analysis of long-term trends based on a set of  assumptions. The models and analyses BLS uses to develop the  projections assume historical relationships and behavior will continue to  hold over the projection period; however, there is inherent uncertainty  about whether historical trends will continue into the future. BLS  employment projections rely on assumptions about demographics, fiscal  policy (including tax policies and government spending), and  macroeconomic conditions over the 10-year projection period. For  example, the BLS projections assume that the economy will be at full  employment in the last year of the period (e.g., 2026). BLS notes,  however, that fluctuations in the business cycle are not foreseeable over  a decade. Therefore, BLS employment projections should be considered  as likely outcomes, but subject to the accuracy of the underlying  assumptions. We determined that the BLS survey and projection data  were sufficiently reliable for purposes of our objective.", "To determine what data and information were available on workforce  needs from industry, we reviewed reports and interviewed officials from  industry associations, including the American Water Works Association,  the Water Environment Federation, the National Rural Water Association,  the Rural Community Assistance Partnership, the National Association of  Clean Water Agencies, and the National Association of Water  Companies. We identified a number of relevant industry studies, including  three surveys published by the American Water Works Association  between 2015 and 2017: the 2016 State of the Water Industry Report,  Benchmarking Performance Indicators Water and Wastewater: 2015  Survey Data and Analyses Report, and Benchmarking Performance  Indicators Water and Wastewater: 2013 Survey Data and Analyses  Report. To assess the reliability of the industry studies, we reviewed their  scope and methodology. We determined that although the industry  estimates were not generalizable, the studies were sufficiently reliable for  illustrating industry perspectives on workforce planning.", "To review the effects of potential unmet workforce needs on water  utilities\u2019 abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean  Water Act, we selected a sample of 11 water utilities\u20146 large and 5  small\u2014based on geography, size, and indications of hiring challenges in  the past. We included both large and small utilities in our selection based  on our initial interviews with industry representatives that suggested that  large utilities and small utilities experienced different challenges.", "To select the large utilities, we compiled a list of cities that were  mentioned in interviews and other communications with industry groups,  and in EPA documents, as experiencing difficulty replacing retiring  workers or having put in place programs to train and recruit new workers.  We then divided the list of cities geographically among the four Census  regions\u2014West, Midwest, Northeast, and South\u2014and tallied the number  of times each city was mentioned. In the West and South regions, we  selected the city with the greatest number of mentions. In the Midwest  and Northeast regions, each of the cities had only one mention, so we  selected the largest city within each region. For each of these four cities  we then identified the drinking water and wastewater utilities for the city.  One of the cities had separate drinking water and wastewater utilities,  while the other three cities had one utility that provided both drinking  water and wastewater services. We also included the water utility for a  fifth city because early in our research we conducted a site visit to that  city and conducted an interview with the local water utility.", "To select the small utilities, we reached out to the National Rural Water  Association and the Rural Community Assistance Partnership for  suggestions on utilities to interview. The National Rural Water Association  provided us with a list of 10 small water and wastewater utilities from 6  states. We divided the list of cities among the four Census regions. In the  West region, one utility was recommended. For the Midwest, Northeast,  and South regions, we selected utilities from cities with populations less  than 10,000. In the South region, we selected a second city in order to  bring the total number of small utilities up to five. One of the small utilities  that we contacted was not able to participate in an interview with us but  instead referred us to a nearby utility. That utility served a population less  than 30,000, which for the purposes of this report we included in the  category of small water utilities. Table 2 shows the locations and sizes of  the 11 utilities we interviewed.", "We asked officials of the selected utilities whether workforce challenges  had affected their abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and  the Clean Water Act at their utilities or whether they anticipated such  effects in the future. The information from those interviews is not  generalizable to the national population of water utilities; it was intended  to provide illustrative examples of any difficulties water utilities were  experiencing in complying with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean  Water Act that they attributed to workforce challenges. We also obtained  EPA data on compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean  Water Act for the selected utilities. We have previously reviewed the  quality of EPA compliance data for the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Specifically, we have interviewed EPA officials and reviewed EPA data  reliability assessments, a 2017 OIG report on the reliability of data in  EPA\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS), data verification  reports, and our past reports on the reliability of the data in SDWIS.  According to these recent EPA assessments, the EPA OIG report, and  our January 2006 and June 2011 reports, some of the data in SDWIS  are not complete. We also interviewed an EPA official and reviewed  documentation on compliance data for the Clean Water Act. We  determined that although the data are incomplete, they were useful to  provide a rough indication of whether selected water utilities had any Safe  Drinking Water Act or Clean Water Act compliance violations over the  past 10 years (between 2007 and 2016).", "To describe the approaches that selected water utilities have used to  manage their workforce needs and the challenges they have faced in  managing those needs over the past 5 years (from 2012 through 2016),  we spoke with utility officials, during the interviews described above, to  learn about their hiring and retirement numbers, challenges in managing  workforce needs, and approaches for hiring staff. The information from  those interviews is not generalizable to the national population of water  utilities; it was intended to provide illustrative examples of any difficulties  water utilities were experiencing in complying with the Safe Drinking  Water Act and the Clean Water Act that they attributed to workforce  challenges.", "To describe how key federal programs can assist water utilities with their  workforce needs, we conducted background research and initial  interviews with federal officials. We identified five federal agencies that  conduct activities or provide funding related to the water utility workforce:  EPA, USDA, Education, DOL, and VA. We interviewed officials with these  agencies about current or past federal programs and policies related to  water utilities\u2019 workforce needs. We did not attempt to identify all  programs that can provide assistance to water utilities for workforce  planning or recruitment, but we determined based on interviews at the  five federal agencies that we had identified the programs for which these  activities were a primary purpose or likely use. Additionally, we  interviewed representatives from the selected utilities we contacted to  determine whether and how they had used various federal programs or  assistance to augment other planning and recruitment strategies and  what problems, if any, they had in using the programs. The information  from those interviews is not generalizable to the national population of  water utilities but provides illustrative examples of how, if at all, water  utilities are using federal programs to help with workforce planning and  recruitment.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to January  2018, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
