As a result, soils were saturated, and many streams were flowing well above normal levels when summer rains began.", "A persistent atmospheric pattern during the summer of 1993 caused excessive rainfall across much of the upper Mississippi River basin. Major flooding resulted primarily from a series of heavy rainfalls from mid-June through late July.

For example, the Kaskaskia Island levee in the Mississippi River in Illinois, which is designed to withstand a flood with an average frequency (or recurrence interval) of 50 years, was built to withstand a water level of 45.7 feet and a flow of 1,010,000 cfs. At other locations, floods of the same frequency will be associated with different heights and flows. For example, the Des Moines-Mississippi River levee in Missouri, which also protects against a flood with an average recurrence interval of 50 years, was built to withstand a water level of 24 feet and a flow of 371,000 cfs. Both levees provide the same degree, or level, of protection but have different performance criteria because the river\u2019s channel and flows differ greatly at these levees.", "Engineers have accounted for uncertainties in the water level and for unknown factors\u2014such as wave action, bridge openings, and the effects of urbanization\u2014by adding 1 to 3 feet to the overall elevation of a levee\u2019s design; this addition is known as freeboard. A levee should withstand floods up to and including the flood for which it was designed. Floods larger than the design flood may overtop or breach the levee\u2014that is, cut a hole through it. The ways that floods can damage levees\u2014by overtopping, piping, saturation, and underseepage\u2014are depicted in figure 1.6.", "Hydrologists have several ways of describing the size of a flood at a specific location. They may refer to the water\u2019s level and flow, or they may refer to the average interval between occurrences of that particular water level and flow. They also refer to the annual probability that the same water level and flow may occur. Because floods occur randomly, the interval between extreme water levels of the same height are far from uniform\u2014a large flood in one year does not preclude the occurrence of an even larger flood the next year. For example, a flood with an average recurrence interval of 100 years has a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded every year. This means that a \u201c100-year\u201d flood may occur several times within a 100-year period, or it may not occur at all.", "As communities and farms have grown on the floodplains of the upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers since the early to mid-1800s, levees have been constructed by various nonfederal entities, ranging from cities to individuals, to protect floodplains from seasonal flooding. Owners have wanted to protect the floodplain from flooding because it has often contained the most fertile land for farming. While no inventory of nonfederal levees exists, the Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee estimated that such levees extend over 5,800 miles in the upper Mississippi River basin.", "The Corps estimated that about 1,100 of the 1,358 nonfederal levees in the area covered by the five Corps districts involved in the 1993 flood failed to keep the flood out of the areas they were designed to protect or were otherwise damaged. Corps officials told us, however, that this estimate was approximate and incomplete.", "Corps and nonfederal levees protect nearly all of the floodplain in the upper Mississippi River basin.

However, according to Corps district officials, the time required to reach a levee\u2019s maximum saturation point varies by flood. A Corps manual (No. 1110-2-1913, Mar. 31, 1978) provides that levees are expected to be exposed to flood flows for only a few days or weeks per year. Embankments that will be exposed to flows for longer periods must meet more stringent criteria for earthen dams.", "Water standing against a levee for an extended period may move through or under the levee, leading to problems such as sinkholes or sandboilson the landward side.

In these cases, a levee exceeded its design capacity in three ways. First, the added height permitted the levee to continue holding back the flood even when the water rose above the top of the levee. Second, the base of the levee withstood the additional water pressure created by extending the height. Third, because flood-fighting prevented or delayed overtopping, the levee withstood saturation far longer than anticipated.", "Flood-fighting techniques effectively increased the design capacity of many levees.

To calculate the damage prevented, the Corps uses damage curves that employ the principles of hydrology and economics to graphically depict the estimated costs of the damage that would occur if a Corps levee were not protecting the area. Economists compare curves depicting the estimated damage with and without a levee. The difference is the estimated value of the damage prevented by the project.", "Corps staff said that the severity and duration of the 1993 flood in the St. Louis district were so great that the existing damage curves could not be used to estimate the damage accurately. As a result, Corps personnel extrapolated damage estimates for the 1993 flood from damage estimates for the large 1973 flood and used their professional judgment.", "Corps staff pointed out that because the dollar values on the damage curves tend to be outdated, the estimates of flood damage derived from these curves are probably understated. They said that some of the dollar values they developed when they constructed the levee have not been updated to reflect the value of development that has since occurred behind the levee. They also mentioned that obtaining information about urban land values requires extensive fieldwork and research, which are labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. Corps officials said that because their resources are limited, they give priority to updating information on the largest urban centers where the greatest threat of damage exists.", "The four Corps districts where levees were overtopped and breached estimated that about $450 million in damage was incurred behind the levees.

FEMA officials said that experience confirms that elevated buildings are less susceptible to flood damage and, therefore, cost less to repair when a flood occurs. When FEMA certifies a levee as protecting against a 100-year flood, it exempts new construction and substantial improvements from the requirement to build above the base flood elevation.
