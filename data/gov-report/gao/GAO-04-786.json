We found that in 2003, 38 states exempted all family child care providers from being regulated, compared with 39 states in 1999. Most states conducted compliance inspections at least once a year, meeting or exceeding the recommended level for all types of providers. Many states organized inspection staff by geography and used technology in many parts of the inspection process. Forty-three states reported assigning staff to geographic locations throughout the state. States also assigned staff based on specific job task and type of child care facility the staff would inspect. Many states used multiple criteria to assign staff. Forty-five states reported using technology to assist them with many aspects of licensing and enforcement functions, such as maintaining statistics on families and providers. States have adopted a number of promising practices to assist their child care licensing and enforcement activities. These practices include the use of technology to streamline licensing and enforcement processes and manage parent and provider information, rating systems to aid parents in selecting the appropriate child care for their child and to offer providers incentives to improve and maintain the quality of their care, and working with other organizations to train providers and parents."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The need for child care has grown dramatically over the past 25 years. In  1975, 39 percent of women with children under the age of 6 were in the  labor force; by 2003 that number had grown to 63 percent. Since 1996,  federal welfare policies have emphasized the importance of work, and  more welfare parents than ever before have moved into the workforce.  The federal government assists the work efforts of parents through the  Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), providing $4.8 billion to states  to help parents pay child care costs and to ensure the health and safety of  children in child care. More than 1.75 million children are enrolled in  subsidized care each month.", "To help protect children in child care, states license certain child care  providers and establish requirements including those focused on health  and safety. All states set licensing requirements and require some child  care providers to obtain a license to offer care. However, as allowed, most  states do not license all types of providers in all child care settings. Both  licensed and nonlicensed providers are eligible to receive funds from  CCDF, and the federal government requires states to have plans in place to  ensure that providers being paid with federal child care funds comply with  the applicable health and safety requirements established by the states.  Many of the health and safety requirements states establish are based on  practices, including inspections, recommended by national organizations.", "To ensure compliance with states\u2019 licensing requirements, states oversee  those child care providers over which they have authority by engaging in  various enforcement activities. The most intense enforcement activities  occur for licensed providers, the most highly regulated status for  providers. Licensed providers are typically subject to background checks  and facilities inspection, provided with technical assistance and training,  and are subject to sanctions\u2014such as fines and revocation of licenses\u2014 for those who do not meet licensing standards. Licensed providers who  receive subsidies have the most stringent requirements. For nonlicensed  providers, states\u2019 laws and policies dictate the extent to which states  engage in such enforcement activities. Consequently, some nonlicensed  providers receive less intense oversight than do licensed providers, but are  still subject to regulation (we will call these regulated nonlicensed  providers). Still other providers are exempt from state regulation because  of state law. For example, in certain states child care centers run by  religious organizations are exempt from regulation. Exempt providers who  receive federal child care funds must comply with state health and safety  requirements. Parents can choose among a number of different child care  settings. Some parents may choose to send their child to a child care  center, where many children are cared for in a nonresidential setting.  Other parents may choose a \u201cfamily\u201d care setting, in which one provider  cares for a number of children within the provider\u2019s home.", "Because of the significant federal role in paying for child care services,  some members of Congress raised concerns about the way in which states  ensure the safety and health of children in child care settings. In 1999, we  surveyed states to identify the most critical licensing and enforcement  activities. We were asked to update our 1999 study, and in this report we  (1) identify any changes in states\u2019 licensing and enforcement activities for  various types of licensed and nonlicensed providers since 1999,   (2) describe the ways child care licensing agencies organize inspection  staff and use technology, and (3) provide examples of promising practices  in state child care licensing and enforcement activities.", "To address these issues, we conducted a mail survey in 2004, to state  licensing officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, asking  about their licensing and enforcement policies and practices in 2003.  Specifically, we asked states to report on the frequency of their  compliance inspections, background checks, training programs and  educational requirements for licensing staff, and caseload sizes. We  achieved a response rate of 98 percent, with 49 states and the District of  Columbia responding to our survey. We then compared our survey results  with a mail survey we conducted in 1999 to identify any changes that had  occurred within the past few years. We also used data from the National  Child Care Information Center for the number of states exempting family  child care providers from regulation. In addition, we conducted a  literature search and interviewed child care licensing experts and state  and federal officials to gather information about critical licensing and  enforcement activities occurring within the states. We asked experts to  identify states that had examples of promising practices in automation,  training initiatives, rating systems for providers, and enforcement  practices. We used this information to identify four states\u2014Delaware,  Florida, North Carolina and Oklahoma\u2014in which we conducted site visits.

The Child Care and Development Block Grant statute that underlies the  CCDF requires states to designate a lead agency and to establish state  plans that commit to establishing and enforcing licensing requirements  and health and safety standards for child care providers. The statute leaves  it to the states to decide what requirements are to be applicable to specific  categories of providers, but for health and safety it sets out three broad  parameters that must apply to all providers receiving federal assistance:  physical premises safety, staff training, and control of infectious diseases  (including childhood immunizations).

States can set income eligibility limits at or below 85 percent of the  state median income level. States must use a significant portion of their  CCDF funds for families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families (TANF) or families who are at risk for becoming dependent upon  public assistance. CCDF has five goals: (1) encouraging maximum  flexibility in developing state child care programs; (2) promoting parental  choice; (3) encouraging states to provide consumer education information  to parents; (4) helping states provide child care to parents trying to  become independent of public assistance; and (5) helping states  implement health, safety, licensing, and registration standards established  in state regulations. However, CCDF does not specify how the states  should meet these goals and only requires them to be included as elements  within the state child care plan.

For example, states consider whether certain providers are  subject to other health and safety regulating authorities, such as school- based programs that must conform to all health and safety requirements  required for public schools and are overseen by the state education  department. States also consider the staffing resources they would need to  carry out the necessary licensing and enforcement activities in light of  their budget, how to target resources toward the greatest number of  children, and the impact that licensing activities could have on child care  availability and parental choice. For example, some providers might pass  the costs of conforming with licensing requirements on to parents, which  could make such care too expensive for some parents.

In addition, inspectors in Florida were able to  print a copy of the compliance report for providers while on-site to  facilitate discussions of areas needing improvement. The laptops also  saved inspectors time by allowing them to quickly access provider  information, state child care regulations, noncompliance citations, and  inspection forms. Officials in both Florida and North Carolina said that  using laptop computers had helped inspectors spend less time on  administrative duties and allowed them to spend more time providing on- site technical assistance to providers.

Specifically, Oklahoma reported using an electronic  benefits transfer (EBT) system to automatically calculate payment rates  and to track subsidy use. Because Oklahoma reimburses providers at over  160 different rates depending upon the characteristics of the family and  provider receiving a subsidy, the likelihood of error had been significantly  higher before the system was implemented, when licensing staff were  responsible for identifying the appropriate rate. According to state  officials, this system has saved time processing paperwork. Further, the  EBT system has allowed parents receiving a child care subsidy to  document the time and attendance for their children using an EBT card  issued by the state, and providers are automatically reimbursed at the  appropriate rate.  This automated system has also has also helped  officials identify instances of child care fraud and payment abuse,  according to state officials.", "We found that in the states we visited, only those that had recently  invested in computer systems, such as Florida, had been able to take  advantage of new technologies at an affordable price. In contrast, other  states that had not recently invested in computer systems, such as  Delaware, had been unable to adopt such promising practices.  Specifically, although Delaware had been on the leading edge of using  technology almost a decade ago, it had been unable to maintain this  advantage. One state official said that it is costly to implement and  maintain the technology necessary to support facilities inspection,  particularly when the state\u2019s system is relatively old and needs to be  updated. For example, Delaware\u2019s system was designed in 1995 to help  staff investigate child abuse, but was being used in 2003 to track the  licensing process. According to state officials, the system was difficult to  use for management purposes. To upgrade the system to adopt promising  practices such as entering data while conducting on-site inspections, the  state would need to develop the system and obtain additional equipment,  such as laptop computers. However, officials told us that despite the  increases in the state licensing budget since 1999, the state does not have  the funding to upgrade the system and purchase additional technological  equipment because these funds had been for specific purposes, such as  staffing and infant and toddler programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rating Systems Helped Parents Choose Child Care and Offered Providers Incentives to Improve and Maintain the Quality of Child Care", "paragraphs": ["Florida, North Carolina, and Oklahoma have implemented rating systems  to tie the level of reimbursement to a provider\u2019s quality.

In implementing rating systems, states set standards for different  tiers of quality and assessed providers against these standards. The lowest  tier included those providers who only met the state licensing criteria,  while the highest tiers in Florida and Oklahoma included those providers  who have achieved accreditation by national organizations.

For example, through the star rating systems in  North Carolina and Oklahoma, providers with more stars received a higher  rate of reimbursement than providers with one star. Similarly, in Florida  high-quality providers also receive financial incentives such as a  reimbursement rate for subsidized children that is 20 percent higher than  the market rate, a tax break for high-quality providers whose clientele  does not include subsidized families, and an exemption from sales tax on  educational materials.

Tier III  training is advanced training, formal education through credit-bearing  courses at accredited colleges, universities, and technology centers that  transfer for credit to such schools, leading to the highest levels of the  quality enhancement star system, the career development ladder, and the  Oklahoma director\u2019s credential.", "North Carolina has woven its provider training into its comprehensive  Smart Start program, which is a recognized national model of partnerships  working together to meet the needs of young children. As part of this  program, the education level of staff is one of three areas on which  providers are evaluated when their quality rating is determined. Providers  who meet higher standards for education and experience receive more  stars because, according to state officials, child care teachers with more  early childhood education and experience are prepared to provide  children with a more enriching child care experience. Providers can  improve their star rating by increasing staff education and experience  levels and by employing more teachers with early childhood education  credentials and experience. Providers can pursue such credentials by  completing certificate or higher education programs offered at community  colleges and universities. Such training activities are facilitated and  coordinated by the North Carolina Institute for Early Childhood  Professional Development.", "Delaware First, the career development program for early childhood  professionals that is operated by the Family & Workplace Connection, has  developed Core Curricula\u2014Basic, Advanced, and Specialty\u2014that can be  used to fulfill training requirements and also to pursue a Child  Development Associate degree or college credit.", "Florida and Delaware provided training information and administrative  functions through the Internet. This has saved time for providers,  inspectors, and training organizations by allowing providers to register  online for courses offered at community colleges or other organizations  offering child care training. In addition, providers and inspectors have  been able to access providers\u2019 transcripts online. State officials say that  this program has saved the state time and money, although no studies have  been done to quantify these savings. Other state officials have noted that  using an Internet system has promoted quality in child care by making the  process transparent and easily accessible. In Florida, for example, families  seeking quality child care can see the latest the inspection reports on a  facility because they are immediately posted on the Internet.", "According to child care officials and the National Association for the  Education of Young Children (NAEYC), training opportunities are  maximized and retention rates for child care workers increased when  rewards for training and higher quality child care are linked. For example,  both North Carolina and Oklahoma offer incentives to providers to  encourage them to pursue training. These incentives are offered through a  program for college scholarships funded by state, federal, and private  dollars (T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood). Both North Carolina and Oklahoma  have also adopted a salary supplement program called WAGE$ to reward  increased education attainment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parent Training", "paragraphs": ["Parent training is provided by R&R organizations in each state, which  provide information on the Internet and by telephone, as well as through  written brochures, fact sheets, and newsletters.

In Delaware, the R&R offered  workshops throughout the year to parents on over 105 topics pertaining to  children up to school age. In all four states we visited, the R&R agency  provided a system to help parents locate child care\u2014often known as a  child care locator\u2014as well as information about how to choose quality  care and what training opportunities were available for parents.

However, some states have decreased the number of inspections per  facility per year. At the same time, states are maintaining their flexibility in  administering CCDF and providing parents with choice in the child care  options available to them. States use inspections to oversee the child care  provided in facilities with the greatest number of children and use less  intensive methods like self-certification for other facilities they regulate.  Self-certification affords less assurance that providers are meeting safety  and health requirements, but in an era when caseload sizes already exceed  recommended levels in many states and states find themselves challenged  by increasing child care demand, it helps keep low-cost child care  available.", "The use of technology has also increased in the states for state licensing  staff, providers, and parents. Not only have the number of states using  technology in the areas associated with state activities in new areas,  providing information and training resources for parents licensing and  enforcement increased, but technology has also expanded into new areas,  providing information and training resources for parents, providers, and  training organizations on a broad range of topics for a number of different  functions. The obvious advantages of an up-to-date, Internet-based,  integrated information system have been demonstrated by Florida.  However, the size of the investment required for this type of system  depends on whether or not the state chooses to create an independent  licensing information system, or if the state wants its licensing system to  be part of a larger statewide child care information system. Florida found  it more affordable to do the former."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided officials of the Administration for Children and Families  (ACF), HHS, an opportunity to comment on a draft of this report.

The responses to question 16 of  our survey (on the number of states exempting some family child care  homes from state regulation) proved problematic, as it had in the 1999  survey. Callbacks to a sample of respondents whose survey responses  differed from data produced by NCCIC showed that respondents  misunderstood our question. The NCCIC information was based on  published state standards of the regulation threshold point for the number  of children served rather than survey data. Therefore we used the NCCIC  data in this report to answer this question. Since this was similar to what  we had done to compensate for the problems in responses to that question  in the 1999 survey, the data for the 2 years are comparable.", "In addition, we conducted a literature search and interviewed child care  licensing experts and state and federal officials to gather information  about critical licensing and enforcement activities occurring within the  states.
