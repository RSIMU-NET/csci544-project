As implemented by FCC, schools and libraries eligible for this program could receive discounts from vendors on the cost of approved telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections.

In our testimony before your Committee on July 16, 1998, we noted that the Corporation had made progress in establishing an operational framework for the program that was consistent with relevant FCC Orders. However, we also found several areas of concern and recommended that the FCC Chairman direct the Corporation to take the following actions to strengthen its operations before issuing any funding commitment letters to applicants: analyze a random sample of processed applications to determine if there are any systemic weaknesses in the application review procedures; complete the design of the program\u2019s operational procedures, automated systems, and internal controls; and obtain a report from its independent accountants that finds that the Corporation has developed an appropriate set of internal controls to mitigate against waste, fraud, and abuse.", "In addition, we recommended that the Corporation conduct in-depth reviews of applications designated as \u201chigh risk\u201d before, rather than after, issuing commitment letters to these applicants.

Generally, educational institutions that meet the definition of \u201cschools\u201d laid out in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 are eligible to participate, as are libraries that can receive assistance from a state\u2019s library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act.", "Schools and libraries do not receive direct funding from the program. Instead, support comes in the form of discounts on the costs of telecommunications services. FCC\u2019s orders provided for discounts ranging from 20 to 90 percent on all commercially available telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections.

NECA, in turn, has subcontracted with two other organizations to help answer applicants\u2019 questions, process and enter applications into the Corporation\u2019s database, and establish and maintain the Corporation\u2019s public web site, which contains important information about program operations and application procedures.", "FCC changed this administrative structure in November 1998 in response to the Congress\u2019s directive that a single entity administer universal service support for schools and libraries and rural health care providers. FCC appointed the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) as the permanent administrator of the universal service fund and directed the Corporation to merge with USAC by January 1, 1999. Under this merger, the Corporation\u2019s staff will become part of USAC\u2019s Schools and Libraries Division, carrying out essentially the same functions as before.

Checking on the eligibility of requested services is not easy, however, because of the variety and technical nature of many of these services\u2014especially those related to internal connections.", "The Corporation\u2019s review procedures for eligible services use both manual inspections and an automated system for flagging problem applications. An important internal control document in this review process is a checklist of ineligible items, which is used during the initial screening of applications. If a clerical staff member using this checklist finds an ineligible item on an application, the application is flagged in the application processing system for a second, more detailed review by a professional staff member who checks the eligibility of each requested service. We found, however, that as the Corporation processed applications and gained experience in the types of services being requested, it added items to its checklist of ineligible services. As a result, different criteria were applied to applications, depending on when they were first screened. In our early discussions with Corporation officials, we learned that they did not intend to recheck applications that had been processed before the checklist was updated. This raised our concern that some early applications may have cleared the screening process that should have been flagged for detailed review.", "The results of the Corporation\u2019s review of a random sample showed that weaknesses indeed existed in its procedures for ensuring that only eligible services receive funding. At least 19 of the 100 applications in the sample contained requests for ineligible items as defined by FCC orders, totaling approximately $106,000 in inappropriately requested funding. Of these 19 applications, 7 had been classified as \u201cclean\u201d (that is, containing no ineligible items) by the Corporation\u2019s earlier review and contained approximately $6,000 in inappropriately requested funding. The Corporation\u2019s independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, subsequently requested the Corporation to conduct a further sample of 300 applications that had been classified as \u201cclean.\u201d This review found that 4.6 percent, or approximately $314,000, of the discount funding requested in these applications would have gone to ineligible items.", "Given the error level revealed by these two samples, Corporation officials concluded that their test had to be strengthened. Accordingly, they changed their review procedures to require staff to perform a complete manual review of every requested service item in all 32,000 applications, regardless of whether these applications had been flagged during the initial screening. To implement these new procedures in a timely manner, the Corporation\u2019s contractor augmented its permanent staff with temporary staff to perform the reviews. Training and supervising new staff is, of course, important in ensuring that the new review procedures are carried out effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discount Issue Needs Further Scrutiny", "paragraphs": ["FCC orders state that the level of discount that each school or library can receive should be determined by the applicant\u2019s economic need and location. Discounts range from 20 to 90 percent of the costs of the services to the applicants, with higher discounts going to those in low-income and rural areas. Applicants calculate the discount level to which they are entitled by following instructions and criteria on the application form and certify that their discount calculations are correct. When the Corporation processes an application, it uses an automated test to check the requested discount level. This test compares the applicant\u2019s requested discount with a discount level calculated from data on schools in the Corporation\u2019s database. If the applicant is requesting a higher discount than indicated by the Corporation\u2019s database, the test can flag the application for special review. As part of this review, a program official contacts the applicant and gathers information to determine whether the requested discount level is in fact correct.", "It is possible for the automated system to flag every application that shows a variance from the Corporation\u2019s own calculation. However, the Corporation decided that such a stringent approach was not warranted because of limitations in the database it uses to make its calculations. For example, the database contains the number of students actually participating in the National School Lunch Program, rather than the number eligible to participate, which is the measure adopted by FCC. Moreover, the data are about a year old. Mindful of these limitations, the Corporation decided to establish some latitude in its review procedures for eligible discounts. Thus, the Corporation allows applications to pass unchallenged through its automated discount review if the requested discount level does not exceed a certain threshold of variance from the Corporation\u2019s own calculation. Applications that cross this threshold are flagged for manual review by a program official. Corporation officials stated that adopting this procedure was a reasonable business decision because the cost of manually reviewing all applications that showed any variance from the Corporation\u2019s own calculations would exceed the benefits gained.", "We found in our initial review, however, that the Corporation had not performed a sound benefit-cost analysis to justify this business decision. We were concerned about this situation not only because of the need to enforce program rules for the sake of equity but also because the total amount of funding available during the program\u2019s first year was not enough to cover all of the applicants\u2019 requests for support. Providing funding for ineligible services or allowing inappropriate discount levels could result in some applicants\u2019 proper requests for support being denied.", "The Corporation\u2019s review of a sample of 100 processed applications showed that 57 of them requested discount levels that varied from the Corporation\u2019s own calculation. After obtaining additional information for these 57 applications, the Corporation determined that at least 9 could not support their requested level of discounts. The dollar amount of these inappropriate discount requests totaled about $14,000 out of the approximately $4.5 million in requested funding.", "At the request of its independent accountants, the Corporation conducted a review of an additional sample. The Corporation selected 50 applications that requested $100,000 or more in support. In this second sample, 39 of the 50 processed applications contained discount levels that varied from the Corporation\u2019s own calculation. The Corporation found that 6 of the 39 applications requested discounts that could not be validated. The funding that would have been awarded for these inappropriate discount levels totaled about $35,000 out of approximately $28.5 million in requested funding.", "Having considered these results, Corporation officials decided that they did not need to change their procedures for reviewing requested discount rates for the first funding year. As before, they maintained that the amount of inappropriate funding in question was not large enough to warrant the time and cost of performing follow-ups on every application that showed any variation from the discount level calculated by the Corporation\u2019s automated check.", "We remain concerned, however, that the amount of inappropriate discounts passing unchallenged through the review process, though relatively low now, could grow larger in subsequent funding years. We therefore believe that the Corporation needs to explore methods for mitigating this risk in a cost-beneficial manner. Aware of our continuing concern, the FCC Chairman directed the Corporation in November 1998 to work with FCC staff \u201cto establish a method for improving the procedures for ensuring that discounts are provided in accordance with the discount levels set forth in the Commission\u2019s rules.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Final Operating Procedures Have Been Established", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our initial review in June and July 1998, the Corporation had not yet finalized all the procedures, automated systems, and internal controls needed to make funding commitments and approve vendors\u2019 compensation for the discounted services provided to applicants. Nevertheless, the Corporation was planning to issue funding commitment letters before the remaining procedures were finalized. We maintained, however, that this approach would have put the Corporation at risk of being unable to process nearly $2 billion in vendors\u2019 invoices in a timely manner. Corporation officials themselves estimated that in cases where services were already being provided to applicants, invoices for payment could be sent in by vendors as soon as 15 days after commitment letters were sent out, thereby triggering the reimbursement process. Therefore, we recommended in our July 1998 testimony that the Corporation make no funding commitments until it had finalized all of its operating procedures and automated systems. FCC and the Corporation accepted this recommendation.", "The Corporation needed until early November 1998 to finalize its operating procedures, complete the testing of the automated systems supporting these procedures, and secure the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s approval of the applicant and vendor forms needed for the reimbursement process. This delay occurred in part because on June 22, 1998, FCC released a reconsideration order that significantly altered the program.", "Specifically, the program\u2019s funding year was changed from a calendar year cycle to a fiscal year cycle, and the period for the first round of funding was changed from 12 months to 18 months. The order also adjusted the maximum amounts that could be collected and spent during 1998 and the first 6 months of 1999, directing the Corporation to commit no more than $1.925 billion for the schools and libraries program during this time frame. Because this amount was not expected to cover all of the applicants\u2019 requests, FCC directed the Corporation to give funding priority to applicants\u2019 requests for telecommunications services and Internet access. Once these requests are satisfied, the remaining funds are to be used for internal connections, with priority given to applicants eligible for higher discounts. To implement these new priority rules, the Corporation had to significantly revise its funding award process and automated support systems.", "In addition, the Corporation found that some established procedures needed to be modified as it learned lessons from reviewing the first round of applications. For example, the Corporation initially cautioned schools and libraries that they would not receive discounts on any items in their funding requests that had included ineligible services mixed with eligible services. However, when the Corporation began reviewing applications, it found some cases in which applicants included an ineligible service that accounted for only a small percentage of the total cost of the service item being requested. As a result, the Corporation, with FCC\u2019s concurrence, modified its procedures so as to provide funding for items that were substantially correct even though they contained some ineligible services. Specifically, if the ineligible services accounted for less than 50 percent of the total dollar amount of the item requested, the Corporation would separate out the cost of the ineligible services and provide discount funding for the remaining eligible services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Independent Accountants\u2019 Report on the Corporation\u2019s Internal Controls Has Been Completed", "paragraphs": ["In December 1997, FCC\u2019s Chairman directed the Corporation to contract with an independent accounting firm to assess\u2014before any program disbursements were made\u2014whether the program\u2019s processes and procedures provided the controls needed to mitigate against fraud, waste, and abuse. In December 1997, with the approval of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors, the Corporation engaged the services of Coopers & Lybrand, LLP (which became PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, on July 1, 1998).

Therefore, we recommended that the Corporation refrain from making funding commitments until it had obtained a report from its independent accountants stating that an appropriate set of internal controls was in place. Both FCC and the Corporation accepted this recommendation.

The weakness in the service review procedures, discussed earlier, was addressed to the independent accountants\u2019 satisfaction when the Corporation changed them to require a complete review of all requested services on all applications before committing funds. The independent accountants\u2019 concern with the discount review focused on the Corporation\u2019s decision to allow some applications to go through the review process unchallenged even though they were requesting a higher discount than calculated by the Corporation in its review process. Near the end of the independent accountants\u2019 review in November 1998, the Corporation modified its written program objective for discounts to reflect its practice of accepting and approving discounts that are higher than its own discount calculation, provided that they are within a certain threshold of variance. The Corporation cited limitations in its verification sources, discussed earlier, as the reason for adopting this procedure.

These represent about $1.2 billion of the $2 billion requested by all applicants for the program\u2019s first year. As part of its high-risk reviews, the Corporation plans to require these applicants to submit additional material to support their funding requests. This material is then to be reviewed by program staff to check for conformity to program rules.", "Because these high-risk reviews are an important internal control, we were concerned about their timing. The Corporation originally planned to wait until after the applicants had received their funding commitment letters before doing their high-risk reviews. Under this scenario, if the Corporation found a problem with a high-risk application during its special review, it might have to reduce or withdraw the funding commitment that it had already made. In such cases, applicants who decided to begin receiving contracted services on the basis of their funding commitment letters could find themselves responsible for paying more than they had planned.", "Accordingly, in our July 1998 testimony, we recommended that the Corporation complete these special reviews before sending funding commitment letters to high-risk applicants. The Corporation agreed to change its procedures and in October 1998 began conducting its first special reviews of the high-risk applications.

These include implementing the newly revised review procedures, especially for high-risk applications; setting priorities for funding commitments in accordance with FCC\u2019s orders dealing with applicants\u2019 appeals on commitment decisions, including establishing a funding reserve to cover those that are successful; and reviewing and authorizing vendors\u2019 requests for reimbursement.", "These are challenging activities in themselves and will be even more challenging because they can overlap in time.
