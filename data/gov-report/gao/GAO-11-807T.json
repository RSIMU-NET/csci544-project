Aviation security remains a daunting challenge with hundreds of airports, thousands of aircraft, and thousands of flights daily carrying millions of passengers and pieces of checked baggage. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has spent billions of dollars and implemented a wide range of aviation security initiatives. Three key layers of aviation security are (1) TSA's Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program designed to identify persons who may pose a security risk; (2) airport perimeter and access controls security; and (3) checked baggage screening systems. This testimony provides information on the extent to which TSA has taken actions to validate the scientific basis of SPOT, strengthen airport perimeter security and access controls, and deploy more effective checked baggage screening systems. This statement is based on prior reports GAO issued from September 2009 through July 2011 and selected updates in June and July 2011. GAO analyzed documents on TSA's progress in strengthening aviation security, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has completed an initial study to validate the scientific basis of the SPOT program; however, additional work remains to fully validate the program. GAO reported in May 2010 that TSA deployed this program, which uses behavior observation and analysis techniques to identify potentially high-risk passengers, before determining whether there was a scientifically valid basis for using behavior and appearance indicators as a means for reliably identifying passengers who may pose a risk to the U.S. aviation system. TSA officials said that SPOT was deployed in response to potential threats, such as suicide bombers, and was based on scientific research available at the time. GAO recommended in May 2010 that DHS, as part of its study, assess the methodology to help ensure the validity of the SPOT program. DHS concurred and its April 2011 validation study found that SPOT was more effective than random screening to varying degrees. For example, the study found that SPOT was more effective than random screening at identifying individuals who possessed fraudulent documents and individuals who were subsequently arrested. However, DHS's study was not designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used to reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a security risk. The study noted that additional work is needed to comprehensively validate the program. TSA officials are assessing the actions needed to address the study's recommendations. In September 2009, GAO reported that since 2004 TSA has taken actions to strengthen airport perimeter and access controls security by, among other things, deploying a random worker screening program; however, TSA has not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment or developed a national strategy. Specifically, TSA had not conducted vulnerability assessments for 87 percent of the approximately 450 U.S. airports regulated by TSA at that time. GAO recommended that TSA develop (1) a comprehensive risk assessment and evaluate the need to assess airport vulnerabilities nationwide and (2) a national strategy to guide efforts to strengthen airport security. DHS concurred and said TSA is developing the assessment and strategy, but has not yet evaluated the need to assess airport vulnerabilities nationwide. GAO reported in July 2011 that TSA revised explosives detection requirements for its explosives detection systems (EDS) used to screen checked baggage in January 2010, but faces challenges in deploying EDS that meet these requirements. Deploying systems that meet the 2010 EDS requirements could be difficult given that TSA did not begin deployment of systems meeting the previous 2005 requirements until 2009. As of January 2011 some of the EDS in TSA's fleet detect explosives at the level established in 2005 while the remaining EDS detect explosives at levels established in 1998. Further, TSA does not have a plan to deploy and operate systems to meet the current requirements and has faced challenges in procuring the first 260 systems to meet these requirements. GAO recommended that TSA, among other things, develop a plan to ensure that EDS are operated at the levels in established requirements. DHS agreed and has outlined actions to do so."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations in prior work to strengthen TSA's SPOT program, airport security efforts, checked baggage screening efforts.

The attempted terrorist bombing of  Northwest flight 253 on December 25, 2009, provided a vivid reminder  that civil aviation remains an attractive terrorist target and underscores  the need for effective passenger screening. According to the President\u2019s  National Counterterrorism Strategy released in June 2011, aviation  security and screening is an essential tool in our ability to detect, disrupt,  and defeat plots to attack the homeland.", "Securing commercial aviation operations remain a daunting task\u2014with  hundreds of airports, thousands of aircraft, and thousands of flights daily  carrying millions of passengers and pieces of checked baggage. In the  almost 10 years that have passed since TSA assumed responsibility for  aviation security, TSA has spent billions of dollars and implemented a  wide range of initiatives to strengthen the layers of aviation security.  However, risks to the aviation system remain.", "In addition, while airport operators, not TSA, generally retain direct day- to-day operational responsibility for airport perimeter security and  implementing access controls for secure areas of their airports, TSA has  responsibility for establishing and implementing measures to improve  security in these areas. Criminal incidents involving airport workers using  their access privileges to smuggle weapons and drugs into secure areas  and onto planes have heightened concerns about the risks posed by  workers and the security of airport perimeters and access to secure  areas.", "My statement today discusses the extent to which TSA has taken actions  to (1) validate the scientific basis of its behavior-based passenger  screening program (referred to as SPOT), (2) strengthen the security of  airport perimeters and access controls, and (3) deploy more effective  checked baggage screening systems.", "This statement is based on our prior work issued from September 2009  through July 2011, and includes selected updates conducted from June  2011 through July 2011 on TSA\u2019s efforts to implement our prior  recommendations regarding aviation security, including those related to  SPOT and airport perimeters and access to secure areas of airports. For  our May 2010 report on SPOT, we reviewed relevant literature on  behavior analysis by subject matter experts. We conducted field site  visits to 15 TSA-regulated airports with SPOT to observe operations and  meet with key program personnel. We also interviewed recognized  experts in the field, as well as cognizant officials from other U.S.  government agencies that utilize behavior analysis in their work. For the  updates, we analyzed documentation from TSA on the actions it has  taken to implement the recommendations from our May 2010 report,  including efforts to validate the scientific basis for the program. As part of  our efforts to update this information, we analyzed DHS\u2019s April 2011  SPOT validation study and discussed its findings with cognizant DHS  officials.", "For our September 2009 report on TSA efforts to secure airport  perimeters and access controls, we examined TSA documents related to  risk assessments, airport security programs, and risk management. We  also interviewed TSA, airport, and industry association officials and  conducted site visits at nine TSA-regulated airports of varying size. We  selectively updated the information in the report on risk management in  July 2011.", "For our July 2011 report on checked baggage systems, we compared  requirements for explosives detection systems (EDS) established by TSA  in 2010 and compared them to requirements previously established in  2005 and 1998 to determine how they differed. To identify challenges  TSA is experiencing in implementing the current EDS acquisition, we  analyzed documentation from the Electronic Baggage Screening  Program, including the acquisition strategy and risk management plans.  We also interviewed TSA program officials regarding their approach to  the current EDS acquisition, including revisions to plans and timelines.  Our previously published products contain additional details on the scope  and methodology, including data reliability, for these reviews.", "All of our work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. These standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis of our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. For  new information that was based on work not previously reported, we  obtained TSA views on our findings and incorporated technical comments  where appropriate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Aviation and Transportation Security Act established TSA as the  federal agency with primary responsibility for securing the nation\u2019s civil  aviation system, which includes the screening of all passenger and  property transported by commercial passenger aircraft. At the 463 TSA- regulated airports in the U.S., prior to boarding an aircraft, all passengers,  their accessible property, and their checked baggage are screened  pursuant to TSA-established procedures, which include passengers  passing through security checkpoints where they and their identification  documents are checked by transportation security officers (TSO) and  other TSA employees or by private sector screeners under TSA\u2019s  Screening Partnership Program. Airport operators, however, are directly  responsible for implementing TSA security requirements, such as those  relating to perimeter security and access controls, in accordance with  their approved security programs and other TSA direction.", "TSA relies upon multiple layers of security to deter, detect, and disrupt  persons posing a potential risk to aviation security. These layers include  behavior detection officers (BDOs), who examine passenger behaviors  and appearances to identify passengers who might pose a potential  security risk at TSA-regulated airports; travel document checkers, who  examine tickets, passports, and other forms of identification; TSOs  responsible for screening passengers and their carry-on baggage at  passenger checkpoints, using x-ray equipment, magnetometers,  Advanced Imaging Technology, and other devices; random employee  screening; and checked baggage screening systems. Other security  layers cited by TSA include, among others; intelligence gathering and  analysis; passenger prescreening against terrorist watchlists; random  canine team searches at airports; federal air marshals, who provide  federal law enforcement presence on selected flights operated by U.S. air  carriers; Visible Intermodal Protection Response (VIPR) teams; reinforced  cockpit doors; the passengers themselves; as well as other measures  both visible and invisible to the public. Figure 1 shows TSA\u2019s layers of  aviation security. TSA has also implemented a variety of programs and  protective actions to strengthen airport perimeters and access to sensitive  areas of the airport, including conducting additional employee background  checks and assessing different biometric-identification technologies.  Airport perimeter and access control security is intended to prevent  unauthorized access into secure areas of an airport\u2014either from outside  or within the airport complex.", "According to TSA, each one of these layers alone is capable of stopping  a terrorist attack. TSA states that the security layers in combination  multiply their value, creating a much stronger system, and that a terrorist  who has to overcome multiple security layers to carry out an attack is  more likely to be preempted, deterred, or to fail during the attempt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Behavior Detection Program", "paragraphs": ["TSA has taken actions to validate the science underlying its behavior  detection program, but more work remains. We reported in May 2010 that  TSA deployed SPOT nationwide before first determining whether there  was a scientifically valid basis for using behavior and appearance  indicators as a means for reliably identifying passengers who may pose a  risk to the U.S. aviation system. DHS\u2019s Science and Technology  Directorate completed a validation study in April 2011 to determine the  extent to which SPOT was more effective than random screening at  identifying security threats and how the program\u2019s behaviors correlate to  identifying high-risk travelers. However, as noted in the study, the  assessment was an initial validation step, but was not designed to fully  validate whether behavior detection can be used to reliably identify  individuals in an airport environment who pose a security risk. According  to DHS, further research will be needed to comprehensively validate the  program.", "According to TSA, SPOT was deployed before a scientific validation of  the program was completed to help address potential threats to the  aviation system, such as those posed by suicide bombers. TSA also  stated that the program was based upon scientific research available at  the time regarding human behaviors. We reported in May 2010 that  approximately 14,000 passengers were referred to law enforcement  officers under SPOT from May 2004 through August 2008. Of these  passengers, 1,083 were arrested for various reasons, including being  illegal aliens (39 percent), having outstanding warrants (19 percent), and  possessing fraudulent documents (15 percent). The remaining 27 percent  were related to other reasons for arrest. As noted in our May 2010 report,  SPOT officials told us that it is not known if the SPOT program has ever  resulted in the arrest of anyone who is a terrorist, or who was planning to  engage in terrorist-related activity. According to TSA, SPOT referred  about 50,000 passengers for additional screening in fiscal year 2010  resulting in about 3,600 referrals to law enforcement officers. These  referrals yielded approximately 300 arrests. Of these 300 arrests, TSA  stated that 27 percent were illegal aliens, 17 percent were drug-related,  14 percent were related to fraudulent documents, 12 percent were related  to outstanding warrants, and 30 percent were related to other offenses.  DHS has requested about $254 million in fiscal year 2012 for the SPOT  program, which would support an additional 350 (or 175 full-time  equivalent) BDOs. If TSA receives its requested appropriation, TSA will  be in a position to have invested about $1 billion in the SPOT program  since fiscal year 2007.", "A 2008 report issued by the National Research Council of the National  Academy of Sciences stated that the scientific evidence for behavioral  monitoring is preliminary in nature. The report also noted that an  information-based program, such as a behavior detection program,  should first determine if a scientific foundation exists and use scientifically  valid criteria to evaluate its effectiveness before deployment. The report  added that such programs should have a sound experimental basis and  that the documentation on the program\u2019s effectiveness should be  reviewed by an independent entity capable of evaluating the supporting  scientific evidence.", "As we reported in May 2010, an independent panel of experts could help  DHS develop a comprehensive methodology to determine if the SPOT  program is based on valid scientific principles that can be effectively  applied in an airport environment for counterterrorism purposes. Thus, we  recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security convene an  independent panel of experts to review the methodology of the validation  study on the SPOT program being conducted to determine whether the  study\u2019s methodology is sufficiently comprehensive to validate the SPOT  program. We also recommended that this assessment include  appropriate input from other federal agencies with expertise in behavior  detection and relevant subject matter experts. DHS concurred and  stated that its validation study, completed in April 2011, included an  independent review of the study with input from a broad range of federal  agencies and relevant experts, including those from academia.", "DHS\u2019s validation study found that SPOT was more effective than random  screening to varying degrees. For example, the study found that SPOT  was more effective than random screening at identifying individuals who  possessed fraudulent documents and identifying individuals who law  enforcement officers ultimately arrested. According to DHS\u2019s study, no  other counterterrorism or screening program incorporating behavior- and  appearance-based indicators is known to have been subjected to such a  rigorous, systematic evaluation of its screening accuracy. However, DHS  noted that the identification of such high-risk passengers was rare in both  the SPOT and random tests. In addition, DHS determined that the base  rate, or frequency, of SPOT behavioral indicators observed by TSA to  detect suspicious passengers was very low and that these observed  indicators were highly varied across the traveling public. Although details  about DHS\u2019s findings related to these indicators are sensitive security  information, the low base rate and high variability of traveler behaviors  highlights the challenge that TSA faces in effectively implementing a  standardized list of SPOT behavioral indicators.", "In addition, DHS outlined several limitations to the study. For example,  the study noted that BDOs were aware of whether individuals they were  screening were referred to them as the result of identified SPOT  indicators or random selection. DHS stated that this had the potential to  introduce bias into the assessment. DHS also noted that SPOT data from  January 2006 through October 2010 were used in its analysis of  behavioral indicators even though questions about the reliability of the  data exist. In May 2010, we reported weaknesses in TSA\u2019s process for  maintaining operational data from the SPOT program database.  Specifically, the SPOT database did not have computerized edit checks  built into the system to review the format, existence, and reasonableness  of data. Because of these data-related issues, we reported that  meaningful analyses could not be conducted to determine if there is an  association between certain behaviors and the likelihood that a person  displaying certain behaviors would be referred to a law enforcement  officer or whether any behavior or combination of behaviors could be  used to distinguish deceptive from nondeceptive individuals. In our May  2010 report, we recommended that TSA establish controls for this SPOT  data. DHS agreed and TSA has established additional data controls as  part of its database upgrade. However, some of DHS\u2019s analysis used  SPOT data recorded prior to these additional controls.", "The study also noted that it was not designed to comprehensively validate  whether SPOT can be used to reliably identify individuals in an airport  environment who pose a security risk. The DHS study made  recommendations related to strengthening the program and conducting a  more comprehensive validation of whether the science can be used for  counterterrorism purposes in the aviation environment. Some of these  recommendations, such as the need for a comprehensive program  evaluation including a cost-benefit analysis, reiterate recommendations  made in our prior work. As we reported in March 2011, Congress may  wish to consider the study\u2019s results in making future funding decisions  regarding the program. TSA is currently reviewing the study\u2019s findings  and assessing the steps needed to address DHS\u2019s recommendations. If  TSA decides to implement the recommendations in the April 2011 DHS  validation study, DHS may be years away from knowing whether there is  a scientifically valid basis for using behavior detection techniques to help  secure the aviation system against terrorist threats given that the initial  study took about 4 years to complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airport Perimeter and Access Controls", "paragraphs": ["TSA has taken actions to strengthen airport perimeter and access  controls security, but has not conducted a comprehensive risk  assessment or developed a national strategy for airport security. We  reported in September 2009 that TSA has implemented a variety of  programs and actions since 2004 to improve and strengthen airport  perimeter and access controls security, including strengthening worker  screening and improving access control technology. For example, to  better address the risks posed by airport workers, in 2007 TSA  implemented a random worker screening program that has been used to  enforce access procedures, such as ensuring workers display appropriate  credentials and do not possess unauthorized items when entering secure  areas. According to TSA officials, this program was developed to help  counteract the potential vulnerability of airports to an insider attack\u2014an  attack from an airport worker with authorized access to secure areas.  TSA has also expanded its requirements for conducting worker  background checks and the population of individuals who are subject to  these checks. For example, in 2007 TSA expanded requirements for  name-based checks to all individuals seeking or holding airport-issued  identification badges and in 2009 began requiring airports to renew all  airport-identification media every 2 years. TSA also reported taking  actions to identify and assess technologies to strengthen airport perimeter  and access controls security, such as assisting the aviation industry and a  federal aviation advisory committee in developing security standards for  biometric access controls.", "However, we reported in September 2009 that while TSA has taken  actions to assess risk with respect to airport perimeter and access  controls security, it had not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment  based on assessments of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, as  required by DHS\u2019s National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). We  further reported that without a full depiction of threats, vulnerabilities, and  consequences, an organization\u2019s ability to establish priorities and make  cost-effective security decisions is limited. We recommended that TSA  develop a comprehensive risk assessment, along with milestones for  completing the assessment. DHS concurred with our recommendation  and said it would include an assessment of airport perimeter and access  control security risks as part of a comprehensive assessment for the  transportation sector\u2014the Transportation Sector Security Risk  Assessment (TSSRA). The TSSRA, published in July 2010, included an  assessment of various risk-based scenarios related to airport perimeter  security but did not consider the potential vulnerabilities of airports to an  insider attack\u2014the insider threat\u2014which it recognized as a significant  issue. In July 2011, TSA officials told us that the agency is developing a  framework for insider risk that is to be included in the next iteration of the  assessment, which TSA expected to be released at the end of calendar  year 2011. Such action, if taken, would meet the intent of our  recommendation.", "We also recommended that, as part of a comprehensive risk assessment  of airport perimeter and access controls security, TSA evaluate the need  to conduct an assessment of security vulnerabilities at airports  nationwide. At the time of our review, TSA told us its primary measures  for assessing the vulnerability of airports to attack were professional  judgment and the collective results of joint vulnerability assessments  (JVA) it conducts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for  select\u2014usually high-risk\u2014airports. Our analysis of TSA data showed  that from fiscal years 2004 through 2008, TSA conducted JVAs at about  13 percent of the approximately 450 TSA-regulated airports that existed  at that time, thus leaving about 87 percent of airports unassessed. TSA  has characterized U.S. airports as an interdependent system in which the  security of all is affected or disrupted by the security of the weakest link.", "However, we reported that TSA officials could not explain to what extent  the collective JVAs of specific airports constituted a reasonable systems- based assessment of vulnerability across airports nationwide. Moreover,  TSA officials said that they did not know to what extent the 87 percent of  commercial airports that had not received a JVA as of September 2009\u2014 most of which were smaller airports\u2014were vulnerable to an intentional  security breach. DHS concurred with our recommendation to assess the  need for a vulnerability assessment of airports nationwide. TSA officials  also stated that based on our review they intended to increase the  number of JVAs conducted at Category II, III, and IV airports and that the  resulting data would assist TSA in prioritizing the allocation of limited  resources. Our analysis of TSA data showed that  from fiscal year 2004  through July 1, 2011, TSA conducted JVAs at about 17 percent of the  TSA-regulated airports that existed at that time, thus leaving about 83  percent of airports unassessed. Since we issued our report in  September 2009, TSA had not conducted JVAs at Category III and IV  airports. Further, TSA could not tell us to what extent it has studied the  need to conduct JVAs of security vulnerabilities at airports nationwide.", "We also reported in September 2009 that TSA\u2019s efforts to enhance the  security of the nation\u2019s airports have not been guided by a national  strategy that identifies key elements, such as goals, priorities,  performance measures, and required resources. To better ensure that  airport stakeholders take a unified approach to airport security, we  recommended that TSA develop a national strategy for airport security  that incorporates key characteristics of effective security strategies, such  as measurable goals and priorities. DHS concurred with this  recommendation and stated that TSA would implement it by updating the  Transportation Systems-Sector Specific Plan (TS-SSP), to be released in  the summer of 2010. In July 2011 TSA officials told us that a pre- publication version of the TS-SSP had been sent to Congress on June  29, 2011, and that DHS was in the process of finalizing the TS-SSP for  publication, but a specific date had not been set for public release."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Checked Baggage Screening Systems", "paragraphs": ["TSA has revised explosives detection requirements for checked baggage  screening systems but faces challenges in deploying equipment that meet  the requirements. Explosives represent a continuing threat to the checked  baggage component of aviation security. TSA deploys EDS and  explosives trace detection (ETD) machines to screen all checked  baggage transported by U.S. and foreign air carriers departing from TSA- regulated airports in the United States. An EDS uses a computed  tomography X-ray source that rotates around a bag, obtaining a large  number of cross-sectional images that are integrated by a computer that  automatically triggers an alarm when objects with the characteristic of  explosives are detected. An ETD machine is used to chemically analyze  trace materials after a human operator swabs checked baggage to  identify any traces of explosive material. TSA seeks to ensure that  checked baggage screening technology is capable of detecting  explosives through its Electronic Baggage Screening Program, one of the  largest acquisition programs within DHS. Under the program, TSA  certifies and acquires systems used to screen checked baggage at 463  TSA-regulated airports throughout the United States. TSA certifies  explosives detection-screening technologies to ensure they meet  explosives detection requirements developed in conjunction with the DHS  Science and Technology Directorate along with input from other  agencies, such as the FBI and Department of Defense.", "Our July 2011 report addressed TSA\u2019s efforts to enhance explosives  detection requirements for checked-baggage screening technologies as  well as TSA\u2019s efforts to ensure that currently deployed and newly  acquired explosives detection technologies meet the enhanced  requirements.  As highlighted in our July 2011 report, requirements for  EDSs were established in 1998 and subsequently revised in 2005 and  2010 to better address the threats. Currently, checked baggage screening  systems are not operating under the 2010 requirements. As of January  2011, some of the EDS in TSA\u2019s fleet are detecting explosives at the level  established by the 2005 requirements. Meanwhile, other EDS are  configured to meet older requirements established in 1998, but include  software to meet 2005 requirements. The remaining EDS are configured  to meet 1998 requirements but lack the software or both the hardware  and software that would enable them to detect at the levels established  by the 2005 requirements. TSA plans to implement the revised  requirements in a phased approach spanning several years. The first  phase, which includes implementation of the 2005 requirements, is  scheduled to take years to fully implement and deploying EDS that meet  2010 requirements could prove difficult given that TSA did not begin  deployment of EDS meeting 2005 requirements until 2009\u20144 years later.", "We found that TSA did not have a plan to deploy and operate EDS to  meet the most recent requirements and recommended, among other  things, that TSA develop a plan to deploy EDS that meet the current EDS  explosives detection requirements and ensure that new EDS, as well as  those already deployed in airports, be operated at the levels established  in those requirements. In addition, TSA has faced challenges in procuring  the first 260 EDS to meet 2010 requirements. For example, due to the  danger associated with certain explosives, TSA and DHS encountered  challenges safely developing simulants and collecting data on the  explosives\u2019 physical and chemical properties needed by vendors and  agencies to develop detection software and test EDS prior to the current  acquisition. Also, TSA\u2019s decision to pursue EDS procurement complicated  both the data collection and procurement efforts, which resulted in a delay  of over 7 months for the current acquisition. We recommended that TSA  complete data collection for each phase of the 2010 EDS requirements  prior to pursuing EDS procurements that meet those requirements to help  TSA avoid additional schedule delays.", "Our report also examined other key issues such as the extent to which  TSA\u2019s approach to its current EDS acquisition meets best practices for  schedules and cost estimates and included a review of TSA\u2019s plans for  potential upgrades of deployed EDSs. The report contained six  recommendations to TSA, including that the agency develop a plan to  ensure that new EDSs, as well as those EDSs currently deployed in  airports, operate at levels that meet revised requirements.
