GAO's review focused on the agencies' efforts since 2010, when the FBI's investigation of the 2001 anthrax attack was closed. GAO analyzed relevant agency documents and interviewed agency officials and scientists on issues related to bioforensics. GAO also convened a meeting of experts with NAS's assistance to discuss potential bioforensics needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have identified some gaps in their bioforensics capabilities, but DHS has not performed a formal bioforensics capability gap analysis. It is therefore not clear whether DHS and the FBI have identified all of their capability gaps. A capability gap analysis can help identify deficiencies in capabilities and can help support the validation and prioritization of how to address the gaps. DHS and the FBI have identified capability gaps using an informal undocumented process. For example, DHS held informal meetings to seek FBI input on capability gaps associated with recent casework. Gaps identified through this informal process include the inability to (1) characterize unique, novel, and engineered agents and \u201cunknowns\u201d (emerging or synthetic organisms) and (2) understand and communicate uncertainty associated with analyzing complex biological samples, among other things. In the absence of a well-documented bioforensics capability gap analysis, the rationale for DHS's resource allocations, or its plans for future enhancements to existing capabilities are not clear and thus cannot ensure that resources are being targeted to the highest priority gaps.", "In addition to DHS and the FBI, other organizations, such as the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), and the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), have identified potential bioforensics capability needs. These needs can generally be grouped into three areas: science, technology and methods, and bioinformatics and data. GAO also convened a meeting of experts, with the help of NAS, and these experts updated a list of potential bioforensics capability needs that NAS and OSTP had previously identified within each of these areas. Some of the needs these experts confirmed as still relevant were similar to those DHS and FBI officials have identified, while others were different. For example, like DHS and the FBI, the experts agreed that an ability to characterize genetically engineered agents was needed, but they also suggested that evaluating existing protocols, such as those for DNA sequencing, to determine whether they were validated, was needed. GAO believes that this information may be helpful to DHS and the FBI as part of any future bioforensics capability gap analysis they undertake.", "Since 2010, DHS has enhanced some of its bioforensics capabilities, with FBI input, by focusing on developing methods-based capabilities while maintaining agent-based capabilities. DHS has funded research and development projects addressing areas such as genome sequencing approaches, which underpin many methods-based bioforensics capabilities. DHS is also developing an in-house reference collection for use in investigations. In addition, DHS is developing the ability to characterize unique, novel agents as well as \u201cunknowns,\u201d such as synthetic organisms. DHS projects that some enhanced capabilities will be complete in about 2025. However, in pursuing enhancements, DHS faces several challenges, including establishing a statistical framework for interpreting bioforensics analyses and associated inferences and communicating them in a court setting, as well as obtaining suitable biological agents and DNA sequences to ensure quality references for use in investigations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS\u2014in consultation with the FBI\u2014conduct a formal bioforensics capability gap analysis and update it periodically.

Further, with the advent of synthetic  biology, concerns have been raised that more virulent genetically  engineered pathogens may be created and that completely new  pathogens are being created synthetically, to be used nefariously. While  not all are convinced that such threats will result in an attack, DHS\u2019s  mission requires it to be prepared for one. Therefore, an ability to attribute  the source of a biological attack and quickly apprehend and prosecute the  perpetrator is essential to our nation\u2019s safety. However, concerns have  been raised about whether that ability has improved since the 2001 case  concerning the anthrax-contaminated letters sent through the postal  facilities to members of Congress and the media (Amerithrax), in which  attribution took several years.  DHS and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) continue to play a role not only in responding to  bioterrorism but also biocrimes, including the FBI\u2019s investigation of  multiple biocrimes involving the use of ricin\u2014one of the most poisonous,  naturally occurring substances\u2014such as a case in 2013 in which ricin  was sent to the U.S. President.", "Attribution relies on many facets of an investigation\u2014one of which is  bioforensics. In its recommended guidelines for laboratories engaged in  microbial forensic analyses, the Scientific Working Group on Microbial  Genetics and Forensics (SWGMGF) defines attribution as \u201cthe  information obtained on the identification or source of a material to the  degree that it can be ascertained.\u201d The FBI has also described attribution  as \u201cthe act of attributing, the ascribing of a crime or act of terrorism to an  actor.\u201d It requires the totality of investigative information\u2014one aspect of  which may be forensic evidence\u2014according to the FBI. However, when  using scientific analyses in an investigation, \u201cscientific attribution\u201d has  been defined as the assignment of a sample of questioned origin to a  source, or sources of known origin, to the highest possible degree of  scientific certainty\u2014while excluding origination from other sources.  Therefore, attribution to a perpetrator\u2014the ultimate goal\u2014is likely to be  supported by both traditional forensics (for example, fingerprints) and  bioforensics.", "Attribution for the 2001 anthrax case took about 9 years. On February 19,  2010, the FBI announced that that it was closing the case, having  concluded that a scientist at the United States Army Medical Research  Institute for Infectious Diseases had perpetrated the attack alone. The  scientific analyses were a key investigative lead, according to the FBI.", "However, experts have noted that U.S. bioforensics capabilities at that  time were \u201cinitially limited to detection and identification and did not  include detailed characterization and comparative analyses.\u201d Therefore,  because the case was never tried in a court of law, it is not clear whether  the scientific analyses the FBI conducted were sound enough to support  its conclusions.", "In 2008, the FBI asked the National Research Council (NRC) of the  National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review the scientific approaches  it had used to support is conclusions. NRC issued its report in 2011. NRC  found that \u201cit is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion about the  origins of the B. anthracis in the mailing based on the available scientific  evidence alone,\u201d and it also details many methodological and  organization problems in the scientific portion of the FBI\u2019s investigation.  Our prior work also revealed several gaps in the FBI\u2019s validation of a key  set of genetic assays for the 2001 investigation as well as challenges  related to characterizing microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in an  effort to identify its source\u2014which could be important in future  investigations. Specifically, we reported on the need for a statistical  framework for analyzing the results the assays generated. We also  identified challenges related to the use of signatures, or genetic markers,  and their significance in an investigation.", "Agency responsibilities changed after the 2001 anthrax attack with DHS\u2019s  establishment. Today, DHS and the FBI coordinate tasks to attribute the  source of a released biological agent\u2014while the FBI alone investigates  actual criminal acts and DOJ prosecutes alleged perpetrators. DHS\u2019s  National Bioforensics Analysis Center (NBFAC)\u2014a dedicated  bioforensics laboratory\u2014is responsible for analyzing evidentiary samples  in a bioforensics investigation.", "In addition, capabilities that could enhance bioforensics continue to  evolve. The Bioforensics Research and Development (R&D) program  supports both customers within DHS (for example, Customs and Border  Patrol) as well as other agencies, including the FBI, and collaborates with  federal and international partners. DHS has funded R&D of new  technologies and associated processes that are intended to achieve a  range of homeland security goals, including those for NBFAC\u2019s  bioforensics analyses for FBI casework. These include the ability to  examine biological agents and nonbiological materials submitted as  evidence to provide relevant information and intelligence that supports an  investigation. DHS also works with the FBI and others to identify potential  gaps in NBFAC\u2019s bioforensics capabilities, in an attempt to ensure that it  is prepared for FBI\u2019s casework needs.", "In this context, you asked us to evaluate issues related to the status of  DHS\u2019s and the FBI\u2019s bioforensics capabilities for attributing a biological  attack and whether those capabilities have any scientific and technical  gaps. For this report, we evaluated (1) the extent to which DHS and the  FBI have identified gaps in their bioforensics capabilities since 2010,   (2) bioforensics needs experts have identified, and (3) any actions DHS  and the FBI have taken to enhance their bioforensics capabilities,  including those for characterizing a novel synthetic biological weapon,  and any challenges they have experienced in enhancing bioforensics  capabilities.", "To determine the extent to which DHS and the FBI have identified gaps in  their bioforensics capabilities, we reviewed agency documents and  interviewed relevant agency officials about their efforts to identify such  gaps since 2010, when the Department of Justice closed the FBI\u2019s  investigation of the 2001 anthrax attack. We examined agency planning  documents, such as DHS\u2019s Strategic Plan 2015-2019 and NBFAC\u2019s  Bioforensics Roadmap for research, among others. We reviewed DHS  policy and guidance, such as DHS\u2019s Joint Requirements Integration and  Management System, which formed the basis for the criteria we used to  compare and assess the extent to which DHS had identified capability  gaps or conducted a capability gap analysis of its bioforensics  capabilities.", "To develop a list of bioforensics needs that experts have identified, we  identified capabilities that might be needed for bioforensics purposes from  a 2014 NRC publication entitled Science Needs for Microbial Forensics:  Developing Initial International Research Priorities and the 2009 National  Research and Development Strategy for Microbial Forensics from the  National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). We extracted potential  capability needs from these publications. We grouped the remaining  bioforensics capability needs into three broad areas: (1) science,   (2) technologies and methods, and (3) bioinformatics and data. We then  convened, with the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences, a  meeting of experts to discuss and update the capability needs we  identified, including identifying issues related to these needs. These  experts represented industry, academia, and government, and had  experience in, among other things, microbiology, molecular genetics, non- genetic methods, genetic engineering, bioinformatics and statistics, and  legal issues related to bioforensics.

We reviewed DHS\u2019s Broad Area Announcements (BAA)  and Open Broad Area Announcements (OBAA) from 2008 to 2016. These  are the mechanisms by which DHS solicits research to develop its  bioforensics capabilities. We obtained details on contracted external R&D  efforts. These included statistical models, standard operating procedures  (SOP), and genetic sequences from external researchers. To determine  any challenges to enhancing bioforensics capabilities, we reviewed  agency documentation, related literature, and our prior work on  bioforensics. We also interviewed agency officials and scientists, and  obtained the opinions of experts in the United Kingdom, which  collaborates with DHS and the FBI on bioforensics-related issues, as well  as those in the United States, including those at our expert meeting.

Instead, they said the focus should be on  identifying introductions of additional virulence or genetic elements into an  organism and determining other elements that suggest that somebody  has modified the organism. There was also disagreement on which  microbes DHS and the FBI should focus.

In  addition, DHS will maintain and enhance its agent-based capabilities in  the interim\u2014which include molecular biology, virology, bacteriology and  toxinology\u2014some of which will always be necessary for certain types of  casework. Both types of capabilities will reside at NBFAC.", "The FBI agrees that such enhanced capabilities are needed. In  responding to our questions, the FBI stated that DHS\u2019s approach will  provide \u201can adaptive and agile capability to characterize unique, novel,  engineered or emerging biological agents.\u201d While agreeing with the need  to develop methods-based capabilities, however, the FBI also  acknowledged in its responses that some agent-specific capabilities will  always be needed for its investigations.", "Methods-based capabilities, according to DHS\u2019s written responses to our  questions, can potentially provide NBFAC with a broader bioforensics  capability. For example, DHS stated that genomic analysis can use  unique features as signatures to differentiate a particular isolate from  others. DHS also responded that such features could include single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rare variants, and epigenetic variation.  Further, DHS stated that genomics-based characterization\u2014including the  ability to characterize background nucleic acids that may be derived from  the environment in which the sample originated\u2014represents a unique  investigative signature that agent-based bioforensics procedures would  miss. According to experts at our meeting, signatures range from  anything that aids an investigation, to genetic signatures, syndromic  signatures, metadata, and proteins, as well as other molecular signatures.", "DHS officials told us that the use of methods-based approaches, such as  genomics, have dramatically reduced investigation timeframes. They said  that DHS can now detect and sequence not only select agents, but a  number of other biological agents (even bioengineered ones) in a fraction  of the time. What took years to complete in the 2001 Amerithrax case can  now happen much more quickly with such improvements. An FBI official  further elaborated, stating that improvements in techniques and  technologies have led to potential increases in obtainable information and  significant reductions in analysis times supporting bioterrorism  investigations.", "In contrast, based on our review, prior to 2010, we found that NBFAC\u2019s  bioforensics capabilities focused on identifying biological agents on the  CDC and USDA select agent lists. In this regard, in its written responses  to our questions, DHS stated that it has established International  Organization for Standardisation (ISO) 17025 accredited, complementary  assays such as culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and  immunoassays for most traditional bacterial, viral, and toxin agents.  However, unlike methods-based capabilities, DHS stated that these  require prior knowledge of an organism and the maintenance of agent\u2010 specific reagents. Further, agent-based capabilities do not cover a wide  array of potential threats, including genetically modified or de novo  agents, and have not been developed for known human pathogens,  especially those that may not be cultivable. Thus, according to DHS  responses, a methods-based approach will ultimately provide NBFAC  with capabilities not only for analyzing challenging samples but also with  a broader, more comprehensive bioforensics capability for characterizing  unique, engineered, or emerging biological agents.", "Table 2 shows these two types of capabilities and the types of analyses  they could be used to perform on evidentiary samples. For example,  bacteriology involves culturing and deriving phenotypic information on an  agent to identify and characterize it.", "However, toxinology, another agent-based capability, could involve  identifying and characterizing protein toxins such as ricin using an  immunoassay\u2014such as ELISA, an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant  assay. In addition, analytical chemistry, a methods-based capability,  could be used to characterize toxins by using mass spectrometry, which  also supports proteomics analysis. That is, both types of capability could  be involved in analyzing toxins. According to DHS responses to our  questions, use of each of its mass spectrometry methods function  independently and provide complementary information to confirm results  derived from immunoassays and biological activity assays for protein  toxins. Electron microscopy\u2014a methods-based capability\u2014involves  nonbiological analysis of evidence samples. For example, it could provide  elemental analysis of an agent.

Such  casework has involved the FBI\u2019s investigation of multiple biocrimes  involving the use of ricin, including a case in 2013 in which ricin was sent  to the U.S. President. NBFAC analyzed some of the samples in that case,  according to the FBI\u2019s responses to our questions.", "FBI casework carried out by NBFAC involves the FBI\u2019s transporting  evidentiary samples to NBFAC, which (1) develops a sample analysis  plan (which could involve traditional as well as bioforensics analyses) for  FBI approval, (2) conducts analyses, and (3) reports the results to law  enforcement, which uses them to inform the bioforensics investigation.", "Based on our review, for prosecution in a case involving ricin, the  scientific evidence may need to establish that the toxin is present in an  evidentiary sample. We found that a combination of analytical  capabilities may be used to confirm this, with each detecting a specific  target. For example, to confirm the presence of ricin in a sample, antibody  tests, such as ELISA, and mass spectrometry can be used for detecting  the presence of ricin, and examining the protein, respectively. Added to  them can be cell-free translation assays, another type of antibody test,  which also detects ricin. We also found that NBFAC\u2019s capabilities for  analyzing ricin toxins initially  included all the independent capabilities  above, with the exception of an accredited mass spectrometry capability  for characterizing ricin and other toxins. Based on our review, we found  that NBFAC had contracted with a laboratory to examine protein toxins by  mass spectrometry when it did not yet have that capability. Doing so,  according to their responses, resulted in a 2\u20143 day delay, and the  laboratory was also not accredited under ISO 17025. As a result, the FBI  further responded that it requested that DHS develop an in-house ISO  17025 accredited toxin analysis capability at NBFAC. The FBI provided  the equipment and funding for this transition to NBFAC.", "Enhancing Genomics and Proteomics Is a Long-Term Effort:  According to a DHS official, DHS is continuing to enhance both genomics  and proteomics capabilities, which is expected to provide a  complementary capability that will link proteomic analysis to  metagenomics analysis of complex samples, thereby providing additional  information about an agent. Further, according to this official, genomics  and mass spectrometry will support developing metagenomics and  proteomics. Based on our review, some of the ways in which  metagenomics capabilities may be used are as follows:", "Metagenomics:  It allows sampling of the genomes of microbes  without culturing them; rather, the DNA is directly isolated from the  sample before genome sequencing. A DHS official stated that DHS  plans to provide comprehensive metagenomics analysis of complex  evidentiary samples. These types of samples may contain both  microbial and human DNA as well as mixtures that derive from  possible processing steps (growth media, etc.), which could provide  links to a possible source.", "In the context of metagenomics, according to a DHS official, \u201ccomplex  samples may be from any environment and can be mixtures of many  types of organisms. The simplest of metagenomics samples may be  viruses in the tissue culture which contains the genomes of two  organisms, the cell line, and the virus. The most complex  metagenomic samples are from soil samples. Soil samples may  contain an organism of interest, at low concentration, but also will  likely have DNA and other biological materials from things such as  plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and viruses. The ability for the forensic  laboratory to collect metagenomic data and analyze it relies on the  development of tools for metagenomics.\u201d In this regard, according to  an expert who we contacted, metagenomics or the evaluation of  environmental samples for genetic information is a task that may not  give DHS the returns from its investment. It is a very time consuming  technique and should probably be left to academia and/or industry.  Once these methods are developed, DHS would be able to apply the  most applicable techniques, according to this expert.", "Figure 3 illustrates the possible composition of a complex sample.", "Metagenomics analysis of a complex sample could reveal the  presence of DNA and other types of material at different percentages,  including eukaryotic nucleic acids. However, because evaluating  metagenomic sequence data is based on relative abundances, large  amounts of data may be generated. Interpreting these data and their  meaning in terms of an agent\u2019s source will be necessary.", "Based on our review, some of the ways in which proteomics capabilities  may be used are as follows:", "Proteomics:  Proteomics is the study of proteomes. A proteome is a  set of proteins produced in an organism, system, or biological  context. In response to our questions, DHS advised us that it plans  to establish a proteomics capability for NBFAC sometime in the future.  Mass spectrometry is being used for proteomics analysis and is able  to provide information indicative of a particular protein.", "While proteomics does not replace genomic analysis, it may provide  additional information if the microbial DNA is too damaged for  analysis, according to an expert who attended our April meeting. In  addition, according to this expert, there are differences in microbes  between those naturally occurring and those grown in laboratories,  including differences in growth patterns. Proteins express themselves  based on different food sources. Consequently, according to this  expert, analyzing the microbes to determine the growth medium used  could be useful for bioforensics. Further, protein profiles have the  potential to provide information on the environment that the  microorganism has experienced. For example, cultivation might  provide information about the skills of the people who grew the  organisms. Thus, proteomics provides a different level of  discrimination from that of genomics. Finally, according to another  expert who we contacted, proteomics analysis should become a  valuable tool for bioforensics and may rival genetic information when  methods have matured.", "Based on DHS\u2019s responses to our questions, achieving a genomics and  proteomics capability will also require (1) a bioinformatics and a statistical  framework for inference and analysis of unknowns in microbial isolates,  and (2) significantly expanded genome databases and an understanding  of the underlying determinants of various pathogenic traits. DHS  responded that both of these are currently funding priorities. In this  regard, DHS stated that NBFAC continues to expand a major genomics  capability that includes multiple, complementary sequencing platforms and advanced bioinformatics within high-performance computing  environment. In its responses, DHS termed this approach as \u201cagent- agnostic\u201d as the analytical procedures require no knowledge of which  agent might be present in a sample. However, while DHS also stated that  it provides confidence estimates for aspects of its genome sequencing  and continues its incremental development of its genomics capability, it  also acknowledges the need for statistical frameworks. For example, it  stated that \u201cthe issues regarding statistical uncertainty require the  development of statistical frameworks to ensure that attribution signatures  are clearly defined and understood; that there is standardization,  validation and verification of the signatures; that relevant source  populations are fully characterized and understood; the limitations of  measurement tools are known, and the statistical methods being used are  appropriate for the signatures data.\u201d Finally, DHS stated in its response to  our questions, that understanding and communicating of the uncertainty  is of particular significance when using metagenomics and proteomics on  complex sample types.", "Other experts we interviewed also agreed that there is a need for more  flexible bioforensics capabilities. For example, an expert from our meeting  stated that currently, characterizing an agent is achieved by using  sequence data. Learning what can be exploited for this purpose is in its  early stages. In addition, a U.K. official we interviewed said that while a  priority list of organisms will still be needed for responding to emerging  pathogens and diseases or synthetic biological agents, now a more  agnostic or \u201chorizon spanning approach\u201d will be used. Nevertheless, not  all experts were in agreement that DHS should pursue metagenomics for  bioforensics purposes, at least not in the short-term. For example, in a  2016 independent assessment of DHS Bioforensics R&D program,  reviewers recommended a \u201cmore measured investment\u201d in metagenomics  and expressed doubt that an operational metagenomics capability was  likely to be available at NBFAC in 5 years. Instead, they suggested that  DHS take a more proactive investment stance by following developments  in the field that were occurring elsewhere.", "Completion of Capability Enhancements:   Based on our review of the  roadmaps that DHS provided to us regarding the bioforensics  enhancements, DHS estimates that most of the R&D tasks associated  with capability enhancements will be completed by 2025 or later, with  some exceptions. For example, in July 2016, a DHS official indicated that  DHS\u2019s new mass spectrometry casework capability may be available after  it has been accredited under ISO 17025 over the next 12 months (in  2017). In addition, DHS has a 3-5 year focus for developing  metagenomics so that it can be used on casework. Completion of more  advanced enhancements will likely extend beyond 2025, according to  DHS responses to our questions, such as for genomics and proteomics,  areas that are evolving. Activities include establishing (1) integrated  processes within metagenomics analyses to facilitate high resolution  characterization of all agents and nucleic acids in complex samples; (2) a  bioinformatic and statistical framework for phenotypic inference and  analysis of \u201cunknown unknown\u201d microbial isolates; and (3) increased  capabilities to support large-scale proteomic analysis integrated with  inferential analyses.

In  this regard, NBFAC has developed a genomics capability that DHS  asserts can be used to infer genetic engineering from DNA sequencing  and protein sequences. Genetic engineering involves inserting a foreign  sequence of genetic codes into an existing sequence of genetic codes in  a target organism with a view to altering some of its functions. DHS states  it can identify genetic modifications by screening against genes of interest  (for example, virulence factors or antibiotic resistance genes), comparing  genome alignments, and comparing regions with unusual sequence  composition to those typically found in nature.", "In the past, restriction enzymes have been used to cut DNA and insert  specific genes from a different organism to produce a desired effect (for  example, producing human insulin using bacterial cells), which results in  \u201cscarring\u201d at the restriction sites. Genome characterization and analysis  according to DHS\u2019s and the FBI\u2019s responses to our questions,  respectively, would be able to detect such scarring. However, gene  editing techniques are evolving and may be harder to detect. Clustered,  regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas-9\u2014is now  available to researchers. It engineers microbes by inserting genes,  although unlike previous methods the restriction sites may not be evident,  and the enzymes used will not cause scarring. Figure 4 is a simple  illustration of genetic engineering using restriction enzymes.", "Experts from our meeting, as well as other experts we interviewed,  indicated that identifying  genetic engineering could be approached by  determining an agents\u2019 virulence and then using capabilities such as  mass spectrometry to identify if elements exist that suggest modification.  Nevertheless, it was thought that a genetically engineered agent would  have some parts that remain unchanged, which would help to determine  its characteristics. For example, according to an expert at our meeting,  the focus should be on (1) identifying those introductions of additional  virulence or genetic elements into an organism, which can be done fairly  quickly, and then determining if there are other elements that suggest  somebody has modified the organism and (2) using methods like mass  spectrometry, microscopy, and other methods that can identify the means  of production or culture and dissemination or delivery of the organism. In  addition, according to a U.K. expert we interviewed, the core part of the  genome in an engineered agent would not be changed, and it also must  reproduce and metabolize. If it is an engineered virus, it would have some  similarities to other viruses, such as in how it attaches itself to a cell to  propagate its genome. So within its genome some signatures would be  available for comparison. Further, this expert stated that even if the  organism was a synthetic one and CRISPR Cas-9 had been used, he  would still look to see whether any scarring was present (see figure 4).", "Regarding synthetic agents, DHS asserts that they can be analyzed  similarly to those that are genetically engineered, with the addition of  NBFAC\u2019s inferential analysis capability, whose analysis will provide clues  to the functionality of a synthetic agent. DHS is developing a capability  that will allow NBFAC to characterize unique, novel agents, \u201cunknowns\u201d  (emerging or synthetic organisms) and \u201cunknown, unknowns\u201d (de novo  synthetic organisms). However, achieving this capability will also require  a bioinformatics and a statistical framework for inference and analysis of  unknowns in microbial isolates and expanded genome databases,  according to DHS.

According to a U.K. official we interviewed, the level of  uncertainty in matching microbes cannot be quantified, and attribution  depends on a reference set, which is incomplete for microbes. It could be  concluded that the microbe in question has the same DNA as that of a  microbe in the reference database, but not with certainty that it would not  match another microbe that is not in the reference database. Because of  the limits of using one approach, it is important to also use traditional  forensics to build an evidence base. In court, traditional forensics, in  addition to expert testimony on bioforensics, would therefore be used for  attribution.", "Statistical frameworks and communicating  results:  As we reported in  2014, a statistical framework allows for statistically meaningful  comparative analyses; it is a set of concepts and organizing principles  that support the compilation and presentation of a set of statistics.  Experts at our meeting expressed the view that a gap that permeates  science, capabilities, and bioinformatics is the lack of a formulation or  framework for expressing confidence in genomics results as well as  similar challenges with non-genetic results. This is especially true with  mixed, metagenomics samples. Further, how to combine or communicate  uncertainties and error rates associated with the analytical and collection  processes needs greater clarity, according to the experts at our meeting.  They stated that to have a more robust statistical foundation, it is critical  to do enough experiments to assess the various contributions of these  sources of variability. NBFAC is moving into the realm of metagenomics,  which has problems with the statistical unknowns associated with it.  Metagenomic samples may contain mixtures as we stated previously. In  this regard, these experts stated that the problem of mixtures is an  opportunity for statistical methods to improve the results for different kinds  of evidence. For example, is the evidence confirmatory; is it consistent  with what\u2019s in the database, and what are some possible alternatives that  could have given rise to the evidence? In addition, these experts stated  that challenges in a bioforensics context include the need for a  quantitative measure for genetics, proteomics, or other methods so that  an informed decision can be made.", "Communicating results using statistical probabilities may not always be  acceptable by courts, despite the need for statistical frameworks to assist  in interpreting bioforensics analyses. Even if accepted, such statistical  information may not be understood. This issue is important because  statistics could play a large part in some types of analyses. For example,  using statistics when communicating the results of human DNA analysis  are generally accepted by courts in the United States. For interpretation  of bioforensic results, according to the experts at our meeting, the  question should be: What is the confidence you have achieved with the  data or information that you have? How that confidence is communicated  is important. It is forensic evidence, a piece of the puzzle. It adds value, but the confidence for it may be low, whereas the confidence for some  other evidence may be high. The level of uncertainty for that result should  also be indicated. Thus, bioforensic analyses of microbial DNA, and its  associated statistical elements, may have to overcome many obstacles  before they reach a similar level of acceptance in a U.S. federal court.", "Other experts have acknowledged such challenges. For example,  regarding the U.S. legal system, issues may arise when new methods are  applied for the first time in bioforensics that have not undergone the depth  of scrutiny undergone by traditional forensic techniques. Also, reference  databases used for comparisons take time to develop. Our interviews  with U.K. scientists and government officials provided some insights into  issues associated with human DNA analysis results, which are generally  accepted by courts and that could have implications for bioforensics in  both the United Kingdom and the United States. For example, regarding  the communication of probability data, according to a U.K. official we  interviewed, while academics say there is some set level of probability to  achieve \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the court is concerned with the  baseline probability. However, this official stated that human DNA is the  only science in which the baseline probability data is considered  incontrovertible. Further, he said that in almost every other science, the  legal system would want assurances from expert witnesses regarding the  analysis results\u2014not the numerical scientific results themselves.", "In light of the discussion above, it is not clear how long it will take for the  results of metagenomics and proteomics analyses to be acceptable to  courts. Nevertheless, what is clear is that the ability to quantify statistical  uncertainty will require the use of comprehensive databases that contain  characteristics of signatures and information on the variations in the  population of the agent in question."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Evolving Threat Landscape Raises Questions about the Bioforensics Capabilities That Will Be Needed", "paragraphs": ["A long-term challenge facing NBFAC, according to DHS\u2019s responses to  our questions, is the increasingly complex biological threat landscape:  New infectious disease agents emerge every year, and advances in  genetic engineering and \u201cdo it yourself\u201d biology methods make the  nefarious use of enhanced and biological agents a possibility. DHS  further responded that as a result NBFAC must regularly establish new  methods and assays to support bioforensics casework that may involve  future threats. Further, we found it is still challenging to distinguish  between a natural and a deliberately released organism. However,  according to the experts at our meeting, when using \u201cnatural,\u201d \u201caccidental\u201d  and \u201cdeliberate,\u201d the issue could be more to do with the means by which  an agent is used, or about the characteristics of the agent itself.  Determining intent is likely to rely on information beyond the science  alone. In addition, while epidemiologic tools determine whether something  is unusual, what is also needed is a defined and validated tool that will  determine whether a microbe is unusual, made by humans, cultured, or  engineered.", "Although DHS is developing capabilities to detect manipulated agents, it  faces several challenges related to the perceived potential for the creation  of agents that could cause harm accidentally or intentionally. To identify  and characterize novel synthetic agents, these challenges go beyond  identifying changes in an agent\u2019s genomics (such as its antibiotic  resistance). DHS, in its responses to our questions, stated that identifying  more complex traits is more difficult because of the current scientific  understanding of how these processes work at the molecular level. DHS  also responded that both genetic engineering and NBFAC\u2019s ability to infer  its intended effects require a deeper understanding of the physiology of  the biological agent as well as its interaction with a human host. Concerns  have also been raised about the potential for gain of function research to  result in manipulation of microbial agents with the potential for causing  harm. Such manipulations could involve, for example, agents or toxins  in which harmful consequences have been enhanced, such as making  them antibiotic resistant, more virulent, or more transmissible to  humans. The use of CRISPR Cas-9 also raises other issues because it  may be more difficult to detect than were previous gene editing approaches. However, not all agree that the risk of possible misuses of  biology is significant.", "Regarding the use of genetically engineered agents to cause harm and  the likelihood  of this becoming a problem, we found differences in the  views of the experts we spoke to both here and in the United Kingdom.  Some said that it is difficult to create new pathogens so the use of  naturally-occurring microbes is of the greatest concern. While  acknowledging there are many technically possible misuses of biology,  they concluded that it is far more likely that minor modifications would be  made to existing organisms rather than the creation of new ones.", "According to an expert we contacted, developing a new microbe with  novel pathogenic characteristics or antibiotic resistance significantly more  difficult than introducing these characteristics by gene manipulation.  Thus, one of the challenges DHS faces is to consider the risks in relation  to not only the bioforensics capabilities it needs but also its strategy for  addressing current and potential threats."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DHS has identified some bioforensics capability gaps since 2010 using an  informal, undocumented process but has not systematically identified the  gaps or performed a bioforensics capability gap analysis.

In its  response, DHS described actions it plans to take to address the  recommendation. Specifically, according to DHS, S&T's Homeland  Security Advanced Research and Projects Agency's  Chemical and  Biological Defense (CBD) Division has initiated a formal, well- documented capability analysis of its Bioforensics R&D program. Further,  DHS stated that CBD will leverage this analysis to conduct a parallel  capability analysis of the Chemical Forensics and Attribution program that  addresses similar analytical and attribution needs for chemical threat  agents. DHS states that the CBD Division staff has prepared newly  updated Operational Requirements Documents and Strategic Plans  (Fiscal Years 2017-2021) for both programs, although we have not  reviewed these documents. According to DHS, the CBD Division initially  identified and compiled a number of bioforensics capability needs from a  review of external programs and meetings with end-users, such as the  FBI, and it is identifying and grouping additional needs under three areas  (science, technology and methods, and bioinformatics and data) through  reviews of documents, such as the National Research Council, Science  Needs for Microbial Forensics, 2014, and GAO\u2019s report, Anthrax: Agency  Approaches to Validation and Statistical Analyses Could be Improved  (GAO-15-80), among others.

We examined agency  planning documents, such as DHS\u2019s Strategic Plan 2015-2019 and  NBFAC\u2019s Bioforensics Roadmap for research, among others. We  reviewed DHS policy and guidance, such as DHS\u2019s Joint Requirements  Integration and Management System, which formed the basis for the  criteria we used to compare and assess the extent to which DHS had  identified capability gaps or conducted a capability gap analysis of its  bioforensics capabilities. We also interviewed agency officials, including  those with DOD, to determine whether any gaps had been identified that  related to bioforensics and their interactions with DHS in this regard.", "We developed a list of bioforensics needs that experts had identified. To  do this, we identified capabilities that might be needed for bioforensics  purposes from a 2014 NRC publication entitled Science Needs for  Microbial Forensics: Developing Initial International Research Priorities  and the 2009 National Research and Development Strategy for Microbial  Forensics from the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).  We excluded capability needs in the literature that were not related to  science and technology development as these would have been beyond  our scope. We grouped the remaining capability needs into three broad  areas: (1) science, (2) technologies and methods, and (3) bioinformatics  and data. We then convened, with the assistance of the National  Academy of Sciences (NAS), a 2-day meeting of 16 experts to discuss  and update the capability needs we identified, including identifying issues  related to these needs. To identify the experts appropriate for the  meeting, we worked iteratively with NAS staff to identify and review  biographical information and relevant qualifications of experts, as well as  factors such as representation from academia, industry, and expertise in  a range of areas. The Board on Life Sciences of NAS solicited  nominations for the expert panel from its extensive contacts in the  microbial forensics area. From this initial list, NAS selected experts based  on their knowledge and expertise in forensics, microbiology, molecular  genetics, non-genetic methods, genetic engineering, bioinformatics,  statistics, and legal issues related to bioforensics. Once we came to  agreement with NAS on the final list of 16 experts for the meeting, these  experts were evaluated for any conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest  was considered to be any current financial or other interest that might  conflict with the service of an individual because it (1) could impair  objectivity and (2) could create an unfair competitive advantage for any  person or organization. We discussed internally all potential conflicts. The  experts were determined to be free of conflicts of interest, and the group  as a whole was judged to have no inappropriate biases. See appendix III  for a list of the experts. The meeting was recorded and transcribed to  ensure that we accurately captured the experts\u2019 statements, and we  reviewed and analyzed the transcripts as a source of evidence. We  developed the session topics based on our researchable objectives and  issues that were identified in our audit work. The session topics were  gaps in the science underpinning bioforensics capabilities, gaps in  capabilities (technologies) and methods for attribution, and gaps in  bioinformatics, data and statistical Interpretation  of bioforensics. We  subsequently obtained their comments on the list of capability needs  identified during the April 2016 meeting to update and amend it based on  their input.", "To determine the actions DHS and the FBI had taken to enhance their  bioforensics capabilities since 2010 and any challenges they  encountered, we reviewed agency documents, including planning  documents and research and development (R&D) efforts. We also  examined DHS\u2019s actions to enhance NBFAC\u2019s capabilities for the long  term as well as for the FBI\u2019s casework. We reviewed DHS\u2019s Broad Area  Announcements (BAA) and Open Broad Area Announcements (OBAA)  from 2008 to 2016. These are the mechanisms by which DHS solicits  research to develop its bioforensics capabilities. We obtained details on  contracted external R&D efforts. Deliverables included statistical models,  SOPs, and genetic sequences from external researchers. To determine  any challenges to enhancing bioforensics capabilities, we reviewed  agency documentation, including planning and contract documentation,  related literature, and our prior work on bioforensics. We interviewed  agency officials and scientists, including those at DHS, DOD, and the FBI  and obtained the opinions of experts in the United Kingdom, which  collaborates with DHS and the FBI on bioforensics-related issues, as well  as those in the United States regarding bioforensics-related challenges.
