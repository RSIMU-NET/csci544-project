GAO was asked to evaluate DOD's review process for MYP candidates; examine MYP program outcomes; identify the impact of changes to MYP savings threshold guidance, and determine how much DOD validates MYP performance.

Although the law has clear requirements for stable, low risk programs with realistic cost and savings estimates, lack of guidance and a rigorous process is not achieving this. It is difficult to precisely determine the impact of multiyear contracting on procurement costs. GAO studies of three recent MYPs identified unit cost growth ranging from 10 to 30 percent compared to original estimates, due to changes in labor and material costs, requirements and funding, and other factors. In some cases, actual MYP costs were higher than estimates for annual contracts. Although annual contracts also have unit cost growth, it is arguably more problematic for MYP's because of the up-front investments and the government's exposure to risk over multiple years. MYP savings were on average higher before changes in law called for \"substantial savings\" rather than a specific quantitative standard. Other factors--lower quantities of modern systems procured, stricter cancellation liability allowances, and contraction in the defense industrial base--may have also impacted savings by lessening opportunities for more efficient purchases, a key attribute of MYPs. DOD does not track multiyear results against original expectations and makes little effort to validate if actual savings were achieved. GAO's case studies indicate that evaluating actual MYP results provides valuable information on the veracity of original estimates in the justification packages, the impacts on costs and risks from internal and external events, and lessons learned that can be used to improve future multiyear candidates and savings opportunities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the past 25 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) has used  multiyear contracts to procure thousands of major weapon systems,  investing about $10 billion annually in recent years.

When used appropriately, multiyear contracting  can save money compared to a series of annual contracts by allowing  more economic procurement from suppliers and more efficient  production. Multiyear contracting can also entail some risks of substantial  losses if a program is reduced or a contract is cancelled early and can limit  DOD\u2019s and the Congress\u2019 future budget flexibility. To identify multiyear  candidates that demonstrate sufficient benefits and manageable risks, the  law requires certain criteria be met before an agency can enter into a  multiyear contract.", "During discussions on the President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2007,  committee members were concerned about the amount of projected  savings realized on multiyear contracts and had questions about the DOD\u2019s  management and oversight of programs with multiyear contracts.

We examined DOD historical budgetary and contractual  records to compile and summarize data on prior and current multiyear  programs. We looked in more detail at nine major programs representing  each military department: three had completed multiyear contracts, two  were beginning multiyear contracts, and four programs were just recently  authorized by the Congress. Several programs have been approved for  more than one multiyear contract and, collectively, these programs  comprised almost one-third of approvals granted since 1996. We  researched the legislative history on the required savings criterion and  DOD\u2019s efforts to interpret and apply it.

It is an exception to the full-funding policy that requires the entire  procurement cost of a weapon or piece of equipment to be funded in the  year in which the item is procured. Under a multiyear procurement, DOD  can contract for up to 5 years of quantities, although funding is still  appropriated on an annual basis.", "Multiyear procurement can potentially save money and improve the  defense industrial base by permitting the more efficient use of a  contractor\u2019s resources. Multiyear contracts are expected to achieve lower  unit costs compared to annual contracts through one or more of the  following sources: (1) purchase of parts and materials in economic order  quantities (EOQ), (2) improved production processes and efficiencies, (3)  better utilized industrial facilities, (4) limited engineering changes due to  design stability during the multiyear period, and (5) cost avoidance by  reducing the burden of placing and administering annual contracts.  Multiyear procurement also offers opportunities to enhance the industrial  base by providing defense contractors a longer and more stable time  horizon for planning and investing in production and by attracting  subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers. However, multiyear procurement  also entails certain risks that must be balanced against potential benefits,  such as the increased costs to the government should the multiyear  contract be changed or canceled and decreased annual budget flexibility  for the program and across DOD\u2019s portfolio of weapon systems.  Additionally, multiyear contracts often require greater budgetary authority  in the earlier years of the procurement to economically buy parts and  materials for multiple years of production than under a series of annual  buys.", "Although DOD had been entering into multiyear contracts on a limited  basis prior to the 1980s, the Department of Defense Authorization Act,  1982, codified the authority for DOD to procure on a multiyear basis  major weapon systems that meet certain criteria. Since that time, DOD has  annually submitted various weapon systems as multiyear procurement  candidates for congressional authorization. Over the past 25 years,  Congress has authorized the use of multiyear procurement for  approximately 140 acquisition programs, including some systems  approved more than once. Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code,  governs the use of multiyear contracting authority for the procurement of  property by DOD. It specifies six statutory requirements, or criteria, that  an acquisition program is expected to meet in order to be considered for  multiyear contracting. These criteria are listed in table 1 below.", "Expected costs to be avoided should be sufficient to offset the added risk  the government assumes with a multiyear contract in the form of a  cancellation liability, decreased flexibility in future funding decisions and  any erroneous assumptions in the estimates. Immature, volatile programs  and those at risk of future changes should not be proposed as MYP  candidates because such instability puts the savings attributed to  efficiencies of production and EOQ buying at risk. The multiyear approach  should be reserved for established production operations and low risk  technology.", "In submitting candidates for multiyear authorization by the Congress, the  heads of the respective military departments vouch that each program  complies with the criteria in table 1. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense  is required to certify to Congress that the current future years defense  program fully funds the support costs associated with the multiyear  contract and that planned production will not be less than the minimum  economic rates given the existing tooling and facilities. Multiyear  contracts historically account for a substantial share of the defense  procurement dollar. Figure 1 shows that DOD has budgeted about $10  million annually for multiyear contracts since fiscal year 2000, accounting  for more than 13 percent of DOD\u2019s total budget for procurement over this  time frame. Over the period, the general trend shows an increase in total  defense procurement, but multiyear obligations holding fairly steady,  resulting in a downward trend of the percentage obligated on multiyear  contracts.

Multiyear costs and savings estimates were not completed in time for  submission with the fiscal year 2007 defense budget. The Air Force later  submitted the completed MYP justification package with estimated total  multiyear costs of $8.7 billion and projected savings of $235 million, or 2.6  percent, compared to estimated annual contracts. Multiyear proponents  cited the projected total dollar savings as substantial and believed there  was little risk that the remaining 60 aircraft would not be procured. On the  other hand, multiyear critics argued that the low percent of savings  predicted, the short time frame for accruing savings, and the program\u2019s  relatively unstable past made it an inappropriate multiyear candidate.", "In prior work, we determined that the restructured F-22A program was  underfunded and questioned whether the proposed multiyear strategy met  statutory criteria. We identified concerns about savings, funding,  requirements, and design stability that we believed needed to be addressed  before the multiyear plan could be justified. For example, the Air Force  did not fully fund the multiyear proposal and asked for incremental  funding. Also, a major development program to add new capabilities and  improve reliability of the F-22A has begun; these efforts could result in  future design modifications which may require retrofit onto aircraft  purchased under the multiyear contract. We also noted that having only a  3-year period of performance at the end of production limited the ability to  achieve savings normally expected under multiyear authority such as EOQ  buys and cost reduction initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiency.", "To provide for EOQ buys, Congress subsequently added $210 million to  the F-22A advance procurement budget. In authorizing a multiyear  contract for the F-22A, Congress specified certain conditions to be met  and prohibited the use of incremental funding. The Secretary of Defense  was required to certify that all statutory requirements have been met,  including the determination that the contract will result in substantial  savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through  annual contracts. DOD submitted its certifications to the Congress in June  2007 and subsequently awarded the F-22A multiyear contract in August  2007.

The justification package also includes short statements about how  programs are believed to meet each of the six statutory criteria. Weapon  system acquisition program officials prepare the package for subsequent  reviews by military service acquisition commands, service headquarters  offices, and OSD offices responsible for program policy and budget  oversight. Approved candidates are submitted to the Congress for  authorization.", "We discussed DOD\u2019s justification process, multiyear contracting policies,  and management practices with OSD and military service officials at each  organizational level. We collected historical and budget data on approved  multiyear programs since fiscal year 1982 and tracked more recent  multiyear candidates through the budget process. We specifically  examined nine major programs representing each military department:  three had completed multiyear contracts, two were beginning multiyear  contracts, and four programs were just recently authorized by the  Congress. Several programs have been approved for more than one  multiyear contract and, collectively, these programs accounted for 17 of  the 59 approvals granted since 1996.", "We found that DOD provides little in the way of supplemental guidance to  operationalize the statutory criteria by amplifying terms such as  \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201csubstantial,\u201d and \u201cstable\u201d and quantifying where possible to  provide more objectivity and rigor to the multiyear review process.  Guidance for the most part restates the statutory criteria and establishes  formats for submitting budget justification materials, but does not provide  much elucidation for interpreting and applying the criteria and  establishing internal evidence standards for demonstrating criteria are  met. From our review of justification packages and our discussions with  DOD officials responsible for generating and reviewing multiyear  justification packages, we determined that reviewers interpret and apply  criteria differently and that the methods and data used to compute  contract costs and savings and providing evidence to document program  stability vary in quality and sophistication.", "For example, officials we talked to at all levels of the review process had  different ideas and perspectives on what constituted substantial savings  when applying the criterion. An official in the Navy, for example, expected  programs to project at least 10 percent savings, but would consider  candidates under that level. Some Army officials wanted to see 10 percent  savings or hundreds of millions of dollars. An OSD official applied a \u201crule  of thumb\u201d of 4 to 5 percent. He said that programs under that amount  would typically be more closely evaluated to ensure they were viable, but  that programs over that amount would generally receive a less detailed  check of reasonableness and to ensure paperwork requirements were met.  An Air Force official told us that a 5 percent savings level should be  considered the floor for a genuinely viable candidate for multiyear and a  10 percent savings level achievable, although he cautioned that recent  statutory changes to eligible cancellation ceiling costs will likely have a  negative impact on future multiyear savings.", "Further, review of the justification packages for the F-22A and the V-22,  both submitted in the same fiscal year for approval, indicated differences  in how the design stability criterion was applied. Initial operational  capability, an important milestone for stability, had been declared 2 years  prior to requesting multiyear authority on the F-22A, while initial  operational capabilities for both variants of the V-22 are not scheduled to  be achieved until after multiyear approval was granted, at least 2 years  later for the Navy\u2019s variant.", "Comparing multiyear savings and judging reasonableness of the estimates  is complicated because the techniques and data used to estimate cost  savings can vary substantially in form, sophistication, and detail. For  example, for its first multiyear contract proposal on the C-17A, the Air  Force simply used the prime contractor\u2019s offer to save 5.5 percent, a figure  that was considered a \u201cmanagement challenge\u201d the contractor believed it  could meet. We found other instances where it was unclear what data was  used in formulating the savings estimates. For example, the Army\u2019s budget  justifications for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Abrams Tank estimated  savings at 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively, and provided very  sketchy details to document how the savings estimates were derived and  compliance with the stability criteria.", "On the other hand, some analyses can be very involved, provide a range of  estimated savings, and use independent third parties to validate data. For  example, the Navy\u2019s F-18E/F cost estimates and methodologies were  independently verified by OSD\u2019s Cost Analysis Improvement Group. For  the F-22A multiyear proposal, two defense research centers developed  contract costs and savings estimates. Several very different methodologies  were employed, including cost improvement curves based on historical  actual production costs, production cost estimate models for single year  contracts less reductions for expected savings, and summation of savings  initiatives from the prime and subcontractors. These studies produced a  wide range of potential savings, from $235 million to $643 million.", "Also, cost and savings estimates in general may be subject to biases and  other factors that impact their fidelity and reliability. Our extensive past  body of work on DOD\u2019s major acquisitions suggests that to gain approval  and continued funding for a weapon system, the acquisition environment  encourages programs to submit overoptimistic estimates about a weapon  system\u2019s readiness for production and to underestimate its costs. Systems  therefore appear more affordable from an investment perspective and can  fit within forecasts of available funds. These circumstances invariably lead  to acquisition programs costing substantially more than originally  estimated. Furthermore, prior reports have discussed the importance of  using present value analysis to account for the time value of money when  evaluating and comparing costs of alternative annual and multiyear  contracts. The timing of government expenditures is expected to differ  with a multiyear contract expected to have relatively more up-front costs  (to fund EOQ for example) and lower costs in the outyears compared to a  series of annual contracts. Although the justification packages are  required to have a present value analysis of the savings estimates,  according to an OSD official and a defense research study, the cost savings  estimates in then-year dollars are the primary estimates used in making  cost decisions. Our review of the justification packages appear to confirm  this because the section of the multiyear exhibit highlighting the benefit to  the government contained only the then-year dollar estimate rather than  the present value estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Documentation and Record- Keeping Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Through our discussions with officials and inspection of records, we  determined that DOD\u2019s review process for the multiyear justification  budget packages does not adequately capture important information and  events to document decisions and help ensure that consistent and reliable  determinations are made regarding multiyear criteria. Once approved,  OSD officials stated few records are kept on multiyear programs regarding  how they determined whether multiyear candidates met the six statutory  criteria. According to OSD and service officials, much of the discussion on  a program proposed for multiyear should have already taken place during  regular executive-level reviews of major weapon systems and been agreed  upon before the multiyear justification package is reviewed for submission  in the budget request. Review of the justification package then essentially  becomes a paperwork formality rarely involving any surprises. Also, we  found programs can be proposed \u201cout of cycle\u201d with the President\u2019s  Budget submission\u2014as in the case of the F-22A, and may not be included  in the budget details that could affect the review path the multiyear  candidate takes to obtain approval.

The 10 percent figure became a savings  benchmark for decision-makers in the early 1980s when judging the merits  of candidate programs. In the late 1980s, this benchmark became a  threshold requirement for many candidate programs as Congress began  stipulating a 10 to 12 percent savings amount in annual defense  authorization acts for selected programs.", "In November 1989, Congress decided to codify the 10 percent savings  requirement and other conditions and limitations previously imposed on  an annual basis. However, a year later, that threshold was struck from the  U.S. Code, and the requirement for \u201csubstantial savings\u201d was substituted  after DOD had argued that a rigid threshold limited the potential for  savings on stable, low risk programs projecting lesser savings amounts.

On the  other hand, candidate programs approved prior to 1991 show a larger  proportion of savings of 10 percent or more.

The higher cost for modern weapon  systems and changes in required force structure has resulted in  generally smaller procurement quantities for new systems compared to  predecessor systems. Smaller quantities of systems bought under  multiyear contracts may not provide the same opportunity to achieve  savings through such mechanisms as EOQ buys of parts and materials.  Past multiyears, on the F-16 Falcon aircraft and Black Hawk  helicopters, for example, procured hundreds of systems. In contrast,  the more recent multiyear procurement of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet  procured less than half the F-16 quantity. Analysis of the data on MYP  candidate programs that we collected and summarized in table 3 below  showed that the median multiyear procurement quantity for aircraft  MYP candidate programs declined over 40 percent from the 1980s to  the present era with a concurrent decline in average savings. With  fewer aircraft procured during the multiyear period, savings from  economic buys and optimized production is typically smaller.", "Cancellation liability changes. If a multiyear contract is cancelled, the  government is liable for reimbursing the contractor for its incurred  costs up to a negotiated cancellation ceiling typically in the contract.  Until recently, DOD has been able to include both recurring and  nonrecurring costs. Multiyear contracts awarded during the past 25  years have included a cancellation liability, but the cancellation ceiling  for the C-17A multiyear contract awarded in 2002 was considered very  large with a potential liability of more than $1.5 billion. Some members  of Congress were concerned by its size and concluded that this large  liability inappropriately committed the government to a production  schedule for which funding had not been appropriated. As a result, for  the past several years Congress has limited the cancellation liability for  multiyear contracts to nonrecurring costs only. Some DOD officials  expect this change to limit savings on current and future multiyear  contracts as contractors choose not to bear financial risks previously  borne by the government. A major source of multiyear savings is the  EOQ buys, and without including these kinds of recurring costs in the  cancellation ceiling, fewer contractors may buy supplies and materials  up front in bulk to limit their risks should the multiyear contract be  cancelled early.", "Declining competition. Some DOD and defense research center  officials believe that the consolidation and contraction of the defense  industry and resulting decline in competition and contraction among  vendors and suppliers, make it harder to wring savings from EOQ buys.  For example, an OSD official stated that because the F-22A was  originally designed well over a decade ago, it is now experiencing  diminishing manufacturing sources on many components as well as  parts and equipment obsolescence.

Improving guidance, ensuring decisions are informed by knowledge, and  maintaining better records are critical needs, as well as important tools for  retaining corporate memory given frequent turnover of personnel at all  levels of the justification review process. It is not possible to calculate  accurately the cost to taxpayers that has resulted from these conditions,  but the lack of a disciplined and rigorous process that demands knowledge  about stability and costs provides potential for significant waste of  taxpayer dollars.", "Furthermore, DOD does not track and evaluate actual performance on  multiyear contracts for major DOD weapon systems. Once a contract is  awarded for a multiyear program, little effort is made to collect data and  assess actual results to compare performance against original  expectations and to validate savings and other benefits achieved.
