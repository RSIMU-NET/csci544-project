If an agency waits to consult with relevant congressional stakeholders until a strategic plan has been substantially drafted and fully vetted within the executive branch, it foregoes important opportunities to learn about and address early on specific concerns that will be critical to successful implementation. The committee, therefore, emphasized that consultations should take place during the development of a strategic plan, not after. In addition, the requirement for consultations at least once every 2 years is intended to ensure that each Congress has input on agency goals, objectives, strategies, and performance measures.

For example, a 2005 DHS OIG report found that USCIS\u2019s ability  to annually process more than 7 million benefit applications has been  hindered by inefficient, paper-based processes, resulting in a backlog that  peaked in 2004 at more than 3.8 million cases.

For example, several committees held at least six  hearings related to USCIS\u2019s transformation plan from 2007 to 2011,  including appropriations hearings in 2008 and 2010 during which  committee members expressed concerns about USCIS not meeting its  goals for timely processing of applications and implementing its  transformation plan. In February 2011, the Ranking Member of the  Senate Committee on the Judiciary\u2014which has jurisdiction over  immigration issues\u2014wrote a letter to the Director of USCIS expressing  concern over reported delays and cost increases for completing the  transformation and requested a briefing on the effort. In addition, in  response to congressional requests, we have reviewed aspects of  USCIS\u2019s implementation of its transformation plan. For example, in  September 2011 we reported that while USCIS had improved the quality  and efficiency of the immigration benefit administration process and  strengthened its immigration fraud detection and deterrence efforts, the  agency\u2019s efforts to modernize its benefit processing infrastructure and  business practices missed planned milestones by more than two years.  In November 2011, we reported that a lack of defined requirements, an  acquisition strategy, and associated cost parameters contributed to the  delays and noted that consistent adherence to DHS\u2019s acquisition policy  could help improve USCIS\u2019 transformation program outcomes. In  particular, we reported that USCIS was managing the program without  specific acquisition management controls, such as reliable schedules,  which detail work to be performed by both the government and its  contractor over the expected life of the program. As a result, we found  that USCIS does not have reasonable assurance that it can meet its  future milestones. We made three recommendations aimed at ensuring  that USCIS takes a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to the  development and deployment of transformation efforts to meet the  agency\u2019s goals of improved adjudications and customer services  processes.

Since fiscal year 2000, we have issued a number of reports and  testimonies, at the request of Congress, aimed at raising the level of  attention and corrective actions surrounding improper payments. Our  work has highlighted long-standing, widespread, and significant problems  with improper payments across the federal government. For example, we  reported in 2000 that the full extent of improper payments  governmentwide remained largely unknown, hampering efforts to reduce  such payments since many agencies did not attempt to identify or  estimate improper payments while others only did so for certain  programs. To help address these issues, Congress passed the  Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), which requires  executive branch agencies to (1) identify programs and activities  susceptible to significant improper payments, (2) estimate the amount of  improper payments for those programs and activities, and (3) report these  estimates along with actions taken to reduce improper payments for  programs with estimates that exceed $10 million. implementation to date.rose substantially from 2004 to 2008, the first 5 fiscal years of IPIA  implementation, we reported that this was a positive step in improving  transparency over the full magnitude of the federal government\u2019s  improper payments as more agencies and more programs reported  estimates over time (see figure 1). In addition, of the 35 agency programs  that reported estimates in each of the 5 fiscal years, 24 of them (or about  69 percent) reported reduced error rates when comparing 2008 rates to  those in 2004. However, we identified several major challenges that  remained in meeting the goals of IPIA, including that   Although reported improper payment estimates  the total estimates reported in fiscal year 2008 did not reflect the full  scope of improper payments across federal agencies; noncompliance issues with IPIA implementation existed; and agencies continued to face challenges in the design or  implementation of internal controls to identify and prevent improper  payments.", "We also noted that separate assessments by agency auditors, such as  GAO or inspectors general, would help to reliably determine the scope of  any deficiencies in, and provide a valuable independent validation of,  agencies\u2019 efforts to implement IPIA. million in annual program outlays. In the first year of IPERA  implementation, fiscal year 2011, 17 agencies reported an estimated  $115 billion in improper payments for 79 programs\u2014a decrease of about  $5 billion from revised fiscal year 2010 estimates. In addition, OMB  reported that agencies recaptured about $1.25 billion in improper  payments to contractors, vendors, and health care providers in fiscal year  2011. As we recently reported, OMB also identified improper payments as  an area covered by one of 14 interim crosscutting priority goals in the  President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2013. The particular goal is to reduce  the governmentwide improper payment rate by at least 2 percentage  points by fiscal year 2014, from 5.42 percent in 2009, and applies to all  federal programs that annually report improper payment estimates."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: Illustrative Questions to Assist Congress in Focusing Consultations on Key Issues", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that consultations provide an opportunity for  Congress to influence  1.  what results agencies should seek to achieve (long-term and annual  2.  how those results will be achieved, including how an agency\u2019s efforts  are aligned and coordinated with other related efforts (strategies and  resources);  3.  how to measure progress given the complexity of federal programs  and activities (performance measures); and  4.  how to report on results (reporting).", "Table 2 presents examples of questions that Members of Congress and  their staffs can ask on strategic plans and related performance issues\u2014 during consultations with agencies or in other venues such as hearings\u2014 to help ensure that the associated performance information meets their  needs and expectations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contact, Elizabeth Curda, Assistant Director;  Benjamin T.
