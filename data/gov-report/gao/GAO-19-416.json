GAO found that ICE did not consistently follow its policies involving veterans who were placed in removal proceedings from fiscal years 2013 through 2018. Consistent implementation of its policies would help ICE better ensure that veterans receive appropriate levels of review before they are placed in removal proceedings. Additionally, ICE has not developed a policy to identify and document all military veterans it encounters during interviews, and in cases when agents and officers do learn they have encountered a veteran, ICE does not maintain complete electronic data. Therefore, ICE does not have reasonable assurance that it is consistently implementing its policies for handling veterans' cases.", "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have policies facilitating the naturalization of noncitizen service members and veterans, and provide informational resources to noncitizen service members seeking naturalization. The number of military naturalization applications received by USCIS declined sharply from fiscal years 2017 to 2018, resulting in a decreased number of applications approved in fiscal year 2018. USCIS and DOD officials attributed this decline to several DOD policy changes that reduced the number of noncitizens joining the military .", "Citizenship status, including removal history, does not affect a veteran's eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits and services.

We  selected this timeframe because 2013 is the first year for which data from  PLAnet are available, according to ICE officials, and 2018 was the most  recent full year of data at the time of our review. For the approximately  250 veterans OPLA data indicated were placed in removal proceedings  and the 92 veterans ERO data indicated had been removed from that  population, we reviewed ICE documents about the content and structure  of PLAnet and EARM, and completed data entry and duplicate record  checks.

USCIS interviews and  naturalizes active-duty service members abroad at certain U.S.  embassies, consulates, and military installations.

As a result of this decline in applications, the number of service  members approved for naturalization also declined, from 7,303 in fiscal  year 2017 to 4,309 in fiscal year 2018.", "USCIS and DOD officials attributed the decline in military naturalization  applications to several DOD policy changes. First, DOD suspended the  MAVNI program in September 2016, which reduced the number of  noncitizens joining the military. According to DOD officials, due to  counterintelligence concerns, DOD suspended the program at the end of  fiscal year 2016 and decided not to renew the program in fiscal year  2017. Second, in October 2017, DOD issued policies expanding  background check requirements for LPR and MAVNI recruits. The  policies specify that LPRs must complete a background check and  receive a favorable military service suitability determination prior to  entering any component of the U.S. Armed Forces. According to DOD  officials, due to backlogs in the background check process, these new  recruits were delayed in beginning their service, and officials stated that it  may take DOD up to a year to complete enhanced requirements for  certain recruits. DOD officials stated that they believe background check  backlogs will decrease by the end of fiscal year 2019 and, as a result, the  number of noncitizen service members eligible to apply for naturalization  will increase. Third, in October 2017, DOD increased the amount of time  noncitizens must serve before DOD will certify their honorable service for  naturalization purposes. Under the new policy, noncitizens must  complete security screening, basic military training, and serve 180 days  for a characterization of service determination. Previously, DOD granted  that determination in as little as a few days of service.", "USCIS made several changes to its military naturalization processes in  response to or in tandem with DOD\u2019s policy changes. First, in July 2017,  USCIS determined that the completion of DOD background checks was  relevant to MAVNI recruits\u2019 eligibility for naturalization. USCIS thus began  requiring currently-serving MAVNI recruits seeking military naturalization  to complete all required DOD background checks before USCIS  interviewed them, approved their applications, or administered the Oath  of Allegiance to naturalize them. Second, in January 2018, USCIS  ended its initiative to naturalize new enlistees at basic training sites. This  initiative, known as the \u201cNaturalization at Basic Training Initiative\u201d, began  in August 2009 as an effort to conduct outreach to new enlistees at the  Army\u2019s five basic training sites and provide noncitizen enlistees an  opportunity to naturalize prior to completion of basic training. Because of  DOD\u2019s October 2017 policy change increasing the amount of time  noncitizens must serve before they are eligible for a characterization of  service determination, noncitizen service members no longer meet the  requirements for naturalization while they are completing basic training.  As a result, USCIS closed naturalization offices in Fort Sill, Fort Benning,  and Fort Jackson.", "USCIS\u2019s processing time for military naturalizations also increased, from  an average of 5.4 months in fiscal year 2017 to 12.5 months in fiscal year  2018, according to USCIS data.

However, as of September 2018, VA was not meeting its  timeliness goal of 125 days for processing foreign claims and VA took an  average of 29 days longer to process foreign claims than domestic  claims.

However, as of March 2019, VA was not meeting its timeliness goal to  process 90 percent of claims reimbursements through FMP in 40 days.
