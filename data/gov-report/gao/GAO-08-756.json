EVM is a project management approach that, if implemented appropriately, provides objective reports of project status, produces early warning signs of impending schedule delays and cost overruns, and provides unbiased estimates of a program's total costs. Among other objectives, GAO was asked to assess FAA's policies for implementing EVM on its IT investments, evaluate whether the agency is adequately using these techniques to manage key IT acquisitions, and assess the agency's efforts to oversee EVM compliance. To do so, GAO compared agency policies with best practices, performed four case studies, and interviewed key FAA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FAA has established a policy requiring the use of EVM on its major IT acquisition programs, but key components of this policy are not fully consistent with best practices of leading organizations. Specifically, FAA fully met four and partially met three components of an effective EVM policy. For example, FAA requires its program managers to obtain EVM training, but it does not enforce completion of this training or require other relevant personnel to obtain this training. Until FAA expands and enforces its policy, it will be difficult for the agency to gain the full benefits of EVM. FAA is using EVM to manage IT acquisition programs, but not all programs are ensuring that their earned value data are reliable. Case studies of four programs demonstrated that all are using or planning to use EVM systems. However, of the three programs currently collecting EVM data, only one program is adequately ensuring that its earned value data are reliable. Another program is limited in its ability to ensure data reliability because it was initiated before earned value was required. The third program did not adequately validate contractor performance data. For example, GAO found anomalies in which the contractor reported spending funds without accomplishing work and others in which the contractor reported accomplishing work while crediting funds to the government. Until programs undertake a rigorous validation of their EVM data, FAA faces an increased risk that managers may not be getting the information they need to effectively manage the programs. FAA has taken important steps to oversee program compliance with EVM policies, but its oversight process lacks sufficient rigor. Through its recurring assessments, FAA has reported that most programs have improved their earned value capabilities over time, and that 74 percent of the programs were fully compliant with national standards. However, FAA's assessments are not thorough enough to identify anomalies in contractor data, and its progress reports do not distinguish between systems that collect comprehensive data and those that do not.

To maintain its ability to effectively carry out this mission,  address an aging infrastructure, and meet an increasing demand for air  transportation, in 1981, FAA embarked on a multibillion-dollar effort to  modernize its aging ATC system. Under this modernization program, FAA  has acquired and deployed new technologies and systems\u2014and continues  to do so today. Looking to the future, FAA is now beginning to fund  components of NextGen, a transformation to a new system that is  expected to use satellite-based technologies and state-of-the-art  procedures to handle increasing air traffic volume through 2025, while  further improving safety and security."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA Relies on IT to Carry out Its Mission", "paragraphs": ["FAA relies extensively on IT to carry out its mission\u2014both in terms of its  operational air traffic responsibilities and its administrative activities. The  agency depends on the adequacy and reliability of the nation\u2019s ATC  system, which includes a vast network of radars, navigation and  communications equipment, and information processing systems located  at air traffic facilities across the country. Through its ATC system, FAA  provides services such as controlling takeoffs and landings, and managing  the flow of traffic between airports. For example, the Integrated Terminal  Weather System integrates local weather data to allow the maximum use  of airport runways. The Wide Area Augmentation System is used to  provide vertically guided system approaches via Global Positioning  System satellites and its own satellites to aircraft at thousands of airports  and airstrips where there is currently no vertically guided landing  capability, thereby improving safety and reducing pilot workload. FAA  also relies on IT to carry out its mission-support and administrative  operations. For example, FAA uses IT to support accident and incident  investigations, security inspections, and personnel and payroll functions.", "With an IT budget of $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2008, FAA accounts for  about 83 percent of the Department of Transportation\u2019s IT budget. For  fiscal years 2007 through 2011, FAA plans to acquire more than $14 billion  in new systems to continue operating the nation\u2019s current ATC system,  while simultaneously transitioning to NextGen. This transition involves  acquiring numerous systems to support precision satellite navigation;  digital, networked communications; integrated weather information;  layered, adaptive security; and more. A cost-effective and timely transition  to NextGen depends in large part on FAA\u2019s ability to keep these  acquisitions within budget and on schedule. Historically, however, FAA  has had chronic difficulties in meeting budget, schedule, and performance  targets for acquisitions aimed at modernizing the National Airspace  System. For example, in June 2005, we reported that 13 of 16 selected  major ATC system acquisitions experienced cost, schedule, or  performance shortfalls when assessed against their original milestones.

Because of FAA\u2019s  contention that its modernization efforts were hindered by federal  acquisition regulations, in November 1995 Congress enacted legislation  that exempted the agency from most federal acquisition laws and  regulations. The legislation directed FAA to develop and implement a  new acquisition management system that would address the unique needs  of the agency. In April 1996, FAA implemented an acquisition management  system that provided acquisition policy and guidance for selecting and  controlling FAA\u2019s investments through all phases of the acquisition life  cycle. This guidance was intended to reduce the time and cost needed for  fielding new products and services by introducing (1) a new investment  management system that spans the entire life cycle of an acquisition, (2) a  new procurement system that provides flexibility in selecting and  managing contractors, and (3) organizational and human capital reforms  that support the new investment and procurement systems.", "More recently, in February 2004, FAA created the performance-based Air  Traffic Organization to control and improve FAA\u2019s investments and  operations and to better provide safe, secure, and cost-effective air traffic  services now and into the future.

Without  meaningful and coherent cost and schedule information, program  managers can have a distorted view of a program\u2019s status and risks. To  address this issue, in the 1960s, the Department of Defense developed the  EVM technique, which goes beyond simply comparing budgeted costs with  actual costs. This technique measures the value of work accomplished in a  given period and compares it with the planned value of work scheduled  for that period and with the actual cost of work accomplished.", "Differences in these values are measured in both cost and schedule  variances. Cost variances compare the earned value of the completed  work with the actual cost of the work performed. For example, if a  contractor completed $5 million worth of work and the work actually cost  $6.7 million, there would be a -$1.7 million cost variance. Schedule  variances are also measured in dollars, but they compare the earned value  of the work completed with the value of work that was expected to be  completed. For example, if a contractor completed $5 million worth of  work at the end of the month but was budgeted to complete $10 million  worth of work, there would be a -$5 million schedule variance. Positive  variances indicate that activities are costing less or are completed ahead  of schedule. Negative variances indicate activities are costing more or are  falling behind schedule. These cost and schedule variances can then be  used in estimating the cost and time needed to complete the program.", "Without knowing the planned cost of completed work and work in  progress (i.e., the earned value), it is difficult to determine a program\u2019s  true status. Earned value provides information that is necessary for  understanding the health of a program; it provides an objective view of  program status. As a result, EVM can alert program managers to potential  problems sooner than expenditures alone can, thereby reducing the  chance and magnitude of cost overruns and schedule delays. Moreover,  EVM directly supports the institutionalization of key processes for  acquiring and developing systems and the ability to effectively manage  investments\u2014areas that are often found to be inadequate on the basis of  our assessments of major IT investments.", "Because of the importance of ensuring quality earned value data, in May  1998, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Electronic  Industries Alliance (EIA) jointly established a national standard for EVM  systems.

However,  FAA calls for a function-oriented structure, rather than a product-oriented  one. This means that work is delineated based on functional activities,  such as design engineering, requirements analysis, and quality control. In  contrast, a product-oriented work breakdown structure reflects cost,  schedule, and technical performance on specific deliverables. Without the  level of detail provided by a product-oriented approach, program  managers may not have the information they need to make decisions on  specific program components. For example, cost overruns associated with  a specific radar component could be quickly identified and addressed  using a product-oriented structure. If a function-oriented structure were  used, these costs could be spread out over design, engineering, and quality  control.", "FAA program managers can choose to use a product-oriented work  breakdown structure to manage their programs and contracts, but then  they need to transfer their data to FAA\u2019s required function-oriented work  breakdown structure when reporting to management.

Furthermore, programs do not always map items in the same way, and, as  a result, costs may not be captured consistently across programs.", "FAA officials stated that they use the functional format because it is  aligned with the agency\u2019s cost accounting system. While this presents a  challenge, it is not insurmountable. For example, in the near-term, the  agency could develop a standard mapping function to translate product- oriented program data into the function-oriented cost accounting system.  While this approach would not resolve the time-consuming nature of  mapping (since programs would still be expected to complete this  activity), it does at least allow costs to be captured consistently across  programs. As a longer-term solution, we have repeatedly urged  government agencies to adopt cost accounting systems that provide  meaningful links among budget, accounting, and performance. Such  systems are consistent with product-oriented work breakdown  structures.", "Until FAA establishes a standard product-oriented work breakdown  structure, program officials who use the function-oriented approach to  manage their contracts may not be obtaining the information they need.

However, the agency does not specify EVM  training requirements for program team members or senior executives  with program oversight responsibilities. In addition, the agency does not  enforce EVM training to ensure that all relevant staff have completed the  required training. Instead, individual program offices are responsible for  ensuring that their teams obtain sufficient EVM training. Some programs  ensure that all key program staff have completed the appropriate level of  training they need to understand their roles and responsibilities, while  other programs do not. Until FAA establishes EVM training requirements  for all relevant personnel (including executives with oversight  responsibilities and program staff responsible for contract management)  and verifies the completion of this training, it cannot effectively ensure  that its program staff have the appropriate skills to validate and interpret  EVM data, and that its executives fully understand the data they are given  in order to ask the right questions and make informed decisions.", "Rebaselining criteria: FAA requires that programs seeking a new cost and  schedule baseline gain approval from a board of executives, called the  Joint Resources Council, which is responsible for investment decisions.  However, the agency does not define acceptable reasons for rebaselining  or require programs to identify and address the reasons for the need to  rebaseline.

Instead, ASR-11 relies  on schedule status to determine when planned work on a contract  deliverable has been authorized to begin\u2014such as work to dismantle a  legacy facility site\u2014and completed.

Specifically, FAA policies lack  sufficient guidance on the type of work structure needed to most  effectively use EVM data, training requirements do not extend to all  relevant personnel and call for this training to be monitored and enforced,  and programs are not required to identify or mitigate the root cause of any  cost and schedule overruns when they request a revised cost and schedule  baseline. In addition, FAA programs are not consistently ensuring that the  data coming from contractors are reliable. Of the three programs we  reviewed that currently collect earned value data, one program, ERAM,  had no explanation for anomalies in its contractor data wherein funds  were spent but no work was done; in another situation, work was  accomplished but funds were credited to the government.
