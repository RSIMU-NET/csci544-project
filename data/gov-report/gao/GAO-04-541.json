However, some Park Service officials have raised concerns that the Foundation's support is not meeting parks' priority needs. In this context, congressional requesters asked GAO to review the activities of the Foundation by determining the (1) Foundation's roles and responsibilities for raising funds to support the Park Service, (2) amount and kinds of donations the Foundation has raised between fiscal years 1999 and 2003, and (3) extent to which the contributions obtained by the Foundation assisted the Park Service in addressing park priorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with its legislative charter, the Foundation raises private donations from a variety of sources and has broad discretion in how it distributes these donations to support the Park Service. In general, the Foundation's policy is to support systemwide projects that serve the Park Service and are not otherwise federally funded, such as supporting temporary transportation advisors to help alleviate congestion at national parks. Overall, annual private donations to the Foundation have more than doubled--from $18 million in fiscal year 1999 to $41 million in fiscal year 2003. Much of this increase has stemmed from the Foundation's concerted effort to target corporate donations, which accounted for the bulk of the donations received. Most of the corporate donations are noncash or \"inkind,\" such as providing expertise to renovate the red bus fleet in Glacier National Park or providing electric vehicles to parks in California. Corporate donors typically specify how their donations are to be used. For example, one corporation donated funds to renovate a national monument in the District of Columbia. The Foundation, in consultation with the Park Service, decided to use these funds to renovate the Washington Monument. Because the majority of the Foundation's donations are restricted by the donors for a specific use, there are limited funds available to respond to some parks' requests, such as for fund-raising assistance or support for local nonprofit groups. Consequently, some park officials question the usefulness of Foundation donations and believe support should be directed at park priorities. In an effort to raise more discretionary funds and possibly better support individual park needs, the Foundation is expanding its fund-raising approach to attract more donations from individuals. The Foundation's efforts to assist the Park Service are hampered by poor communication and documentation problems. First, unlike most other partner relationships with the Park Service, the Foundation and the Park Service do not have a comprehensive written agreement that clearly describes the Foundation's fund-raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each partner. Second, the Foundation and the Park Service sometimes enter into verbal rather than written fund-raising agreements, thereby making it more difficult to determine the responsibilities of each party and whether commitments were met. Third, Foundation and Park Service officials disagree about the fund-raising strategy as well as the objectives for one of the Foundation's key fundraising programs. Both parties have taken initial steps to address these and other communication problems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the last few decades, the National Park Service (Park Service) has  relied increasingly on private donations in meeting its mission to promote  and protect the national parks.  Although national parks remain primarily a  public responsibility, parks benefit from other sources of support,  including individuals, corporations, and nonprofit organizations.  These  entities donate time, materials, and funds to support the park system.  In  1967, the Congress created an official national, nonprofit partner of the  Park Service\u2014the National Park Foundation (Foundation)\u2014to raise  private contributions for the benefit of the Park Service, its activities, or its  services.", "The Congress and the Park Service have long recognized the important role  of private support in meeting the needs of America\u2019s parks.

To determine the amount and  kinds of donations the Foundation has raised on behalf of the Park Service,  we reviewed Foundation revenues from fiscal years 1999 through 2003 and  analyzed private contributions made to the Foundation during this same  period.  We also examined 41 cooperative agreements between the  Foundation and the Park Service or other federal agencies (see app. III).   Moreover, we reviewed strategic plans of the Foundation and its fund- raising goals.  To determine the extent that contributions assisted the Park  Service in addressing park priorities, we reviewed the Foundation\u2019s  available discretionary funds and grants to Park Service units and  interviewed Foundation officials about how these funds and grants are  used to satisfy park requests.  We also reviewed the Foundation\u2019s processes  over contributions.  We analyzed the Foundation\u2019s financial statements for  fiscal years 1999 through 2003, which received an unqualified opinion by  independent auditing firms.

To manage this diverse system,  parks are arranged under seven regional offices.  These offices offer  administrative or specialized support that is not always available at the  local park level.  Within these regions, a superintendent manages each park  and has considerable decision-making authority over local park operations.", "Federal appropriations to the Park Service have increased from about $2  billion to about $2.5 billion over the past 5 years, but these funds still fall  short of addressing system needs.  For example, the park system has a  maintenance backlog estimated to be about $5 billion.  In addition to  federal appropriations, the Park Service relies on support from various  sources.  For example, the Park Service receives additional support  through (1) admission and user fees collected at park sites; (2) franchise  fees paid by over 600 park concessionaires; and (3) donations from various  individuals and groups, such as nonprofit organizations, which provide,  among other things, technical, volunteer, and financial assistance to parks.   The Park Service is actively increasing its partnerships with nonprofit  organizations as an additional source of support.", "In 1967, the Congress chartered the Foundation as the official national,  nonprofit fund-raising partner of the Park Service.

The Secretary of the  Interior is the board\u2019s chairperson and appoints all board members, who  serve without pay or other compensation.  With the exception of  appointment powers, most of the chairperson\u2019s responsibilities for  overseeing Foundation operations are delegated to the board\u2019s vice  chairman, who is the private citizen leader of the board.

Fund-raising efforts typically begin with the Foundation\u2019s  board members identifying corporate donors that could potentially provide  donations in support of the Park Service.  After identifying these corporate  donors, the Foundation researches their philanthropic interests, such as  demonstrated support for educational programs.  Next, the Foundation  contacts potential donors to explore the donors\u2019 philanthropic interests  and to ascertain their willingness to make donations in support of the Park  Service.  If the donors are willing to contribute, the Foundation then  contacts Park Service headquarters officials with relevant subject matter  expertise to help identify potential systemwide projects that correspond  with the donors\u2019 interests.  The Foundation then presents these projects to  the donors for their consideration.  The donors then may decide to make a  cash or in-kind contribution through the Foundation to support (1) one or  more of the proposed systemwide projects, (2) projects in a specific park,  or (3) general Park Service activities.  In instances where the donors decide  to support systemwide projects, the Foundation requests that all interested  parties submit grant proposals, indicating how they would use these  donations.

Furthermore,  neither the Foundation nor the Park Service tracked fund-raising requests  or verbal agreements.  Thus, neither agency can measure whether  performance under these agreements met expectations.  We requested the  views of officials from all seven regional offices about their relationship  with the Foundation.  Deputy and associate regional directors confirmed  that some field staff are dissatisfied with the Foundation for not keeping its  fund-raising promises.  For example, some regional Park Service officials  told us that they had verbal fund-raising agreements with the Foundation,  and that the Foundation did not honor its commitments.  In one instance, a  Park Service regional official stated that the Foundation agreed to raise  $500,000 for a restoration of a historic site in Atlanta, Georgia.

Specifically, internal control standards specify  that all transactions and other significant events need to be clearly  documented, that the documentation should be readily available for  examination, and that all documentation and records should be properly  managed and maintained.

Foundation officials stated that this is a recent policy and that they have  not entered into any local park agreements since this policy was adopted.   In any event, the Park Service and the Foundation could improve their  internal control procedures by entering into written fund-raising  agreements.

Some Park Service headquarters officials agree with the  Foundation\u2019s fund-raising strategy and the Secretary of the Interior and the  Director of the National Park Service serve on the Foundation\u2019s Board of  Directors, which approves all fund-raising activities of the Foundation.   However, some regional Park Service officials, while appreciative of the  Foundation\u2019s support, disagree with the Foundation on its fund-raising  strategy and objectives of the Proud Partners Program.  With regard to the  fund-raising strategy, these officials told us that the Foundation\u2019s strategy  should be targeted at the priority needs of individual parks.  For example,  several regional officials commented that the Foundation\u2019s unfamiliarity  with park needs resulted in missed opportunities to solicit contributions  for important park projects.  In addition, these officials suggested that the  Park Service periodically provide its list of individual park priorities to the  Foundation for fund-raising consideration.  Although the current park  priority listing focuses on projects eligible for funding from over 80 federal  sources, the officials believe the list could be modified to include projects  for which nonprofit funding is needed and appropriate.  Foundation  officials believe that individual park priorities can be better addressed by  local nonprofit organizations.  Foundation officials acknowledge that, in  some cases, donors are interested in supporting a park priority need that  could be viewed as a federal responsibility.  For example, one corporation  agreed to raise $5 million to support the restoration of the Washington  Monument in Washington, D.C.\u2014a project that was on the Park Service\u2019s  priority list in anticipation of future federal funding.", "Some regional officials stated that some support provided through the  Proud Partners Program was unrelated to park needs.  For example, one  company donated 500 electric vehicles, valued at about $4.2 million, to  national and state parks in California, and, according to one Park official,  the actual funds would have better met park needs.  Park Service  headquarters\u2019 officials recognize that much of the Foundation\u2019s corporate  revenues are restricted and heavily tied to promotional or advertising  objectives, but they believe these contributions have nevertheless provided  valuable assistance.", "In addition, the Park Service and the Foundation appear to have differing  viewpoints with respect to one of the three objectives of the Proud  Partners Program.  In a May 2001 memorandum sent to the Park Service\u2019s  Leadership Council, the Acting Park Service Director communicated to the  service\u2019s regions and local park superintendents that the objectives of the  Foundation\u2019s Proud Partner Program includes providing \u201cdirect support for  National Park Service priorities.\u201d  According to Foundation officials, the  objectives of the Proud Partner Program were designed to support  systemwide Park Service programs, not individual park priorities.  The  Foundation\u2019s published objectives for the Proud Partner Program are to  provide servicewide benefits to the park system by (1) raising awareness  about the breadth and depth of national parks, (2) generating individual  interest and support for parks through sales of the National Parks Pass and  encouraging contributions, and (3) piloting visitor experience grant  programs to help the Park Service address the challenges of encouraging  and providing meaningful park experiences while preserving park  resources.  In practice, however, the Foundation policy has not always  been followed.  For example, the Director of the Park Service and the Park  Service\u2019s Associate Director for Partnerships, Interpretation and  Education, Volunteers, and Outdoor Recreation, recently stated that the  Proud Partners Program has supported some local park projects, such as  the restoration of the historic fleet of red buses at Glacier National Park at  a cost of about $8 million.  Such inconsistencies in communication and  practice have led to misunderstandings about the kinds of projects the  program will support.", "Lastly, Foundation and Park Service officials have different views about the  exclusivity terms in the Proud Partner agreements.  A memorandum of  agreement between the Foundation and the Park Service, originally signed  in 1994, established policies and guidelines that should be followed in  managing commercial advertising and promotional campaigns, such as the  Proud Partner Program.  Although predating the Proud Partner Program by  6 years, this agreement, along with an earlier internal Park Service  memorandum, establishes the Foundation\u2019s responsibility for managing  national, cause-related marketing campaigns.  The 1994 agreement also  stipulates that all promotional and advertising arrangements will be  consistent with Park Service policies and provides for Park Service review  of promotional material before their public distribution.  Additionally, the  agreement authorizes the Foundation to sign letters of agreement with  corporate partners and to provide product or service category exclusivity.", "The issue in question is whether these exclusivity arrangements preclude  other nonprofits from making park-based marketing agreements with  businesses that promote products or services that fall within the Proud  Partners\u2019 categorical areas of operation.  Foundation officials advised us  that the terms of their agreements with corporate partners do not prevent  other Park Service nonprofit partners from negotiating park-based  marketing agreements with businesses that provide the same type of  product or services as the Foundation\u2019s five national partners.  However,  the Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor officials, along with nonprofit officials  with whom we spoke, believe that such park-based agreements are  generally prohibited.  Under this interpretation, a local friends group at any  national park, for example, generally could not negotiate a park-based  automotive-related marketing agreement with the Toyota Corporation  because the Ford Motor Company is a Proud Partner and has exclusive  marketing rights within the automotive product category.  Because the  Foundation has provided nondisclosure guarantees to its Proud Partners, it  does not make the actual terms within the specific agreements between the  Foundation and the Proud Partners available for Park Service review (see  app. IV for more details)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Foundation and the Park Service Have Efforts Under Way to Improve Collaboration and Communication", "paragraphs": ["Both the Park Service and the Foundation have several ongoing efforts,  which when fully implemented should help address recognized  communication problems between their organizations.

This committee,  comprised of Park Service headquarters officials and regional directors and  Foundation board members and staff, also focuses on achieving shared  goals and recommending actions to resolve differences between the two  organizations.  In addition, the Director of the Park Service and Foundation  officials recently agreed to meet monthly to find ways to promote better  communication.

Recognizing  this, Foundation staff attempt to customize a promotional program for  each partner that meets corporate marketing, philanthropic, and public  affairs objectives and that is consistent with the Foundation\u2019s principal  program objectives for benefiting the park system.", "The Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors plays a key role in developing  corporate partnerships.  Usually, board members identify prospective  partners.  They also may contact the corporation directly or facilitate  contacts by Foundation staff.  Before meeting with a prospective partner,  Foundation staff perform research to identify the corporation\u2019s  philanthropic and promotional interests.  Also, informal discussions may  occur among the board, Foundation staff, and the Park Service to ensure  that the corporation\u2019s values are in-line with those of the Park Service and  the Foundation.", "As the process continues, Foundation representatives make a customized  presentation to the potential partner.  The presentation uses information  gleaned from staff research, such as the corporation\u2019s philanthropic  interests, and identifies partnering contribution requirements as well as  broad program benefits that corporations might expect.  For example, if a  corporation has a philanthropic interest in education, Foundation  representatives would note educational opportunities and needs associated  with the national parks.  Among the broad benefits, the representatives  note that by aligning their corporate image with the popularity of the  national parks, corporate sponsors can demonstrate excellent corporate  citizenship, increase sales, heighten brand awareness, and target specific  markets and consumer demographics.  Information on specific program  benefits may also be provided during the presentations.

Although we recognize the influences that donors have in directing  support provided through the Foundation (see pp. 9 and 38 of the  report), we believe that the Foundation\u2019s comments are overall  inconsistent with its literature, our prior conversations with its  officials, the views of some Park Service regional officials, and our  review of Proud Partner Program grants.  As stated on page 19 of the  report, and supported by discussions with Foundation officials, the  literature of the Foundation does not mention providing direct support  for National Park Service priorities as an objective of the Proud  Partners Program.  Moreover, as noted on page 18, this interpretation is  inconsistent with views held by several park regional officials who  believed that the program should be targeted at securing support for  individual park priorities as opposed to systemwide needs.  Finally, this  interpretation appears incongruent with some grants that have been  issued under the Proud Partner Program.  As noted on page 19 of the  report, our review found that some Proud Partner grants, such as those  used to restore the red bus fleet at Glacier National Park, principally  appear to support local, rather than systemwide, Park Service  priorities. 3. The Foundation takes issue with our mentioning the Glacier red bus  renovation as an example of an inconsistency in application of its  program strategy.  Although we agree that several cited transportation  initiatives provided systemwide benefits, most of these initiatives\u2019  support did not provide systemwide benefits.  For example, of about  500 electric vehicles donated during the period we examined, 225 went  primarily to California state parks (parks not affiliated with the  National Park Service).  Additionally, virtually all of the 275 electric  vehicles donated to Park Service units were directed to park units only  in California.  Further, the National Park Service Director as well as the  Park Service\u2019s Associate Director for Partnerships, Interpretation and  Education, Volunteers, and Outdoor Recreation referred to the Glacier  bus restoration as supporting a local park project (see p. 19). 4. We do not agree with the Foundation\u2019s position that potential conflicts  only arise under circumstances where a park-based project involves a  national marketing component.  Director\u2019s Order 21 states that when  the Foundation has a national cause-related marketing arrangement,  this may take precedence over a park-based cause-related marketing  effort in the same business category.  The order does not specify that  the precedence applies only when the park-based project has a  national marketing component as interpreted by the Foundation.   Further, as reported on page 20, Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor  officials, along with nonprofit officials with whom we spoke, believe  that park-based agreements, in the same business category as a Proud  Partner, were generally prohibited.  Thus, we continue to believe (1)  that there is general confusion in the Park Service, especially in the  field locations, regarding the applicability of the Proud Partner  exclusivity terms to park-based cause-related marketing arrangements  and (2) that the Foundation should help further clarify this issue. 5. Although there is evidence that the Foundation has contributed funding  toward renovation of the Ebenezer Baptist Church (a facility within the  Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site) and did complete a  feasibility study for the Native American monument at the Little  Bighorn National Monument, the exact terms and conditions for these  two fund-raising efforts is speculative because there was no written  agreement.  Our point in this section is not whether the Foundation did  or did not provide support.  Rather, the examples illustrate that verbal  fund-raising agreements can lead to disagreements about whether  commitments were met.  Verbal agreements also provide little means  for measuring performance in such arrangements.    6. We agree that the information contained in figure 8 may understate the  full amount of grants issued by the Foundation for fiscal years 2000  through 2003.  On page 28, we clearly stated that the GIFTS database  was incomplete.  At the time we completed our audit work, the  Foundation had not provided us with information showing the extent to  which the database was incomplete.  We have revised figure 8 to reflect  those total grant amounts contained in the Foundation\u2019s audited  financial statements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Barry T.
