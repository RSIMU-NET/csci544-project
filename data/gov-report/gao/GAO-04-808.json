Some stakeholders who use companies' filings, such as investor organizations and researchers, maintained that the requirements allow too much flexibility and are too narrow in scope to capture important environmental information. Other stakeholders, primarily those who prepare or file reports with SEC, said that the scope of the current requirements and guidance is adequate and that companies need flexibility to accommodate their individual circumstances. Little is known about the extent to which companies are disclosing environmental information in their filings with SEC. Determining what companies should be disclosing is extremely challenging without access to company records, considering the flexibility in the disclosure requirements. Despite strong methodological limitations, some studies provide tentative insights about the amount of environmental information companies are disclosing and the variation in disclosure among companies. However, the problem in evaluating the adequacy of disclosure is that one cannot determine whether a low level of disclosure means that a company does not have existing or potential environmental liabilities, has determined that such liabilities are not material, or is not adequately complying with disclosure requirements. The adequacy of SEC's efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental disclosure requirements cannot be determined without better information on the extent of environmental disclosure. In addition, SEC does not systematically track the issues raised in its reviews of companies' filings and thus, does not have the information it needs to analyze the frequency of problems involving environmental disclosure, compared with other types of disclosure problems; identify trends over time or within particular industries; or identify areas in which additional guidance may be warranted. Over the years, SEC and EPA have made sporadic efforts to coordinate on improving environmental disclosure; currently, EPA periodically shares limited information on specific, environment-related legal proceedings, such as those involving monetary sanctions. Using a Web-based survey of 30 experts that use disclosure information, including investor organizations and financial analysts among others, GAO obtained suggestions for increasing and improving environmental disclosure in three broad categories: modifying disclosure requirements and guidance, increasing oversight and enforcement, and adopting nonregulatory approaches to improving disclosure. Some of the experts offered comments about why particular proposals are unnecessary or unworkable. GAO also sought the views of representatives of companies that file reports with SEC, who questioned the value and feasibility of some suggestions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent scandals in the business world have shaken investors\u2019 confidence in  corporate financial reporting and the underlying accounting and auditing  practices, and have highlighted the importance of disclosing key  information to potential investors. Environmental risks and liabilities are  among the conditions that, if undisclosed, could impair the public\u2019s ability  to make sound investment decisions. For example, the discovery of  extensive hazardous waste contamination at company-owned facilities  could expose a company to hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup  costs, while impending environmental regulations could affect a company\u2019s  future financial position if the company were required to shut down plants  or invest in expensive new technology. While not the primary impetus,  concern about environmental liabilities has also contributed to the growth  of \u201csocially responsible\u201d investor groups and mutual funds that invest only  in companies with a strong record in environmental compliance, worker  protection, and other social issues. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of  corporate disclosures, which could lead to improved reporting of  environmental liabilities.", "The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) primary mission is to  protect investors and the integrity of securities markets. Among other  things, SEC regulations require companies to disclose information that  would be considered \u201cmaterial\u201d by a reasonable investor. A matter is  material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would  consider it important. The omission or misstatement of an item in a  financial report is material if, in light of surrounding circumstances, the  magnitude of the item is such that the judgment of a reasonable person  would probably have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or  correction of the item. Information that might be considered material can  include, for example, significant changes in accounting practices or  potential risks or liabilities, such as the cost of a major environmental  cleanup, that could affect future earnings. SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation  Finance monitors compliance with the disclosure requirements by  periodically reviewing companies\u2019 filings and issuing comment letters to  the companies, if necessary, to request any additional information that  might be required. In addition, SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement may seek a  monetary penalty or take some other enforcement action when a  company\u2019s failure to comply with disclosure requirements is particularly  egregious. While the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not  have a direct role in monitoring environmental disclosures, the agency  encourages the disclosure of environmental legal proceedings by notifying  companies of potential disclosure obligations and periodically shares  relevant information with SEC.", "You asked us to determine (1) key stakeholders\u2019 views on how well SEC  has defined the requirements for environmental disclosure, (2) the extent  to which companies are disclosing environmental information in their  filings with SEC, (3) the adequacy of SEC\u2019s efforts to monitor and enforce  compliance with the disclosure requirements, and (4) what actions experts  suggest for increasing and improving environmental disclosure. To obtain  views on environmental disclosure requirements, we reviewed SEC\u2019s  disclosure regulations along with relevant standards and guidance from  SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). We also interviewed  representatives of groups with a stakeholder interest in environmental  disclosure, including investor organizations, financial services institutions,  environmental groups and consultants, business associations, credit rating  agencies, and public accounting firms. For information on the extent to  which companies are disclosing environmental information in their filings  with SEC, we reviewed 27 studies conducted from 1995 to 2003 and  assessed their methodologies. After eliminating 12 studies that either had  severe methodological limitations or did not address aspects of  environmental disclosure relevant to our objectives, we summarized the  findings of the remaining 15 studies. At the committee\u2019s request, we  supplemented our analysis of existing studies with a limited examination of  disclosures related to potential future risks, focusing on the impacts of  potential controls on greenhouse gas emissions at 20 U.S. electric utilities  with relatively high emissions of carbon dioxide.", "For information on SEC\u2019s monitoring and enforcement of environmental  disclosure requirements, we reviewed SEC\u2019s policies and procedures,  obtained agency statistics on relevant activities, and interviewed officials  within SEC and EPA.

Some of the experts were also among the  stakeholders consulted about the disclosure requirements. To ensure  balance, we sought the views of representatives of reporting companies  regarding the experts\u2019 suggestions.

To ensure that all investors have access to basic  relevant information prior to trading, federal securities laws require certain  companies to register with SEC and make public particular information.  Among other things, these companies are required to file reports with SEC  about their financial condition and business practices when stock is  initially sold and on a continuing and periodic basis afterwards to help  investors make informed decisions. Each year, companies generally must  file, at a minimum, one annual report, called a 10-K, and three quarterly  reports, known as 10-Qs.", "SEC promulgates regulations and issues guidance on what information  public companies must disclose in their filings. Beginning in 1982, SEC  integrated all of the required disclosures into one omnibus regulation,  regulation S-K. According to SEC, three sections of regulation S-K are most  likely to elicit environmental disclosures, either because of specific  environment-related requirements or common practice:   Under S-K item 101, companies must disclose the material effects of  compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions on  their capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position;  Under S-K item 103, companies must describe certain administrative or  judicial legal proceedings arising from federal, state, or local  environmental provisions; and  Under S-K item 303, companies must discuss their liquidity, capital  resources, and results of operations. For example, companies must  identify any known trends, demands, commitments, events, or  uncertainties that may result in a material change in the company\u2019s  liquidity. In this part of the filing, known as Management\u2019s Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, SEC  expects to see information on any environmental matters that could  materially affect company operations or finances.", "In addition to its own disclosure requirements, SEC relies on the standards  and guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to help ensure that  companies are properly accounting for and reporting on their financial  operations, including any environmental losses resulting from liabilities or  from permanent reductions in the value of company assets. For example,  SEC presumes that financial statements in company filings that are not  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, are misleading  or inaccurate. Moreover, SEC regulations require companies to submit  audited financial statements with their annual filings. The audits are  performed by independent auditors, who are subject to professional  auditing standards, which until recently were promulgated by the AICPA.  Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the new Public Company  Accounting Oversight Board, appointed and overseen by SEC, is now  responsible for issuing standards related to the preparation of audit reports  for publicly held companies.", "To monitor compliance with disclosure requirements, SEC\u2019s Division of  Corporation Finance periodically reviews companies\u2019 filings and issues  comment letters to the companies, if necessary, to request additional  information, amendments of prior filings, or specific disclosures in future  filings. While Corporation Finance does not have direct authority to compel  companies to respond to its comment letters, companies know that failure  to do so could delay approval of filings that they need in order to raise  capital. In egregious cases, Corporation Finance can refer companies to  SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. The Division of Enforcement can seek  sanctions against companies for the misrepresentation or omission of  important information about securities in civil or administrative  proceedings. Among the sanctions available to SEC are obtaining a  permanent injunction against an officer of the company; levying monetary  penalties; requiring the return of illegal profits, known as disgorgement;  and barring an individual from serving as an officer or director in a public  company. EPA encourages companies to disclose environmental legal  proceedings by notifying companies of potential disclosure obligations and  sharing relevant information with SEC.", "Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to improve the accuracy  and reliability of corporate disclosures. While the act does not contain  provisions that specifically address environmental disclosure, some of  them could lead to improved reporting of environmental liabilities. These  provisions include requirements for SEC to more frequently review  company filings; for companies to make real-time disclosures of material  changes in their financial conditions; and for company officials to annually  assess the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures for financial  reporting and to certify that their SEC filings fairly present, in all material  respects, the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.

Beginning in the late 1960s, some investors consciously avoided  the securities of companies they perceived as polluting the environment,  engaging in unfair labor practices, or otherwise exhibiting poor corporate  governance, and sought out investments in companies perceived to have  better records on various social issues. Although initially a marginal  segment of the investing community, the dollar amount of assets in socially  screened accounts has increased significantly in recent years. The Social  Investment Forum, an organization of over 500 social investment  practitioners and institutions, estimated that in 2003, the total assets  invested in such accounts were about $2 trillion in the United States, or  about 11 percent of the $19.2 trillion in assets under professional  management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Disagree on How Well SEC Has Defined Environmental Disclosure Requirements", "paragraphs": ["While most of the disclosure requirements are designed for broad  application\u2014and apply to the disclosure of all types of information,  including environmental matters\u2014some of the regulations and related  guidance provide criteria specifically for determining whether and how to  disclose environmental information.

According to generally accepted accounting  principles, companies should always accrue (and disclose) their best  estimate for a liability in their financial statements, given the range of  possible costs. If no one estimate is better than the others, the applicable  accounting standard specifies that companies should accrue the lowest  estimate in the range in their financial statements, although they must still  disclose the potential for additional liability in the footnotes to the statements. If the liability does not meet one or both of the criteria for  accruing in the financial statements, it must nonetheless be disclosed in the  footnotes if it is \u201creasonably possible.\u201d The term \u201creasonably possible\u201d  represents a range of possible outcomes that have a greater than remote  chance of occurring.", "SEC regulations generally require disclosure of information only if it is  \u201cmaterial.\u201d According to SEC officials, in determining whether information  is material, the agency relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201can  omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable  shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.\u201d  Guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board states that  the omission of an item in a financial report is material, if, in light of  surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is  probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the report  would have changed or been influenced by the inclusion or correction of  the item. In general, SEC and other standard-setting bodies recognize that  only those who have all the facts can properly make materiality judgments.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board believes that no general  standards of materiality could be formulated to take into account all the  considerations that enter into an experienced human judgment.", "Concerning the disclosure of future risks, including risks related to  environmental matters, SEC regulation S-K item 303 requires company  management to discuss the company\u2019s liquidity, capital resources, and  results of operations. For example, a company must identify any known  trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that may result in  a material change in the company\u2019s liquidity. In addition, under item 303  companies are \u201cencouraged\u201d to include in their filings forward-looking  information, which SEC guidance defines as anticipating a future trend or  event, or anticipating a less predictable impact of a known event, trend, or uncertainty. In a 1989 interpretive release, SEC explained when companies  are obligated to disclose future risks. The guidance says that \u201ca disclosure  duty exists where a trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty is  both presently known to management and reasonably likely to have  material effects on the registrant\u2019s financial condition or results of  operation.\u201d", "Some reporting standards and guidance relate specifically to the disclosure  of environmental information or contain specific environmental  benchmarks.

By way of illustration, the guidance suggests that companies use  notification by EPA that they are a potentially responsible party at a  hazardous waste site as an indication that a liability is probable and subject  to disclosure if material. The supplemental accounting guidance also  contains a chapter on measuring the amount of environmental liabilities,  given the uncertainties inherent in environmental sites.

Regarding the point at which companies should  disclose a liability, stakeholders said that the current standards and  guidance are unclear; for example, opinions vary on whether a disclosure  obligation exists at the time the environmental contamination occurs or the  point at which a regulatory agency (or some other third party) has taken  action against a company to force a cleanup. In addition, some  stakeholders said that companies can use the apparent flexibility in judging  the likelihood of a liability to postpone or avoid disclosure.", "Stakeholders also said that applicable regulations and guidance make it too  easy for companies to conclude that they have nothing to disclose or  cannot calculate an estimate, or to default to a known minimum amount  rather than develop a best estimate. Estimating the amount of  environmental liabilities involves several uncertainties, among them the  extent of contamination and required cleanup, the stringency of applicable  cleanup standards, the state of the art of available cleanup technology, and  the extent to which cleanup costs might be shared with other responsible  parties or offset by insurance recoveries. However, stakeholders believe  that companies have developed methods to account for such uncertainties  that yield better estimates than the known minimum, and they believe that  companies should be required to share this information with investors.", "On assessing materiality, stakeholders expressed concern that the existing  regulations and guidance largely rely on the discretion of company  management and that the requirements generally do not establish minimum  thresholds for disclosure. Some stakeholders also said that the materiality  standard does not sufficiently emphasize the need to disclose intangible,  nonquantifiable factors, such as the impact of environmental  contamination on a company\u2019s reputation.", "Regarding disclosure of future risks, stakeholders said that SEC  regulations and guidance do not clearly distinguish between \u201cknown  information\u201d that could cause reported financial information to not be  indicative of future results and \u201cforward-looking information,\u201d which may  be less certain but could have a greater potential impact.

Stakeholders expressed the following  concerns, among others:  SEC\u2019s definition of monetary sanctions does not include certain costs  related to the sanctions. Specifically, in determining when the $100,000  disclosure threshold has been met, SEC regulations and guidance  exclude costs associated with (1) environmental remediation and (2)  supplemental environmental projects conducted in lieu of paying  sanctions.", "SEC\u2019s regulations do not require companies to aggregate the estimated  costs of similar potential liabilities, such as multiple hazardous waste  sites, when assessing materiality.", "Companies are not required to disclose information about their  environmental assets or environmental performance. A growing body  of socially responsible investors believes that such information could be  material to many investors or indicative of effective corporate  management.", "SEC regulations do not require companies to disclose quantitative  information on the total number of environmental remediation sites,  related claims, or the associated liabilities.

Because company records are generally  not publicly available, it is virtually impossible for an external party to  know what information companies should be disclosing. In the case of  existing environmental contamination, for example, evaluating the  adequacy of companies\u2019 disclosure may require information on the number  of sites, the nature of the contamination, projected cleanup costs, and the  extent to which the companies\u2019 liability may be shared by others or  mitigated by insurance, among other things. Evaluating companies\u2019  disclosures regarding potential future risks, such as the impact of potential  changes in environmental regulations, poses similar problems.", "Another obstacle to assessing companies\u2019 disclosure is the flexibility  inherent in certain reporting requirements and related guidance. A number  of key requirements use terms that are general enough to accommodate a  range of situations and allow company management to exercise judgment  regarding the amount and type of information they disclose. For example,  in determining whether an existing or potential environmental liability  should be reported in financial statements, company officials must  determine if the occurrence of such liabilities is \u201creasonably possible\u201d and  the amounts are \u201creasonably estimable.\u201d   SEC, the Financial Accounting  Standards Board, and the AICPA have all issued standards and guidance to  assist companies and their independent auditors in making these  determinations, but inevitably, some subjective judgments remain.  Similarly, in assessing the materiality of environmental information, SEC\u2019s  guidance says that companies should consider information that a  \u201creasonable person\u201d would need to make an investment decision.  Generally, SEC\u2019s regulations and guidance do not establish any minimum  thresholds for materiality. Finally, in the case of disclosing future risks,  companies have some flexibility in deciding what qualifies as \u201cknown  material trends, events, and uncertainties\u201d that would cause the companies\u2019  reported financial information to not be indicative of future operating  results or financial condition.", "One of the consequences of disclosure requirements that are subject to  interpretation\u2014and of not having direct access to company records\u2014is the  difficulty of determining with any certainty whether a low level of  disclosure indicates that the company does not have existing or potential  environmental liabilities, has determined that such liabilities are not  material, or is not adequately complying with disclosure requirements. The  varying formats used for disclosure pose another problem for researchers.  Much of the environmental information that is subject to disclosure can be  reported in a number of different sections of the 10-K filing, including the  financial statements, related footnotes, and various narrative sections of  the report. In addition, the information may be stated in general or specific  terms and companies often use different terminology to describe similar  issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Limited and Not Generalizable, Existing Studies Indicate That the Extent of Disclosure Has Increased Over Time and Can Vary Substantially within Industries", "paragraphs": ["We identified 27 studies and papers that (1) were published, presented at  conferences, or provided by the authors from 1995 to 2003 and (2)  contained original research on companies\u2019 environmental disclosures.

In addition, while the 15 studies shed some light on  the amount and type of information disclosed by selected companies\u2014and  how it varied among them or changed over time\u2014in some instances, the  researchers drew conclusions beyond what was supported by their  analysis.", "Eleven of the studies found variations in the amount of information specific  companies were disclosing in their filings with SEC. Some of these studies  focused on the disclosure of existing environmental liabilities while others  examined disclosures related to future potential risks, ranging from  impending regulations to larger issues such as global climate change. For  example, a 1998 study on disclosure of Superfund remediation liabilities by  140 companies found that the amount of information they disclosed about  the number and location of the sites, the materiality of the liabilities, and  the estimated amounts varied substantially. Some of the companies did  not disclose any information and others did not provide enough  information to allow a meaningful assessment of the companies\u2019 risks,  according to the authors. Six of the 11 studies found that variations among  companies within the same industry can be substantial. For example, a  2003 study that looked at how 38 coal-fired electric utilities reported on the  impact of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 found wide variation in  the types of disclosures by these companies.

According to officials from  the Division of Corporation Finance, SEC relies on reporting companies  and their independent auditors to completely and accurately disclose  material information to investors; SEC\u2019s role is to help companies ensure  that they are making the required disclosures and properly interpreting the  requirements. Even if SEC\u2019s role were broader, SEC officials told us that  the agency does not have the resources to review all company filings or  conduct on-site examinations to proactively ensure that companies are  disclosing all material information.", "Reviewers in the Division of Corporation Finance do a preliminary review  of companies\u2019 annual 10-K filings to determine which reports warrant  further scrutiny and at what level.

SEC may also choose to conduct a limited review of specific  issues that have been identified as needing attention. For example, a  limited review might focus on a company\u2019s accounting policy for  recognizing revenue in its financial records and reports. As table 2 shows,  SEC reviewed about 8 to 20 percent of the annual filings each year from  1999 through 2003.", "To ensure consistency across reviewers, SEC uses guidance that provides  an organizational structure for each review and the documentation that  supports it. The guidance identifies, as a reminder for the reviewers,  various aspects of the filing that should be covered in the review,  depending on the particular company and the industry it represents; among  other things, the guidance cites the adequacy of disclosures related to  environmental liabilities. If a reviewer questions the accuracy or  completeness of the filing and believes that further disclosures may be  warranted, SEC issues a comment letter requesting additional  information. SEC officials said that companies may sometimes be  reluctant to respond to the comment letters, claiming that providing the  requested information is too difficult or expensive or will hurt their  competitive position. In the case of time-critical transactional filings,  companies have an incentive to respond to SEC\u2019s comment letters because  the companies cannot raise additional capital by issuing securities until  SEC has cleared the filings. Although the Division of Corporation Finance  does not have a similar \u201cstick\u201d to compel companies to respond in the case  of the 10-K or 10-Q filings, the companies generally comply, according to  SEC officials.", "When a company\u2019s failure to respond is particularly egregious, SEC may  refer the case to its Division of Enforcement. According to information  from the Division of Enforcement and other sources, we identified four  enforcement actions related to inadequate environmental disclosure since  1977, none of which were referred by the Division of Corporation Finance.  Enforcement officials were not aware of any additional cases and said that  while they track enforcement cases by broad program area, such as  broker-dealer fraud, insider trading, and issuer financial disclosure, they do  not track the number of cases in which environmental disclosure is the  primary issue. According to an official in the Division of Enforcement, most  enforcement actions are prompted by company whistleblowers or news  reports of company wrongdoing rather than referrals from the Division of  Corporation Finance.", "SEC officials noted that reviewing company filings is an iterative process; a  single filing often generates multiple comment letters and responses before  SEC is satisfied that all matters have been resolved. In some instances, SEC  raises one or more questions about the disclosures in a company\u2019s filing  and, based on the company\u2019s response, is either satisfied with the  explanation or decides that the matter does not warrant additional  follow-up.", "SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance does not systematically track the  issues raised in comment letters.

SEC officials told us that for the most part, they  rely on the reviewers\u2019 knowledge and experience to get a sense of the most  common problem areas. While SEC did not have any statistics on the  frequency with which its comment letters questioned companies\u2019  environmental disclosures, Division of Corporation Finance officials told  us that, based on their experience, environmental disclosure is rarely  among the issues cited if one considers all of the filings SEC reviews, partly  because of the nature of the businesses involved. Within particular  industries, however, SEC officials said that reviewers regularly and  frequently comment on environmental disclosure.", "In the absence of a formal tracking system, an SEC study of annual 10-K  filings from the Fortune 500 companies for the year 2002 provided some  information on the most common disclosure issues. To conduct the study,  SEC screened the companies\u2019 filings and then selected a substantial  number for further review; ultimately, SEC sent comment letters to more  than 350 companies. According to officials from the Division of  Corporation Finance, the type and frequency of comments identified in the Fortune 500 study were consistent with their observations generally.  SEC\u2019s summary report noted that environmental disclosure prompted  comments more frequently in particular industries, such as oil and gas and  mining companies and certain manufacturing companies.

While there are  conflicting reports on when the regular transfer of information halted,  officials from SEC and EPA agree that some problems arose because the  volume and complexity of the data that EPA was providing were not useful  to SEC reviewers.

The suggestions  we obtained fell into three broad categories: modifying disclosure  requirements and guidance, increasing oversight and enforcement, and  adopting nonregulatory approaches to improving disclosure.

The courts did not rule on whether the alleged failure to  disclose actually caused whatever financial harm the shareholders may have suffered.To  prevail in such cases, shareholders must demonstrate that (1) the company intentionally  misled them by misstating or withholding material information about environmental risks  or liabilities and (2) the misstatements or omissions caused the shareholders to suffer a  financial loss.

These suggestions are summarized below along with  contrasting views from a few of the experts we surveyed and  representatives of reporting companies, including the American Chemistry  Council, the Business Roundtable, the Edison Electric Institute, and the  U.S. Business Council for Sustainable Development.", "On limiting the flexibility of existing requirements: Some experts  suggested that SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, as  appropriate, clarify terms such as \u201cprobable,\u201d \u201creasonably possible,\u201d and  \u201cremote\u201d relative to the occurrence of environmental liabilities, or require  or recommend the use of expected value analysis in estimating the  amounts of liabilities, as advocated by ASTM International. In addition,  several experts commented on the need for more guidance on materiality,  calling for clarification or more specific criteria. One participant suggested  that SEC establish a presumption of materiality for environmental  liabilities, thus shifting the burden of proving that such liabilities are not  material to companies. In contrast, another expert commented that more  specific guidance on estimating the amounts of liabilities would lead to  rules not well suited for all companies and would mislead users of  company filings by making estimates appear to be more precise than they  really are. Company representatives made similar comments, saying that  uncertainties about the nature and extent of environmental contamination,  potential remediation costs, and the extent of the company\u2019s liability all  affect the feasibility of deriving precise estimates. Company  representatives also objected to requiring the use of the expected value  method of cost estimation advocated by ASTM International, saying that it  would lead to misleading disclosures because, for example, the method  does not allow companies to factor in contributions from other potentially  responsible parties in estimating their own potential liabilities. Finally,  company representatives maintained that existing guidance on materiality  is sufficiently clear and necessarily flexible to accommodate companies\u2019  individual circumstances.", "On reporting existing environmental liabilities: A few experts suggested  that SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, as appropriate,  clarify the accounting and disclosure procedures for unasserted but  enforceable claims related to the cleanup of environmental contamination  at current and former company facilities. This clarification would, among  other things, specify the point at which such liabilities occur (and a  disclosure obligation may exist)\u2014when the release happens or when a  third party initiates action against the company. Representatives of  reporting companies did not agree with this suggestion. They said that  environmental laws require companies to study and remediate  contaminated sites, and disclosing possible sites\u2014based merely on their  existence\u2014does not advance investors\u2019 understanding of a company\u2019s  economic value. Company representatives pointed to guidance from the  Financial Accounting Standards Board, which notes that the existence of  an environmental liability becomes determinable and the related costs  estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help define the  liability. Once a third party intervenes and companies learn more about the  extent of the problem, they can make and disclose better estimates.", "On disclosing future risks: Another suggestion from the experts was that  SEC issue guidance clarifying when certain potential environmental issues  should be disclosed, citing, in particular, the potential impacts of global  climate change and controls over greenhouse gas emissions. More  specifically, one expert commented that in the case of climate change, SEC  should issue guidance advising companies to report their internal  assessments of the impact of complying with pending environmental  regulations over a specified time period, including the range of possible  actions being considered by a company, how the actions might affect the  financial condition and operations of the company, and whether the effects  would be material to shareholders. Company representatives and a few of  the experts commented that it is inappropriate to single out particular  issues, such as climate change, for disclosure or to use SEC\u2019s disclosure  requirements to advance the interests of particular groups. According to  one expert, the current rules and guidance for disclosing future  environmental risks are clear and companies know they cannot avoid  disclosure of such risks by categorizing them as \u201cforward-looking\u201d  information. Company representatives also questioned the value of  disclosing \u201cspeculative\u201d information to investors. Moreover, the  representatives pointed out that such requirements could have significant  ramifications for disclosure in general, depending on where one draws the  line in deciding when the impact of potential legislation should be  disclosed.", "On requiring companies to report environmental performance  information: Five of the experts we surveyed said that SEC should require  companies to provide information on their environmental performance  (e.g., pollutant releases and remediation expenditures) or issue guidance  stating that such information might be considered material by investors. In  one case, an expert suggested that SEC use the Global Reporting Initiative  as a model for the types of environmental performance measures that  should be disclosed. Some experts disagreed with proposals for reporting  requirements involving companies\u2019 environmental performance, saying  that such information is publicly available outside of SEC filings. One  expert also questioned the justification for singling out environmental  performance as opposed to other potentially important social issues. While  some company representatives acknowledged that environmental  performance data and intangible assets such as environmental  management systems might be considered important by some investors,  they said that such information is already available to the public through  company Web sites; special reports on environment, health, and safety  issues; and federal and state regulatory agencies.", "On changing requirements for reporting monetary sanctions and  aggregating liabilities: Some experts believe that SEC should (1) change  the definition of monetary sanctions to include supplemental  environmental projects that companies fund in exchange for reduced  sanctions so that investors have a more complete picture of companies\u2019  potential costs and (2) issue guidance recommending that companies  aggregate the estimated costs of similar liabilities before assessing  materiality and the need for disclosure. Representatives of reporting  companies questioned the proposed inclusion of supplemental  environmental projects as monetary sanctions because companies are  generally not permitted to use dollar-for-dollar offsets when they agree to a  supplemental project. Some of the experts we surveyed commented that  the threshold for monetary sanctions should be updated or abolished  altogether. Company representatives also thought that the fixed thresholds  for disclosures related to legal proceedings were outdated. They  commented, for example, that the $100,000 threshold for monetary  sanctions should be raised to $1 million to reflect increases in penalty  amounts since the regulation was promulgated over 20 years ago.  Regarding calls for aggregation of similar liabilities, one of the experts and  some company representatives said that such a requirement would mislead  investors by portraying a company that is one of many potentially  responsible parties for several environmental remediation sites as  equivalent to a company that is likely to be responsible for one or two  larger cleanup sites, when the companies\u2019 actual liabilities could differ  significantly. Other company representatives commented that although  aggregation of liabilities related by some common cause or probability  seems reasonable, aggregation of any and all environmental liabilities with  differing circumstances would be arbitrary and not very useful to investors  in analyzing a company\u2019s risks.", "On other regulatory approaches to improving disclosure: Experts\u2019  suggestions included a call for SEC to issue new guidance that focuses  specifically on environmental disclosure as a way of underscoring its  importance. Another suggestion was that the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board take action to improve procedures for evaluating the  effectiveness of companies\u2019 internal control policies and procedures as  they relate to environmental matters, in connection with the annual  management assessment of internal controls required by the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Among other things, according to one expert,  the board should issue guidance calling for independent auditors to verify  environmental remediation liabilities during financial statement audits,  with the assistance of specialists as necessary. Regarding the suggestion for  guidance focusing on environmental disclosure issues, representatives of  reporting companies said that SEC should first determine if there is a  compliance problem and, if one exists, the agency could issue special  guidance to highlight the importance of environmental disclosure  requirements. Company representatives did not see a need for specific  guidance on assessing internal controls over environmental matters. They  commented that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has  already issued a number of proposed rules for the auditing of companies\u2019  internal controls, which will encompass controls for environmental  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Experts Called for Better Monitoring and Targeted Enforcement Actions to Increase Environmental Disclosure", "paragraphs": ["A similar number (14 of 30) of the experts who participated in our survey  had suggestions for enhancing SEC oversight of environmental disclosure  through increased monitoring, enforcement, or coordination with EPA.  Specifically, some experts said that SEC should review more filings in  industries for which environmental disclosure is more likely to be a  concern and issue more comment letters for problematic filings to force  companies to reexamine their internal controls for the reporting of  environmental information. Some experts also suggested that SEC put  more emphasis on enforcing environmental disclosure requirements to (1)  establish legal precedents for adequate disclosure, (2) achieve greater  consistency in company reporting of environmental liabilities, and (3)  ensure that companies take seriously the reporting of environmental  information. While the experts did not specify how SEC should increase its  enforcement, many of those that offered suggestions believe that  increasing the emphasis on enforcement\u2014for example, by initiating a few  high-profile cases\u2014would better deter nondisclosure of important  environmental information. Two of the experts we surveyed did not see a  need for increasing SEC\u2019s monitoring and enforcement. They commented  that SEC is probably doing a reasonable job, given competing priorities and  the lack of evidence that disclosure of material environmental information  is inadequate. Representatives of reporting companies pointed out that the  frequency of SEC\u2019s reviews of annual 10-K filings and the amount of  resources available to conduct such reviews has increased significantly as  a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.", "Another suggestion from the experts was for better coordination between  SEC and EPA and state environmental agencies to obtain information  useful for evaluating companies\u2019 environmental disclosures. For example,  one expert suggested that SEC work with EPA to develop a protocol for  using EPA data on environmental remediation liabilities as an indicator of  whether companies are adequately reporting environmental information in  their filings. It was also suggested that SEC develop a mechanism for  comparing real-time information on environmental liabilities and their  related monetary sanctions with companies\u2019 filings. Some representatives  of reporting companies believed that coordination between EPA and SEC is  already occurring to the extent that SEC has access to publicly available  databases such as the Enforcement and Compliance History Online and  Toxics Release Inventory.

Another potential  vehicle for improving environmental disclosure, according to some  experts, is secondary markets, such as insurance and financial services. If  these markets started incorporating environmental information into their  company assessments, then companies would be more likely to disclose  such information to improve their relative standing. One expert suggested  creating a public database of companies\u2019 disclosure of environmental  performance measures, similar to the Toxics Release Inventory database  maintained by EPA. Such a database would allow investors to compare  companies\u2019 environmental performance across industries, thus creating an  incentive for companies to compete on that basis. Finally, some experts  cited shareholder resolutions as a vehicle for encouraging companies to  disclose environmental information or issue reports on corporate  environmental performance by petitioning for a proxy vote on such matters  by the entire body of shareholders.", "Representatives of reporting companies agreed that nonregulatory  approaches can be effective in making company management aware of  public interest in environmental disclosure. For example, some  representatives said that companies and trade associations have adopted  voluntary disclosure guidelines for environmental information, although  they also commented that projects such as the Global Reporting Initiative  do not inform investors with broad interests. According to the American  Chemistry Council, all of its members are required to publicly report on  their environmental management systems. While company representatives  acknowledged the growing number of socially responsible investors,  particularly among institutional investors, they said that investment  analysts have not demanded more information about environmental risks  and liabilities. The representatives also commented that secondary  markets would indeed prompt environmental disclosure if such  information were in demand.

At that  time, we will send copies to appropriate congressional committees; the  Chairman of SEC; the Administrator, EPA; and the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget.

Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix VII."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine key stakeholders\u2019 views on how well SEC has defined the  requirements for environmental disclosure, we first identified what  environmental information companies are required to disclose.  Specifically, we reviewed SEC\u2019s disclosure regulations, generally accepted  accounting principles promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards  Board, auditing standards issued by the AICPA, and applicable guidance  issued by all three entities. To confirm that we had identified all relevant  disclosure requirements and to clarify our understanding of them, we  interviewed officials within SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance and  Office of Chief Accountant. We met with a variety of groups that had a  stakeholder interest in the disclosure requirements because they (1) had a  particular interest in environmental disclosure; (2) used disclosure  information as investors, financial analysts, or researchers; or (3) were  involved in the disclosure process as reporters or preparers of SEC filings.  Our stakeholder contacts included representatives of investor  organizations, including those that identify themselves as socially  responsible and those with general investment interests; financial services  institutions; environmental groups, attorneys, and consultants; business  associations; credit rating agencies; and public accounting firms.", "To determine the extent to which companies are disclosing environmental  information in their filings with SEC, we identified existing studies on  environmental disclosure and analyzed their results and methodology.  First, we conducted a literature search on the Internet, using the keywords  \u201cSEC,\u201d \u201cdisclosure,\u201d and \u201cenvironmental,\u201d to identify references, including  studies, journal articles, and other material, that focused on the disclosure  of environmental information by publicly held companies. We identified  additional references by reviewing the bibliographies of the material from  the initial Internet search and through contacts with study authors. Overall,  we identified 152 references in material published from 1990 to 2003.", "To zero in on the most useful material, we established two criteria: (1) the  reference had to be relatively recent, with a date of 1995 or later, and (2) it  had to contain original research. After eliminating 50 references that were  published prior to 1995 and 75 references that reviewed or summarized  research performed by others, we were left with 27 studies that met our  criteria. (The studies were published, presented at a conference, or  provided by the authors during 1995 to 2003.) We reviewed each of the  remaining 27 studies in detail and (1) assessed each study\u2019s research  methodology, including its data quality, research design, and analytic  techniques and (2) summarized its major findings and conclusions. When a  study focused on compliance with disclosure requirements, we determined  whether the criteria used to assess the adequacy of companies\u2019 disclosures  were consistent with existing regulations, standards, and guidance. We also  assessed the extent to which each study\u2019s data and methods support its  findings and conclusions.", "Overall, we eliminated 8 of the 27 studies from our analyses because they  had severe methodological limitations or provided little or no information  on key aspects of the study methodology. We eliminated another four  studies because they did not address environmental disclosure in terms of  SEC\u2019s reporting requirements or examine the amount of environmental  information being disclosed. The latter four studies focused entirely on  other issues such as the impact of environmental disclosure on investor  behavior and the relationship between environmental disclosure and  market value. The remaining 15 studies had strong limitations, which  should be considered in interpreting the results, but the limitations were  not so severe as to preclude the studies\u2019 use. Appendix III briefly  summarizes the objectives, scope, and limitations of the 15 studies  included in our analyses.", "To supplement our review of existing disclosure studies, we also conducted  a limited examination of disclosures related to potential future risks,  focusing on the impacts of potential controls on greenhouse gas emissions  at 20 U.S. electric utilities with relatively high emissions of carbon dioxide.  We obtained emissions data from EPA\u2019s EGRID2002 database, using  emissions in 2000 (the most recent data available), and identified 20  utilities with high emissions that are also publicly traded companies  subject to SEC disclosure requirements. These companies were the AES  Corporation; Allegheny Energy, Inc.; Ameren Corporation; American  Electric Power Company, Inc.; CenterPoint Energy, Inc.; Cinergy  Corporation; Dominion Resources, Inc.; DTE Energy Company; Duke  Energy Corporation; Edison International; Entergy Corporation;  FirstEnergy Corporation; FPL Group, Inc.; Mirant Corporation; PPL  Corporation, Inc.; Progress Energy; Reliant Energy, Inc.; The Southern  Company; TXU Corporation; and Xcel Energy, Inc. For each company, we  reviewed the most recent available annual and quarterly filings, namely, the  fiscal year 2003 forms 10-K and 10-Q filings (including any such filings that  were amended). We looked for disclosures related to the impact of  potential controls over greenhouse gas emissions, including any discussion  of estimated risks to the utilities\u2019 operations or financial condition and the  estimated cost impact. To ensure that we identified all relevant disclosures,  we searched the documents for a number of key terms, including \u201cglobal  warming,\u201d \u201cclimate change,\u201d \u201cKyoto Protocol,\u201d \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d and  specific elements of greenhouse gases such as \u201ccarbon dioxide.\u201d We  focused on the sections of the filings most likely to yield disclosures related  to the impact of potential controls over greenhouse gas emissions,  including Forward-Looking Information (when it was included as a  separate section), item 1, Description of Business; item 3, Legal  Proceedings; item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of  Operations and Financial Condition; and item 8, Financial Statements and  Supplemental Data. When a company included its annual report to  shareholders in its filing by reference, we also reviewed that report in the  same manner as the filing. After extracting the relevant excerpts from the  filings, we created a table and categorized the disclosures by company and  type of disclosure.", "To assess the adequacy of SEC\u2019s efforts to monitor and enforce compliance  with the disclosure requirements, we obtained information from the  Division of Corporation Finance, which is responsible for reviewing  companies\u2019 filings to check their compliance with disclosure requirements,  and the Division of Enforcement, which has authority to initiate civil or  criminal actions to enforce the requirements. Specifically, we obtained  information on SEC\u2019s procedures for reviewing company filings, issuing  comment letters, and documenting the results; reviewed relevant  documents, including SEC\u2019s analysis of annual filings by Fortune 500  companies; obtained available statistics on SEC\u2019s monitoring and  enforcement process; and interviewed SEC reviewers responsible for  reviewing annual filings of companies in industries with a greater  likelihood of being affected by environmental disclosure requirements. We  also obtained information on enforcement actions by SEC\u2019s Division of  Enforcement, including cases involving environmental disclosure, and met  with officials within SEC and EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance  Assurance to obtain information on the nature of interagency coordination  on environmental disclosure.", "To obtain suggestions on actions for increasing and improving  environmental disclosure, we conducted a Web-based survey of 30 experts  on environmental disclosure issues. We selected the participants from a  larger group of 52 widely recognized experts on environmental disclosure,  which we compiled by consulting organizations and individuals with a  stakeholder interest in environmental disclosure, relevant literature,  authors of reports on disclosure issues, and other sources. We also  obtained assistance from the National Academies of Science in identifying  experts on environmental disclosure.", "In compiling our initial list of experts, we sought to achieve balance in  terms of various areas of expertise, including environmental laws and  regulations, accounting and auditing standards and guidance, SEC  disclosure requirements, the disclosure interests of socially responsible  investors, the disclosure interests of investors with general investment  interests; and the relationship between business strategy and corporate  governance. We also sought to achieve participation by experts from fields  that use the filings in some way, including auditing and accounting,  consulting, financial services, insurance, nonprofit advocacy groups, the  legal profession, public employee pension funds, credit rating agencies,  nonprofit research groups, and academia. Appendix IV lists the 30 experts  who participated in our survey.", "Our questionnaire focused on concerns about SEC\u2019s environmental  disclosure requirements, asking the experts for their views on the concerns  and for suggestions on how best to resolve them. To identify concerns, we  analyzed the results of 27 recent studies about environmental disclosure;  reviewed other relevant literature; and, as discussed earlier, interviewed  representatives of groups with a stakeholder interest in environmental  disclosure. In total, we identified 15 concerns, which we categorized into  five general areas: (1) addressing uncertainty regarding the likelihood and  amount of existing and potential liabilities related to environmental  contamination, (2) determining whether environmental information is  material, (3) disclosing future risks, (4) ensuring disclosure of important  environmental information, and (5) monitoring and enforcing  environmental disclosure. For each concern, we asked the experts about  the extent to which they shared the concern and thought that it contributed  to inadequate disclosure of environmental information. We also asked a  series of questions on the impact of inadequate disclosure and ways to  address problems related to inadequate disclosure.", "We pretested the questionnaire with five experts in Boston, Massachusetts,  and Washington, D.C., revised it based on the feedback we received, and  posted the final version on GAO\u2019s survey Web site. We notified the  participants of the availability of the questionnaire with an e-mail message,  which contained a unique user name and password for each. The  participants were able to log on and fill out the questionnaire but did not  have access to the responses of others. We obtained responses from all 30  experts for a response rate of 100 percent.", "We analyzed the content of the responses given to the open-ended  questions to identify suggestions for increasing and improving  environmental disclosure. For each question, two coders independently  read the responses and identified broad categories for the responses. We  discussed these categories and reached agreement on which ones to use.  Each coder then worked independently to classify responses into the  categories. The coders then compared their classifications and resolved  any differences through discussion so that there was 100 percent  agreement.", "Finally, we discussed the experts\u2019 suggestions with representatives of  businesses responsible for filing reports with SEC, including industries  such as electric utilities and chemical manufacturing in which  environmental disclosure is more likely to be relevant. We met with the  American Chemistry Council, the Business Roundtable, the Edison Electric  Institute, and the U.S. Business Council for Sustainable Development to get  their views; in addition to the staff from these associations, representatives  from approximately 10 companies participated in the discussions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principal Requirements and Guidance Applicable to the Disclosure of Environmental Information in SEC Filings", "paragraphs": ["Securities and Exchange Commission, Regulation S-X: Form and Content of and Requirements for Financial  Statements, Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,  Investment Company Act of 1940, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975,  37 Fed.
