The request was then forwarded to the  unit\u2019s purchase card agency program coordinator, who approved the  request and began the process for obtaining a new card from Citibank.  According to SPAWAR and Navy Public Works Center officials, specific  criteria did not exist for either the supervisors or the program coordinators  to use in requesting and approving purchase cards for employees. This  flawed policy has resulted in a proliferation of purchase cards at the two  units. For example, as of September 30, 2000, about one in three, or 36  percent of SPAWAR San Diego employees and about one in six, or 16  percent, of Navy Public Works Center San Diego employees were  cardholders.

At the Navy Public Works Center San Diego, the span of control problem  was not as serious, with six approving officials responsible for certifying  monthly summary statements covering an average of 55 monthly  statements for 254 cardholders. The span of control issue is particularly  important for purchase cards because supervisors and, in some cases,  cardholders themselves, are responsible for authorizing purchases, rather  than an independent contracting officer as is the case under the standard  procurement process.

Although we determined  that the policies and procedures related to cardholder responsibilities were  essentially the same under the previous Navy purchase card program, we  found that several cardholders had received the prior training as many as 2  years to 6 years before the current program began.

The  Navy requested that Citibank defer payment of all of the purchase card  rebates it earned since the current purchase card program began in  November 1998 because, according to DOD and Navy officials, it had not  yet determined how to record and allocate the rebates to Navy programs.  According to Citibank officials, Citibank plans to pay cumulative purchase  card rebates and accrued interest to the Navy on July 31, 2001, the payment  date required in the Navy\u2019s latest purchase card contract task order  modification. Citibank estimates that the total payment will be about $8.8  million, including an estimated $8.3 million in cumulative rebates and an  estimated $530,000 in accrued interest on these rebates. In addition, the  Navy had not established policies and procedures for managing rebates and  had not monitored its rebate earnings. As a result, the Navy, SPAWAR San  Diego, and the Navy Public Works Center San Diego were not aware that  Citibank had miscalculated the rebates that SPAWAR and the Navy Public  Works Center should have earned during fiscal year 2000 by about  $150,000.

However, the Instruction does not require written  reports on the results of internal reviews to be submitted to either local  management or a central Navy office for monitoring and oversight. As a  result, the Navy did not have a consistent process for documenting the  results of purchase card reviews, identifying systemic problems, and  monitoring corrective actions to help ensure that they are effectively  implemented. This weakness also impaired the Navy\u2019s ability to assess  purchase card controls for possible inclusion in its Annual Statements of  Assurance pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3512(d) (commonly referred to as the  Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982), which requires agency  heads to make annual disclosures regarding the adequacy of their internal  controls.

The problems identified were consistent with the control weaknesses  discussed later in this testimony, including lack of independent  documentation that the Navy received items ordered by purchase card,  accountable items that were not recorded in the property records,  inadequate documentation for transactions, split purchases, and  transactions that did not appear to be related to government business  purposes.", "During our review, we saw correspondence and other documentation  showing that SPAWAR San Diego management had considered the findings  identified in its agency program coordinator evaluations, but directed that  corrective actions should not be implemented due to complaints from  cardholders and their supervisors regarding the administrative burden  associated with procedural changes that would be needed to address the  review findings. As a result, the agency program coordinator had not used  these reviews to make systematic improvements in the program. Rather,  these reviews generally resulted in the reviewer counseling the cardholders  or, in some instances, recommending that cardholders attend purchase  card training. During fiscal year 2000, the SPAWAR San Diego Office of  Command Evaluation internal review group had not conducted any reviews  or audits of the purchase card program. Further, although the SPAWAR San  Diego Command Inspector General reviewed the SPAWAR purchase card  program during fiscal year 2000 and prepared a draft report summarizing  the results of this review, the final report has not yet been issued.

As a result, there is no documented evidence that the  government received the items purchased or that those items were not lost,  stolen, or misused.

NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94 and, to a greater extent, a policy  memorandum issued by the Navy Comptroller\u2019s office on June 3, 1999, do  not provide adequate internal controls and are inconsistent with the  responsibilities of certifying officers reflected in statutes and DOD\u2019s fiscal  policy guidance. Approving officials at the two units told us that they were  not following the existing procedures due to time constraints and the Navy  Comptroller\u2019s policy memorandum.", "Under 31 U.S.C. 3325 and DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation,  disbursements are required to be made on the basis of a voucher certified  by an authorized agency official. The certifying official is responsible for  ensuring (1) the adequacy of supporting documentation, (2) the accuracy  of payment calculations, and (3) the legality of the proposed payment  under the appropriation or fund charged. Proper certification of bills for  payment is a preventive control that requires and provides the incentive for  certifying officers to maintain proper controls over public funds. It also  helps detect fraud and improper payments, including invalid (unsupported  or prohibited) transactions, split purchases, and duplicate payments.  Further, section 933 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2000 requires the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations that  ensure, among other things, that each purchase cardholder and approving  official is responsible for reconciling charges on a billing statement with  receipts and other supporting documentation.", "According to NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94, upon receipt of the individual  cardholder statement, the cardholder has 5 days to reconcile the  transactions appearing on the statement by verifying their accuracy to the  supporting documents and notify the approving official in writing of any  discrepancies in the statement or sign and forward it to the approving  official. The approving official is responsible for ensuring that all purchases  made by the cardholders within his or her cognizance were appropriate and  that the charges are accurate. However, the Instruction further states that  within 5 days of receipt of the cardholders\u2019 statements, the approving  official must review and certify the monthly summary statement for  payment, whether or not the cardholder has reviewed the statement and  notified the official of any discrepancies or agreement with the statement.  That is, the approving official is to presume that all transactions on the  monthly statements are proper unless notified in writing by the purchase  cardholder.", "Under this process, the certifying officer relies upon the silence of a  cardholder who may have failed to timely forward corrections or  exceptions to the account statement or, even worse, may not have even  reviewed the statement. A certifying officer in these circumstances is not  taking steps to assure that a payment is proper and an agency therefore  cannot rely on the certification for assurance that a payment is for the  proper amount and a legal purpose.", "This NAVSUP policy is inconsistent with the purpose of certifying vouchers  prior to payment, which is to maintain proper control over public funds and  assure that payments are made for proper amounts and purposes.  Certifying officers are responsible for the correctness of facts and  computations in the voucher, and the legality of the proposed payment  under the appropriation involved. A certifying officer is liable for losses  resulting from improper certifications, but may be relieved from liability if  the certification was based upon official records and the officer did not  know, and could not have reasonably discovered, the correct information.  While certifying officials may rely on systems, controls, and personnel that  process transactions rather than personally reviewing the supporting  documentation, they must show that their reliance was reasonable.  Regardless of what system is used, there is no authority to make known  improper payments. At SPAWAR and the Navy Public Works Center, the  certifying officers relied on a process without assurances that even a  minimal review of the facts and computations underlying the proposed  payment or the legality of such payment was carried out before  certification was made. Thus, the certifying officers may not be able to  demonstrate that their reliance on such a system is reasonable.", "In addition to the problems with NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94, the Navy  Comptroller\u2019s June 3, 1999, policy memorandum further weakens the  certification process. The policy memorandum does not explicitly state  that the cardholder must review the statement of account and notify the  approving official of any improper or incorrect items within 5 days of  receipt. Nonetheless, the approving official must certify the invoices based  on the presumption that all cardholder accounts are proper unless notified  in writing within 5 days of receipt of the invoice. Navy officials told us that  it is assumed that cardholders would review the statements and notify the  approving officials of any problems. While the cardholder\u2019s review is not  explicitly required, the memorandum states that the change in policy \u201cwill  ensure that the cardholder will inform the AO  in a  prompt manner of any duplicate payments or fraudulent or improper  charges to his account.\u201d Again, by requiring certification within 5 days,  whether or not a cardholder has reviewed a statement, the June 3, 1999,  policy memorandum requires a certifying officer to rely upon a process that  does not require review of a proposed payment or otherwise assure that a  payment is properly payable before certification occurs.", "All seven approving officials at the two activities (one at SPAWAR and six  at the Navy Public Works Center) told us that they never reviewed the  cardholders\u2019 supporting documentation before signing and submitting  purchase card statements for payment. Accordingly, we assessed the  failure rate for this control as 100 percent for both SPAWAR San Diego and  the Navy Public Works Center San Diego. Approving officials explained  that they certify purchase card statements for payment without reviewing  cardholders\u2019 supporting documentation because (1) they do not have time  to review the documentation and (2) the Navy Comptroller\u2019s June 3, 1999,  guidance relieves them of this responsibility.", "With regard to the first issue, both activities are faced with a significant  span of control issue that makes the overall purchase card environment  difficult, if not impossible, to control. With an average of over 700 monthly  cardholder statements at SPAWAR San Diego and only one approving  official\u2014who is also the Agency Program Coordinator\u2014proper  certification of monthly summary statements within 5 days of receipt is not  physically possible. Thus, the SPAWAR San Diego approving official told us  that the certification process is largely a \u201crubber stamp\u201d with no real  verification of the underlying cardholder support for the monthly summary  statements. The environment is somewhat more manageable at the Navy  Public Works Center San Diego, with six approving officials charged with  certifying summary statements that cover an average of 55 cardholder  statements each month. However, Public Works Center approving officials  also told us that they did not review all cardholder supporting  documentation before certifying purchase card statements for payment. As  a result, these two Navy units paid their monthly purchase card bills  without knowing whether the charges were valid. As discussed later in this  statement, this has contributed to payments being made for unauthorized  and improper transactions.", "With regard to the second issue, the June 3, 1999, policy memorandum  appears to improperly assign certifying officer accountability to  cardholders. The policy memorandum stated that because it is not possible  for the approving official to personally review and verify individual  cardholder transactions and statements of account, the approving official  is to certify the purchase card statements for payment based on the  presumption that all cardholder accounts are proper unless the approving  official has been notified to the contrary by the cardholder. The  memorandum goes on to say that, \u201chis new policy recognizes that the  ultimate responsibility for purchases being proper is with the cardholder.\u201d  However, under 31 U.S.C. 3528 and DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation, certifying officers are liable for an illegal, improper, or  incorrect payment as a result of an inaccurate or misleading certification.  An agency may not shift certifying officer liability to other employees. The  policy memorandum is also inconsistent with GAO\u2019s internal control  standard for ensuring that only valid transactions are entered into.

The cardholder, who was having financial problems, was hired  by her stepfather, who was the club\u2019s treasurer.  The stepfather delegated  nearly all purchase card duties to the cardholder, as well as the authority  for writing checks to pay the Flying Club\u2019s monthly purchase card  statements.  The cardholder made over $17,000 in fraudulent transactions  to acquire personal items from Wal-Mart, The Home Depot, shoe stores, pet  stores, boutiques, an eye care center, and restaurants over an 8-month  period from December 1998 through July 1999.  The fraud was identified  when the club\u2019s checking account was overdrawn due to excessively high  purchase card payments and a bank official contacted the president of the  Flying Club.  The cardholder pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15  months in jail and assessed about $28,486 in restitution due to purchase  card fraud and bounced checks.

In this instance, the military officer allegedly conspired  with cardholders under his supervision to make nearly $400,000 in  fraudulent purchases from five companies\u2014two that he owned, one owned  by his sister, and the other two owned by friends or acquaintances.   They  charged thousands of dollars for items such as DVD players, Palm Pilots,  and desktop and laptop computers.

Investigators were only able to obtain a  partial list consisting of 681 compromised accounts so the exact number is  not known.  At least 45 of the compromised accounts were for SPAWAR  San Diego and one of the compromised accounts was for the Navy Public  Works Center in San Diego.  Of these 46 compromised accounts, 22  SPAWAR San Diego accounts were still active in May 2001.  None of the  active accounts on the partial listing found by investigators were for the  Navy Public Works Center San Diego.  Although the account numbers  showed up on a computer printer in a community college library in San  Diego in September 1999, the Navy has not canceled all of the  compromised accounts.  Instead, according to NCIS and Navy Supply  Command officials, the Navy is canceling the compromised accounts as  fraudulent transactions are identified.  Naval Supply Systems Command,  SPAWAR San Diego, and Navy Public Works Center San Diego officials told  us that they were aware of this incident but did not have a listing of the  account numbers affected.  As a result, the Navy did not take any measures  to flag the compromised accounts and implement special monitoring  procedures to detect any potential fraudulent use of these accounts.", "According to Navy investigators, as of January 2001, at least 30 of the  compromised account numbers had been used by 27 alleged suspects to  make more than $27,000 in fraudulent transactions for pizza, jewelry, phone  calls, tires, and flowers.  As of May 21, 2001, 22 of the compromised  SPAWAR accounts were still active.  Our review of the monthly credit limits  associated with the 22 compromised accounts showed that SPAWAR  continued to have an aggregate monthly financial exposure of $900,000  associated with these accounts nearly 2 years after the compromised list  was discovered in a San Diego community college library in September  1999.  Further, with the lack of controls over receipt of goods and  certification of purchase card statements that we identified at the two  activities we reviewed, it is impossible for the Navy to identify fraudulent  purchases as they occur or to determine the extent of the fraudulent use of  the compromised accounts.  As a result, when fraudulent use of one of the  comprised accounts was identified, the Navy could not determine if the  incident was due to cardholder fraud or use of the compromised account  by an outside party.  A joint task force in San Diego, comprised of NCIS, the  U.S. Secret Service, local police, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, investigated  this fraud.

Our assessment of SPAWAR San Diego and the Navy  Public Works Center San Diego purchase card controls covered   the overall management control environment, including (1) span of  control issues related to the number of cardholders, (2) training for  cardholders and accountable officers, (3) management of rebates, and  (4) monitoring and audit of purchase card activity;  tests of statistical samples of key controls over purchase card  transactions, including (1) documentation of independent confirmation  that items ordered by purchase card were received, (2) proper  certification of purchase card statements for payment, and (3) proper  accounting for purchase card transactions;   substantive tests of accountable items in our sample transactions to  verify whether they were recorded in property records and whether they  could be found; and   analysis of the universe of transactions to identify (1) any potentially  improper, fraudulent, and abusive transactions and (2) purchases that  were split into one or more transactions to avoid micro-purchase  thresholds or other credit limits.", "We used as our primary criteria applicable laws and regulations; our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government; and our  Guide for Evaluating and Testing Controls Over Sensitive Payments.

We  stratified the samples into two groups\u2014transactions from computer  vendors and other vendors. With this statistically valid probability sample,  each transaction in the population had a nonzero probability of being  included, and that probability could be computed for any transaction. Each  sample element was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account  statistically for all the transactions in the population, including those that  were not selected.

For these reviews, we did not look for all  potential abuses of purchase cards. For example, because a large number  of store receipts (such as those from The Home Depot) were missing, we  were unable to determine whether certain purchases were made for  personal use. In addition, we did not physically examine purchases made to  determine whether goods and services were received and used for  government purposes. While we identified some improper and potentially  fraudulent and abusive transactions, our work was not designed to identify,  and we cannot determine, the extent of fraudulent, improper, or abusive  transactions.", "We briefed DOD managers, including officials in DOD\u2019s Purchase Card  Joint Program Management Office and the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service, and Navy managers, including Navy Supply Command,  Navy Comptroller, SPAWAR San Diego, and Navy Public Works Center San  Diego officials on the details of our review, including our objectives, scope,  and methodology and our findings and conclusions.
