This report examines, among other things, the extent to which DOD has (1) visibility over such reported incidents, and (2) developed and implemented policies and procedures to respond to and resolve these incidents. GAO reviewed relevant policies and guidance; interviewed officials at a nongeneralizable sample of seven military installations; analyzed program data; interviewed parents of children affected by abuse; and interviewed DOD, service, and civilian officials, including at children's advocacy centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has limited visibility over reported incidents of child abuse\u2014physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, or neglect by a caregiver\u2014and child-on-child abuse due to standalone databases, information sharing challenges, and installation discretion. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the military services recorded more than 69,000 reported incidents of child abuse (see figure). However, personnel at all seven installations in GAO's review stated that they use discretion to determine which incidents to present to the Incident Determination Committee (IDC)\u2014the installation-based committee responsible for reviewing reports and determining whether they meet DOD's criteria for abuse (an act of abuse and an actual or potential impact, e.g., spanking that left a welt). Per DOD guidance, every reported incident must be presented to the IDC unless there is no possibility that it could meet any of the criteria for abuse. However, personnel described incidents they had screened out that, per DOD guidance, should have been presented to the IDC. Without the services developing a process to monitor how incidents are screened at installations, DOD does not know the total number of reported child abuse incidents across the department.", "While DOD has expanded its child abuse policies and procedures to include child-on-child sexual abuse, gaps exist. For example, DOD standardized the IDC process in 2016, but the new structure does not include medical personnel with expertise, contrary to best practices for substantiating child abuse allegations. Without expanding the IDC membership to include medical personnel, members may not have all of the relevant information needed to make fully informed decisions, potentially affecting confidence in the efficacy of the committee's decisions. GAO also found that the availability of certified pediatric sexual assault forensic examiners across DOD is limited\u2014according to DOD officials, there are only 11 in comparison to 1,448 incidents of child sexual abuse that met DOD's criteria for abuse from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Without processes that help ensure timely access to certified pediatric examiners, child victims of sexual abuse overseas may not receive exams in time for evidence to be collected for use in prosecution, increasing the stress and trauma of affected victims."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 23 recommendations, including that the military services develop a process to monitor how reported incidents are screened at installations, that DOD expand the membership of the IDC to include medical personnel, and that DOD establish processes that help ensure timely access to certified pediatric examiners overseas.

DOD policy defines child abuse as the physical,  sexual, or emotional abuse, or neglect of a child by a parent, guardian,  foster parent, or caregiver. Incidents of child abuse, including child-on- child abuse, can cause a range of emotional and physical trauma for  military families, ultimately affecting servicemember performance and  readiness.", "Since 2018, a number of media reports have highlighted challenges  regarding DOD\u2019s response to incidents of child-on-child sexual abuse  occurring on military installations in the United States and overseas,  including within DOD Education Activity (DODEA) schools. DODEA  operates 163 schools in 11 countries, 7 states, Guam, and Puerto Rico  that collectively serve more than 70,000 children of active duty military  and DOD civilian families. DOD\u2019s efforts related to child-on-child abuse  are currently focused on problematic sexual behavior in children and  youth, which is defined in policy as behaviors that involve sexual body  parts in a manner that deviates from normative or typical sexual behavior  and that are developmentally inappropriate or potentially harmful to the  individuals initiating or impacted by the behavior. Amid these media reports, you asked us to assess how DOD addresses incidents of child  abuse, including child-on-child abuse, occurring on military installations or  involving military dependents. This report assesses the extent to which  DOD (1) has visibility over such reported incidents, (2) has developed and  implemented policies and procedures to respond to and resolve these  incidents, and (3) collaborates with other governmental and  nongovernmental organizations to address these incidents.", "For our first objective, we analyzed data from the three primary  organizations that DOD officials identified as having responsibility for  tracking these incidents. Our review included data on any abuse of a child  (emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, or neglect) by an adult and child- on-child abuse\u2014any physical or sexual abuse of a child (under the age of  18) by another child. First, we analyzed data from the Army, the Navy,  the Marine Corps, and the Air Force\u2019s Family Advocacy Programs  (FAP)\u2014which, among other things, provide trauma-informed assessment,  rehabilitation, and treatment to persons who are involved in alleged  incidents of child abuse\u2014on all reported incidents of child abuse for fiscal  years 2014 through 2018. We selected this timeframe to evaluate trends  over 5 years, and fiscal year 2018 was the most recent year for which  complete data were available at the time of our review. Specifically, we  analyzed the data to determine the number of reported incidents of child  abuse by service and the percentage of those that met DOD\u2019s criteria for  child abuse, as well as to describe the characteristics of these incidents.  To assess the reliability of the service FAPs\u2019 child abuse data, we  reviewed related documentation; assessed the data for errors, omissions,  and inconsistencies; and interviewed officials. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable to describe trends in reported incidents of  child abuse across the services and characteristics of such incidents from  fiscal years 2014 through 2018.", "Second, we analyzed data from the military criminal investigative  organizations\u2014the Army Criminal Investigation Command, the Naval  Criminal Investigative Service, and the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations\u2014for the same time period for all investigations with a child  victim. Specifically, we analyzed the data to identify trends in the number of investigations over the past 5 fiscal years and to identify key  characteristics of the investigations. To assess the reliability of the military  criminal investigative organizations\u2019 child victim investigation data, we  assessed the data for errors, omissions, and inconsistencies, and we  interviewed officials. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable to describe trends in child victim investigations across the  services and the characteristics of such investigations from fiscal years  2014 through 2018.", "Third, we analyzed three sources of DODEA data: (1) child abuse reports  from school years 2014-2015 through 2017-2018, (2) serious incident  reports from school years 2013-2014 through 2017-2018, and (3) student  misconduct records from school years 2016-2017 through 2017-2018.  We selected this timeframe to evaluate serious incident report trends over  5 years, and school year 2017-2018 was the most recent year for which  complete data were available at the time of our review.

To assess the reliability of DODEA\u2019s child abuse reports  and serious incident reports, we reviewed related documentation;  assessed the data for errors, omissions, and inconsistencies; and  interviewed officials. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable to describe trends in and characteristics of child abuse reports  from school years 2014-2015 through 2017-2018 and serious incident  reports from school years 2013-2014 through 2017-2018, as well as to  compare serious incident reports to DODEA student misconduct records  from school years 2016-2017 through 2017-2018.", "We also conducted an analysis of DODEA\u2019s student misconduct records  for school years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 to determine the number of  student misconduct records that school administrators, using DODEA\u2019s  guidance, could have reasonably categorized as a violation of law or  sexual event and filed a serious incident report. We selected these 2  school years for the analysis because DODEA\u2019s updated serious incident  reporting guidance was issued in August 2016 and was in place for both  school years. We compared the number of student misconduct records  for which we determined school administrators, using the guidance, could  have reasonably filed a serious incident report with the number of serious  incidents recorded by DODEA for the same time period to determine the  extent of DODEA\u2019s visibility into serious incidents. We discussed the  student misconduct records and our analysis with DODEA officials.", "Further, we interviewed relevant DOD and service officials at the  headquarters level and at a nongeneralizable sample of seven military  installations to identify how DOD tracks reported incidents of child abuse  from the time of a report to an ultimate adjudication, including how  information is communicated within and across the services. We selected  at least one installation per service as well as two joint installations, and  selected locations based on the number of reported child abuse incidents  and the number of investigated child-on-child abuse incidents, as well as  other factors. Specifically, we selected installations that had a high  number of reported incidents of child abuse, a high number of child-on- child abuse investigations\u2014or both\u2014from fiscal years 2014 through 2018  in order to maximize the possibility we would interview officials,  responders, and care providers who had responded to reported incidents  of child abuse. Other selection factors included a mix of types of  legislative jurisdiction, at least some installations with DODEA schools, a  high number of DODEA serious incident reports, and a mix of geographic  locations in the United States and overseas. We compared information  from our data analyses and interviews to DOD guidance; GAO-identified  practices for developing and maintaining a reliable schedule; GAO- identified leading practices for results-oriented management; and  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to  quality information, designing control activities, and monitoring activities.", "For our second objective, we reviewed relevant DOD and service policies,  guidance, reports, and memoranda on child abuse, juvenile misconduct,  and problematic sexual behavior in children and youth. We also  conducted work at the previously mentioned nongeneralizable sample of  seven military installations in the United States and overseas where we  interviewed a variety of personnel responsible for tracking, responding to,  and resolving these incidents. To obtain the perspectives of parents and  guardians of children who have been affected by abuse (either by an  adult or another child) on military installations or while they were military  dependents, we interviewed, using a structured questionnaire, 20 parents  and guardians by phone. These parents and guardians volunteered to  speak with us about their perspectives on available resources and  assistance, case communication, and the investigative and adjudicative  processes. We compared the information from the selected installations  and interviews to GAO-developed practices to enhance and sustain  collaboration in interagency groups, Department of Justice (DOJ) best  practices for sexual assault forensic examination kits, and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government related to quality  information.", "For our third objective, we reviewed written agreements in place with  civilian organizations at the five nongeneralizable installations located in  the United States in our review, such as agreements with local civilian law  enforcement and state child welfare agencies that pertain to how  incidents of child abuse on the installation are to be addressed. We also  interviewed relevant officials from civilian organizations near the five U.S.  installations in our review, such as state and local child welfare agencies,  law enforcement organizations, prosecuting attorneys\u2019 offices, and  Children\u2019s Advocacy Centers (CAC) to determine the extent of their  collaboration with the military and any related challenges. In addition,  we interviewed DOJ officials regarding the prosecution of juvenile crimes  committed on overseas installations and on some U.S. installations.  Further, we contacted officials from the National Children\u2019s Alliance,  which accredits CACs, about its efforts with DOD to improve collaboration  between the military and CACs.

If a civilian commits a crime in exclusive federal  jurisdiction, he or she may be prosecuted under federal law through the  appropriate United States Attorney\u2019s Office. However, if a civilian commits  a crime in concurrent or proprietary jurisdiction, he or she may be  prosecuted by the state.

The conference  report also directed the Secretaries of the military departments to report  to the defense committees on these efforts 15 months after the  enactment of the Act. In June 2019, the Acting Deputy Secretary of  Defense issued a memorandum directing each military department to  seek to establish concurrent jurisdiction with the respective states for  offenses committed by juveniles in areas on military installations that are  currently exclusive federal jurisdiction. This action seeks to provide  ways for the department to address actions by children in areas of  exclusive federal jurisdiction that may constitute a crime, such as some  instances of problematic sexual behavior in children and youth, since,  absent unusual circumstances, children and other civilians are not subject  to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

These officials also noted that federal  prosecution is usually declined for such cases.", "There are various laws and agreements in place regarding crimes  committed on U.S. military installations or involving servicemembers or  military dependents overseas. These laws include U.S. criminal laws that  may be applied extraterritorially, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction  Act, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and host nation laws. Whether  a particular law provides extraterritorial jurisdiction over such crimes  depends on the specific facts of the incident, such as the nature and  location of the alleged crime, the status of the alleged offender  (servicemember or civilian), and the nationalities of the alleged offender  and the victim.

While DOD is developing a new database  to track problematic sexual behavior in children and youth, it has not yet  made key decisions about its development and implementation, which  could further affect visibility. In addition, challenges related to information  sharing limit visibility over child abuse incidents within and across the  military services. Further, Family Advocacy Program (FAP) installation  personnel are given considerable discretion in deciding how reported  incidents of child abuse are tracked and reported, as are DODEA school  personnel with regard to incidents of child-on-child abuse, which also  hinders the department\u2019s visibility over these incidents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Standalone Databases Limit DOD\u2019s Visibility over Reported Incidents and Key Decisions Related to a New Database Have Not Yet Been Made", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Standalone Service Databases Limit the Department\u2019s Visibility over Both the Extent to Which Children Have Been Affected by Abuse and Incident Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Each military service maintains multiple standalone databases that  separately track the reporting, response to, and resolution of each  reported incident of child abuse, which limits DOD\u2019s visibility over the  extent to which children have been affected by abuse on military  installations or as military dependents and its visibility over incident  outcomes. Depending on the reported incident, information regarding the  alleged abuse may be retained in multiple databases or only one  database. Specifically, each service\u2019s FAP has a database\u2014referred to  as the \u201ccentral registry\u201d\u2014where it tracks the total number of reported  incidents of child abuse (by a parent or someone in a caregiving role) and  detailed information, such as information about the offender, victim, and  type of abuse, for incidents that met DOD\u2019s criteria for abuse. Incidents  of abuse where the alleged offender was not in a caregiving role are not  tracked in the FAPs\u2019 central registries and would only be tracked as  incidents of abuse if they were investigated by military law enforcement.  Information associated with investigations of these incidents by any  military criminal investigative organization is tracked in a separate  database maintained by each investigative organization. If the alleged  offender was a servicemember, information related to the adjudication or  case resolution is tracked in the relevant service\u2019s military justice  database maintained by the services\u2019 legal offices. Figure 1 shows the  department\u2019s databases for tracking the abuse of children and how they  differ depending on the circumstances of the incident.", "Because of DOD\u2019s multiple standalone data systems, it is difficult to know  the extent to which children have been affected by abuse on military  installations or as military dependents. From fiscal years 2014 through  2018, the military service FAPs\u2019 central registries recorded more than  69,000 reported incidents of child abuse, of which 48 percent met DOD\u2019s  criteria for abuse. Over this same time period, the military criminal  investigative organizations conducted approximately 9,500 investigations  involving a child victim, some but not all of which may have also been  recorded in the service FAPs\u2019 central registries. Figures 2 and 3 show  the number of incidents of child abuse reported to the military service  FAPs and the number of military investigations involving a child victim  from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, respectively.", "However, the number of incidents tracked by both organizations cannot  simply be added together because, as previously discussed, there is  some overlap between them. For example, an incident of child sexual  abuse inflicted by a servicemember parent or a teacher would likely be in  both databases. Moreover, neither the service FAPs nor the military  criminal investigative organizations individually track all reported incidents  of abuse. Specifically, the FAP only tracks information related to abuse  inflicted by a parent, guardian, or someone in a caregiving role. It does  not capture incidents of abuse inflicted by, for example, a neighbor who  was not babysitting at the time of the incident. While the services\u2019 military  criminal investigative organizations track any abuse of a child that rises to  their level of investigation, such as a felony or sexual offense\u2014regardless  of the relationship between the alleged offender and the victim\u2014they only  investigate certain crimes. For example, an incident of child neglect would  likely only be in the FAP\u2019s central registry because incidents of neglect do  not typically rise to the level of a military criminal investigative  organization investigation. Similarly, an August 2019 report by the  Defense Health Board found that it is difficult to establish the true  incidence of child abuse across the department due to challenges  associated with the underreporting of cases and unreliable capture of  data.", "Standalone databases also limit DOD\u2019s visibility over incident outcomes.  Depending on the reported incident of abuse\u2014for example, child sexual  abuse inflicted by a servicemember parent\u2014to get the most complete  picture of how the incident was reported, responded to, and resolved,  service officials would need to query three databases: the FAP, military  criminal investigative organization, and military justice databases. Navy  legal officials stated that a centralized database for all child abuse  incidents\u2014that tracks the FAP\u2019s determination about whether the incident  met DOD\u2019s criteria for abuse, the investigation, and resolution\u2014would be  beneficial because it is currently very difficult to track an incident from the  initial report to its final outcome in order to easily determine what  happened in a particular case. These officials further stated that such a  database would benefit commanders\u2019 oversight of cases for which they  are responsible.", "The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019 included a provision directing DOD to establish and maintain a  centralized database on each incident of problematic sexual behavior in  children and youth reviewed by an installation FAP. Specifically, per the  statute, for each substantiated and unsubstantiated incident of  problematic sexual behavior, the database is to track a description of the  allegation, whether or not a FAP review of the case has been completed,  the status and results of any related law enforcement investigation, and  the nature of any action taken. Officials responsible for the development  of the database\u2014which is supposed to begin in fiscal year 2020\u2014stated  that it will maintain information related solely to cases of problematic  sexual behavior and will not include other types of child-on-child abuse,  such as physical assaults not of a sexual nature. Additionally, these  officials stated that they do not have plans to expand the scope of the  database to include any adult-on-child inflicted abuse.", "As a result, even once the centralized database on problematic sexual  behavior in children and youth is implemented, DOD will still lack a  centralized mechanism to track the reporting, response to, and resolution  of other incidents of abuse involving children that were reported to the  FAP or investigated by a military law enforcement organization\u2014 specifically, any abuse or neglect inflicted by an adult or physical abuse  inflicted by another child. DOD officials responsible for the development  of the database stated that they do not plan to expand the scope of the  centralized database because they do not want to conflate the processes  for responding to incidents of adult-inflicted child abuse and incidents of  problematic sexual behavior. While the response process differs between  incidents of adult-inflicted child abuse and incidents of problematic sexual  behavior, DOD officials acknowledged that the organizations involved in  the response process and the primary data sources are the same.", "Additionally, DOD FAP officials stated the scope of the centralized  database was defined in statute and that they foresee additional privacy  and data-safeguarding issues if they were to expand its scope. While the  statute indicated what must be included in the database, it did not limit the  scope of the database to those required elements. DOD not only lacks  visibility over incidents of problematic sexual behavior, but over any  reported abuse of a child and could therefore benefit from a centralized  tracking mechanism for all such incidents. With regard to privacy and  data-safeguarding concerns, according to DOD, data-safeguarding  precautions were taken when developing the Defense Sexual Assault  Incident Database, which the department successfully implemented.  While the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database does not contain  information pertaining to children, it contains sensitive information that the  department has taken steps to protect. Specifically, according to DOD,  the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database is reviewed annually to  ensure all security controls are maintained and it is secured using  physical, technical, and administrative controls, such as role-based  permissions, to maintain the privacy of personal information. DOD FAP  officials also expressed concerns about maintaining information about  both adults and children in the centralized database. However,  information about both adults and children is included in the service  FAPs\u2019 central registries and the military criminal investigative  organizations\u2019 databases.

Without a centralized database that tracks all incidents of abuse involving  children that were reported to the FAP or investigated by a military law  enforcement organization, DOD and Congress will not know the extent to  which children have been affected by abuse on military installations or as  military dependents, or how such incidents have been responded to and  resolved\u2014making it difficult to identify and address trends that could lead  to further prevention efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Yet Made Key Decisions Related to the Development of Its Database to Track Problematic Sexual Behavior", "paragraphs": ["While DOD is in the early stages of developing a centralized database to  track incidents of problematic sexual behavior in children and youth, it has  not yet made key decisions about its development and implementation,  which could further affect visibility over such incidents.

However, as previously discussed, DOD officials expect to complete the  bulk of the development this fiscal year. In November 2006, we found that  establishing a valid need and translating that into a service acquisition  requirement is essential for obtaining the right outcome. Without this, an  organization increases the risk that it will pay too much for the services  provided, acquire services that do not meet its needs, or enter too quickly  into a sensitive arrangement that exposes the organization to financial,  performance, or other risks. Additionally, Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government states that management should use quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives, which includes identifying  information requirements that consider the expectations of both internal  and external users.

However, installation personnel described  reported incidents of child abuse that had been screened out that, per  DOD guidance, should have been presented to the IDC. For example,  FAP officials at one installation stated that they screen out reports of  spanking by a parent if there is no mark. Since DOD\u2019s list of actions  considered to be nonaccidental physical force includes spanking, it meets  at least one of DOD\u2019s criteria for child abuse and should be presented to  the IDC for a determination.

FAP officials at a different installation stated that the  medical clinics were not previously reporting suspected abuse to the FAP,  but are now doing so.

The types of incidents  described in the student misconduct records included, among other  things, the use of physical force by a student on another student that  resulted in an injury; a student touching another student\u2019s groin, breasts,  or buttocks without consent; and verbal and behavioral sexual  harassment. However, for this time period\u2014for which DODEA reported  the highest number of serious incidents from school years 2013-2014  through 2017-2018\u2014DODEA only reported 89 serious incidents. In  addition, DODEA officials stated that prior to August 2018, up to one-third  of schools were not recording student misconduct in the student  information system because they were not required to do so and, as a  result, we were not able to review any misconduct records for those  schools.", "Challenges related to the reporting of serious incidents were also  highlighted in our interviews with parents and DODEA school  administrators. Specifically, two of the parents of children affected by  child-on-child sexual abuse that we interviewed discussed incidents that  occurred within DODEA schools. They both stated that they received  information about the incidents as part of Freedom of Information Act  requests and that the schools had not reported the abuse as serious  incidents. For one of these incidents, we identified a corresponding  DODEA child abuse report, but not a serious incident report. Per DODEA  guidance, the incident should have been categorized as a serious  incident (but not as child abuse) because the offender was a student\u2014 child abuse reports are only to be filed if the alleged offender was an  individual responsible for the child\u2019s welfare, such as a parent or a  teacher.", "In addition, at one installation in our review, FAP personnel discussed a  recent sexual assault within a DODEA school. When we discussed this  incident with a senior DODEA official who is to be notified of all serious  incidents reported in the region in which the school is located, the official  was unaware of the incident because it was not categorized as a sexual  assault in the serious incident report and another senior official for the  region had handled it directly. Further, administrators at one of the  DODEA schools we visited stated that the reporting guidelines are not  fully clear and that they often call the superintendent\u2019s office for advice on  what to report and how to report it.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should internally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Specifically, management  communicates quality information down and across reporting lines to  enable personnel to perform key roles in achieving objectives. However,  DODEA\u2019s guidance affords school administrators discretion in what to  report because it does not explicitly define what types of serious incidents  must be reported. While the guidance identifies and defines a number of  incidents that could be reported as serious incidents, and provides  detailed examples\u2014like a student intentionally exposing their genitals or  a student posting naked or suggestive photos of another student online\u2014 the guidance does not mandate that these incidents be reported.  Specifically, the guidance states that the lists of events, activities, and  paraphernalia described in the guidance as serious incidents are  illustrative only and do not identify every incident that may be  inappropriate, nor require that each incident result in a serious incident  report.", "While DODEA officials noted that both reporting and their visibility over  serious incidents has been improving, they acknowledged that  administrators may not be reporting all serious incidents described in the  guidance because, in part, it may be easier for them to resolve some  incidents\u2014such as students jokingly slapping each other on the  buttocks\u2014at the school level instead of filing a serious incident report.  These officials stated that they are optimistic a new reporting database for  serious incidents that they implemented in August of 2019 will streamline  the process for administrators and increase reporting. In addition, in  February 2019, DODEA issued guidance related to the reporting of and  response to prohibited sexual, sex-based, and other related abusive  misconduct, which DODEA officials told us they believe will reduce  discretion in how alleged child-on-child sexual abuse is recognized and  reported.", "While the new reporting system and guidance related to child-on-child  sexual abuse are positive steps, without additional guidance that clarifies  the types of incidents\u2014including non-sexual incidents\u2014that must be  reported as \u201cserious incidents,\u201d DODEA may continue to lack full visibility  into the extent to which serious incidents are occurring. As a result,  systemic issues within a particular school or district may never be  reported to DODEA leadership and any additional resources that a school  or district needs to prevent future incidents may not be identified.

The statute required,  among other things, that the Secretary of Defense establish a policy,  applicable across all military installations, to respond to allegations of  problematic sexual behavior in children and youth on military  installations. The purpose of the policy is to ensure a consistent,  standardized response to such allegations across the department. In May  2019, DOD issued a revised FAP instruction that establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the FAP specific to  child abuse, domestic abuse, and problematic sexual behavior in children  and youth. In addition, in July 2019, DOD revised the FAP standards to  implement policy, assign responsibilities, and provide procedures for  addressing problematic sexual behavior in children and youth in military  communities. As of October 2019, the military services had not yet  issued their updated FAP policies to incorporate the new department- wide policy and standards, but the policies were under development,  according to DOD FAP officials.", "Prior to the issuance of DOD\u2019s updated FAP policy, the Army issued a  broader policy on major juvenile misconduct in March 2019. The policy  addresses the command response to juvenile misconduct and the referral  of juvenile cases to civilian authorities. For Army installations in the  United States with areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction, the policy directs  such commands to seek to establish concurrent jurisdiction of juvenile  criminal offenses. In instances where establishing concurrent jurisdiction  is not feasible or recommended, the policy directs commanders to pursue  memoranda of agreement with local prosecution authorities that address  the referral of juvenile cases to the local juvenile court system for state  review and state determination of appropriate disposition. Army officials  stated that the Army policy covers more than incidents of problematic  sexual behavior in children and youth because the challenges involving  children on Army installations are broader than problematic sexual  behavior and encompass other types of misconduct, such as fights,  vandalism, and shoplifting. Officials from the other services stated that  their policies, which are under development, will focus on problematic  sexual behavior because that was what was required per statute.", "In addition, DOD has taken steps to implement a training program for  personnel at installations that focuses on problematic sexual behavior in  children and youth. Specifically, DOD and DOJ\u2019s Office of Juvenile  Justice and Delinquency Prevention entered into an interagency  agreement in July 2019 to expand the scope of DOJ\u2019s cooperative  agreement with the University of Oklahoma. According to DOD officials,  this agreement includes providing training and technical assistance in  support of DOD\u2019s response to problematic sexual behavior in children and  youth. The 3-year interagency agreement provides $1.5 million in  funding, and according to DOD officials, the funding will be used to  develop and implement targeted training on problematic sexual behavior  in children and youth for FAP personnel at the installations. According to  DOJ officials, other efforts include a DOJ and DOD working group on  child-on-child sexual abuse\u2014focused on resolving jurisdictional issues,  as will be discussed in greater detail later in the report\u2014and the  development of a centralized database for tracking incidents of  problematic sexual behavior in children and youth, as previously  discussed.", "Further, DODEA has implemented a number of initiatives related to  serious student misconduct. These include the issuance of a standalone  sexual harassment policy and providing administrators with additional  guidance on reporting and responding to sexual activity within DODEA  schools, and the development and distribution of standardized language  regarding discrimination and sexual harassment for each school\u2019s student  handbook. DODEA also created outreach materials for students on how  to recognize and respond to sexual harassment. DODEA has conducted  training for administrators on these topics. Other training initiatives  include training for all counselors, school psychologists, and nurses on  problematic sexual behavior in children and youth.

However,  the new structure may lack stakeholders with the requisite knowledge and  expertise to allow the IDC to make fully informed determinations. The  standardized process to determine whether an incident meets DOD\u2019s  criteria for child abuse was informed by a collaboration between the Air  Force and New York University researchers, which yielded a decision- tree algorithm. The process was implemented by the Air Force and then  subsequently adopted by the Navy and the Marine Corps. According to  Army officials, the Army\u2019s phased implementation of the IDC process was  ongoing as of October 2019.", "As part of the standardization of the process in the 2016 guidance,  medical personnel were removed as permanent voting members of the  IDC, although they regularly participated in some of the services\u2019 prior  incident determination processes, according to Army FAP officials. The  external researchers involved in the effort noted that they were primarily  involved in the decision-tree algorithm and not the composition of voting  members, which was an internal DOD decision. According to DOD, the  definitions in the decision-tree algorithm used to determine if an incident  meets criteria to be considered child abuse were robust enough that  experienced healthcare providers were not needed to determine if an  incident met DOD\u2019s criteria for child abuse. In addition, DOD FAP officials  stated that participation in the IDC process by medical personnel could  take them away from their clinical duties and become burdensome since  the IDC at larger installations may meet weekly and for several hours.", "DOD officials noted that medical personnel, and others, can still be invited  to participate in the IDC process as needed to provide information related  to specific incidents. While IDC members at four of the installations in our  review also noted that medical personnel can still be invited to share  relevant case information\u2014in a nonvoting capacity\u2014medical personnel  we spoke to at three of these installations noted that they are rarely  invited to participate. As a result, medical personnel at one installation we  visited stated that they have attempted to write their medical reports in  more lay terminology to bridge the gap and to help ensure that critical  information is properly relayed during the IDC meeting. Medical personnel  with expertise in child abuse stated that they would welcome the  opportunity to again participate in IDC meetings about which they have  specific knowledge, but that they are contacted to participate once every  2 years at the most. In addition, medical personnel at one of the  installations we visited had never heard of the IDC and were unaware of  its function.", "During a number of our interviews and installation visits, medical  personnel frequently expressed concerns about the lack of medical  expertise in the IDC process. For example, medical personnel at three  installations we visited expressed concerns that the absence of medical  personnel on the IDC may prevent reported incidents of child abuse from  being fully understood. They noted that medical personnel\u2014specifically,  pediatricians\u2014have particular utility on the IDC because of the complexity  of some of the cases and the need to articulate how medical findings can  indicate whether an injury resulted from a nonaccidental use of force.  Medical personnel with expertise in child abuse stated that there is a  strong medical component to many child abuse cases and that FAP  clinicians may not have the requisite medical expertise needed to  appropriately interpret that information. Medical personnel also stated that  lacking this expertise could result in the IDC incorrectly voting that an  incident meets criteria for abuse or does not meet criteria. For example, a  pediatrician described one IDC meeting in which they were invited to  participate, as a nonvoting member, related to an incident that had  medical evidence that the pediatrician referred to as clearly presenting a  hallmark finding in child abuse\u2014ear bruising patterns in a very young  child. However, the pediatrician stated that the IDC voted that the incident  did not meet DOD\u2019s criteria for abuse before allowing medical personnel  to present information they had about the incident. According to this  pediatrician, after the vote, the IDC allowed the pediatrician to provide  information about the incident, but it did not alter the committee\u2019s initial  determination.", "At one of the IDC meetings we observed, IDC members discussed a case  that involved bruising. The IDC members noted that they wished that a  doctor had been present so that they could determine whether the  allegation had any merit. However, no medical personnel were present  and the IDC reached a determination without medical input. Members of  this IDC also discussed concerns about a downward trend across the  service in the number of cases meeting DOD\u2019s criteria for abuse, which  they attributed to changes to the voting membership of the committee.", "In addition, one of the parents that we spoke with described an incident  that met DOD\u2019s criteria for child sexual abuse under the military service\u2019s  prior incident determination process. However, the parent stated that after  the service implemented the new IDC process, the servicemember\u2019s  command\u2014which was added as a permanent voting member of the  IDC\u2014requested that the determination be reconsidered. The parent  stated that the incident was again presented to the IDC and the  committee reversed the initial determination, concluding that the incident  did not meet DOD\u2019s criteria for child sexual abuse. The parent expressed  concerns that the removal of medical personnel from the IDC process  played a significant role in the reversal of the determination.", "Further, at one installation in our review, after the installation  implemented the new IDC process, officials set up a separate pre-IDC  process to discuss the same cases with medical personnel and others to  ensure that they include their perspectives in the determination process.  Installation officials stated that they felt the need to establish this  redundant process because participation and discussion are more limited  under the IDC process and there was an identified gap.", "In August 2019, the Defense Health Board recommended that DOD  reconsider requiring at least one comprehensive pediatric medical health  care provider to be a member of all IDCs. However, DOD FAP officials  stated that they have no plans to reassess or expand the voting  membership based on this recommendation or the concerns expressed  by medical personnel across the military services. They stated that there  are other meaningful ways in which medical personnel can participate in  the IDC process, but that they should not be voting members because  their competing clinical responsibilities may lead to a lack of continuity on  the IDC and they might not have any direct knowledge of the incidents  being discussed. However, as previously discussed, medical personnel  are not being regularly invited to participate and, when they are, the  information they present may not be considered as part of the voting  process. In addition, medical personnel at one installation we visited  noted that even if they were regularly invited to participate, since they are  not permanent voting members, other clinic responsibilities may take  precedence.", "A 2018 Department of Health and Human Services guide for child  protective caseworkers noted that involving teams with a diversity of  skillsets, including pediatricians, early in the child abuse determination  process can improve accurate and comprehensive assessments,  information sharing, and analysis of gathered information to support an  accurate substantiation decision. In addition, GAO-developed practices  to enhance and sustain collaboration in interagency groups note that it is  critical to involve nonfederal partners, key clients, and stakeholders in  decision-making.

According to military criminal investigative organization officials, cases  that do not meet this threshold may be investigated by other military law  enforcement investigators, such as military police or local civilian law  enforcement. Additionally, the FAP only reviews incidents of child abuse  where the alleged offender was a parent or someone in a caregiving role.", "As a result, the FAP would not present incidents to the IDC where the  alleged offender was another child or an adult who was not in a  caregiving role, such as a neighbor who was not babysitting at the time of  the incident. Further, as previously discussed, the jurisdiction of the  installation where the incident took place determines which entity, such as  the state or the federal government, will adjudicate the incident. The  process can also differ based on the state and local laws where the  incident occurred.

However,  officials at an overseas installation stated that there is no law that clearly  authorizes commanders to exercise this authority on overseas  installations, and there may be no local authorities to provide guidance or  services at overseas installations. Rather, service guidance grants  installation commanders the authority to remove children from unsafe  homes on a temporary basis. Guidance describing this authority is not  standardized across the services and installation officials overseas stated  that additional guidance would help clarify situations when a child can be  removed from an unsafe home.", "For example, according to Army guidance, an installation commander  may authorize emergency placement care when abuse is substantiated  and when neither judicial authorization nor parental consent can be  obtained, and the removal is necessary to avoid risk of imminent death,  serious bodily harm, or serious mental or physical abuse. In addition,  commanders may take action in situations when medical protective  custody is not appropriate. Per Navy guidance, commanders can only use  this authority in situations where there is substantial reason to believe the  life or health of the child is in real and present danger. Air Force  guidance states that base security and unit leadership are responsible for  overseeing the appropriate removal or placement of children with  consultation and guidance from the FAP. Per Marine Corps guidance,  commanders may implement a child removal order\u2014designed for short- term placement of a child into a place of safety. Individual installation  commanders are responsible for issuing a written policy setting forth the  procedures and criteria for the removal of child victims of abuse or other  children in the household when they are in danger of continued abuse or  life-threatening child abuse.", "Officials at installations overseas stated that the decision to remove a  child from an abusive home can vary depending on the commander\u2019s  comfort level in doing so. For example, officials at two installations  provided an example where a commander removed a child from the  home in a situation of suspected abuse, and then a parent requested an  Inspector General investigation questioning the commander\u2019s authority to  do so. Installation officials stated that the complaint to the Inspector  General was not substantiated, but that the ambiguity of the guidance,  coupled with the possibility of a commander having his or her actions  reviewed by the Inspector General, could affect a commander\u2019s  willingness to take action in similar cases. Medical personnel we spoke with highlighted examples where military hospitals overseas have  admitted child abuse victims for their safety in situations when installation  commanders did not take action to otherwise remove the child from the  home. In one example, an infant presenting with physical trauma  consistent with abuse was admitted to the hospital for 1 month until the  child could be returned to the United States and a state child welfare  agency could respond to ensure the child\u2019s safety.", "Installation officials overseas responsible for addressing incidents of child  abuse stated that they believe additional clarity regarding commander  authorities would help commanders in making a determination about  when to exercise their authority to remove an at-risk child from a home. In  comparison to the services\u2019 guidance, some state child welfare agencies  have comprehensive checklists and decision matrices to help officials  make decisions regarding child removal. One child welfare agency we  visited provided a list with 14 specific safety factors, including descriptions  of each factor, and a list of 10 protecting interventions. Safety factors  include anything that may put a child in danger, for example, questionable  caretaker explanations for a child\u2019s injuries, or the family not allowing the  child welfare agency access to the child.

Based on our  analysis, from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, for all four military  services, there were 1,448 incidents that met DOD\u2019s criteria for child  sexual abuse and may have therefore necessitated a sexual assault  forensic exam. According to our analysis of FAP data over these 5 years,  the average age of the victims involved was 10. However, according to  Defense Health Agency officials, there are only four child abuse  pediatricians who are certified to perform pediatric sexual assault forensic  exams: two in the Navy, one in the Army, and one in the Air Force. In  addition, according to these officials, the Army has seven sexual assault  forensic examiners, initially certified to perform exams on adults, who  have completed a 40-hour pediatric course, for a total of 11 certified  pediatric examiners across the department. In comparison, according to  these officials, there are a total of 466 sexual assault forensic examiners  throughout the department who are certified to perform exams on  adults\u2014161 are located overseas and 305 are located within the United  States.", "As a result of this disparity between examiners certified to perform exams  on adults and those certified for children, children affected by sexual  abuse on military installations or as military dependents may lack access  to qualified pediatric sexual assault forensic examiners. This lack of  access on overseas installations\u2014identified by medical personnel as a  significant concern\u2014can prevent them from being examined in a timely  manner or may subject them to further trauma if they are first examined  by an untrained provider and have to be examined again.", "When victims of sexual assault receive a forensic exam, the exam may  be provided by either a trained sexual assault forensic examiner\u2014that is,  a medical provider who has received specialized training in properly  collecting and preserving forensic evidence\u2014or a medical provider who  has not received such specialized training. Studies have shown that  exams performed by trained sexual assault forensic examiners may result  in shortened exam time, better quality health care delivered to victims,  higher quality forensic evidence collection, as well as better collaboration  with the legal system and higher prosecution rates.", "Navy officials stated that pediatric sexual assault forensic examiners are  not a billeted position at any installation and Air Force officials stated that  there are no certified pediatric sexual assault forensic examiners billeted  to any installation in Japan\u2014which hosts the largest number of active  duty U.S. servicemembers outside of the United States\u2014due to  inconsistent demand. Medical personnel we spoke with described two  options to overcome the lack of certified pediatric examiners: call a  certified pediatric examiner in the United States to guide\u2014via  telephone\u2014a pediatrician on the overseas installation through the exam;  or medically evacuate the victim to the United States.", "Although DOJ best practices for sexual assault exams note that  telemedicine can result in significant positive changes in the methods of  examination and evidence collection, medical personnel stated that it is  inferior to an in-person exam because the person conducting the exam is  not the actual certified examiner, which can open the exam findings up to  legal challenges. Medical personnel also stated that a child may need to  undergo multiple exams if the initial exam is not performed correctly,  which, as noted previously, can add to a victim\u2019s trauma. Additionally,  medical personnel stated that there can be technical challenges with  getting the right equipment in place and training people who may quickly  transition to another installation. If telemedicine processes were to be  established at overseas installations, there are still only four child abuse  pediatricians across the department who can consult on the exams, and  they may not be available to consult on all cases.", "Further, medical personnel noted that using telemedicine for pediatric  exams overseas may result in these exams being physically conducted  by someone with little to no experience conducting any type of genital  exam. This is because pediatricians in the military typically do not conduct  any genital exams on children, even basic or preventative exams. In the  event that a girl becomes pregnant, officials stated that she will be sent to  a military adult obstetrician, and the military pediatrician would not  conduct any of the relevant exams. These personnel also stated that the  military does not conduct routine cervical exams on women until they are  21 years of age, so pediatricians likely have no practical experience  conducting even standard exams. A 2018 Department of Health and  Human Services guide for child protective caseworkers noted that if  health care providers do not routinely examine the genitalia of young  children, they may mistake normal conditions for abuse or vice versa.  One parent that we spoke with about an incident of sexual abuse  overseas stated that the child\u2019s pediatrician was not comfortable  conducting such an exam, but offered to take a cursory \u201cpeek\u201d for  anything concerning. The parent declined the offer because they knew  the pediatrician was neither trained nor certified to perform such an exam.", "Although medical personnel stated that a medical evacuation to the  United States for an exam is a potential option, medical evacuations are  challenging because they can take 5 to 6 days. However, the physical  evidence from a sexual assault should be collected as soon as possible  and ideally between 1 and 5 days after the assault, according to DOJ best  practices. Additionally, installation medical personnel noted that medical  evacuations can result in additional stress on the victim from travel,  increased complexity of legal and investigation processes, and travel  costs that may be greater than training local examiners.", "DOD medical personnel stated that it can be challenging because in  some instances the children can only receive the exam at medical  facilities that have a memorandum of understanding in place with the  military because the exams are typically funded locally. For example,  these officials described an incident of child sexual abuse in Okinawa\u2014a  remote location in Japan with no certified examiners. These personnel  noted that while a medical evacuation to Hawaii would seem like a good  solution\u2014because there is a trained pediatrician there to conduct sexual  assault exams\u2014the pediatrician in Hawaii can only examine children who  have been referred directly by Hawaii\u2019s child welfare agency. These  personnel noted that the next best option is San Diego, where there is a  DOD child abuse pediatrician, but by the time the travel is arranged,  which can take days, the evidence might no longer be available. These  personnel suggested that instead of relying on medical evacuations or  telemedicine, better options to ensure that child victims get timely access  to care could include certifying pediatricians or adult sexual assault  forensic examiners as pediatric examiners during mandatory training or  establishing shared regional assets.", "In the United States, child victims of sexual abuse may have more options  to receive pediatric sexual assault forensic exams. Specifically, pediatric  exams may be done at a local Children\u2019s Advocacy Center (CAC) or  hospital. However, it is still challenging in the United States because CAC  coverage is not uniform across the country, and rural patients may have  to travel several hours to the closest center. For example, officials at one  CAC we visited noted that while they have a certified pediatric examiner,  this individual is only available once per week. One parent that we spoke  with stated that they had to drive their child 2 hours to the closest CAC to  receive an exam when stationed at an installation in the United States.  Two parents described delays in receiving an exam in the United States  after the incident was reported, which could have prevented quality  evidence from being collected.", "DOJ protocols for sexual assault forensic exams state that these exams  should be performed by a healthcare professional specially trained in  collecting evidence relating to sexual assault cases, such as a sexual  assault nurse examiner or other appropriately trained medical  professional. In particular, female children who have not yet reached  puberty should only be examined by health care providers specifically  trained in pediatric sexual abuse. Further, related DOJ best practices  state that evidence should be collected as soon as possible, ideally  between 1 and 5 days post assault. However, DOD does not have  processes in place to help ensure that children who are sexually abused  overseas have timely access to certified pediatric sexual assault forensic  examiners. Without processes that help ensure timely access to certified  pediatric examiners overseas, child victims of sexual abuse may not  receive exams in time for the evidence to be collected for use in  prosecution. In addition, the difficulty and time associated with obtaining an exam could potentially increase the stress and trauma of affected  victims and their families. Further, because of the variation in resources  across military installations, child victims of sexual abuse may have  access to different levels of care depending on the geographic location of  the installation due to the lack of standardized availability of certified  pediatric examiners."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Collaborates with Interagency Partners to Address Reported Incidents of Child Abuse and Child-on-Child Abuse, but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["DOD collaborates at various levels both inside and outside the  department to address reported incidents of child abuse and child-on- child abuse.

According to a senior Defense State Liaison  Office official, the office has successfully collaborated with a number of  states on child abuse reporting measures to require or allow local  jurisdictions to report incidents of child abuse in military families to  relevant military service officials. According to DOD, at least half of the  states have no such requirements, but at least one is considering passing  a law to provide for the requirement. According to this senior Defense  State Liaison Office official, the effort will remain a key issue area for the  office through at least fiscal year 2020 in order to continue to focus efforts  on these remaining states.", "In August 2019, the Defense Health Board noted that child abuse can be  difficult to quantify because of underreporting, and some studies suggest  a lower rate of incidents being reported to the FAP if the incidents are first  identified at a civilian facility. Therefore, it recommended, in the absence  of state legislation, that DOD ensure that all U.S. military installations  have memorandums of agreement in place with state child welfare  agencies for bilateral information sharing on child abuse cases. A senior  Defense State Liaison Office official stated that the office has sought  legislation because prior efforts to establish memorandums of agreement  were only focused on information sharing and did not specify procedures  for state and local child welfare agencies to use in determining whether a  family involved in an incident had a military connection. Additionally, the  official noted that a statutory basis is important because otherwise state  laws that limit who child welfare agencies can share information with  about child abuse cases may take precedence. For example, some states  have expressed concerns that sharing information about an alleged, but  not yet confirmed, incident of child abuse could be detrimental to a  servicemember\u2019s career.", "We found that the extent of collaboration between the military and other  state and local authorities (such as child welfare agencies) varied among  the installations in our review.

However, according to  FAP officials at one installation we visited in North Carolina\u2014where  approximately 80 percent of dependent children live off the installation\u2014it  was rare to receive notification from some counties for child abuse cases  with a military affiliation because, at the time of our visit, there was no  state policy requiring it. DOD\u2019s continued focus on improving  collaboration with the states that have not yet established such a  requirement should help to increase the department\u2019s visibility over  incidents occurring off the installation.

McCain  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a  provision for the service Secretaries to seek to relinquish jurisdiction over  offenses committed on military installations by individuals not subject to  the Uniform Code of Military Justice, such as civilians and children. In  response, according to DOJ officials, DOD and DOJ have, among other  things, established a joint working group to coordinate on issues related  to child-on-child sexual assault on military installations, including the  relinquishment of exclusive federal jurisdiction to the states. Both DOD  and DOJ officials agreed that the federal justice system is not well suited  to prosecuting juvenile offenses because it lacks a dedicated juvenile  justice system and that state courts, which aim to be rehabilitative in  nature, are better suited to adjudicate these cases. Specifically, DOJ\u2019s  Justice Manual states that the intent of federal laws concerning juveniles  is to help ensure that state and local authorities will deal with juvenile  offenders whenever possible.", "Working group officials stated that they are compiling a list of United  States Attorneys\u2019 Offices and the military installations in their respective  districts from which they have received referrals, as well as the types of  jurisdictions at those installations. These efforts are designed to ultimately  result in a comprehensive chart detailing the precise jurisdictional status  of each military installation in the United States, which can then be used  to inform discussions with each state about the relinquishment of  exclusive federal jurisdiction. According to DOJ officials, the working  group is also developing templates of coordination documents, such as  letters and memoranda of understanding for outreach with the states.  Working group officials stated that the group has identified and is  attempting to address other issues, such as those regarding privacy  concerns related to information to be contained in DOD\u2019s centralized  database for problematic sexual behavior in children and youth, which, as  previously discussed, is under development.", "The difficulties of addressing child-on-child sexual assault are  exacerbated when the incident occurs overseas, where no U.S. state  authorities exist to assume jurisdiction. The Military Extraterritorial  Jurisdiction Act can be used to either prosecute child offenders as  adults\u2014for certain violent or controlled substance violations\u2014or to initiate  federal delinquency proceedings. However, as discussed, while both  DOD and DOJ officials stated that they prefer to refer children to state  courts, this is currently not possible when the incident occurs overseas.  Working group officials stated that this challenge is another issue being  actively discussed by the group in an effort to identify potential solutions.  For example, they stated that one idea under discussion relates to a  specific Virginia state law that asserts concurrent jurisdiction over federal  crimes committed by a child, to be assumed only if waived by the federal  court or the United States Attorney. The discussion centered on the idea  that the Virginia state law could potentially be applied extraterritorially.  Therefore, if a sexual assault were to occur on an installation with  exclusive federal jurisdiction in Virginia\u2014or theoretically overseas where  the United States has jurisdiction\u2014the Virginia courts could assert  jurisdiction as long as the relevant United States Attorney\u2019s office has  waived jurisdiction. However, whether or not Virginia could use its courts  to address matters that occurred overseas and where the juvenile  offender is not a resident is not yet clear. Legal officials at one installation  who are involved in the working group efforts stated that they were  considering whether it was possible to have a single municipal court have  sole jurisdiction for any juvenile crimes occurring on overseas  installations.

Additionally, DOJ has begun tracking referrals made to United States  Attorneys by DOD for child-on-child sexual offenses. Specifically, in  September 2018, the Director of the Executive Office for United States  Attorneys issued a memorandum that instructed all United States  Attorneys to begin tracking referrals of child-on-child sexual offenses from  the military. According to these data, between October 1, 2018 and  August 5, 2019, the military referred 63 of these cases to United States  Attorneys for prosecution.

Further, CACs provide a child-friendly environment to conduct  these interviews and exams, which are then reviewed by a  multidisciplinary team that includes medical, law enforcement, mental  health, and legal personnel, victim advocates, and state child welfare  agencies. The purpose of the multidisciplinary team is to determine how  to best support the child, such as through therapy, courtroom preparation,  and victim advocacy.", "With regard to child forensic interviews, CACs work to minimize  retraumatization of a child by only conducting one comprehensive  interview of the child that is typically recorded and involves a team  viewing the interview from a separate room. The recorded interview can  then be shared with other interested parties with a need to know to  include doctors, police, lawyers, therapists, investigators, and judges.  This prevents the child from having to talk about the traumatic experience  repeatedly in environments where they may be uncomfortable, such as in  a police station where they may think they are in trouble.", "Officials from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service stated that they  prefer to use CACs for child forensic interviews when available and where  agreements are in place.

At  one U.S. installation we visited, military criminal investigators told us that  due to personnel transfers they sometimes do not have investigators  available who are qualified to conduct these interviews. Other military  criminal investigators with whom we spoke noted that the lack of  continuous training for military child forensic interviewers is challenging  because regular practice is needed to develop and maintain the skillset.  One investigator stated that even though they had not conducted a child  forensic interview in 4 years, they were still technically qualified to  conduct these interviews.

However, according to installation and CAC  officials, four of the U.S. installations that we visited either did not have a  formal agreement in place with the local CAC or noted that maintaining  the agreement was challenging because of the limits that military turnover  puts on their ability to build such partnerships. DOD has assigned the  responsibility to establish formal agreements with counterparts in the  community, such as CACs, within the Family Advocacy Committee at  each individual installation. However, given that only 7 percent of CACs  with a military installation in their area reported having such an agreement  in place according to the National Children\u2019s Alliance\u2019s 2019 study,  developing installation-level agreements with CACs has had limited  success.", "In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation established a nationwide  memorandum of understanding with the National Children\u2019s Alliance to  use CACs to conduct forensic interviews.

As of February  2019, officials from three of the services indicated that while discussions  have been underway, none of these military services have an established  agreement, though the status of their efforts varies. For example, as of  September 2019, Air Force officials described the effort as being in its  infancy, with no established timeframes to achieve goals.

For example, DOJ has provided  funding for CAC-military partnership pilot projects, which are aimed at  improving coordination between CACs and the military to address  reported incidents of child abuse.

For example, DOD\u2019s visibility over incident  outcomes and the extent to which children have been abused\u2014by an  adult or another child\u2014is limited by standalone databases, information- sharing challenges, and personnel discretion at the installation level. As  DOD develops a centralized database on problematic sexual behavior, it  could address some of these challenges by expanding the scope of the  database to include any abuse of a child, regardless of offender and type  of abuse, and making key decisions related to its development. Further,  additional guidance and processes are needed to help reduce  information-sharing challenges and installation-level discretion in the  tracking and reporting of these incidents. Until DOD resolves these  challenges, it will continue to have limited visibility over the extent to  which children have been affected by abuse on military installations or as  military dependents.", "Additionally, the department faces gaps in its existing processes for  responding to and resolving incidents of child abuse that should be  addressed as it continues to develop processes related to problematic  sexual behavior in children and youth. For example, given concerns  expressed by medical personnel across the military services, DOD should  expand the voting membership of the IDC to include medical personnel to  ensure that stakeholders with pertinent knowledge and expertise are  included. It is critical that IDC determinations are made with all of the  relevant information available. Moreover, qualified medical personnel play  an essential role in responding to children who have been abused, such  as by conducting sexual assault exams. However, according to DOD  officials, there are only 11 certified pediatric sexual assault examiners  across the department. Without processes to ensure that children who  are sexually abused overseas have timely access to a qualified examiner,  child victims of sexual abuse may not receive exams in time for the  evidence to be collected for use in prosecution and may experience  additional stress and trauma. Until DOD addresses these process-related  challenges, among others, child victims and their families may not receive  the assistance, care, and services that they need.", "Finally, while DOD has successfully collaborated with a number of states  to increase information sharing and with DOJ to address child-on-child  sexual offenses occurring on military installations, there are opportunities  for DOD to improve its collaboration with external partners to the benefit  of military families.

Such avenues could, among other things, help identify needed changes  to investigative processes or training. Further, there are opportunities to  facilitate awareness and increase the military services\u2019 use of CAC  resources, such as through the establishment of a national agreement  between the National Children\u2019s Alliance and each military service.

DOD\u2019s written comments are summarized below and  reprinted in appendix VI.", "For the 16 recommendations with which DOD concurred, DOD\u2019s written  comments discuss ongoing and planned efforts to implement our  recommendations, and in some cases provide target completion dates.", "DOD did not concur with our first recommendation to expand the scope of  its centralized database on problematic sexual behavior in children and  youth to track information on all incidents involving the abuse of a child  reported to the FAP or investigated by a military law enforcement  organization. In its written comments, DOD stated concerns related to  privacy and protecting information collected and shared on the alleged  conduct of juveniles. DOD also cited a statutory requirement to not  disclose directly or indirectly certain juvenile records during the course of  juvenile delinquency proceedings and stated that it is the department\u2019s  position that it is imperative to protect sensitive juvenile data with any  database. We agree that protecting sensitive juvenile data is imperative  and acknowledge in the report that privacy and data-safeguarding  precautions\u2014such as role-based permissions and other physical,  technical, and administrative controls\u2014will need to be taken, as they  were in the development of the Defense Sexual Assault Incident  Database.", "In addition, as discussed in the report, the department already maintains  databases that include information about both adults and children, such  as the service FAPs\u2019 central registries and the databases of the various  military criminal investigative organizations, which contain data on both  adult and juvenile offenders and victims. DOD does not assert that it  would be impossible to establish role-based permissions and the sorts of  physical, technical, and administrative controls that would protect the  privacy rights of individuals whose information appeared in a central  database like the one we recommend.  Moreover, the existence of other  DOD databases that incorporate such measures supports the notion that  it is possible to develop such a database in this situation. Doing so would  provide the information needed to track the extent to which children have  been affected by abuse and problematic sexual behavior, while  safeguarding the personal information of minors.", "DOD\u2019s written comments also stated that the report conflates three  separate and distinct constructs of behavior: juvenile misconduct,  problematic sexual behavior in children and youth, and child abuse and  neglect committed by adults. As described in our scope and methodology,  the scope of our review included child abuse inflicted by both adults and  children, which, according to DOD definitions, includes the three  categories of behavior noted above. As stated in our report, information is  tracked in multiple standalone databases, due, in part, to who inflicted the  abuse; as a result, it is difficult to know the extent to which children have  been affected by abuse on military installations or as military dependents.  In addition, while the response process differs between incidents of adult- inflicted child abuse and incidents of problematic sexual behavior, DOD  officials acknowledged that the organizations involved in the response  process and the primary data sources are the same. As we also noted,  officials stated that a centralized database for all child abuse incidents,  tracking the FAP\u2019s determination about whether an incident met DOD\u2019s  criteria for abuse, the investigation, and resolution, would be beneficial in  determining what happened in a particular case. These officials further  stated that such a database would benefit commanders\u2019 oversight of  cases for which they are responsible. In addition, without a centralized  database that tracks all incidents of abuse involving children, DOD and  Congress do not know the extent to which children have been affected by  abuse on military installations or as military dependents, or how such  incidents have been responded to and resolved. This makes it difficult to  identify and address trends that could lead to further prevention efforts.  As such, we continue to believe that this recommendation is valid and  should be implemented.", "DOD partially concurred with recommendation 5 to direct the service  FAPs and military law enforcement organizations to document in their  respective databases the date they notified the other entity of a reported  incident of child abuse. In its written comments, DOD stated that it will  analyze the efficiency, cost, and feasibility of recording the notification  date to law enforcement in FAP databases and that it plans to incorporate  a notification field as part of new data standards for DOD\u2019s criminal justice  agencies. Similarly, DOD also partially concurred with recommendation 6  to issue guidance that describes the process through which the service  FAPs receive and incorporate information into their central registries  regarding child abuse allegations and determinations involving their  servicemembers and dependents that were recorded by another service\u2019s  installation FAP, and that the guidance include a mechanism to monitor  that the process is occurring consistently. DOD stated that it will review  FAP data reporting policy to explore the potential to reference this  process in the scheduled reissuance of DOD policy in 2023. DOD further  stated that such information sharing is limited to reported incidents of  child abuse that were determined to have met DOD\u2019s criteria for abuse  rather than all abuse allegations. We continue to believe that issuing  guidance that extends to both allegations and determinations would  provide better assurance that the services have complete and up-to-date  information about their personnel and their dependents, and increase  their visibility over incidents of child abuse.", "DOD partially concurred with recommendation 12 to expand the voting  membership of the IDC to include medical personnel with the requisite  knowledge and experience. In its written comments, DOD agreed that the  inclusion and consideration of medical information in the determination  process is important, and stated that the current process includes medical  personnel as nonvoting members. DOD also stated that it will engage the  researchers who developed the IDC algorithm and process, as well as  other stakeholders\u2014including the Defense Health Agency and the military  services\u2014for collaborative input and guidance for a forthcoming revision  of the relevant DOD Manual. However, as discussed in the report,  medical personnel we spoke with at installations stated that they are not  always included in the process, and if they are, their medical expertise is  not always included as part of the final determination, contrary to best  practices for substantiating child abuse allegations. Further, if medical  personnel are not voting members, other clinical duties may take  precedence. Therefore, we continue to believe that this recommendation  is valid.", "For recommendations 13, 14, and 16, the Army, the Navy, and the Air  Force concurred that they should establish efforts to comprehensively  inform victims\u2019 families about how reported incidents of child abuse will be  addressed following the report, such as a comprehensive guide that  explains the process and available victim services. However, the Marine  Corps partially concurred with the related recommendation 15, stating  that it is out of scope for the FAP to explain the processes that law  enforcement organizations will follow. However, our recommendations  state only that the FAP and military law enforcement processes should be  effectively communicated to the families, not that the FAP would have to  determine or communicate the law enforcement processes to affected  families. Further, DOD\u2019s written comments stated that Marine Corps  Order 1754.11 addresses the recommendation because it directs victim  advocates to be assigned to the non-offending parent of a victim of child  abuse who requests services. However, parents we spoke with indicated  that they were not aware of all available services and resources offered  by the military, and that a comprehensive guide outlining the process  would have helped them understand what was going to happen. For  these reasons, we continue to believe that the recommendation is valid.", "For recommendations 20 through 23, DOD\u2019s written comments stated  that the services concurred with the overall recommendation to seek to  establish memorandums of understanding with the National Children\u2019s  Alliance that make children\u2019s advocacy center services available to all  military installations and thereby increase awareness of those services  across the department. While the Marine Corps and the Air Force  concurred (recommendations 22 and 23), DOD noted that individual  service differences in organizational structure and process are reflected in  the nuances of their responses. For example, the Army partially  concurred with recommendation 20. DOD stated that the Army is working  with the National Children\u2019s Alliance to develop a broad memorandum of  understanding to support partnerships between military installations and  local children\u2019s advocacy centers. The agreement is intended to assist in  providing support services, education, and prevention services to military  families and investigations of child abuse and problematic sexual  behavior with a goal to finalize the agreement in fiscal year 2021. The  Army also plans to pursue local agreements with children\u2019s advocacy  centers who may not participate in the broader service-wide agreement.  We believe that such local agreements, in addition to a broader  memorandum of understanding with the National Children\u2019s Alliance,  would be beneficial and that these actions would meet the intent of our  recommendation.", "Likewise, the Navy partially concurred with recommendation 21. DOD\u2019s  written comments stated that the Navy seeks to develop memorandums  of understanding both broadly with the National Children\u2019s Alliance, as  well as with local children\u2019s advocacy centers who may not be accredited  through the National Children\u2019s Alliance. Similar to the Army, we believe  that such local agreements would be beneficial in addition to a broader  agreement with the National Children\u2019s Alliance and, that together, they  would meet the intent of our recommendation. DOD\u2019s comments also  stated that the Navy\u2019s planned agreement with the National Children\u2019s  Alliance will outline services and support to families affected by  problematic sexual behavior. However, as previously discussed in this  report, we believe that such an agreement should not be restricted to  problematic sexual behavior given the need for services associated with  any type of abuse. As such, we continue to believe that the  recommendation is valid.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of  Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the  Secretary of the Air Force, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

We selected this timeframe to evaluate trends over 5  years, and fiscal year 2018 was the most recent year for which complete  data were available at the time of our review. Specifically, we analyzed  the data to determine the number of reported incidents of child abuse by  service and the percent of those that met DOD\u2019s criteria for child abuse.  Because the services are required to track more detailed information  about incidents of child abuse that they determined met DOD\u2019s criteria for  child abuse, we conducted a more detailed analysis of these incidents to  describe their characteristics, such as the status of the offender, the  relationship between the offender and the victim, the age of the victim,  and the type of abuse (emotional, physical, sexual, or neglect). To assess  the reliability of the service FAPs\u2019 child abuse data, we reviewed related  documentation; assessed the data for errors, omissions, and  inconsistencies; and interviewed officials. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to describe trends in reported incidents of child abuse across the services and characteristics of such incidents from  fiscal years 2014 through 2018.", "Second, we analyzed data from the military criminal investigative  organizations\u2014the Army Criminal Investigation Command, the Naval  Criminal Investigative Service, and the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations\u2014for the same time period for all investigations with a child  victim. We also analyzed child victim investigation data from the U.S.  Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division, a federal law enforcement  agency that also investigates some offenses involving child victims.  Specifically, we analyzed the data to identify trends in the number of  investigations over the past 5 fiscal years. We also analyzed the  investigation data to identify key characteristics of the investigations, such  as the status of the offender, relationship between the victim and  offender, and primary investigative agency. To assess the reliability of the  military criminal investigative organizations\u2019 child victim investigation data,  as well as that of the U.S. Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division,  we assessed the data for errors, omissions, and inconsistencies, and  interviewed officials. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable to describe trends in child victim investigations across the  services and the characteristics of such investigations from fiscal years  2014 through 2018.", "Third, we analyzed three sources of DODEA data: (1) child abuse reports  from school years 2014-2015 through 2017-2018, (2) serious incident  reports from school years 2013-2014 through 2017-2018, and (3) student  misconduct records from school years 2016-2017 through 2017-2018. We  selected these timeframes to evaluate serious incident report trends over  5 years and to align with the FAP and investigation data; school year  2017-2018 was the most recent year for which complete data were  available at the time of our review. All DODEA records were redacted by  DODEA personnel to ensure the privacy of students and DODEA  personnel.", "DODEA child abuse reports track information about incidents of  suspected or alleged child abuse or neglect. We analyzed DODEA\u2019s  child abuse reports over 4 school years to identify trends in the number  and type of child abuse reports as well as to describe characteristics of  the reports. Specifically, we analyzed characteristics such as the  relationship between the victim and the offender, the location of the  reported abuse, and notifications by DODEA to external organizations,  such as the FAP. To assess the reliability of DODEA\u2019s child abuse  reports, we reviewed related documentation; assessed the data for errors,  omissions, and inconsistencies; and interviewed officials. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable to describe trends in and  characteristics of child abuse reports from school years 2014-2015  through 2017-2018.", "DODEA serious incident reports track information about alleged or  suspected serious incidents resulting in consequences greater than those  normally addressed through routine administrative actions. We analyzed  DODEA\u2019s serious incident reports relating to child-on-child abuse\u2014 involving a violation of law or a sexual event\u2014over the past 5 school  years to identify trends in the number and type of serious incident reports  as well as to describe characteristics of the reports. Specifically, we  analyzed the type of serious incident (assault/battery, child pornography,  nonconsensual sexual contact, etc.), whether police were notified,  whether the police investigated, and the type of school filing the report. To  assess the reliability of DODEA\u2019s serious incident reports, we reviewed  related documentation; assessed the data for errors, omissions, and  inconsistencies; and interviewed officials. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to describe trends in and characteristics of  serious incident reports from school years 2013-2014 through 2017-2018,  and to compare serious incident reports to DODEA student misconduct  records from school years 2016-2017 through 2017-2018.", "DODEA\u2019s student misconduct records are separate from child abuse  reports and serious incident reports\u2014but may also be filed in relation to a  serious incident\u2014and track information regarding disciplinary actions and  the triggering incident, such as an abusive or indecent act. We requested  and received all redacted DODEA student misconduct records over the  past 5 school years that involved at least one of 26 incident types that we  determined, through conversations with DODEA officials familiar with the  records, could relate to a child-on-child serious incident. We received  over 26,000 records, some of which related to the same incident, for  example, according to DODEA officials, when more than one student was  involved. For school years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, we conducted a  content analysis of the student misconduct records, using DODEA\u2019s  Serious Incident Reporting Procedures, to determine the number of  student misconduct records that school administrators, using that  guidance, could have reasonably categorized as a violation of law or  sexual event and filed a serious incident report. We selected these 2  school years for the analysis because DODEA\u2019s updated serious incident  reporting guidance was issued in August 2016 and was in place for both  school years.", "Because of the large number of DODEA student misconduct records, we  conducted our content analysis in two stages. We first conducted an  electronic search to identify potentially-relevant records and then  conducted a manual review of all potentially-relevant records. One of our  data analysts electronically searched the student misconduct record  descriptions for key terms that could potentially signify that the incident  was of a nature serious enough to warrant the filing of a serious incident  report, per DODEA guidance. We selected the search terms using the  DODEA guidance (e.g., assault, battery, and rape); additional terms that  may signify a medical or police response (e.g., nurse, ambulance, blood,  and police) because incidents resulting in an injury may be considered to  be serious incidents per the guidance; and terms for common social  media outlets (e.g., Facebook and Snapchat) because taking or sharing  nude photos of another student without their knowledge is an example of  a noncontact sexual act that should result in the filing of a serious incident  report. This search resulted in 2,619 student misconduct records\u2014after  removing duplicate records\u2014that we then manually reviewed. It is  possible that we did not identify some student misconduct records that  could have been categorized as serious incidents because we did not  include some search terms that would have identified more.", "Two analysts independently reviewed each of the 2,619 student  misconduct records, using the DODEA guidance, and recorded their  determination that a record (a) could have been classified as a serious  incident report per DODEA\u2019s guidance, (b) was unclear whether it could  be classified as a serious incident report, or (c) should not have been  classified as a serious incident report per DODEA\u2019s guidance. For records  where the two analysts did not initially agree on a determination, they met  and discussed the records and reached a final determination. We then  compared the number of student misconduct records which we  determined school administrators, using the guidance, could have  reasonably categorized as a violation of law or sexual event and filed a  serious incident report with the number of serious incidents recorded by  DODEA for the same time period to determine the extent of DODEA\u2019s  visibility into serious incidents. We discussed the student misconduct  records, the content analysis, and the comparison to serious incident  reports with DODEA officials.", "Further, we interviewed relevant DOD and service officials at the  headquarters level and at a nongeneralizable sample of seven military  installations to identify how DOD tracks reported incidents of child abuse  from the time of a report to an ultimate adjudication, including how  information is communicated within and across the services. We selected  at least one installation per service as well as two joint installations, and  selected locations based on the number of reported child abuse incidents  and the number of investigated child-on-child abuse incidents over the  past 5 fiscal years, as well as other factors. Specifically, we selected  installations that over the past 5 fiscal years had a high number of  reported incidents of child abuse or a high number of child-on-child abuse  investigations\u2014or both\u2014in order to maximize the possibility we would  interview officials, responders, and care providers who had responded to  reported incidents of child abuse. Other selection factors included a mix  of types of legislative jurisdiction (such as exclusive and concurrent  jurisdiction), at least some installations with DODEA schools, a high  number of DODEA serious incident reports, and a mix of geographic  locations in the United States and overseas. Because we did not select  locations using a statistically representative sampling method, the  comments provided during our interviews with installation officials are  nongeneralizable and therefore cannot be projected across DOD or a  service, or any other installations. While the information obtained was not  generalizable, it provided perspectives from installation officials that have  assisted with the response to reported incidents of child abuse. We  compared information from our data analyses and interviews to DOD  guidance; GAO-identified practices for developing and maintaining a  reliable schedule; GAO-identified leading practices for results-oriented  management; and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government related to quality information, control activities, and  monitoring activities.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has developed and implemented  policies and procedures to respond to and resolve incidents of child  abuse, including child-on-child abuse, occurring on military installations or  involving military dependents, we reviewed relevant DOD and service  policies, guidance, reports, and memoranda on child abuse, juvenile  misconduct, and problematic sexual behavior in children and youth. We  also conducted work at a nongeneralizable sample of seven military  installations in the United States and overseas. At the installations, we  interviewed FAP personnel, medical and mental health personnel, military  law enforcement officials, legal personnel, Special Assistant United  States Attorneys, military criminal investigators, chaplains, child  development center personnel, school liaison officers, military family life  counselors, DODEA personnel, and commanders about how they  prevent, track, respond to, and resolve these incidents.", "To obtain the perspectives of parents and guardians of children who have  been affected by abuse on military installations or while they were military  dependents (either by an adult or another child), we interviewed 20  parents and guardians by phone that volunteered to speak with us about  their perspectives on available resources and assistance, case  communication, and the investigative and adjudicative processes. To  develop the interview protocol for parents and guardians, we reviewed  DOD and service policies, interviewed DOD officials, and reviewed our  prior work related to sexual assault in the military. We also consulted  with a GAO mental health professional on the appropriateness of the  instrument as well as guidance on resources to offer participants if  relevant. A survey specialist helped to design the interview protocol,  another survey specialist reviewed it for methodological issues, and an  attorney reviewed it for legal terminology and any other issues. Prior to  interviewing parents and guardians, we pretested the interview protocol  with three analysts who had children and had experience as a military  servicemember or military dependent. We used the pretests to determine  whether: (1) the questions were clear, (2) the terms used were precise,  (3) respondents were able to provide information that we were seeking,  and (4) the questions were unbiased. We made changes to the content  and format of the interview protocol based on the results of our pretesting.", "Further, each team member was trained on the interview protocol to  assure its consistent implementation across interviewers and participants.  Due to the sensitivity of the information being discussed, we took several  steps to help ensure a confidential and safe environment during the  phone interviews. All information provided was handled confidentially\u2014 callers\u2019 names and contact information were not recorded in our notes  and we did not audio record the interviews. We conducted interviews from  June to September 2019. We took interview notes on paper and later  entered them into a Microsoft Word form. Data entry was verified by the  same analyst. The data were electronically extracted from the Word forms  into a comma-delimited file that was then imported into Excel for analysis.", "We summarized the answers to questions about the characteristics of the  incidents discussed, such as whether the offender was a child or an adult,  the location of the incident, the military dependent status of the victim,  and the servicemember status of the offender. Quantitative data  analyses were conducted by one analyst and verified by a second  analyst. We also conducted a content analysis of the narrative information  to identify common themes related to items such as parents\u2019 awareness  of available victim services, the clarity of the response process, and areas  for improvement. Two analysts reviewed the data collected from the  interviews and agreed on the themes into which callers\u2019 comments would  be categorized. Standardized coding instructions were developed and  tested. One analyst reviewed all the callers\u2019 narrative comments and  indicated in the spreadsheet if a theme was present or absent. A different  analyst reviewed the first analyst\u2019s coding to see if they reached the same  determination. For records where the two analysts did not initially agree  on a determination, they met and discussed the records and reached a  final determination. The codes were then counted to assess how many  callers mentioned a given theme. Because we did not select participants  using a statistically representative sampling method, the perspectives  obtained are nongeneralizable and therefore cannot be projected across  DOD, a military service, or installation. While the information obtained  was not generalizable, it provided perspectives from parents and  guardians who were willing to discuss their experiences with the  reporting, response, and resolution processes.", "Additionally, we observed each service\u2019s Incident Determination  Committee (IDC) process\u2014through which installations determine whether  an incident meets DOD\u2019s criteria for child abuse\u2014at a total of four  installations. We also attended a symposium hosted by the National  Center on Sexual Exploitation on problematic sexual behavior in children  and youth.

We also  interviewed relevant officials from civilian organizations near the five U.S.  installations in our review, such as state child welfare agencies, law  enforcement organizations, prosecuting attorneys offices, and children\u2019s  advocacy centers (CAC) to determine the extent of their collaboration with  the military and any related challenges. In addition, we interviewed a  senior official from the Defense State Liaison Office regarding their  outreach to states to increase information sharing with state child welfare  agencies. Further, we interviewed DOJ officials regarding the prosecution  of juvenile crimes committed on overseas installations and on some U.S.  installations and its coordination with DOD to address these incidents.  Finally, we contacted officials from the National Children\u2019s Alliance, which  accredits CACs, about its efforts with DOD to improve collaboration  between the military and CACs.
