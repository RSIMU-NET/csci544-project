Following immediate relief efforts, Congress provided $1.14 billion for Haiti reconstruction in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010. USAID, which is responsible for implementing $651 million of this amount, has allocated about $268 million of this and other funding to construct a power plant and port to support the CIP in northern Haiti and permanent housing in several locations in the Port-au-Prince, St-Marc, and Cap-Haitien areas.", "This testimony draws from GAO's June 2013 report on Haiti reconstruction and further examines (1) USAID's funding obligations and disbursements; (2) USAID's progress in two CIP-related activities--a power plant and port; and (3) USAID's progress in constructing permanent housing. For this statement, GAO updated funding information and data regarding progress, based on information from USAID and Department of State officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of June 30, 2013, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had obligated $336 million (52 percent) and disbursed $229.5 million (35 percent) of $651 million in funding for Haiti earthquake reconstruction from the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010.", "USAID has allocated $170.6 million to construct a power plant and port to support the newly developed Caracol Industrial Park (CIP). According to USAID documents and other studies, the CIP, power plant, and port are interdependent; each must be completed and remain viable for the others to succeed. USAID completed the first phase of the CIP power plant in time to supply the first CIP tenant with power. Port construction will begin more than 2 years later than originally planned, in part because of a lack of USAID expertise in port planning at the Haiti mission. According to current estimates of port construction costs, USAID funding will be insufficient to cover a majority of projected costs. The estimated gap of more than $117 million to $189 million is larger than initially estimated, and it is unclear whether the Haitian government will be able to find a private sector company willing to finance the remainder of the project.", "USAID has reduced the targets for its permanent housing program in Haiti, to which it has allocated $97.3 million. The agency decreased the projected number of houses by more than 80 percent, from 15,000 to 2,649. The estimated number of beneficiaries was reduced from a range of 75,000 to 90,000 to its current estimate of approximately 13,200 to 15,900. These reductions resulted from inaccurate original cost estimates that used inappropriate cost comparisons and from the Haitian government's request for larger houses with improvements such as flush toilets. USAID currently estimates that construction will be completed more than 2 years later than initially scheduled. Delays occurred primarily because of difficulties in securing land titles and coordinating with partner donors. USAID is attempting to mitigate potential sustainability risks, such as affordability and community cohesion, through community development mechanisms. However, it is uncertain whether these mechanisms will fully cover all sites."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations in this testimony.

A lack  of staff with technical expertise in port planning, construction, and  oversight, such as a port engineer, at the USAID mission in Haiti  contributed to these delays. According to a USAID planning document  for the port sector, the agency planned to complete a feasibility study by  March 2012, to initiate construction in spring 2013 through a private  company that would supplement USAID\u2019s funding contribution for port  construction, and to complete construction in fall 2015. However, the  feasibility study was not completed until February 2013 because of  unrealistic initial time frames; delays in awarding the contract for the  study; and a statement of work for the feasibility study that did not require  the contractor to include all information necessary to help select a port  site. Lacking staff with port expertise, USAID consulted with officials from  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, who informed USAID officials that more studies should be  undertaken to identify the additional economic, environmental, technical,  and other information necessary to make a final site selection and design  the port. According to USAID officials, USACE estimates that the  necessary studies and design will take an additional 18 months to 2  years. As a result of these planning delays, port construction will not  begin until more than 2 years later than initially planned. USAID officials  also initially estimated that port construction would take 2.5 years but  have since learned that port construction may take up to 10 years,  depending on the complexity of the port designed.", "Port construction costs remain uncertain because the port site, design,  and needed mitigation measures have not been determined. However,  rough estimates in the February 2013 feasibility study project that the cost  of port construction will range from $185 million to $257 million. Excluding  funding for feasibility studies, $68 million of USAID\u2019s allocation to the port  project remain for planning, design, and construction. USAID does not  know what portion of this funding is needed for the additional planning  and design; however, it is clear that the amount remaining will be a  significantly smaller portion than USAID had initially planned to contribute  to the port\u2019s total construction cost, given the estimated funding gap of at  least $117 million to $189 million. As a result, USAID officials recognize  a risk that private companies interested in operating the port may not be  willing to cover the remaining construction costs. Thus, the Haitian  government may need to secure additional donor funding to build the  port.", "Because of the complexity of port construction and the lack of port  expertise at the USAID mission, we recommended that USAID fill the  vacant port engineer position at its Haiti mission within time frames that  will help avoid future project delays. In written comments on the report,  USAID agreed with this recommendation, noting that it issued a  solicitation for a ports advisor in May 2013.

USAID underestimated the construction costs of its New  Settlements program. These costs are comprised of two main categories:  (1) cost of site preparation per plot and (2) cost of construction per house.  In its 2010 planning documents, USAID originally estimated costs at  $1,800 per plot and $8,000 per house. However, as of April 2012, when  USAID had awarded contracts for construction at its first two  settlements\u2014Caracol-EKAM and DLA 1.5\u2014the total cost for a plot and  house had increased by 151 percent, to $24,625. These cost increases  stemmed primarily from the inaccuracy of USAID\u2019s original estimates,  which were based in part on costs reported by the World Bank and an  NGO that was building houses in northern Haiti. As a result, according to  USAID officials, the original estimates did not adequately consider the  stringent international building codes and disaster resistance standards  planned for New Settlement houses and did not take into account the  extent or complexity of service infrastructure USAID intended to provide.  Furthermore, USAID officials noted that the demand for and cost of  construction materials had increased.", "After USAID awarded these initial contracts, construction costs increased  further as a result of Haitian government requests for design changes.  The requested changes included an increase in the size of housing units,  from about 275 square feet to about 450 square feet, and the inclusion of  flush toilets rather than the traditional dry toilet system. The Haitian  government\u2019s design changes increased the total cost for a plot and a  house by an additional 34 percent, to $33,007. Therefore, as of April  2013, average costs based on awarded contracts at the first two sites to  undergo construction had increased by 433 percent per plot and by 193  percent per house.

USAID  plans to fund the construction of 906 of these houses and expects NGOs  and other partner donors to fund the construction of the remaining 1,743.  USAID also reduced the total number of projected beneficiaries, from an  original estimated range of 75,000 to 90,000 to its current estimated  range of approximately 13,200 to 15,900. Approximately 74 percent of  these houses are to be built in the Cap-Ha\u00eftien corridor, with the  remainder in the Port-au-Prince and St-Marc corridors (see table 3).According to USAID officials, the first 26 families moved in to DLA 1.5 at  the end of September 2013, with more families planned to occupy houses  at DLA 1.5 and Caracol-EKAM in October 2013.", "The U.S. government\u2019s January 2011 strategy projected that all USAID  permanent housing construction and site preparation under the New  Settlements program would be completed by July 2012, but completion of  some sites will likely occur more than 2 years later than planned. The  following factors have mainly accounted for these delays.", "Land titling issues. According to USAID officials, USAID spent  substantial time trying to secure clear title to private and government- owned land. In the end, USAID was able to acquire only one site from  private owners because of difficulties in confirming legitimate  ownership. In addition, USAID found that secure land title for some  government-owned sites could not be confirmed because of unclear  or disputed ownership, which further reduced the number of site  options and delayed site selection.", "Difficulties partnering with NGOs and other donors.", "USAID\u2019s New Settlements program relied heavily on partners, which  led to delays in the program when these partnerships encountered  difficulties. For example, in January 2011, the American Red Cross  (Red Cross) announced that it would partner with USAID to build  homes on at least two sites; however, USAID did not sign an  agreement with the Red Cross until August 2013 and the agreement  was for just one site.

If those efforts do not provide adequate  economic opportunities, beneficiaries may not be able to afford the fees  and services connected with their new homes or may have to relocate  altogether. The sustainability of the settlements will also depend on their  ongoing support, maintenance, and management by local governments  and community members. Specifically, beneficiaries will face site-specific  issues such as affordability and community cohesion.", "Affordability. The Haitian government has determined that  beneficiaries must make monthly payments of 1500 Haitian gourdes  for 5 years before receiving title to a house. These monthly fees will  go toward the maintenance of housing, public spaces, and septic  tanks; management costs incurred by the Haitian government; and  incidental expenses. Beneficiaries will also face charges for utilities  and services, such as electricity and water.", "Community cohesion: The New Settlements program currently  plans to create eight new \u201ccommunities,\u201d each consisting of 148 to  1,283 households, with beneficiaries from various locations in Haiti  and with varied income levels. USAID officials acknowledged that  discord may arise among the beneficiaries or between the settlements  and surrounding communities.", "To mitigate these concerns, USAID has put community development  programs in place at two sites and plans to fund or pursue NGO  partnerships to support such programs at the remaining sites. For  Caracol-EKAM, USAID obligated about $4.8 million to develop and  manage the beneficiary selection process, establish a provisional  community management committee, and create other mechanisms to  support community development. In addition, in August 2013, USAID  signed a $1.5 million agreement with another implementing partner to  provide support for the phased occupation of Caracol-EKAM and  management of the settlement, among other activities designed to help  ensure its sustainability. For community development activities at DLA  1.5, USAID has entered into a partnership with an NGO that is providing  such support through its own funding. USAID has allocated an additional  $3.3 million to support community development efforts, including  beneficiary selection and site management and operations, at the eight  new settlement sites. In addition, USAID plans for partner organizations  to contribute to these activities at some of the settlement sites. For  example, the memorandum of understanding between USAID and partner  donors building houses on three sites notes that partner donor funds are  to be provided for community development activities at those settlements;  however, that memorandum does not fully secure such a financial  commitment. In addition, it is unclear whether such partnerships will be  available to support all of the remaining settlements. USAID officials have  stated that it is crucial that these support mechanisms are in place to  ensure a smooth transition when beneficiaries move in and to set the tone  for interaction among beneficiaries.", "In our June report, we recommended that the USAID Administrator direct  the mission in Haiti to ensure that each new settlement has community  support mechanisms in place prior to beneficiary occupation, including by  making funds available as necessary to help ensure this support. USAID  agreed with this recommendation and noted that the mission is prepared  to provide additional resources if they are needed to finance community  development activities. USAID also elaborated on the ongoing and  planned activities to facilitate community development and sustainability  at the first two settlement sites.
