For example, according to the 2016 National Drug Control  Strategy, over the previous 8 years, opioid abuse emerged as the  greatest drug threat to the nation. This development was complicated by  a spike in the supply and purity of heroin, primarily from Mexico, resulting  in a combined epidemic of heroin-opioid overdose deaths. According to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heroin overdose deaths  more than tripled between 2010 and 2015, as powerful synthetic opioids,  notably illicit fentanyl, were often mixed with heroin without the user\u2019s  knowledge. Similarly, in its 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy  Report, State reported various indicators suggesting a significant increase  in cocaine production and trafficking from Colombia. For example,  according to this report, coca cultivation in Colombia increased by 39  percent in 2014 and by 42 percent in 2015, and the amount of cocaine  trafficked out of Colombia has reached record levels. Consistent with  these reported trends in cocaine production and trafficking, Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention data indicate that, after falling sharply in  the middle of the past decade, overdose deaths related to cocaine have  been gradually rising in the United States. Finally, while a significant  portion of the marijuana consumed in the United States continues to be  smuggled from Western Hemisphere countries, including Canada,  Jamaica, and Mexico, the domestic production and marketing of  marijuana are undergoing important shifts, as several states and the  District of Columbia have passed measures that legalize possession of  limited amounts of the drug and provide for regulation of its production,  processing, and sales.

According to DOD officials, the collection  of best practices and lessons learned relating to counternarcotics in the  Western Hemisphere through this program is intended to enhance  readiness and effectiveness. DOD officials noted that the effort to collect  best practices and lessons learned is routine and helps inform policy and  budget proceedings. Annual conferences, such as the Counternarcotics  and Global Threats Coordination Conference and the Program Objective  Memoranda Conference, also offer an opportunity to identify, collect, and  disseminate best practices and lessons learned as they relate to DOD\u2019s  counterdrug and counter-transnational-organized-crime operations.  According to DOD officials, such conferences provide a forum for  participants to learn how other relevant DOD components working on  counternarcotics efforts are approaching counterdrug, transnational  organized crime, and related issues. DOD officials also noted that they  intend to use an interagency-agency-task-forces approach to  counternarcotics interdiction that the U.S. Southern Command developed  in Guatemala as a model for sharing best practices and lessons learned  in the region. According to DOD officials, the U.S. Southern Command\u2019s  support included training in interdiction tactics, techniques, and  procedures, and maintenance of provided equipment such as intercept  boats, tactical vehicles, communications gear, and night vision devices.  DOD officials reported that lessons learned include establishing the  interagency legal framework early, clearly defining interagency  relationships, developing the task force\u2019s intelligence capability,  implementing police authority and leadership, identifying measures of  success, communicating the task force\u2019s purpose and success to the  public, and maintaining equipment. DOD officials said that they plan to  use the Guatemalan interagency task force as a model with other foreign  partners and new counterdrug units in Guatemala and in the region.", "State\u2019s report, \u201cLessons Learned from the M\u00e9rida Initiative and Plan  Colombia with Regard to Judicial Reform Efforts,\u201d provides specific  examples of operational and tactical lessons, as follows:", "Political will is critical. According to State, one of the clearest symbols  of political will was Mexico\u2019s and Colombia\u2019s dedication of additional  resources (to initiatives under the M\u00e9rida Initiative and Plan  Colombia). In addition, according to State, the governments of El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras created a joint regional plan, the  Plan of Alliance for Prosperity, underscoring their political will and  significant commitment to improve economic opportunities,  governance, and public safety. For example, these governments  identified $2.6 billion in their 2016 budgets to, among other things,  target criminal networks, tackle corruption, and strengthen  government institutions.", "No lasting security without enhanced access to justice. The  governments of Colombia and Mexico have undertaken efforts to  expand access to justice in their countries. Since 2008, the  government of Mexico has been working to improve the transparency  and efficiency of its judicial system by implementing an oral-based  accusatorial system.", "Partnership across agencies is critical. Plan Colombia represented a  whole-of-government approach, with a broad U.S. interagency  presence to work across the breadth of the Colombian government.

ONDCP is responsible for developing (1)  the National Drug Control Strategy, which sets forth a comprehensive  plan to reduce illicit drug use through programs intended to prevent or  treat drug use or reduce the availability of illegal drugs; and (2) several  associated companion strategies, which target government efforts to  respond to emerging counternarcotics threats for key geographic areas.", "The Strategy issued in 2010 laid out the administration\u2019s 5-year blueprint  for combatting drug use and included a section on counternarcotics  efforts in the Western Hemisphere. The 2010 Strategy described an  approach that reflected two core focus areas: (1) disrupting domestic drug  trafficking and production and (2) strengthening international partnerships  to reduce the availability of foreign-produced drugs in the United States.  The Strategy, including the portions associated with counternarcotics  efforts in the Western Hemisphere, is updated annually to reflect current  priorities and conditions. According to ONDCP officials, an example of a  key change since 2010 is the developing focus on the opioid crisis. In  2010, the President\u2019s first National Drug Control Strategy emphasized the  need for action to address opioid use disorders and overdose, while  ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective treatment. On  April 19, 2011, the White House released its national Prescription Drug  Abuse Prevention Plan, which outlined its goals for addressing  prescription drug abuse and overdose.", "The 2016 Strategy continued the previous administration\u2019s focus on the  opioid crisis but recognized the growing threats from drug-trafficking  organizations involved in manufacturing and distributing cocaine and  synthetic drugs, including novel psychoactive substances such as  synthetic cannabinoids. To address these efforts, the Strategy described  U.S. agencies\u2019 interdiction activities, and DEA led efforts to disrupt  synthetic drug production and trafficking. The 2016 Strategy also noted  U.S. collaboration with China to limit the export of precursor chemicals  associated with the production of psychoactive substances.", "ONDCP also develops companion strategies with a geographic focus,  such as the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, the  Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy, and the Caribbean Border  Counternarcotics Strategy. The 2015 Strategy acknowledges the  companion strategies and indicates that the efforts they describe will be  carried out. These strategies include objectives such as enhancing  intelligence, interdicting drugs and drug proceeds, ensuring prosecution,  disrupting and dismantling drug-trafficking organizations, and improving  cooperation with international partners.", "The companion strategies have provided opportunities for more targeted  responses to address emerging threats in specific geographic areas,  which include the following:  National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy focused  primarily on U.S. government efforts to prevent the trafficking of illicit  drugs\u2014heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and foreign-produced  marijuana\u2014across the U.S.-Mexican border. The strategy also  addressed the illegal outbound movement of weapons and bulk  currency from the United States, both of which are associated with  activities of narcotics traffickers. As an example of the growing threat  posed by the trafficking of heroin from Mexico, the quantity seized on  the southwest border nearly tripled, from 1,080 kilograms in 2010 to  3,158 kilograms in 2015. To address these threats, ONDCP  expanded the focus of the 2011 National Southwest Border  Counternarcotics Strategy to provide border communities with  enhanced prevention and drug treatment assistance, in the context of  maintaining strong and resilient communities. The 2013 strategy  stressed the same basic goals and objectives: substantially reduce  the flow of illicit drugs, drug proceeds, and associated instruments of  violence across the southwest border as well as maintain strong and  resilient communities. This strategy also included indicators related to  seizures of drugs at the border. The 2016 strategy differed slightly  from the 2013 strategy by elaborating on the threats of various illicit  drugs. It also noted that \u201canything that affects one part of the border  affects the entire border\u201d and noted that, for this reason, the National  Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy must be synchronized  with the other companion strategies, and the Heroin Availability  Reduction Plan.", "National Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy. The 2012  National Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy, which ONDCP  first issued that year, parallels the National Southwest  Counternarcotics Border Strategy and focuses on ongoing efforts to  reduce transnational organized crime threats on both sides of the  border between the United States and Canada, specifically the  movement of illicit drugs such as marijuana, ecstasy,  methamphetamine, and cocaine, and the proceeds from the sale of  those drugs. The 2014 strategy emphasizes enhanced federal  collaboration with state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  The legislation mandating that ONDCP publish the National Northern  Border Counternarcotics Strategy requires that this document be  released biannually; as of June 2017, the 2016 version had not  been released.", "Caribbean Border Counternarcotics Strategy. The Caribbean Border  Counternarcotics Strategy, issued in January 2015, is substantially  equivalent to the national counternarcotics strategies for the  southwest and northern borders, according to ONDCP. The strategy  identifies cocaine as the principal drug threat and a source of  associated violence in the Caribbean region and notes that the  documented cocaine flow via the Caribbean to the United States more  than doubled from 2011 to 2013, rising from 38 metric tons to 91  metric tons.

ONCDP has created working groups, such as groups focused on heroin  and cocaine, to develop actions, goals, and measures to reduce the  supply of those drugs in the U.S. market as a part of the overall effort to  address treatment and demand, as noted in the following examples:  In November 2015, ONDCP established the National Heroin  Coordination Group in coordination with the National Security  Council to provide guidance on interagency activities aimed at  reducing the supply of heroin and illicit fentanyl in the U.S market.  The working group includes agencies with federal law enforcement  responsibilities and their components, select High Intensity Drug  Trafficking Areas (HIDTA), the U.S. embassy in Mexico, and other  federal agencies and state entities. In June 2016, the group produced  the 5-year Heroin Availability Reduction Plan as part of the  administration\u2019s effort to prevent and treat heroin abuse.", "In January 2016, ONDCP created an internal working group on  methamphetamine and synthetic drugs to coordinate efforts across  drug control agencies. The group\u2019s priorities included working in  concert with federal partners, with source and transit countries to  reduce the availability of illicit methamphetamine in the United States,  and multilaterally to reduce the global trafficking of illicit  methamphetamine and precursor chemicals coming primarily from  Mexico.", "In September 2016, ONDCP created a National Cocaine Coordination  Group to address emerging threats from cocaine brought on by the  spike in coca cultivation and production as well as the associated  increase in its trafficking and use in the United States.

For  example, to address the smuggling of illicit drugs over the southwest  border, in May 2014 DHS established three new joint task forces\u2014Joint  Task Force\u2013East, Joint Task Force\u2013West, and the Joint Task Force for  Investigations\u2014in support of its Southern Border and Approaches  Campaign. The task forces coordinate operations to combat transnational  criminal organizations and counter illegal drug flows at maritime  approaches and in between ports of entry. All three joint task forces  incorporate elements of the Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE as well as DHS\u2019s  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Joint Task Force\u2013East is  responsible for the southern maritime border and approaches, Joint Task  Force\u2013West is responsible for the southern land border and the West  Coast, and the Joint Task Force for Investigations focuses on  investigations in support of the geographic task forces.", "Task forces also enhance coordination, deconfliction, and information  sharing by colocating representatives from different entities, which  facilitates interaction and enables information sharing, as we previously  reported. For example, Joint Interagency Task Force South includes 26  agencies and 20 foreign partners that work together to detect and monitor  illicit trafficking in the air and maritime domains, facilitating international  and interagency interdiction and apprehension. Information sharing is a  critical aspect of the Joint Interagency Task Force South\u2019s strategic  approach in supporting national and foreign partner nation law  enforcement and promoting regional stability in the Western Hemisphere.  As part of this effort, Joint Interagency Task Force South uses a tool  known as the Cooperative Situational Information Integration system to  share strategic communications and information with foreign partner  nations, according to Joint Interagency Task Force South officials. In  addition, U.S. Tactical Analysis Teams, which are posted at U.S. missions  overseas, and liaison officers from foreign partner nations, provide for a  high level of integrated information, according to officials at Joint  Interagency Task Force South. Officials indicated that Tactical Analysis  Teams and liaison officers provide the information that results in 60 to 70  percent of all task force cases, directly contributing to 50 to 60 percent of  all Joint Interagency Task Force South drug seizures. The task force  reported that its efforts resulted in 80 percent of total U.S. cocaine  seizures (282 of 338 metric tons) in fiscal year 2016.", "According to Joint Interagency Task Force South, the advantages of  working as a task force include the ability to use the participants\u2019 various  legal authorities (see the text box for an example):", "DOD brings detection and monitoring authorities.", "DOJ and DHS bring anticrime authorities.", "The Coast Guard brings its maritime law enforcement authorities.", "DEA, the FBI, and HSI bring drug and finance laws enforcement  authorities.", "CBP and HSI bring customs and immigration authorities.", "Partner nations bring multiple authorities from their countries.", "A typical case that illustrates how the various authorities of component agencies  work together in the Joint Interagency Task Force South could start with receipt  of actionable law enforcement information from the Drug Enforcement  Administration. This information prompts the deployment of a Customs and  Border Protection or Coast Guard plane that subsequently detects and monitors  a suspect vessel until Joint Interagency Task Force South can deploy a Coast  Guard, U.S. Navy, or allied government\u2019s ship with an on-board law enforcement  detachment to investigate. When the deployed ship arrives at the vessel\u2019s  location, the Coast Guard assumes control of the investigation. If the suspect  vessel is not registered in the United States, the Coast Guard commander  implements a bilateral agreement with the vessel\u2019s country of registration to  confirm the vessel\u2019s nationality and to stop, board, and search the vessel for  drugs.

The report states that Strike Force members are  colocated in offices separate from their parent agencies and interact with  each other on a daily basis using the resources and support of their  parent agencies. According to OCEDTF\u2019s report, Strike Force efforts help  further counternarcotics investigations by combining the resources and  expertise of all OCDETF participating investigators and prosecutors. The  report also states that, in recognition of the nationwide heroin threat,  OCDETF adjusted its resources to target heroin investigations and that  when heroin use was rising in 2014 and 2015, the percentage of  indictments with heroin charges likewise increased over the same time  frame. According to OCDETF\u2019s report, Strike Force effectiveness is  reflected in the caseload of active investigations linked to OCDETF\u2019s  Consolidated Priority Organization Targets. OCDETF reported that, in  fiscal year 2015, 45 percent of Strike Forces\u2019 active investigations were  linked to OCDETF Consolidated Priority Organization Targets; in contrast,  22 percent of all OCDETF investigations addressing transnational  organized crime were linked to these targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interagency Policy Committees", "paragraphs": ["The National Security Council has a number of interagency policy  committees that prioritize counternarcotics, including changing conditions,  in the Western Hemisphere.

To select these eight agencies, we  used the following two criteria:  1.  Agencies that have international counternarcotics efforts in one or  more of the areas that the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy  Commission has been asked to review. The Office of National Drug  Control Policy (ONDCP), which coordinates the National Drug Control  Program, requires all National Drug Control Program agencies to  submit an annual drug budget identifying the amounts the agencies  plan to spend on counternarcotics efforts for the upcoming fiscal year.  The agencies report spending for such efforts in 10 program areas:  Corrections, Intelligence, Interdiction, International, Investigations,  Prevention, Prosecution, Research and Development, State and Local  and Tribal Law Enforcement Assistance, and Treatment. On the basis  of ONDCP\u2019s definitions of these program areas, we determined that  four of these areas\u2014Intelligence, Interdiction, International, and  Investigations\u2014were relevant to the areas that the Western  Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission has been directed to examine.  2.  Agencies that allocated a combined total of at least $50 million for  their counternarcotics efforts for the Intelligence, Interdiction,  International, and Investigations program areas in fiscal year 2015.

Interdiction activities are intended to reduce the  availability of illegal drugs in the United States or abroad by targeting  transportation links. Interdiction efforts encompass the interception of  shipments of illegal drugs and their precursors and the disruption of  trafficking networks and their proceeds; such efforts may include air  and maritime seizures and deterring transport via air, sea, and land  routes. Other efforts involve accurate assessment and monitoring of  interdiction programs; enhancing the ability of nations that are drug  sources to interdict drugs; interdicting the flow of drugs, weapons, and  bulk currency along borders; and other air and maritime activities that  disrupt illegal drug-trafficking operations.", "International. International activities are primarily focused on areas  outside the United States and are intended to reduce illegal drug  availability in the United States or abroad. Activities may include  source-country programs designed to help international partners  manage the consequences of drug production, trafficking, and  consumption in their own societies, including programs to train and  equip security forces; efforts to raise awareness of science-based  practices and programs to prevent, treat, and provide recovery from  substance abuse; and support for economic development programs to  help reduce the production or trafficking of illicit drugs.

Moreover, State  officials reported that a State-provided wiretapping system and  associated training allowed Costa Rican prosecutors to convict seven  Sinaloa cartel members in May 2017, shutting down an operation that,  according to State officials, had been sending 14 metric tons of  cocaine per year to the United States.", "USAID also relies on international partnerships to implement its  alternative development activities. For example, USAID reported that it  plans to continue its mitigation of drug-related security threats in Peru by  replicating successes it had in the country\u2019s San Martin region and in  other coca-growing regions in collaboration with the government of Peru  and other U.S. government agencies, in its Peru Country Development  Cooperation Strategy for 2012 through 2016. Results from the Monzon  Valley in Peru also demonstrate how foreign partnerships can impact the  illicit drugs trade. USAID focused its alternative development assistance  on the coca stronghold of the Monzon Valley, which once supported  about 10,000 hectares of coca, from 2013 to 2015. The average income  was about $1.89 per day per person, well below the national extreme  poverty line of $2.20 per day per person in 2013. Households that  remained under assistance during the strategy period saw a 53-percent  increase in income. Moreover, the percentage of assisted families in  extreme poverty dropped by 25 percent, from 55 percent to 30 percent.  Coca cultivation dropped by more than 91 percent in all areas where  recent coca eradication was followed by sustained alternative  development assistance, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs  and Crime. The Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s Crime and Narcotics Center  recorded a less robust, but still impressive, reduction of 64 percent over  the same period, according to USAID officials. Furthermore, USAID  officials noted that while its resources for alternative development in Peru  diminished, the budget for the National Commission for Development and  Life without Drugs, Peru\u2019s development organization, grew from $15  million in 2011 to $38 million during 2014 and 2015.", "In Colombia, USAID reported in its 2014-2018 Country Development  Cooperation Strategy that it is trying to address the need for licit  economic opportunities by supporting cocoa, specialty coffee, rubber, and  dairy sectors in former coca-growing areas, which would help create the  conditions for alternative livelihoods and legal behaviors for small  producers in areas vulnerable to coca cultivation and drug production,  contributing to broad U.S. government and Colombian efforts to address  drug trafficking. This alternative development work increased under Plan  Colombia, with USAID and the government of Colombia working together  on several large-scale rural development projects. Three programs  evolved that incorporate public and private partnerships to facilitate  economic growth from 2006 to 2017. The first program reportedly  generated 250,000 new jobs by investing in agricultural sectors such as  rubber, cacao, and African palm enterprises as well as hotels and  tourism. The second program supported the provision of grant subsidies  to agricultural value-chains, linking small farmer associations with national  and international private-sector buyers. In the 2013 selection round, for  example, more than 30 selected projects included crops and products  such as cacao, rubber, fruits, dairy, and meat. In the third program,  USAID carried sustainable development by encouraging private-sector  investment in target areas. For example, USAID focused on developing  alliances with key private-sector leaders in the coffee and cacao sectors  in the former sector by raising yields and quality and addressing  infrastructure needs especially in conflict-prone zones. Today, Colombia  is the world\u2019s largest producer of premium-quality Arabica beans,  according to USAID. Likewise, fine cocoa is a successful crop in  Colombia, with a growing world demand, according to USAID. The  Colombian cocoa industry is relatively small, with 25,000 farmers  producing about 42,000 tons, or 0.2 percent of the global market.  However, about 85 percent of Colombian cocoa is from \u201cfine\u201d species,  giving Colombia a 3-percent share of global fine cocoa exports. USAID  also developed a private investment equity fund, providing capital to  small- and medium-sized enterprises in Colombia. The fund is now an  independent, for-profit enterprise providing small- and medium-sized  Colombian enterprises with capital and operational support.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to support foreign partners include its  Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, where U.S. and foreign  partners meet to discuss operational and legal issues.
