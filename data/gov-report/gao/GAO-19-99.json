They were typically located near sources of water or Corps-constructed water infrastructure.", "To prioritize construction projects to include in the President's budget requests for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the Corps used a process involving each of its three organizational levels\u2014districts, divisions, and headquarters. Districts divided projects into work packages and assigned 1 of 6 priority levels to indicate the order in which work packages from the same project should be completed. Districts grouped these work packages by business line or appropriations account based on the Corps' budget guidance for the fiscal year and then ranked them. Then Corps divisions and headquarters ranked the work packages. To assign rankings, Corps officials applied criteria specific to the business line of each project. These criteria often varied by fiscal year to address changes to policy guidance. Across the organization, Corps officials ranked more than 25,000 packages for fiscal year 2017. After assigning rankings, headquarters developed final budget recommendations to submit to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, who in turn provided the recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget for review and potential inclusion in the President's budget requests."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

However, Corps officials  explained that geographic characteristics, such as population, might have  affected how they considered including construction projects within  specific business lines. For example, Corps officials within the flood risk  management business line may have considered a construction project  located in a population center that could be severely impacted by a  flooding event to be a higher priority over other projects in less populated  areas.", "For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3  billion for the 71 construction projects that fell within the three main  business lines:", "Aquatic ecosystem restoration. The President\u2019s budget requested  $618 million for 15 Corps construction projects in the aquatic  ecosystem restoration business line, which were located in California,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon,  and Washington. According to the Corps budget guidance, these  projects were located in areas of federal significance that have some  degree of habitat scarcity, connectivity, and special-status species,  among other characteristics. Moreover, according to the Corps  budget guidance, construction projects in this business line  emphasize the restoration of nationally or regionally significant  habitats where the solution primarily involves modifying the hydrology  and geomorphology. For example, the goals of the South Florida  Ecosystem Restoration program\u2014a collection of several projects\u2014 includes improving the health of over 2.4 million acres of the south  Florida ecosystem (including Everglades National Park), enhancing  water supply, and maintaining flood mitigation, according to a Corps  document and Corps officials. According to a Corps document,  since 2000, the Corps has invested a total of $2.4 billion in the  program including other initiatives, such as the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan and Central and Southern Florida.", "Flood risk management. The President\u2019s budget requested $1.33  billion for 33 Corps construction projects in the flood risk management  business line, which were located in California, Florida, Illinois,  Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio,  Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West  Virginia. According to the Corps\u2019 budget guidance and strategic plan,  these projects are located in areas that may experience riverine and  coastal flooding, and they are to provide water supply storage. For  example, the Bluestone Lake project, in West Virginia, is to address  deficiencies that could lead to a breach of a dam built by the Corps in  the 1940s. According to the Corps, the dam\u2019s spillway cannot  discharge enough water without substantially increasing the potential  for a breach of the dam. According to the Corps, a breach could  cause catastrophic flooding along the largest river valleys in West  Virginia, including locations of major manufacturing and chemical  industries, and put 165,000 lives at risk. The Corps started the project  in 1998, and plans to award the next phase of the project in 2022. A  draft supplementary study has been completed to identify a plan to  address this additional deficiency, according to the Corps. The Corps  is planning for a 10-year construction period, with an estimated cost of  $575 million, according to a Corps document and a headquarters  official.", "Navigation. The President\u2019s budget requested $908 million for 20  Corps construction projects in the navigation business line, which  were located in coastal, inland, and intracoastal navigation systems in  California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, New  York, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and  Wisconsin. According to Corps\u2019 budget guidance, these projects are  intended to provide safe, reliable, cost-effective and environmentally  sustainable waterborne transportation systems for the movement of  commercial goods. For example, the Corps\u2019 Olmsted Locks and Dam  project is located on the Ohio River, which connects to the  Tennessee, Cumberland, and Mississippi rivers and is considered  critical for commercial navigation. According to the Corps, the project  consists of two 110-foot by 1,200-foot locks, which are located  adjacent to the Illinois bank, and a dam comprising of five tainter  gates, which control the amount of water that flows downstream.  According to a Corps document, over the last several years,  approximately 80 million tons of bulk commodities (for example, coal,  grain, rock, and sand) per year, on average, have passed through  navigation structures that are part of the project.

According to Corps  budget guidance and headquarters officials, business line managers and  account managers are instructed to consider two key factors when  determining their final rankings each fiscal year. Specifically, those  managers are instructed to give top priority to work packages that  significantly impact the risk to human life posed by potential disasters. In  addition, the managers are to prioritize work packages that address a  legal requirement to mitigate potential negative effects caused by  construction, such as adverse environmental effects.", "Using the final rankings, Corps headquarters officials said they developed  the final budget recommendations for each fiscal year, including a  recommended funding amount for each project, with input from various  levels of the organization.
