Although this was the most complete data identified, the data may not be representative of all private insurers. In addition, GAO interviewed officials in six states (Florida, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Texas) selected in part for variation in approaches to limit balance billing and location. GAO also interviewed air ambulance providers, health insurers, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials. DOT provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate, and the Department of Health and Human Services had no comments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Privately-insured patients transported by air ambulance providers outside of their insurers' provider networks are at financial risk for balance bills\u2014which, as the figure shows, are for the difference between prices charged by providers and payments by insurers. Any balance bills are in addition to copayments or other types of cost-sharing typically paid by patients under their insurance coverage.", "According to GAO's analysis of the most complete data identified for air ambulance transports of privately-insured patients, 69 percent of about 20,700 transports in the data set were out-of-network in 2017. This is higher than what research shows for ground ambulance transports (51 percent in 2014 according to one study) and other emergency services. Air ambulance providers that GAO spoke with reported entering into more network contracts recently, which could lower the extent of out-of-network transports in areas covered by the contracts.", "While out-of-network transports may result in balance billing, the data GAO analyzed do not indicate the extent to which patients received balance bills and, if so, the size of the bills. In addition, as GAO reported in 2017, there is a lack of national data on balance billing, but some states have attempted to collect information from patients. For example, GAO reviewed over 60 consumer complaints received by two of GAO's selected states\u2014the only states able to provide information on the amount of individual balance bills\u2014and all but one complaint was for a balance bill over $10,000. Patients may not end up paying the full amount if they reach agreements with air ambulance providers, insurers, or both. The amounts of potential balance bills are informed in part by the prices charged. GAO's analysis of the data set with transports for privately-insured patients found the median price charged by air ambulance providers was about $36,400 for a helicopter transport and $40,600 for a fixed-wing transport in 2017.", "The six states reviewed by GAO and others have attempted to limit balance billing. For example, the six states have taken actions to regulate insurers, generate public attention, or both. As required by recent federal law, the Secretary of Transportation has taken steps to form an advisory committee to, among other things, recommend options to prevent instances of balance billing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Air ambulances provide emergency services for critically ill patients,  primarily in life-threatening situations. First responders call for air  ambulances to transport patients from the scene of an injury or an  accident to hospitals. Physicians also call for air ambulances to transport  patients between hospitals when patients need higher levels of care, such  as specialized trauma, cardiac, or stroke care.", "The air ambulance industry, particularly as it relates to air ambulance  helicopters, has seen numerous changes in recent years. In 2017, we  reported that between 2010 and 2014 the median prices charged by air  ambulance providers for helicopter transports approximately doubled, and  the number of air ambulance helicopters grew by more than 10 percent.  We also found that various factors, such as the costs for and volume of  transports, may play a role in air ambulance prices, but we concluded that  an in-depth analysis of those factors is not possible due to a lack of data,  including data on the total number of transports.", "A health care billing practice known as balance billing may pose financial  risk to patients covered by private health insurance who receive air  ambulance services. Balance billing is when privately-insured patients  receive a bill from a health care provider for any difference between the  amount charged and the payment from the insurer for the service. For  privately-insured patients who receive air ambulance services, balance  billing can occur when they are transported by air ambulance providers  outside of their insurers\u2019 provider networks, which means the providers  and insurers do not have an agreed-upon payment rate. For example,  one consumer in North Dakota reported receiving a balance bill of  approximately $34,700 for an air ambulance transport from Dickinson,  North Dakota, to Bismarck, North Dakota, in November 2017. The air  ambulance provider had charged $41,400, and the patient\u2019s insurer had  paid $6,700, leaving a balance of approximately $34,700.", "There has been interest among federal and state policymakers and  others in the issues of out-of-network air ambulance transports and  potential balance billing. For example, the Secretary of Transportation  has taken steps to form an advisory committee on air ambulance patient  billing, as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  Reauthorization Act of 2018, which became law in October 2018. Among  other things, the committee is directed to recommend steps that states  can take to protect consumers.", "The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the 2017 Consolidated  Appropriations Act includes a provision for us to review air ambulance  services.

We also  interviewed officials from the three largest independent air ambulance  providers, five national health insurers dominant in our selected states,  and officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the  U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). To gain additional context, we  also interviewed academic researchers and a consumer group who have  examined the issue of balance billing, and we interviewed officials from  local air ambulance providers and hospitals in three states (Maryland,  Montana, and Texas) where we conducted site visits.", "To describe changes in the geographic distribution of air ambulance  services, in addition to the interviews, we analyzed data in the Atlas &  Database of Air Medical Services (ADAMS) on the locations of air  ambulance providers\u2019 bases for 2012 and 2017, the most recent year for  which data were available. We consulted with officials from the  Association of Air Medical Services about limitations of the data, including  that (1) these data are voluntarily reported by air ambulance providers  with, according to officials, an estimated 95 percent of helicopter air  ambulance providers and 90 percent of fixed-wing air ambulance  providers in each year; and (2) the data include some air ambulance  providers that do not offer air ambulance services on a full-time basis or  that have a primary mission other than air medical services. We assessed  the reliability of the ADAMS data by reviewing related documentation,  interviewing relevant officials, checking for internal consistency, and  comparing our results across data sets and to published sources. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives.", "To describe the extent of out-of-network air ambulance transports and  balance billing for these services, in addition to the interviews, we  analyzed private health insurance claims from FAIR Health for 2012 and  2017, the most recent year for which data were available, regarding the  status of air ambulance transports as in- or out-of-network and the prices  charged for those transports. FAIR Health is an independent, nonprofit  organization that collects data for and manages a database of private  health insurance claims data. The FAIR Health data set contains claims  for around 24,100 transports in 2012 and 33,800 transports in 2017 from  all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including claims from over 50  insurers in each year (including both fully-insured and self-insured plans).  The data set accounted for 110.1 million covered lives in 2012 and 145.0  million covered lives in 2017. This was the most complete data source  we identified with data on prices charged for and the network status of air  ambulance transports for privately-insured patients. However, the FAIR  Health data may not be representative of all private insurers and therefore  cannot be generalized. Our results on prices charged are based on all  transports in the FAIR Health data. Our results on the extent of out-of- network transports are based on a subset of about 13,100 transports  (accounting for about 58.6 million covered lives) in 2012 and about  20,700 transports (accounting for about 87.3 million covered lives) in  2017 with information on network status. We assessed the reliability of  the FAIR Health data by reviewing related documentation, interviewing relevant officials, checking for internal consistency, and comparing our  results across data sets and to published sources.

Helicopter bases may be at hospitals, airports, or  other types of helipads, and a provider may need to fly from its base  to the scene or a hospital to pick up the patient being transported. Air  ambulance providers typically respond to calls for helicopter  transports within a certain area around their bases in part to ensure  appropriate response times.", "Fixed-wing aircraft are generally used for longer-distance transports  between hospitals. Fixed-wing bases are at airports, and the patient is  transported by ground ambulance to and from the airports.", "Air ambulance providers respond to emergencies without knowing  patients\u2019 health insurance coverage, such as whether the patient has  private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or no insurance. According to  our previous analysis of information from eight selected air ambulance  providers, in 2016, Medicare patients received 35 percent of helicopter  transports, privately-insured patients received 32 percent, Medicaid  patients received 21 percent, uninsured patients received 9 percent, and  patients with other types of coverage such as automobile and military- sponsored insurance received a small percentage.", "Relatively few patients receive air ambulance transports, but those  patients who do generally have no control over the decision to be  transported by air ambulance or the selection of the air ambulance  provider, as shown in Figure 2. For privately-insured patients, this means  they cannot necessarily choose to be transported by air ambulance  providers in their insurers\u2019 network and can potentially receive a balance  bill from the providers for the difference between the price charged by the  provider and the amount paid by the insurer. This amount is in addition to  copayments, deductibles, or other types of cost-sharing that patients  typically pay under their insurance. Air ambulance providers are  prohibited from sending balance bills to Medicare and Medicaid patients,  while uninsured patients might be held responsible by the air ambulance  provider for the entire price charged.", "With many types of health care services, both health care providers and  insurers have incentives to negotiate and enter into contracts that specify  amounts that providers will accept as payment in full, thereby avoiding the  potential for balance bills for those services. Insurers can offer\u2014and  health care providers may be willing to accept\u2014payment rates that are  much lower than the providers\u2019 charged amounts because the providers  may receive more patients as an in-network provider. Furthermore, when  patients are choosing insurance plans, they may consider how many or  which providers are in-network, particularly for providers such as  hospitals or certain physicians.", "The emergency nature of most air ambulance transports, as well as their  relative rarity and high prices charged, reduces the incentives of both air  ambulance providers and insurers to enter into contracts with agreed- upon payment rates, which means air ambulance providers may be more  often out-of-network when compared with other types of providers.  Decisions by first responders and physicians on which air ambulance  provider to call are typically not based on the patient\u2019s insurance plan,  meaning that being in-network may not increase air ambulance providers\u2019  transport volume. As a result, according to stakeholders we spoke to, if  insurers offer payment rates that are much lower than the air ambulance  providers\u2019 charged amounts, the air ambulance providers may be less  willing than other health care providers to accept those payment rates.  Furthermore, given the relative rarity of air ambulance transports, patients  may not anticipate needing air ambulance transports and may not choose  insurance plans based on which or how many air ambulance providers  are in insurers\u2019 networks.", "Approaches by states or the federal government to limit balance billing  may target providers, insurers, or both. Examples of approaches  described in research on balance billing include a cap on the amount that  providers can charge or a requirement for insurers to pay the full amount  charged by providers. However, according to the research, targeting just  providers or insurers can result in undesired outcomes. Capping the  amount providers can charge could result in insurers that underpay for  services, which could lead some providers to reduce service or exit the  market altogether. Conversely, requiring insurers to pay the full amount  charged by providers could result in providers that overcharge for  services, which could lead to higher premiums charged to patients.", "The authority of states to address issues related to air ambulance  balance billing is affected by the following federal laws:", "Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA): A provision in this law  preempts state-level economic regulation\u2014i.e., regulating rates,  routes, and services\u2014of air carriers authorized by DOT to provide air  transportation. In general, courts have held that air ambulances are  considered to be air carriers under the ADA\u2019s preemption provision,  and courts, DOT, and state attorneys general have determined  specific issues related to the air ambulance industry that can and  cannot be regulated at the state level.", "McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945: This act affirmed that states have  the authority to regulate the business of insurance. For example,  states may review insurers\u2019 health insurance plans and premium  rates. In instances of balance billing, states can determine whether  the insurer paid a provider in accordance with its policy for paying for  out-of-network services.", "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA):  ERISA provides a federal framework for regulating employer-based  pension and welfare benefit plans, including health plans. Although  states may regulate health insurers, ERISA preemption generally  prevents states from directly regulating self-insured employer-based  health plans.", "In 2017, as previously mentioned, we reported on the increase in prices  charged by helicopter air ambulance providers and on the lack of data on  the factors that may be affecting prices charged. We also found only  limited information was available related to several key aspects of the  industry, ranging from basic aspects\u2014such as the composition of the  industry by type of air ambulance provider, the prices charged by air  ambulance providers, and the number of overall transports\u2014to the more  complex, such as the extent of contracting between air ambulance  providers and insurers or the extent of balance billing to patients.", "Given DOT\u2019s authority to oversee certain aspects of the industry, we  made four recommendations to DOT in 2017 to increase transparency  and obtain information to better inform their oversight of the air  ambulance industry: (1) communicating a method to receive air  ambulance complaints, including those regarding balance billing; (2)  taking steps to make complaint information publicly available; (3)  assessing available federal and industry data to determine what  information could assist in the evaluation of future complaints; and (4)  considering consumer disclosure requirements for air ambulance  providers, such as established prices charged and the extent of  contracting with insurers. DOT has taken steps to respond to the first two  recommendations, including adding information to its website describing  how air ambulance complaints can be registered and used by DOT. It has  also listed the number of air ambulance complaints filed with DOT each  month starting in January 2018\u201423 air ambulance complaints have been  filed with DOT through November 2018.

This addition in bases also  increased the total area served by helicopter bases by 23 percent.  Several air ambulance providers told us about their decisions to open  new bases. For example, one air ambulance provider told us that one  way it evaluates the need for a new base in an area is to ask hospitals in  that area about the number of transports they typically require and the  length of time it takes helicopters to arrive to pick up patients.", "Along with adding helicopter bases, air ambulance providers also added  fixed-wing bases from 2012 through 2017, according to our analysis of  the ADAMS data.

Both the existing and new bases are more prevalent in the  Western and Southern parts of the United States. Given that fixed-wing  aircraft are used for longer-distance transports and that patients are  brought to the base rather than picked up by fixed-wing aircraft, we did  not measure the area or any changes in the area served by fixed-wing  bases, which are usually airports.", "Based on our previous work, we further analyzed two trends related to  where air ambulance providers have chosen to locate their new bases.", "New bases in rural areas: About 60 percent of the new helicopter  bases and about half of the new fixed-wing bases in the ADAMS data  were in rural areas. We previously reported that some helicopter air  ambulance providers told us that the lower population density in rural  areas leads to fewer transports per helicopter at rural bases. They  also said that, despite the lower population density, rural areas may  have greater need for air ambulance transports. This may be due to,  for example, the closure of some rural hospitals and the establishment  of regional medical facilities, such as cardiac and stroke centers that  provide highly specialized care.", "New bases in areas with existing coverage: For just under half of  the new helicopter bases in the ADAMS data, the area served  overlapped with existing air ambulance coverage by more than 50  percent. On one hand, according to some stakeholders we spoke to,  the new helicopters may help enhance available services by, for  example, being able to respond to a call if the existing ambulance  resources are in use or otherwise unavailable. On the other hand,  as we have previously reported, some air ambulance providers told us  that when helicopters are added to bases in areas with existing  coverage, those helicopters are not serving additional demand. As a  result, the same number of transports is spread out over more  helicopters, reducing the average number of transports per helicopter.", "The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which became law in October  2018, requires the FAA to assess the availability of information to the  general public related to the location of heliports and helipads used by  helicopters providing air ambulance services and to update current  databases or, if appropriate, develop a new database containing such  information.

For example, one of the large independent air ambulance providers and a  national insurer entered into a contract that covered patients in five states  as of August 2018. These contracts could decrease the extent of out-of- network transports and balance billing in the future for these states.", "Increases in the prices charged for air ambulance transports may  exacerbate the financial risks related to balance billing for those with  private insurance.

In addition, as we  previously reported, there is a lack of comprehensive national data about  the extent and size of balance bills, and air ambulance providers are  generally not required to report such data.", "However, some states have attempted to collect information from patients  about balance billing for air ambulance services. Therefore, to provide  insights into potential balance bill amounts, we reviewed data on  consumer complaints that two of our selected states had received about  specific incidents of balance billing for 2014 through 2018. Data for  Maryland contained about two dozen complaints with information on the  specific amount of balance bills, and those amounts ranged from $12,300  to $52,000. Data from North Dakota contained three dozen complaints  with information on the specific amount of balance bills, and those  amounts ranged from $600 to $66,600, though all but one amount was  over $10,000.", "Given that providers may agree to reduce amounts that patients would  otherwise owe or insurers may increase their payments to providers,  along with limited national data, the extent to which patients actually pay  the full amounts of balance bills received is also unclear. Generally,  officials from air ambulance providers we spoke to said that they first  encourage patients to appeal to their insurers for increased payment. If  these appeals do not fully address the balance bill, the providers may  offer various payment options. For example, officials from one air  ambulance provider said that it offers a discount of up to 50 percent off  the balance bill if the patient pays the remaining 50 percent immediately.  Alternatively, the provider requests detailed financial information\u2014such  as income, obligations and debts, and medical bills\u2014to determine  whether to potentially offer other discounts or a payment plan. This  process can take multiple months, and officials from another air  ambulance provider said patients who do not respond to letters and calls  may be more likely to be referred to a collections process. Air ambulance  providers we spoke with said that they use discretion on how much  assistance to offer, and not all patients receive discounts after providing  all relevant documentation.

One reason for this decrease in consumer complaints,  according to officials in Montana, was that uncertainty over the possible  effects of the law has made most air ambulance providers more willing to  enter into contract negotiations with insurers. The officials added that  shortly after the law\u2019s enactment, a large insurer and a large air  ambulance provider entered into a network contract.
