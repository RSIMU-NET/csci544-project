MA enrollment has  increased from 11.1 million in 2010 to 17.6 million in 2016, and the  program now accounts for nearly a third of all Medicare beneficiaries\u2014 more than in any previous year. Under MAOs\u2019 contracts, beneficiaries  may typically choose from a wide array of plans that vary in their  coverage, costs, and provider networks. Medicare requires MAOs to  accept all beneficiaries who want to enroll in a plan, and the program has  certain protections in place to ensure that the needs of beneficiaries in  poor health are adequately met. For example, MAOs are prohibited from  limiting or conditioning their coverage or provision of benefits based on  health status, and CMS may not approve bids for MA contracts with plans  that have benefit packages that discourage the enrollment of certain  beneficiaries, such as those with chronic conditions. In addition, CMS  requires that MAOs develop provider networks that ensure adequate  access to covered services for all beneficiaries.", "Because MAOs can change their plan offerings from one year to the next,  CMS encourages MA beneficiaries to review their enrollment decisions  annually and consider which plan best meets their needs. Beneficiaries  may choose to remain in their current plan, enroll in another plan offered  under the same MAO contract, enroll in a plan offered under a different  contract, or enroll in traditional Medicare. Each MAO contract is specific  to a plan type\u2014such as a health maintenance organization (HMO) or a  preferred provider organization (PPO)\u2014but each contract may include a  variety of plan benefit packages (referred to as a plan) for beneficiaries to  select, each with its own unique mix of cost sharing requirements and  covered benefits.", "Consequently, beneficiaries who choose to enroll in a different plan under  the same MA contract, have elected to stay in the same type of plan (e.g.,  HMO or PPO) offered by the same MAO. In contrast, beneficiaries who  choose to enroll in a plan offered under a different contract have elected  to enroll in a different type of plan or one offered by a different MAO. In  2014, nearly 12 percent of beneficiaries chose to leave their MA contract,  due to a number of potential factors. Contract-level disenrollment may  indicate a well-functioning competitive local MA market with competing  MAOs seeking to attract beneficiaries to their plans by offering additional  benefits or lower premiums and cost sharing. Alternatively, disenrollment  may indicate that beneficiaries encountered access or quality issues.  These beneficiaries may disenroll, for example, if their preferred provider  is no longer in the plan\u2019s network or if they believe that their health care  needs have not been well met.", "While disenrollment among some of a contract\u2019s beneficiaries is  expected, disparities in disenrollment rates between beneficiaries with  different health care needs can be a sign of potential problems with a  contract. If MAOs are meeting the needs of all their beneficiaries, we  would expect that the rates at which beneficiaries disenroll would not vary  by their health status. However, when beneficiaries in poor health are  more likely to disenroll than those in better health\u2014which we refer to as  health-biased disenrollment\u2014it may indicate that those beneficiaries  could be facing problems with access to care or the quality of services  provided. From an oversight perspective, contracts with health-biased  disenrollment may not warrant extra CMS scrutiny if relatively few  beneficiaries choose to leave the contract. However, contracts with both  high overall rates of disenrollment and health-biased disenrollment may  indicate potentially problematic contracts.", "Given questions about the care beneficiaries in poor health receive in MA,  you asked us to review MA disenrollment by health status and any related  CMS oversight. In this report, we examined  1.  the extent to which disenrollment rates vary across MA contracts;  2.  the extent of any health-biased disenrollment among MA contracts;  3.  how the characteristics of those contracts with health-biased  disenrollment, if any, compare to those of other contracts;  4.  the reasons beneficiaries give for leaving those contracts with health- biased disenrollment, if any, compared with other contracts; and  5.  how, if at all, CMS identifies contracts with health-biased  disenrollment as part of its routine oversight of MA contracts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To examine variation in MA disenrollment by contract, we examined CMS  enrollment and disenrollment data for 2014\u2014the most recent year of data  available at the time of our analysis\u2014for 252 contracts. We selected  these 252 contracts as they had at least 100 disenrollees in poor health  and 100 disenrollees in better health as well as had at least 50 percent of  the individual measures in the 2016 MA Five-Star Rating System\u2014which  largely reflected performance in 2014. These contracts accounted for 80  percent of the 17.5 million beneficiaries enrolled in an MA contract that  year. We calculated the disenrollment rate for each of these contracts  and designated the 126 contracts above the median rate of 10.6 percent  as having relatively high disenrollment rates and the 126 contracts below  the median rate as having relatively low disenrollment rates. (See  appendix I for more details on the selection of the contracts included in  our study.)", "To determine the extent of health-biased disenrollment, if any, among MA  contracts, we focused our analysis on the 126 MA contracts with higher  disenrollment rates. We used CMS risk score data to identify  beneficiaries in poor health and beneficiaries in better health. Specifically,  beneficiaries whose projected spending was at least twice as much as  that for the average Medicare beneficiary were characterized as being in  poor health, while the remaining beneficiaries with projected spending  less than that amount were considered to be in better health. Using this  information for each of the 126 contracts, we then calculated  disenrollment odds ratios to determine the likelihood that beneficiaries in  poor health disenrolled from the contract compared to beneficiaries in  better health. For example, an odds ratio of 1.50 signifies that those in  poor health were 50 percent more likely to disenroll than those in better  health. We deemed contracts with an odds ratio over 1.25\u2014where the  likelihood that poor health beneficiaries disenrolled was more than 25  percent greater than that of beneficiaries in better health\u2014as having  health-biased disenrollment. We deemed those contracts with an odds  ratio of 1.25 or less as lacking health-biased disenrollment.", "To examine the characteristics of contracts with and without health- biased disenrollment, we focused our analysis on the 126 MA contracts  with higher disenrollment rates in 2014. We analyzed CMS data for 2014  on a number of contract variables, including enrollment size and the  number of years of experience in the MA program. In addition, we  compared the quality ratings of contracts in each group based on data  from the MA Five-Star Rating System. These data comprise an overall  star rating for each MA contract as well as each contract\u2019s performance  scores on up to 47 individual measures\u2014such as controlling blood  pressure\u2014grouped within 9 domains\u2014such as managing chronic  conditions. We determined the median score for individual performance  measures for all contracts in the rating system. For both the contracts  with and without health-biased disenrollment, we then determined the  percentage of measures within each domain that had better than median  scores; we characterized these contracts as having relatively high  quality.", "To examine the reasons beneficiaries chose to disenroll from contracts  with and without health-biased disenrollment, we analyzed CMS\u2019s  Disenrollment Reasons Survey reports. The reports are compiled for MA  contracts based on surveys sent to a representative sample of  disenrollees to learn about why they elected to leave their plan. CMS  combined survey responses into one of five composite reasons for  disenrollment: problems with costs, problems with drug coverage,  problems getting information on drugs, problems getting needed care,  and preferred providers not in network. For each of the 126 MA  contracts with higher disenrollment rates, we compared the average  percentage of respondents who identified each composite reason, for  contracts with and without health-biased disenrollment.", "To examine how, if at all, CMS identifies contracts with health-biased  disenrollment as part of its routine oversight of MA contracts, we reviewed  the agency guidance and data provided to its regional offices and  interviewed CMS officials. In addition, we compared the set of contracts  identified by CMS as having potential problems in 2014 with the contracts  we identified as having health-biased disenrollment.

Instead of paying  providers\u2019 claims directly, CMS contracts with MAOs to assume the risk of  providing health benefits to beneficiaries in exchange for fixed monthly  payments. The payment amounts vary, in part, depending on the relative  health status of the MAO\u2019s beneficiaries as compared to the health status  of an average Medicare beneficiary. CMS paid almost $170 billion to  MAOs in 2015.", "MAOs must provide coverage for all traditional Medicare services and  include a yearly limit on out-of-pocket costs. Most plans also include  prescription drug coverage offered under Medicare Part D. Plans may  offer more generous benefits, such as less cost sharing and additional  covered services, such as vision or dental care. To control utilization, plans may impose referral requirements and implement care coordination  programs. MA beneficiaries\u2019 access to providers is generally limited to a  network of physicians, hospitals, and others that contract with their MAO.  If a given physician or hospital is not in the MA plan\u2019s network, the  beneficiary\u2019s out-of-pocket cost to use that physician or hospital may be  considerably higher than the cost associated with using providers in the  plan\u2019s network.", "Beneficiaries may choose from the plans available in their county, which  may be provided by multiple contacts. The contracts represent various  types of plans, including HMOs, PPOs, and private fee-for-service (PFFS)  plans. HMOs, which according to CMS, accounted for nearly three-fourths  of MA enrollment in 2016, generally restrict beneficiary access to  providers in their network. PPOs, which according to CMS, accounted for  nearly one-fourth of 2016 MA enrollment, also have networks, but allow  beneficiaries access to non-network providers by paying higher cost  sharing amounts. In contrast, PFFS plans, which accounted for 1 percent  of MA enrollment in 2016, generally offer a wider choice of providers. A  subset of HMOs and PPOs are special needs plans (SNP) which provide  care for beneficiaries in one of three classes of special needs. Medicare  beneficiaries can enroll in a SNP if they are dually eligible for Medicare  and Medicaid, require an institutional level of care, or have a severe or  chronic condition.", "While beneficiaries are generally locked into their MA plan for a year  (January through December), they may voluntarily leave their plan at  certain times in the year or if they meet certain criteria. During the annual  open enrollment period, from October 15 to December 7, MA  beneficiaries may change their MA plan selection or join traditional  Medicare. This is followed by the MA disenrollment period, from January  1 to February 14, when MA beneficiaries may join traditional Medicare  and are allowed to select a drug plan to go with their new coverage. In  addition, CMS has special enrollment periods where MA beneficiaries  may change their enrollment under certain circumstances. For example,  Medicare beneficiaries can switch to a contract with an overall Five-Star  rating of 5 from December 8 to the following November 30.
