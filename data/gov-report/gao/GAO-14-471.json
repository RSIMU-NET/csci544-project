The geographic distribution of RUS loans is widespread, with broadband providers in 43 states having received one or more loans through the loan program from 2003 through 2013. About $2 billion in loans have been made to providers in areas with diverse demographics and economies, including areas with low population densities and income as well as areas in relative proximity to large cities with robust local economies. Of the 100 RUS loans approved through the loan program, 48 are currently being repaid, and 9 have been fully paid back. Forty-three are no longer active, either because they were cancelled before they were paid out (25 rescinded) or because the provider defaulted by failing to abide by the terms of the loan (18 defaulted). Approving a loan requires significant resources. Loans that default or are rescinded can represent an inefficient use of RUS resources. Despite these issues, RUS has not gathered information or performed analysis to better understand what might lead a project to default or otherwise make a project a poor candidate for receiving a loan. Federal guidance, though, emphasizes the importance of assessing the risk associated with loan programs.", "RUS loans can help promote limited broadband deployment and economic development, but USDA's performance goals do not fully align with the loan program's purpose. According to GAO analysis of National Broadband Map deployment data as of June 2013, areas with RUS loans generally have the same number of broadband providers as areas without a loan. However, the RUS loan program can enhance the quality and reach of broadband networks in rural areas, according to stakeholders. Further, according to GAO analysis of RUS loans and U.S. Census Bureau data from 2003 through 2011\u2014the years for which RUS and relevant Census data are available\u2014areas affected by at least one approved RUS loan were associated with modestly higher levels of employment and payroll (1 to 4 percent) after the year of loan approval and in all subsequent years, as compared to areas that did not receive RUS loans. As stated in the program regulations, the purpose of the RUS loan program is to increase broadband deployment (that is, the number of broadband subscribers with access to new or improved broadband service) and economic opportunity in rural America through the provision of broadband services. USDA's Annual Performance Report ( APR ) provides information on the achievements of USDA's programs each fiscal year. The goals in USDA's report, though, do not fully align with the purpose of the loan program. For instance, USDA's APR does not have any goals or measures to determine the loan program's progress towards economic development outcomes. As our past work has shown, an attribute of a successful performance goal is whether it aligns with division and agency-wide goals. Agency performance goals that do not link to program goals can lead to incentives and behaviors that do not support the achievement of division or agency-wide goals. Performance goals aligned with the program's purpose may help USDA and Congress better monitor the outcomes of the loan program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USDA (1) evaluate loans made by RUS through the loan program to identify characteristics of loans that may be at risk of rescission or default and (2) align the goals in its APR to the loan program's purpose, to the extent feasible.

Furthermore, broadband can improve  citizens\u2019 quality of life. For example, broadband technology makes it  possible for a patient to visit a local clinic and receive medical attention  from specialists hundreds of miles away, for a student to access  information not available from the local library, and for a firefighter to  download blueprints of a burning building and intervene appropriately.

To assess broadband deployment, we  used the most recent National Broadband Map\u2019s (NBM) data on  broadband availability to compare the number of providers in counties  with approved RUS loan projects to counties with rejected RUS loan  projects. NBM data currently available represent broadband availability as  of June 2013. We also compared the number of broadband providers in  select communities before and after the approval of a RUS loan; we  selected these communities as part of our site visits, discussed below.  For this analysis, we gathered information on broadband providers  present in these communities before the RUS loan from the relevant loan  files at USDA, and used NBM information to identify providers after the  RUS loan approval. To examine economic development in rural areas,  we developed a regression model to assess the relationship between  counties with approved loan projects and specific economic outcomes  (i.e., number of business establishments, employment, and annual  payroll). We assessed the reliability of RUS data by interviewing RUS  officials about their databases and data collection practices. We also  assessed the reliability of NBM data by reviewing how the map  developers collect data and conduct quality assurance checks, as well as  through interviews with stakeholders. Based on this information we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting  purposes. We also conducted site visits and phone interviews with  stakeholders in seven states, which we selected to include communities  with providers that have and have not received different kinds of RUS  broadband loans. As part of our site visits we interviewed, when  possible, broadband providers, as well as state and local stakeholders  such as Chambers of Commerce. We also examined prior academic  studies of the RUS loan program as well as other research on the general  impact of broadband availability and adoption on communities. We  identified these studies through a literature search as well as interviews  with stakeholders.", "Finally, to determine the impact of reforms to the USF and ICC on the  RUS broadband loan program, we reviewed relevant documentation,  analyzed USF data, and conducted interviews.

We also reviewed public comments  on the rulemakings proposed as part of this Transformation Order, as well  as studies and reports that assess the impact of the reforms. To calculate  the extent of USF support for RUS broadband borrowers, we examined  data\u2014for the years 2003 through 2013\u2014reported in FCC\u2019s Universal  Service Monitoring Report. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing relevant data collection and verification documents.

Rural areas, though, can  have conditions that increase the cost of broadband deployment, such as  remote areas with challenging terrain like mountains, which increase  construction costs, or conditions that make it difficult to recoup  deployment costs, such as relatively low population densities and  incomes. These conditions make it less likely that a service provider will  build out or maintain a network. Low population density can mean fewer  potential subscribers, and lower-income populations are less likely to use  broadband. There is also evidence that rural low-income households are  less likely to use broadband than metropolitan low-income households.  As a result of these factors, rural areas tend to lag behind urban and  suburban areas in broadband deployment.", "However, because of broadband\u2019s economic and social benefits, several  public programs aim to encourage greater investment in rural areas. RUS  administers several such programs intended to accelerate the  deployment of broadband services. One program is the Rural Broadband  Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, which authorizes RUS to  provide treasury rate loans, 4 percent loans, and loan guarantees. The  loan program was authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment  Act of 2002 (2002 reauthorization act) and RUS approved the first loans  under the program in fiscal year 2003. On February 6, 2013, RUS  published in the Federal Register the final rule implementing the loan  program, as reauthorized in 2008. Entities eligible to receive these  loans include corporations, limited liability companies, cooperative or  mutual organizations, Indian tribes, and state or local governments. The  program is \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d in that RUS can finance any type of  broadband service as long as the applicant plans to deliver broadband to  every customer in the proposed service area at certain speeds. The  loan program was reauthorized by the 2014 reauthorization act, which  modified some eligibility requirements and included a new requirement for  any entity receiving a loan to submit a semiannual report, for the 3 years  after completion of the project, which includes data on broadband  adoption rates. According to RUS officials we spoke with, until RUS  publishes regulations implementing the changes in the 2014  reauthorization act, it will not accept new loan applications. To  administer the loan program, RUS has approximately 22 program staff as  well as 25 field staff assisting part-time.", "According to RUS rules for the loan program, the service area of a project  eligible for RUS broadband financing must be entirely within a rural area,  defined for this loan program as any area not contained in an  incorporated city or town with a population in excess of 20,000  inhabitants, or an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or  town that has a population greater than 50,000 inhabitants.

The RUS definition of eligible rural areas for the loan  program has been changed twice to better target loans to rural areas. In  2008, for instance, the definition of an eligible community was changed to  exclude communities adjacent to urbanized areas. This change followed  a 2005 finding by the USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General that some loans  had been made to areas that were not truly rural, such as suburban  communities bordering large cities. We found that the majority of active  RUS loans were made to providers in communities that satisfy the 2008  and 2004 definitions of rural used by RUS. Additionally, the majority of  active loan communities meet alternative definitions of rural. Specifically,  our analysis assessed whether loans could be considered rural using the  standard Census definition as well as USDA\u2019s Rural-Urban Commuting  Area Codes (RUCA). Census classifies a community as rural if it falls  outside of an urban area, and most active loans adhered to this  population density-based definition, whether 2000 or 2010 Census data  were used.

Because these loans were not carefully serviced, these funds are not  available to support future broadband loans.\u201d Since the loan program  was created in 2002, about 18 percent of all loans have defaulted. In  contrast, a private, but government-sponsored, lender that finances  broadband projects we spoke with stated that only about 1 to 3 percent of  its clients will fail to implement their projects. However, officials with that  private lender noted that their investment strategy differs significantly from  RUS, with RUS\u2019s program requirements allowing more risk in their loan  portfolio. As RUS officials told us, private lenders can decline to award  any loan, whereas RUS must implement the program in accordance with  its authorizing statutes.", "Loans that are approved by RUS require significant resources to review  and monitor. According to RUS officials, these administrative costs are  not just one-time expenses associated with the application review, but are  incurred throughout the life of the loan. For loans made to providers that  experience financial challenges, RUS staff must conduct additional follow- up work, including work associated with any decisions to rescind a loan.  Therefore, failure of many defaulted and fully rescinded projects to result  in broadband service can represent an inefficient use of RUS resources.  RUS acknowledged that dedicating resources to servicing loans in default  takes away resources that could be used for evaluating new applications,  but it did not agree that this is an inefficient use of resources. Additionally,  the rescission of funding for projects in a year when RUS obligates the  entirety of its total authorized value of loans that year could prevent more  viable applicants from receiving loans.", "Despite these issues, RUS has not gathered information or performed  analysis to better understand what might lead a project to default or  otherwise make a project a poor candidate for receiving the loan.  According to RUS officials, a lack of staff resources has prevented them  from studying the reasons for failed projects. Other USDA staff, though,  such as researchers in the Economic Research Service who are  responsible for informing and enhancing public and private decision  making, may have the expertise to examine these issues.

The comparatively lower population density and income of rural  areas are primary reasons why broadband is less deployed there than in  suburban and urban areas. As a result, developing a business case to  build broadband infrastructure that guarantees a return on investment can  be difficult for rural providers. Aside from RUS loans, there are few  alternatives for financing rural broadband projects because banks  typically do not make loans for projects that lack a strong business case.", "According to several stakeholders we spoke with, RUS loans have helped  providers overcome financial barriers to broadband deployment, allowing  providers to upgrade existing service to faster technologies and expand  deployment to new subscribers in rural areas. In these areas, RUS loans  can be an essential source of financing. Officials we spoke with in four  rural communities said that broadband services would likely not exist in  very rural areas without federal support. For example, representatives of  providers in Kansas and Vermont told us their RUS loan was essential to  construction of broadband infrastructure in their rural service areas.", "According to our analysis of affected areas, the RUS loan program has  had a mixed record of increasing overall broadband deployment. In order  to further assess the impact of loans on broadband deployment, we  compared the number of broadband providers in counties that have RUS- financed broadband projects to the number of providers in counties that  applied but were rejected for a RUS loan as well as counties that had fully  rescinded loans, using the latest data from the NBM. Our goal with this  analysis was to compare counties that were generally similar but for the  presence of a RUS loan. Overall, counties with RUS-financed projects  generally do not have more broadband providers than similar counties.  Specifically, as of June 2013, counties with RUS projects had an average  of 4.9 broadband providers, whereas counties with rejected and  rescinded projects had an average of 5.1 broadband providers.  While  this analysis suggests that RUS loans have little to no overall impact on  the number of broadband providers, the county-level data could mask  local impacts of loans. Indeed, information we collected during our site  visits indicate that RUS loans can lead to enhanced broadband  deployment in specific rural areas within counties. For example, rural  areas around East Corinth, Vermont, had no broadband access until the  local provider was awarded a RUS loan. Catskill, New York, only had one  broadband provider until a RUS loan enabled another provider to build  into the community. A RUS loan also helped a provider upgrade service  in rural areas around Eagle Butte, South Dakota, from dial-up access to  digital subscriber line service.

Rural development officials in Vermont also told us that  broadband enables online financial transactions for rural residents to  conduct both bookkeeping and shopping, provides a forum for community  outreach, and facilitates increased tourism, among other things.  According to one official we spoke with in Vermont, some tourists prefer  to have broadband access while vacationing.", "Businesses and entrepreneurs may choose to locate in a community in  part based on access to broadband. According to two business site  selection experts\u2013consultants who specialize in helping businesses  identify new business locations\u2013we spoke with, reliable broadband  networks are now critical for rural businesses. The lack of broadband  connectivity in a rural area could significantly hinder the ability of that area  to attract and retain businesses. These perspectives are consistent with  broader academic research, which has found that access to reliable and  affordable broadband is viewed as particularly important for the economic  development of rural areas because it enables individuals and businesses  to participate fully in the online economy regardless of geographical  location.", "Since a variety of factors can influence local economic development, we  developed a model to assess the impact of the RUS loan program on  economic development. We used a regression model since this technique  can help control for a variety of extraneous factors, such as growth of the  national economy in general. Specifically, our model compared  employment, payroll, and business establishments of counties affected by  RUS loans to similarly rural counties that were not affected by loans,  using RUS and Census data from 2003 through 2011.", "According to our analysis of RUS loans and economic development data,  counties affected by at least one approved RUS loan were associated  with modestly higher levels of employment and payroll after the year of  loan approval and in all subsequent years, as compared to counties that  did not receive RUS loans. We found that RUS loans are associated  with a one to four percent higher level of employment and payroll in  affected counties. As noted above, stakeholders told us that broadband  access can help make businesses more efficient, which can lead to job  creation and increased payroll. However, we found no relationship  between RUS loans and the number of total business establishments in a  community. We ran the model using several specifications, most of which  involved alternative comparison groups of unaffected counties, and our  results were consistent.", "Several factors could contribute to the findings from our model. The lack  of effect on the number of establishments, and the modest impact on  employment and payroll, may be the result of the county being too coarse  a level of analysis for evidence of impact to emerge, meaning the  county\u2019s scale overwhelms in size the service area of broadband  providers receiving loans. Additionally, the effect of the loan program may  not be strong enough to affect the number of business establishments at  the county level. While e-commerce is greatly facilitated by broadband  access, it can hinder rural businesses by making it cheaper and easier for  local residents to shop on-line rather than at local establishments.  Nevertheless, our results are broadly consistent with information we  gathered in site-visit interviews about how enhanced broadband access  enabled by the RUS loan program can have a modest, positive impact on  the local economy.

Video  teleconferencing enables students at several schools to attend the  classes of a single instructor. Earning course credits online can also be  less expensive than taking classes in person, helping students save  money and expanding access to education to lower-income students.  Telemedicine and telehealth have been hailed as vital to health care in  rural communities, by expanding the medical services available.

According to an industry association we spoke with, small,  rural providers like most RUS borrowers are generally net recipients of  ICC, paying out less than they receive. The incremental decreases in ICC  rates implemented to date may have therefore resulted in net revenue  reductions for these small, rural providers.

This mechanism allows providers to recover a portion of lost ICC  revenues from increases in end-user (e.g., consumer) rates and, where  appropriate, universal service support through ICC CAF.", "Despite concerns, reductions in USF support have not limited the ability  of broadband borrowers to pay back RUS loans, to date. According to  RUS officials, the agency evaluates loan applicants\u2019 ability to pay back a  loan based on their overall financial situation, including any support they  expect to receive from the USF and ICC. RUS does not consider whether  the parent company of the applicant receives such support. Some RUS  loans were approved, and investments made by borrowers who assumed  that at least some revenue to repay the loans would come from the USF.

As noted above,  some important details of the reforms to USF high-cost support have not  been determined. Some broadband providers that we spoke with,  including those that have and have not received a RUS loan, noted that  they have postponed infrastructure investments pending these USF  reforms. One provider in rural New Mexico we spoke with said that it is  hesitant to build additional broadband infrastructure, especially high-cost  fiber to the home, because it fears the consequences of USF reforms.  Another provider in South Dakota maintained that it is not borrowing any  more money for broadband build out because it does not know how much  USF revenue to expect in the future. According to a study by a law firm of  USF reforms, \u201csince telecom services require high upfront capital  investments that are recovered over a number of years, there will be  lesser and more sporadic investment in high-cost areas, due to the lower  levels of support funding and increased uncertainty.\u201d According to  officials we spoke with at CoBank, a government-sponsored bank that  supports agriculture and the rural economy, the \u201cbottom line\u201d impact of  USF reforms is that small, rural providers will likely have reduced access  to debt capital, restricting their ability to upgrade or expand broadband  networks. With broadband providers hesitant to invest in infrastructure  projects, demand has decreased for the RUS loan program. For instance,  RUS received 29 applications for loans in fiscal years 2011\u20142013,  compared to 130 in the first 3 full years of the program. Nevertheless,  FCC recently reported that since adoption of the Transformation Order  the number of Census blocks with broadband service of at least 3  megabits per second download speed has increased. In addition, on  April 23, 2014, the FCC issued a news release stating that it had adopted  an order that will eliminate a rule that may have unintentionally  encouraged providers to limit their investment in broadband-capable  networks.", "Much of the uncertainty regarding future USF support will be resolved  with the full implementation of the USF/ICC Transformation Order, but the  complexity of the reforms may result in a long implementation period.

RUS\u2019s comments  indicated that the map may overstate the extent of loan service areas.  However, the intent of this map is not to illustrate the extent of loan  service areas but rather to illustrate the geographic distribution of RUS  loans; the title and legend for the map clearly note that it reflects counties  and territories with one or more approved RUS loans and we include a  note explaining our methodology below the map. Thus, we continue to  believe that its presentation is appropriate for the purpose intended.", "Second, RUS noted that the areas around Catskill and Hudson, New  York, which we describe as being relatively close to large metropolitan  areas, qualified for financing according to the statutory requirements of  the program; RUS also said that because an area is close to an urban  area does not mean it is an urban area. We did not assess whether the  service areas of loan projects complied with statutory requirements,  though based on our site visits, we agree that the areas around Catskill  and Hudson are rural, and revised the report to clarify this point.", "Third, RUS noted that it disagreed with the 2005 USDA Office of  Inspector General finding about the pilot loan program that our report  discusses; RUS said that it did monitor projects, and that the purpose of a  pilot program is to try different approaches, which inherently involves  taking on additional risk to determine the best approach. While we found  the Office of Inspector General\u2019s findings sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, we added text to our report indicating that RUS disagreed with  the Inspector General\u2019s findings and continues to do so.", "Fourth, RUS said that our comparison of the RUS loan default rate to a  private lender may give the wrong impression, since RUS takes on more  risk than a private lender and thus may have more defaults. We  acknowledge that RUS takes on more risks than private lenders and may  therefore have a higher default rate. However, even considering the  additional requirements and risk inherent in the RUS loan program, its  default rate is six times higher than the private lender with whom we  spoke and we believe this warrants further examination by USDA. As we  recommend above, we believe USDA should evaluate loans made by  RUS through the broadband loan program to identify characteristics of  loans that may be at risk of rescission or default.", "Fifth, RUS agreed that dedicating resources to servicing loans in default  takes away resources that could be used for evaluating new applications,  but RUS does not consider this an inefficient use of resources as stated  in our report; rather, RUS said that additional resources would allow it to  be more effective in making funds available to rural areas for broadband  service. We added text to the report further explaining RUS\u2019s view on this  issue; however, we continue to believe, as we recommend, that a better  understanding of the characteristics of loans that may be at risk of  rescission or default would help RUS use its resources more effectively.", "Finally, RUS noted two concerns with our analysis of the number of  broadband providers in counties with and without RUS loans. First, RUS  said it is unfair to compare the number of providers in a county in 2013  when loans to that county may have been approved as far back as 2003.  Second, RUS said that our analysis misrepresents the impact of RUS  loans on broadband deployment because it assumes the entire county is  served when only a small portion of a county may have actually received  funds for broadband. One of the goals of the RUS loan program is to  promote broadband service in communities where it would not otherwise  exist. Accordingly, we assessed the extent to which the number of  broadband providers in communities that received loans differed from  communities that did not receive loans. The timing of the loan\u2014whether it  was made in 2003 or 2011, for instance\u2014is not relevant to this analysis,  since we were focused on the current state of broadband service.  Comparing the current state of broadband service in areas that did and  did not receive loans helps demonstrate the extent to which the loan  program may be increasing the number of broadband providers. The fact  that our analysis also uses counties, rather than individual communities,  is also not a significant limitation because the data should show the  presence of additional broadband service as a result of the loans even if  the loans only affect portions of those counties. Therefore, we believe that  this analysis is appropriate as one source of evidence about the impact of  the RUS loan program on broadband deployment.", "As we agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the date of this letter.

Specifically, we identified counties with  approved RUS loan projects as well as those with rejected and fully  rescinded projects from the RUS loan information noted above. For  counties that had both approved and rejected loan projects, we treated it  as an approved loan county, since it has been \u201ctreated\u201d by the RUS loan  program through its approved loan. Rejected and rescinded loan project  counties therefore included only those counties with rejected and/or fully  rescinded loans. We identified the current number of broadband providers  in those counties using National Broadband Map data downloaded from  the website created and maintained by the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration, in collaboration with the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC). We used the most recent data  available, which were current as of June 2013.

Additionally, to inform our quantitative analysis and provide  additional information on the relationship between broadband and  economic development, we examined prior academic studies of the RUS  loan program as well as government and academic research on the  general impact of broadband availability and adoption on communities.  We identified these studies through a literature search of the ArticleFirst,  Engineering Information Compendex, Inside Conferences, NTIS, PAIS  International, PapersFirst, ProQuest, SciSearch, Social SciSearch, and  WorldCat databases, as well as interviews with stakeholders.

These areas were selected to  include providers who did and did not receive RUS loans as well as  stakeholders in surrounding communities and state capitals. We also  identified communities and RUS broadband loans with varying  experiences and perspectives. The specific criteria used to identify site- visit locations included the status of the loan (if relevant), the size of the  loan, location, technology of loan project (if relevant), and date of loan  approval (if relevant). Based on these criteria, we conducted physical  visits to North and South Dakota as well as New York and Vermont.  These site visits included loan service areas (consisting of one or more  communities) in a variety of regions, with active, rescinded, and rejected  loans. They also included four loan service areas with loans above the  median loan size and five loan service areas below median loan size  ($8,249,250). They also included a loan service area with one of the four  loans approved after 2008, as well as loan projects utilizing three different  technology types. Although using these criteria allowed us, in our view, to  obtain information from a diverse mix of RUS broadband borrowers, the  findings from our site visits cannot be generalized to all borrowers  because they were selected as part of a nonprobability sample.", "As part of our site visits, we interviewed, when possible, local broadband  providers, including any that have applied for and received RUS loans.  We also interviewed staff and members of local Chambers of Commerce,  state and local government officials involved in broadband policy, and  staff at state and local advocacy and economic development  organizations. For additional information, we also interviewed broadband  providers in Kansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico separate from our in- person site visits. In total, we spoke with broadband providers that have  been approved for 10 of the 100 loans to date.", "To determine the impact of reforms to the Universal Service Fund (USF)  High-Cost program and Intercarrier Compensation (ICC) on the RUS  broadband loan program, we reviewed FCC\u2019s 2011 USF/ICC  Transformation Order that proposed changes to the USF and ICC  mechanisms for determining support. We also reviewed stakeholder  submissions to the rulemakings proposed as part of this Transformation  Order, as well as studies and reports that assess the impact of the  reforms. To calculate the extent of USF support for RUS broadband  borrowers, we examined data\u2014for the years 2003 through 2013\u2014 reported in FCC\u2019s Universal Service Monitoring Report. We assessed the  reliability of this data by reviewing relevant data collection and verification  documents. Based on this information, we determined that the data  provided to us were sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes.", "To better understand the impact of these reforms on RUS broadband  borrowers, we also conducted interviews with officials from RUS, FCC,  CoBank, and NTCA\u2013The Rural Broadband Association. We also  discussed these reforms with broadband providers that have and have  not received USF support, as described above.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2013 to May 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The  RUS broadband loan program was authorized in 2002 to finance the  construction of broadband infrastructure in rural areas, following an earlier  pilot program. The first loans, though, were approved in 2003, so the  relevant information associated with RUS loans begins in 2003.  Broadband infrastructure projects funded by the RUS broadband loan  program vary in geographic size. Projects must be designed to serve rural  communities, although the geographic footprints of the proposed rural  broadband projects do not consistently correspond to geographic units for  which relevant data are collected. Some projects span more than one  county, while others are focused on a specific area within a single county.  We chose to focus our analysis at the county level, because counties,  more fully (although still incompletely) than zip codes or Census tracts,  encompass the geographical extent of local markets. Though the most  recent loan was approved in 2013, the relevant annual county-level  Census data on economic activity are only available through 2011.", "To conduct our analysis, we acquired data from RUS on all applications  for RUS loans. Some of these applications were approved while others  were rejected by RUS. The data we received from RUS included the list  of communities (i.e., cities, towns, and Census Designated Places) to be  served by each loan project. For those projects that were approved, we  also received data on the approval date and the loan\u2019s current repayment  status. By matching the list of communities to Census data, we identified  the counties associated with each project. This information allowed us to  categorize each county as part of the service area of an approved project,  a rejected project, a project for which loan funds had been rescinded by  RUS, or not part of any project service area. Some counties included the  service areas of more than one approved project; others included the  service areas of, for instance, both approved and rejected projects. For  the purposes of this analysis, we classified every county associated with  an approved project that has not been rescinded as being in active status,  regardless of whether that county included the service area of a  rescinded or rejected project. Counties associated with loans that have  been rescinded were classified as being in rescinded status. Counties  associated with rejected loans were classified as rejected.", "We also acquired data from the Census. Specifically, we used County  Business Pattern data on county employment, annual payroll, and  number of business establishments from 2003 through 2011. Economic  development has no universal definition or measure, but can be assessed  using a variety of proxy measures. We identified our three measures of  economic activity because they have been used in the past to assess the  effect of a federal program on economic development. Specifically, in a  2006 report assessing the impact of Empowerment Zones on economic  development, we used Census data on unemployment rates and the  number of business establishments. Additionally, in their analysis of the  RUS loan program, Kandilov and Renkow used Census data on the  number of business establishments, employment, and annual payroll as  measures of economic development. Further, other studies have  examined the impact of broadband availability and adoption on economic  outcomes, using variables such as unemployment, household income,  and number of firms or establishments.", "Because the RUS program targets communities in rural areas, we wanted  to restrict our analysis to rural counties and to examine whether our  results were sensitive to the characterization of rural used to select  counties. We used two county-level data sources to define rural areas at  the county level. We used Census information on county rural and urban  population characteristics as of 2010. As an alternative, we also used  USDA data that placed each county into one of nine categories on a  rural\u2013urban continuum.", "Additionally, as part of the proximity-scoring process, to be discussed in  more detail below, we used additional County Business Patterns data for  an earlier time period and 2000 Census information on demographic  characteristics of counties.

In any particular place,  economic activity can be influenced by natural resources in that area and  the current fortunes of whatever industries have located there historically,  among other factors. In any particular time, regional or national  economies may be growing rapidly or may be in recession. In addition,  the degree to which any area is connected to the broader economy has  implications for economic performance. In this regard, the quality of  access to transportation networks has long been identified as among the  important factors explaining economic development. More recently,  access to broadband infrastructure has been thought of in this context,  and particularly in the case of rural communities, real and perceived lack  of broadband access has been thought to hinder economic development  and has provided the motivation for the RUS broadband loan program,  among others.", "Given that broadband infrastructure is one of many factors that could be  associated with economic activity, it may be difficult in a modeling context  to assemble all of the factors that may be necessary to distinguish one  county from another in terms of its resources, industrial structure, and  labor force characteristics, among other things. One estimation technique  that can be useful in this kind of situation is to take advantage of the  panel characteristics of this data. A panel data set is one in which there  are observations for a given set of cross-section units, in this case  county-level measures of economic activity, over several time periods, in  this case years. A fixed-effects model of panel data can have two sets of  dummy variables, one for each cross-section unit and one set for each  time period. In our model, the former account for those observed and  unobserved effects that are constant over time but affect economic  activity in a particular county, and the latter for effects that are constant  across counties but vary over time, such as the condition of the national  economy. The variable in which we are interested is defined as a zero (0)  or one (1) RUS broadband loan indicator that varies over time and  counties. Although the value of the loan indicator never takes a value of 1  in those counties without an approved project, the timing of approvals in  those counties with approved projects varies over the time period.", "Our model can be thought of as a treatment model in which some  counties receive a treatment (the RUS broadband loan). Our goal was to  estimate whether there is an association between this treatment and  measures of economic activity, such as employment, payroll, or the  number of establishments. In a treatment evaluation, however, it is  important to have an appropriate comparison or control group of  untreated subjects, in this case, counties that were not in the service area  of a RUS broadband loan. The estimate of the treatment could be in part  a reflection of the particular characteristics of those that pursued  treatment, in this case those counties that were in the service areas  approved for a RUS broadband loan. If those counties were growing  faster, or were richer, among other possibilities, then those counties might  be expected to continue to grow quickly over the analysis period. If these  counties are compared to an average county, it might appear that the  broadband loan is associated with the observed pattern of increased  economic activity. Alternatively, if the treated counties are compared to  other counties that are more similar, the estimated association with the  broadband loan might be more modest or nonexistent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Control Groups", "paragraphs": ["A focus of our estimation approach was to develop a number of different  control groups of rural counties without approved broadband loans. We  identified three broad types of control groups. First, some control groups  are defined using characteristics of the RUS program itself, such as those  counties that were in the service areas of projects that were rejected by  RUS. These were projects that, we assume, their developers believed  would be successful. In this way, the counties in their service areas can  be thought of as similar to the set of approved counties in unobservable  ways. Second, control groups were defined on the basis of similarity to  key observable characteristics of the set of approved counties. We use a  proximity-scoring algorithm to match approved counties to other counties  based on particular concepts of similarity. For example, to develop one  control group, we looked for counties that were similar to approved  counties in terms of economic growth in the period leading up to 2003,  the beginning of our analysis period. Third, we defined one control group  on the basis of geographic adjacency to the set of counties in approved  service areas. This control group may capture less readily observable  characteristics of local economic activity in and around the service areas  of approved loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rural Definition", "paragraphs": ["Within this estimation framework, a primary issue we considered was  which counties to include in our analysis. Although we determined that  counties were the best unit of analysis, in some cases they can still be too  coarse a level of analysis for any evidence of the RUS loan program\u2019s  impact to emerge. Accordingly, we used Census data on the rural and  urban population characteristics of counties, as well as observations from  our site visits (described above in app. I) to identify a suitable universe of  counties. One consideration was that the dependent variables of interest  in our model (i.e., the economic outcomes) likely scale with county  population; that is, the level of employment and payroll, and the number  of business establishments will likely increase with a county\u2019s population.  In some counties that have large rural populations in an absolute sense  but also include significant urban centers, the economic activity of the  urban areas can overwhelm the activity in the rural portions of the county;  these counties may not be well suited for inclusion in a county-level  analysis. Our solution to this issue was to restrict the set of analyzed  counties to those meeting a rural threshold, so that any changes in  economic activity associated with broadband infrastructure had a better  chance of being captured with county-level data.", "We considered three definitions, and present some program implications  of these alternative definitions in table 2. The initial threshold we chose  was 90 percent of county population considered rural according to the  Census, excluding all counties that are less rural. However, table 2  shows that this threshold had the effect of excluding many counties,  including the vast majority of counties with an approved loan. Specifically,  there are 289 counties in our data set with an approved loan, but only 52  of them were rural counties defined in this way. Using only a county\u2019s  rural population has the consequence of treating many counties located in  what would typically be thought of as rural areas as not rural because  they contain small cities. Based on our site visits we determined that  while counties with large Urbanized Area populations were generally too  urban to be included in the model, counties with just the smaller Urban  Clusters were appropriate. Our preferred threshold for counties was 90  percent of county population considered rural, defined as the sum of rural  population and urban cluster population as determined by Census. Table  2 shows that this definition captures almost 90 percent of counties with  approved loans.", "As an alternative to constructing our own categorization using Census  data, we also used the rural\u2013urban continuum codes developed by  USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service to select rural counties. Specifically,  as an alternative, we considered a county to be rural according to these  codes if the county was not in a metropolitan area and the urban  population of a county was less than 20,000 people. This definition  provided a selection of rural counties that fit somewhere between our  other two in terms of number of included counties and approximately the  same share of counties with approvals as the rural and urban  combination definition. We present results for the two Census-based  definitions. Results using the USDA definitions were more similar to the  rural and urban cluster combination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of Control Groups", "paragraphs": ["We developed three types of control groups. First, we developed groups  from the program itself, including groups of rejected loan counties and  rescinded loan counties. Rejected counties can be thought of as similar to  approved counties in terms of intent by broadband providers to build rural  broadband infrastructure. Rescinded counties can also be thought of in  these terms, but these counties were in service areas that were actually  approved for broadband loans.", "Second, we developed control groups based on observable  characteristics of counties rather than attributes of the RUS loan program.  Specifically, for each approved county we sought to find a non-approved  county that is similar. Since there are many dimensions along which  counties may be similar to one another, the use of proximity scoring is  one way to identify control counties based on how similar they are to  approved counties based upon a scoring procedure. In our case, we use  logistic regressions on county-level factors that we think could explain  whether a county had an approved loan. The proximity score for each  county is derived from the logistic regression and reflects the probability  that a county has an approved loan based on the set of explanatory  variables. We develop two different sets of explanatory variables that we  use to calculate proximity scores. The explanatory values are used as  independent variables in the proximity scoring logistic regression in which  the dependent variable is loan approval.  Using the estimated coefficients  and the values of the explanatory variables, a proximity score is  calculated for each county.  We then used a matching algorithm  developed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic to select from among the  non-approved counties a match for each approved county based on the  proximity scores.", "We developed different control groups based on two sets of explanatory  variables. The first set consisted of annual growth rates in county-level  measures of economic activity over the pre-analysis period of 1994\u2014 2002. Specifically, for each county we estimated the annual growth rates  in employment, payroll, payroll per employee, and the number of  establishments, using County Business Patterns data. We interpreted the  matches based on this scoring process to represent a control group that  is similar to the set of approved counties based on economic growth  profiles in the time period leading up to the start of the broadband loan  program in 2003. The second set of explanatory variables consisted of  demographic variables from the 2000 Census, again from a time  preceding the broadband loan program. Specifically, for each county we  examined data on county population, population density, per capita  income, the share of county population aged 60 and above, the share of  county population that has less than a high school education, and the  share of county population that has a college degree or more. We  interpreted the matches based on this scoring process to represent a  control group that is similar to the set of approved counties based on  demographic characteristics that may be related to the costs of providing  broadband (population density) as well as characteristics related to the  demand for broadband (income, age, and education profiles).  Additionally, we developed a control group based on proximity scores  using both of these sets of variables in the same scoring regression.", "Third, another alternative control group was comprised of the set of rural  counties without approved loans that are geographically adjacent to the  set of rural counties with approved loans. This set of counties was  identified by using the Census county adjacency file for 2010. These  adjacent counties are rural, not in the set of approved counties, and  adjacent to at least one approved county. These counties included a mix  of counties with and without applications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, we used a simple fixed-effects model to estimate the  relationship between RUS broadband loans and various annual measures  of economic activity at the county level.

We regressed the dependent  variables on year and county fixed effects and an indicator variable of  whether a county had an approved broadband loan. The loan indicator  variable equals 0, except for counties with an approved broadband loan,  when, beginning one year after the loan award an all subsequent years, it  equals 1.", "Our analysis using this model and our preferred definition of rural  suggests that RUS broadband loans are associated with a 1 to 4 percent  higher level of employment and payroll in affected counties in the year  following the loan approval and all subsequent years (see table 3). The  estimated effects on payroll were at the higher end of this range. We  found no consistent relationship between RUS loans and the number of  new business establishments in a community. Our results were much  weaker when we restricted the model only to counties that were  considered rural using the 90 percent rural population threshold (see  table 4), but results were roughly comparable between the samples  defined using rural and urban clusters definition and the Economic  Research Service continuum codes. Generally speaking, for a given  definition of rural counties, our results were consistent across the range of  control groups we developed.", "As noted above, these model results are broadly consistent with what  stakeholders told us, including that broadband access enabled by the  RUS loan program can help make businesses more efficient, which can  lead to job creation and increased payroll. The lack of effect on the  number of establishments, and the modest impact on employment and  payroll, may be the result of the county being too coarse a level of  analysis for evidence of impact to emerge. Additionally, the effect of the  loan program may not be strong enough to affect the number of business  establishments at the county level. For instance, while e-commerce is  greatly facilitated by broadband access, it could hinder rural businesses  by making it cheaper and easier for local residents to shop on-line rather  than at local establishments.", "Table 3 presents results using the rural and urban cluster definition of  rural counties and provides results for the full range of control groups, and  table 4 presents results using the rural definition. All of the dependent  variables were expressed in log form and the parameter estimate on the  loan variable can be interpreted as the percentage increase in the level of  economic activity when the loan is in effect.", "Though our findings were consistent across various model specifications,  our findings require caveats. First, there are no standard metrics for  measuring the economic impact broadband access and adoption can  have on a community, so our choices in data points may not accurately  capture the true value of broadband to rural communities. Second, since  RUS broadband loan-project service areas do not conform to county  boundaries, our decision to treat all counties containing affected  communities as \u201ctreated\u201d may mask some very local affects of the  broadband loans, or may overstate the extent of some effect.
