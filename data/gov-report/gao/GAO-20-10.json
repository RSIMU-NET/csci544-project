GAO's review of 2017 data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) found that for-profit and non-profit hospices had, on average, similar scores on CMS's current quality measures that indicate hospice performance in areas such as pain assessment and discussion of beneficiary treatment preferences. However, for-profits were more often among the subset of providers with the lowest scores on certain quality measures GAO reviewed. In addition to analyzing providers' scores on CMS quality measures, GAO analyzed provider performance on other indicators, identified by researchers, that could signal quality issues and found performance varied among for-profit and non-profit hospices. One of the other quality indicators GAO analyzed was the rate of beneficiaries discharged from hospice prior to death, which in some cases could indicate dissatisfaction with care leading to the beneficiary's decision to leave the hospice provider. In addition, GAO examined the number of provider visits to give medical and emotional support within the last few days of a beneficiary's life. With regard to these indicators, for 2017, GAO found the following, among other things:", "472 hospice providers (462 for-profits and 10 non-profits) had a high rate of discharging beneficiaries prior to death (50 percent or more were discharged). According to research, a high discharge rate could, in some cases, be an indicator of poor quality of care or of provider misuse of the benefit, in that the hospice may be enrolling beneficiares who are not eligible for hospice care.", "83 providers (80 for-profits and 3 non-profits) did not have hospice staff (such as nurses, physicians, or nurse practitioners) visit beneficiaries within the last 3 days of their life\u2014a critical time in providing quality care, according to researchers GAO interviewed.", "CMS's oversight of the quality of care provided by hospice providers consists primarily of inspections\u2014called surveys\u2014of hospice providers. GAO found that, while CMS instructs surveyors to review previous survey findings and complaints, CMS does not instruct surveyors to use information on providers' performance on quality measures or other potential indicators of quality as part of the survey process. For example, CMS does not instruct surveyors to consider whether a hospice provided staff visits during beneficiaries' last week of life. According to research, this information could be used to enhance the survey process. GAO also found that CMS is limited to one enforcement option\u2014termination of the Medicare provider agreement\u2014which CMS uses rarely and generally only when providers fail to correct within the required time frame the most serious violations of federal health and safety requirements. According to two researchers, additional remedies, such as civil monetary penalties, could enhance CMS's oversight by addressing performance problems that do not merit termination and incentivize agencies to improve quality of care. CMS uses a range of remedies for other provider types, such as home health agencies and nursing homes, but lacks authority to impose such additional sanctions on hospices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["CMS should incorporate the use of additional information that could be used to identify quality of care issues into its survey process for hospice oversight.

Enrolling in  the hospice benefit is a beneficiary\u2019s choice and, when doing so, the  beneficiary is choosing to forego curative treatment of their terminal  illness and related conditions. Medicare will, however, continue to pay for  curative treatment of conditions that are not related to the terminal illness.", "Since 2000, there has been a substantial increase in both Medicare  spending for hospice services and the number of Medicare beneficiaries  using these services.

(See table 3.) Since hospices are  typically paid a set amount per day of a hospice stay, longer stays  generally result in higher payments. Beneficiaries with non-cancer  diagnoses can often have longer lengths of stay compared to other  beneficiaries because the progression of these diseases (such as  dementia) can be harder to predict; this may result in beneficiaries being  enrolled in hospice earlier than appropriate (meaning that their projected  life expectancy may actually be longer than 6 months). For instance, one  study noted that dementia beneficiaries\u2019 decline may include periods of  stabilization where their health stays the same or even improves, which  differs from a constant and predictable decline in most beneficiaries with  terminal cancer.", "There are likely other factors beyond a greater percentage of  beneficiaries with non-cancer diagnoses that contributed to for-profit  providers\u2019 higher portion of Medicare hospice payments.

According to this guidance, surveyors are to prepare for  hospice surveys by reviewing documents of record including licensure  records, previous survey findings and complaints, media reports, and  other publicly available information about the provider. A representative  for an association representing state surveyors confirmed that this is the  type of information surveyors typically review prior to a hospice provider  survey. However, according to CMS officials and the surveyor  association, CMS does not instruct surveyors to review other information  such as providers\u2019 performance on CMS quality measures or other  indicators of quality that surveyors could use to identify potential areas of  concern that they could focus on more closely during a survey. For  example, it might be helpful for surveyors to know if a hospice provided  no visits during beneficiaries\u2019 last days of life. According to CMS officials,  CMS does not use such information to target hospices for additional  survey review.", "Several studies we reviewed and researchers we interviewed noted CMS  could strengthen its survey process by incorporating additional  information into the survey process, such as information on how hospice  providers perform on CMS quality measures or other potential indicators  of quality. For example, one study suggested that hospices with poor  reported beneficiary experiences based on caregivers\u2019 experience survey  data could be identified for more frequent surveys and that such  information could be used to identify care processes for closer review  during surveys. Another study we reviewed concluded that claims- based measures could help guide surveyors to more closely review key  processes of care to ensure Medicare beneficiaries receive high quality  hospice care. In addition, a researcher we interviewed suggested when  claims data show no visits during the last 2 days of life, the survey team  could interview the deceased patients\u2019 families to see if there was any  harm done by the lack of visits at the end of life. And, in July 2019, the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the Inspector  General (HHS OIG) reiterated recommendations from prior HHS OIG  work that CMS analyze claims and deficiency data to identify specific  patterns identified by the HHS OIG that could indicate potential issues\u2014 such as hospices that infrequently provide physician services\u2014and that  CMS instruct surveyors to pay special attention to these areas during  surveys.", "In contrast to hospice surveys, home health agency surveyors utilize  information in addition to survey findings and complaints to identify  potential areas of concern. According to CMS officials and the surveyor  association we interviewed, home health surveyors review certain CMS  quality measures to focus the survey on specific areas of concern or to  identify beneficiaries who experienced potential care issues for a more  detailed survey review.", "According to CMS officials, the agency is considering making changes to  the survey process but has not yet made any decisions. CMS officials told  us they last updated the survey process in 2010, and since then, they  have implemented quality measures for hospice providers (provider- reported measures in 2014 and caregivers\u2019 experience survey measures  in 2015). They also said that CMS is \u201ccurrently monitoring the  implementation of these programs and considering the potential benefit of  incorporating review of the data into the survey process.\u201d According to  federal standards of internal control, agencies must identify, analyze, and  respond to risks related to achieving objectives. By not utilizing  additional information in the survey process that would allow it to identify  providers and areas where risk of noncompliance is greatest, CMS is  missing an opportunity to strengthen its ability to identify and respond to  such risks and ensure the quality of care that hospice beneficiaries  receive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Limited Enforcement Remedies Due to Lack of Statutory Authority, Which Could Restrict Its Ability to Ensure Compliance", "paragraphs": ["CMS is limited to one hospice enforcement remedy\u2014termination of the  Medicare provider agreement. By law, to qualify for payment under the  Medicare program, hospice providers must meet the program\u2019s conditions  of participation. If the agency finds a provider is not complying with the  program\u2019s conditions of participation, CMS may terminate the provider\u2019s  participation in the program. In the Medicare program, termination of a  provider is the most significant action CMS can take to address provider  non-compliance. As a result, CMS generally only terminates a hospice  provider on the basis of a deficiency when the provider fails to correct a  condition-level deficiency (the most severe) within the required time  frame. Our review of CMS hospice survey data found termination  happens rarely. Specifically, 19 hospices were involuntarily terminated  from 2014 through 2017. This is less than half of 1 percent of the total  number of hospices operating during this time period.", "In contrast to hospice care, where CMS\u2019s enforcement authority is limited  to termination, Congress has given the agency authority to impose  additional enforcement remedies for other provider types. Additional  statutory and regulatory penalties for home health agencies and nursing  homes include civil money penalties, denial of payment for all new  Medicare and Medicaid admissions, and imposition of training  requirements for situations where it is determined that education will likely  lead to provider compliance (referred to as directed in-service training).  Such remedies, if available, could enable the agency to more effectively  address a broader range of hospice risks. For example, additional  remedies could be used in situations that warrant a remedy other than  termination or that could further incentivize providers to comply with  health and safety requirements or improve their quality of care. According  to federal standards of internal control, agencies must identify, analyze,  and respond to risks related to achieving objectives. Because CMS  lacks the authority to establish such additional remedies, the agency\u2019s  ability to respond to risks and ensure quality of care for beneficiaries is  limited.", "The HHS OIG and one researcher we interviewed have recommended  CMS seek statutory authority to establish additional enforcement  remedies for hospices, explaining that less severe remedies could help  address performance problems that may not merit termination and  incentivize agencies to improve quality of care. CMS agreed with this  recommendation in March 2016 and stated it would consider submitting a  request that would seek legislative authority to establish additional  enforcement remedies through the President\u2019s annual budget proposal to  Congress. In a July 2018 HHS OIG report, the HHS OIG again  recommended CMS seek this authority. CMS neither agreed nor  disagreed with this recommendation and stated again that it would  consider this recommendation when developing the agency\u2019s proposals  for the President\u2019s annual budget. However, a request for such legislative  authority was not included in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017, 2018, or  2019 budget proposals.
