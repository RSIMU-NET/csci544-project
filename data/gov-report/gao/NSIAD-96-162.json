To help improve DOD\u2019s quality assurance program, we reviewed world-class commercial organizations to determine what practices they had adopted to more efficiently produce quality products. Specifically, this report describes (1) the historical problems DOD has had in improving quality assurance practices, (2) some private sector practices that could benefit DOD, and (3) a current plan for improving quality assurance activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Quality assurance has a simple goal: to ensure that products perform the way they are supposed to. For many years, the traditional way DOD and commercial companies achieved quality was through systematic final inspection. But now, intense competition has led some U.S. companies to adopt total quality management practices that are prevention based. Consequently, quality assurance has taken on a broader meaning, to include virtually all key design and engineering elements during development, the transition to production, and production itself.", "There is general agreement across government and industry that DOD\u2019s inspection-based quality assurance practices have added unnecessary costs to acquisitions because they require DOD and contractor personnel and resources for oversight that are separate from the production process. Until recently, DOD\u2019s quality requirements were based on MIL-Q-9858A, a military standard established in 1963. This standard requires a contractor to establish a quality program with documented procedures and processes that are subject to approval by government representatives throughout all areas of contract performance. Quality is theoretically ensured by requiring both the contractor and the government to monitor and inspect products. In June 1994, the Secretary of Defense announced that commercial quality standards such as ISO-9000 should replace MIL-Q-9858A where it makes sense. DOD will not require MIL-Q-9858A on contracts awarded after October 1996. Until then, DOD will be approving the quality standards on a case-by-case basis at the request of industry.", "The Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) has primary responsibility for setting and overseeing quality assurance standards within DOD. As of September 1995, DCMC had about 5,000 quality specialists located in contractor facilities or in regional offices across the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing DOD\u2019s Quality Assurance Practices Is Challenging Given Long-standing Problems", "paragraphs": ["DOD faces a formidable challenge in changing its quality assurance culture. This culture has been characterized by a narrow approach to quality assurance, in both DOD and the defense industry, which has led to a focus on detecting defects and recording corrective actions. In the past, DOD\u2019s practices have reflected a narrow approach to quality assurance. Responsibility for meeting military quality standard MIL-Q-9858A has been assigned to one organization\u2014DCMC, which is outside much of the acquisition decision-making process. DCMC has quality specialists stationed in contractor plants across the country to inspect material and end items. These specialists have relied heavily on quality system documentation, various reviews and audits of the quality process, and corrective action plans submitted by contractor quality assurance personnel to ensure quality on weapon systems.", "Based on information from studies performed for the Secretary of Defense, we estimate that the extra cost associated with military-unique quality assurance requirements for DOD acquisitions is $1.5 billion annually. The studies assessed the cost impact of DOD regulations on contractors and DOD and found that the contractors\u2019 cost to implement MIL-Q-9858A and to comply with DOD requirements represented at least 1.7 percent of DOD\u2019s acquisition cost, or about $1 billion. Most of this cost occurred as the result of contractor quality assurance and operations personnel devoting time to such activities as preparing quality plans and procedures, conducting and documenting inspections, documenting deviations, proposing corrective actions to government concerns, and supporting government audits and reviews. Further, DOD\u2019s own costs for quality assurance oversight were about $687 million annually. This estimate does not include what DOD has spent to correct the manufacturing and quality problems that have contributed to historical cost and schedule overruns on weapon system production programs. These past problems occurred partly because manufacturing processes were not considered during the design phase of the program, and inspection, rather than process control, was the predominant method of ensuring quality.", "Like many commercial manufacturers, DOD is now being expected to cut costs and do more with less. Commercial manufacturers have adopted far-reaching quality strategies as one way to become more competitive, efficient, and economical. Even though DOD faces the same challenge, particularly since it can no longer expect the budget increases it had during the 1980s, it has yet to effectively achieve the same level of efficiency from its manufacturers. A major difference between DOD and commercial manufacturers is that DOD has, until recently, maintained its practice of inspecting rather than designing quality into a product while world-class companies have broadened their definition of quality to include design.", "DOD is attempting to change its approach to quality by including design in the definition of quality. In translating this approach into practice, DOD will have to overcome a history in which many weapon system acquisitions have encountered significant cost and schedule overruns because of design and manufacturing problems. These problems usually resulted from acquisition strategies that began production before the design was complete and key manufacturing processes were in place and tested for capability. Some examples we have reported on follow: In 1985, we reported on four major weapon system acquisitions\u2014the Army\u2019s Copperhead projectile and Blackhawk helicopter, and the Navy\u2019s High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile and Tomahawk missile\u2014that had encountered substantial problems in early production, resulting in cost overruns and schedule delays. At least part of these cost and schedule overruns were caused by several untried manufacturing processes that were not studied to see if they could produce quality components. Symptoms of these problems were high scrap rates, parts shortages, and changes to engineering drawings.In 1988 and 1990, we reported that the B-2 bomber program\u2019s immature design led to manufacturing problems in production that, in turn, led to schedule delays and cost increases. The contractors initiated thousands of changes to engineering drawings, some of which required new parts and tooling. Because the bomber was not ready for production, actual labor hours exceeded planned labor hours on the first three aircraft by 84, 86, and 94 percent, respectively, and the three major contractors estimated it would take over 10 million quality assurance labor hours to develop and produce 21 production aircraft, not including hours estimated for government oversight. These manufacturing problems delayed the first flight of the B-2 by 19 months and contributed to significant cost increases.In 1991, we reported that 12 tactical missile programs had cost and schedule overruns, partly because program offices had not adequately considered the risk associated with the weapons\u2019 design, development, and production. One missile, the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, encountered problems in transitioning to production partly because certain electronic components proved too complex and had to be redesigned. This contributed to cost increases of 285 percent and a 5-year delay to the missile\u2019s operational capability date.In 1994, we reported that quality problems with the C-17 program increased unit cost to production aircraft and delayed scheduled deliveries. Labor hours for rework and repair of production items made up 40 percent of the labor on the first five production C-17s, and scrap, rework, and repair cost about $44 million in 1993. In addition to these costs, some production aircraft were delivered to the Air Force with unfinished work and known deficiencies that had to be corrected after government acceptance. The Defense Science Board reviewed the C-17 program in 1993 and concluded that the production schedule could not be maintained unless the contractor changed its manufacturing and quality assurance processes. An Industry Review Panel on Specifications and Standards found that the C-17 production process had many quality problems that were adding cost to the program. It found that the production aircraft were being produced in a \u201cdevelopment environment,\u201d with unqualified processes, and with a reactive rather than proactive quality management system that did not analyze the causes of quality problems. It also found that a high number of engineering changes were making production less efficient. The review panel concluded that the program had an \u201cinspection mentality\u201d and that only 10 percent of quality cost was being spent on prevention.", "These examples represent a persistent problem in DOD\u2019s major acquisitions. All of the programs began producing weapon systems before their key characteristics were fully designed and the key processes for building the system were understood. Some started production before doing a significant amount of testing to determine if these systems would perform their required mission. The consequences of beginning production before completing testing have repeatedly included procurement of substantial inventories of unsatisfactory weapons that require costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance and, in some cases, deployment of substandard systems to combat forces.", "These examples do not necessarily condemn DOD to a repetition of the past or prejudge the potential success of DOD\u2019s current efforts to better manage quality. However, they do underscore the challenge DOD faces in changing quality assurance practices. The systems in the examples were developed and produced using inspection-oriented quality assurance practices and significant DOD oversight. Yet, in each case, we reported that beginning manufacturing before the design was understood and manufacturing processes were controlled led to quality problems, cost increases, and schedule delays. The narrower interpretation of quality assurance that prevailed at the time may not have included the various design and engineering elements that played a part in the weapons\u2019 eventual problems in production. However, the broader view of quality assurance practiced by leading commercial manufacturers includes these elements and thus covers a much larger range of responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Developed New Mindset: Prevent Problems Rather Than Fixing Them", "paragraphs": ["Many companies have effectively evolved from an inspection-oriented quality assurance process, and the culture and infrastructure to support it, to a standard in which quality is an integral part of each stage of the design and production process.", "The difference between how a manufacturer operates on a military contract versus how it operates on a commercial contract is often startling. For example, we visited a company that manufactured military and commercial products with similar specifications and uses; both manufacturing processes were in the same building. On one side of the hallway, the commercial process used automation and process control throughout the production process to continually reduce nonvalue-added inspections. On the other side of the hallway, the military process included two large test facilities at the end of the production process, used at least four test stations, and added about 10 days to the process. Company officials told us that the military process continued to have 100-percent end-item inspection, even though the quality of these products was not in question.", "In response to increased competition in the 1980s, companies had to dramatically improve quality while reducing cost. They accomplished this by shifting paradigms. Rather than focusing on identifying and correcting problems, they began trying to focus on preventing the problems. Quality assurance changed from being a postmanufacturing step, done at the end of each process, to being part of the process itself. This was a significant culture change for these companies. Figure 1 illustrates the shift in paradigms from inspection-oriented to prevention-oriented quality practices.", "Traditional quality assurance techniques relied upon many after-the-fact inspections, increasing costs in time and money. To remain profitable, manufacturers switched from detection to prevention-based quality strategies. These strategies teamed suppliers, manufacturing staff, and engineers to design quality into the product and to identify and control key characteristics. Prevention-based process control replaced end-item inspections.", "To reduce their costs and gain an edge on the competition, companies have found that they have had to not only establish a basic commercial quality system, such as ISO-9000, as their baseline, but also consistently exceed it. Most of the companies we visited had obtained ISO-9000 certification, a basic quality management system that commercial customers are beginning to require. This standard ensures that a manufacturer has a well-documented commercial quality system. In addition, they all had developed or adopted advanced quality concepts that brought the concept of quality to the design phase of a product\u2019s life. They began by using two advanced concepts called design for manufacturing and process control techniques. After a company had successfully incorporated each technique, it began to eliminate inspections\u2014and the cost associated with them\u2014and significantly reduced the amount of defects in its products. A third ingredient for success involved developing relationships with key suppliers, which ensured that parts and subcomponents were appropriate for a product\u2019s design and arrived for production at consistently high quality and expected cost. Companies we visited had dramatic reductions in product defects\u2014ranging from 34 to 90 percent\u2014resulting from these techniques. Appendixes II and V contain detailed examples."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Design for Manufacturing Controls Product Development", "paragraphs": ["Design for manufacturing represents a culture change that involves a whole new mindset. Rather than continuing the old practice of engineers designing a product in isolation and then handing it off to the manufacturing process, design for manufacturing involves all stakeholders in the process. The stakeholders form cross-functional teams that include representatives from the customer, marketing, research and development, engineering, manufacturing, key suppliers, quality assurance, finance, and customer support. Under the old practice, a product would require many design changes in full-scale production, creating additional defects, rework, and scrapped material. But now, the teams identify the requirements for a product\u2019s performance and ensure that manufacturing processes are in place to meet those requirements within specified cost targets before production begins. Their objective is to build quality in up front rather than fix problems during some stage of the manufacturing process or discover there is no profitability. These cross-functional teams conduct phased development processes to ensure that a product\u2019s design is producible and profitable. Continuous communication between the engineers who design the product and the people responsible for manufacturing it is a key to the process.", "Using design for manufacturing techniques, these companies review projects to prevent a potentially unprofitable design from entering full-scale production. Teams use modeling and prototyping to determine the capability of existing manufacturing processes. As the development process continues, team members must make trade-offs between a product\u2019s performance and its cost to meet strategic targets. For example, Texas Instruments\u2019 semiconductor facility reviews a product\u2019s potential profitability at each milestone of a five-phased development process. If any of these reviews indicate that cost targets cannot be met, the product\u2019s development can be terminated. This eliminates additional investment in full-scale production tooling and facilities. Likewise, Varian Associates\u2019 managers are given cost and schedule targets during the design phase, and special \u201cout-of-bounds\u201d reviews are held for behind-schedule or over-budgeted items throughout the development process. Figure 2 provides a conceptual model of the design for manufacturing process based on what we observed at these two companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process Controls Help to Ensure Consistently High-Quality Products", "paragraphs": ["Process control means controlling the production process by checking the quality while the work is being done. Beyond that, companies rely on final inspections of completed lots. Leading companies rely on \u201ctotal process control,\u201d which demands that every process is controlled by checking the quality during production. Rather than employing a lot of inspectors, however, they entrust the production workers to do it themselves.", "The companies we visited had implemented similar systems. In addition to a basic quality system, such as ISO-9000, and an emphasis on including design as an element of the quality process, we found they (1) diffused responsibility for quality across the production line and (2) trained employees to use analytical diagnostic tools such as statistical process control, process mapping, or continuous flow manufacturing to maintain predictable processes.", "The companies had developed or adopted advanced quality concepts that went beyond the basic ISO-9000 standard and that emphasized finding the cause of quality problems by gathering data and then eliminating those causes from the manufacturing process. Once root causes are discovered and processes are controlled, the likelihood of consistently high-quality products is significantly increased and the need for inspection at the end of the production line is reduced. For example, Cherry Electronics uses QS-9000, an advanced quality guide developed jointly by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler as a required supplement to ISO-9000 for their suppliers. It includes comprehensive instructions for implementing design for manufacturing in new products and using process controls to reduce defects in final products. Cherry is undergoing certification for QS-9000 now and plans to require its own suppliers to become certified in QS-9000 as well. Also, Motorola and Varian Associates used the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award criteria to create advanced quality systems for themselves and their suppliers.", "Representatives from both companies credit the use of these advanced quality guidelines for reducing defects while eliminating the need for end-item inspection. For example, Varian\u2019s Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments business unit heavily inspected both its product and its suppliers\u2019 components coming into final assembly until the mid-1980s. At that time, it instituted process control and gradually reduced the number of its inspectors by 92 percent, from 26 to 2. Similarly, John Deere eliminated its quality assurance department by dividing the production line into \u201cfocused factories\u201d and giving the inspection responsibility directly to each product manufacturing team."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Suppliers Become Part of the Team", "paragraphs": ["Material from suppliers typically represents from 60 to 85 percent of the final product cost at the companies we visited. Because of this, companies focused on improving supplier quality so they could eventually reduce material defects and inspections. They began by reducing their number of suppliers. In addition, they created qualification and certification procedures that relied on periodic evaluations of supplier quality systems. Finally, they developed long-term relationships with valued suppliers, increasing communication and creating a partnership, when possible. These practices helped companies reduce suppliers\u2019 defects by as much as 90 percent and inspections of incoming material by as much as 76 percent. Appendix III describes the results of our visits to specific companies that had implemented some of these supplier quality programs.", "Commercial companies significantly reduced the number of suppliers\u2014from 50 to 85 percent\u2014to manage the cost and quality of incoming material more closely. Generally, a reduction in the supplier base eliminates poorer performers, increases the importance of top performers, and allows closer cooperation with suppliers in continuous improvement practices and in new product development. To help reduce the number of suppliers, companies generally have a qualification and certification process. The qualification process typically begins with an evaluation of each supplier\u2019s current quality system and is often carried out by small cross-functional teams. For example, Varian\u2019s Oncology Systems qualifies all new suppliers through an evaluation process that includes an assessment of suppliers\u2019 defect rates, delivery performance, and a review of their internal quality systems.", "Once a company determines that a supplier has processes in place to guarantee continued quality, it eliminates inspections and depends on periodic supplier quality information and reviews, generally not more than once annually. For example, Motorola uses its Quality System Reviews to assess the suppliers\u2019 quality system every 2 years and score the supplier on such items as process controls and its ability to develop new products. The reviews are accomplished by a team of four or five quality management experts and take 2 to 3 days. The review guidelines use a scoring approach patterned after the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award criteria and include audit guidelines to determine how well a supplier controls quality in new product development and deploys good process controls. Both Motorola and Varian provide consulting teams and optional training courses to certified suppliers who either need or request assistance.", "Most of the companies had strategies to enter into long-term relationships with world-class, high-quality suppliers, resulting in reduced inspection, planning, rework, and contracting costs. As suppliers progress in meeting cost and quality goals with companies, they are included on design teams, given schedule forecasts for future orders, and included in the company\u2019s quality training program. In addition, longer term contracts typically help to reduce costs further and encourage valued suppliers to deliver material more efficiently. When companies introduce new products, valued suppliers are given the key characteristics of the part they are being asked to supply and then use this information to make sure their manufacturing processes are capable of making the component with consistently high quality."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Moves to Improve Quality Assurance Practices", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in the early 1990s, DCMC implemented Process Oriented Contract Administration Services (PROCAS) as a method of moving away from inspection-oriented quality assurance practices and toward process control. The intent of PROCAS is to team with contractors to identify, analyze, and manage production processes and reduce the need for oversight and inspection where it makes sense. In recognition that more advanced quality concepts are needed, a group of DOD officials and defense company representatives have joined in an initiative that, if implemented, could eliminate the costs of redundant quality assurance processes. According to the plan created by the Government and Industry Quality Liaison Panel in April 1995, DOD would allow a contractor to use the same quality management system\u2014based on process controls\u2014for its military contracts that it uses on its commercial contracts. Related to the panel\u2019s goals, DOD\u2019s Single Process Initiative, introduced in December 1995, also supports moving from multiple government-unique management systems to a single management system common to both commercial and military contracts. In addition, DOD has established a policy for using integrated product and process development concepts to integrate all acquisition activities, from product concept through production and field support. How well it will support the panel\u2019s goals remains to be seen.", "The Liaison Panel\u2019s plan has three overall goals. The first goal is to develop a single quality system that can meet commercial or military quality requirements. It envisions a multitier quality management framework based on criteria similar to the commercial ISO-9000 standard that would be recognized by all government and commercial entities. It begins with a basic quality system that must use process controls from design to delivery and would be reviewed on a regular basis by a single, unified government audit team. As a contractor moves to advanced quality concepts, such as design for manufacturing, and commits to continuous improvement of all its processes, its advanced quality system would be reviewed by government and industry representatives. One objective of this goal is to create a culture that can ensure effective design, production, and delivery processes without constraining suppliers with a set of inspection and oversight requirements.", "The plan\u2019s second goal is to have government and industry share the most advanced quality concepts in defining requirements for, designing, and manufacturing military products. It envisions a system that will encourage continuous improvement across the industry by identifying the most advanced methods of ensuring quality, making these concepts available to all contractors, and helping train personnel in these concepts. DOD and industry agreed that contractors who can provide evidence of using these advanced concepts to ensure quality should be given credit during source selection.", "The plan\u2019s third goal is to establish and implement efficient oversight methods. It envisions the government and industry developing a single set of criteria to evaluate contractors\u2019 quality management systems. This criteria should be implemented in a unified evaluation process and should promote effective and efficient innovation. Most importantly, DOD believes the criteria and its implementation method should be accepted by all government customers to avoid inconsistency and duplication of quality evaluations. The Co-chair of the Government and Industry Liaison Panel stated that this evaluation criteria would be used by government audit teams, perhaps from DCMC, in registering contractors\u2019 basic and advanced quality systems rather than current methods of oversight. Appendix IV lists the 15 specific tasks that the panel has undertaken to achieve its goals, their current status, and their projected completion dates.", "In December 1995, DOD began the Single Process Initiative, managed by DCMC, that allows contractors with military contracts to transition their quality system from MIL-Q 9858A to their best practice, such as a quality system based on ISO-9000, the basic commercial standard. The response to date has been slow; as of June 5, 1996, 38 contractors had submitted proposals to change their quality systems, 5 of which had been approved by DCMC. In discussions with government officials, we found that the biggest reason for this slow response is cultural. The defense community\u2019s traditional quality assurance practices have been inspection-based; the newer, more advanced concepts advocate process control. In addition, some contractor officials believed there is an understandable fear among DOD employees that changes in the quality assurance strategy will translate to a loss of jobs. Also, defense contractors do not see the benefit of implementing quality systems that may result in payment to the government for savings resulting from more efficient practices.", "DOD\u2019s approval of five contractors\u2019 commercial quality systems means that they are accepted as the basic quality system on all government contracts. This is a positive step toward introducing more advanced quality concepts from the commercial world that force quality considerations during the design phase of an acquisition. However, in agreeing to this change, DCMC reserved the right to review all quality documentation at any time; perform any inspections, verifications, or evaluations it deems necessary; review any supplies from other facilities; and disapprove the quality system or any portion of it. The method or frequency with which DCMC invokes these rights will be as important as a change in the military standard. Also, it is important that DOD continue to move contractors beyond changing basic quality systems, toward advanced concepts.", "According to DCMC officials, DCMC approved changes to commercial quality systems on 4,255 out of 158,000 existing military contracts\u2014less than 3 percent. It approved ISO-9000 on 398 new military contracts between May 1995 and April 1996. DCMC approves an average of 36,000 contracts per year, meaning that about 1 percent of new contracts in the past year have been approved with ISO-9000 as the quality standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["The commercial world has proven that it can design and manufacture consistently high-quality products by focusing on building quality into the product\u2019s design, understanding the key characteristics of the product and the manufacturing processes necessary to build it, training production personnel to control those processes throughout production, and instituting quality programs with suppliers based on these same principles. We saw convincing evidence that these practices improve product quality and reduce time and labor spent on quality assurance oversight by making it unnecessary.", "DOD recognizes the benefits of taking a broader approach to quality assurance. It has made some policy changes and is beginning to implement new practices. If DOD provides incentives for implementation of the advanced commercial practices, such as those identified in this report, we believe it can significantly improve quality, reduce costs of its acquisition programs, and apply savings to future modernization efforts. However, we do not believe DOD\u2019s quality assurance culture will change easily. Our conclusion is based on discussions with DOD and service representatives and our review of past acquisitions where DOD and we repeatedly identified unstable design, poor process controls, and poor transition to production as causes for manufacturing quality problems and made recommendations that have not been implemented.", "Therefore, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense (1) establish measurable steps to implement and monitor the progress of the Government and Industry Quality Liaison Panel plan closely; (2) periodically assess its success in implementing basic standards such as ISO-9000; (3) develop ways to encourage the adoption of advanced quality concepts of design for manufacturing, process controls, and supplier quality programs throughout the defense industry, using commercial practices as a guide; and (4) as suggested in the plan, establish incentives for defense contractors to participate, such as providing credit during source selection for successful implementation of these advanced quality practices. Such selection criteria could also provide world-class companies greater opportunities to participate in DOD\u2019s weapons acquisition programs.", "To assist DOD in changing its own quality assurance culture, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense expeditiously determine who in DOD\u2019s acquisition community can best oversee the advanced quality functions used by defense contractors in developing and producing weapon systems, using commercial practices as a guide in assigning these functions, and provide all necessary training for any new responsibilities that DOD personnel need to perform."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD agreed with the intent of the report and stated that it has already implemented many changes in line with our recommendations.
