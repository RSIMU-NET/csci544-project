The satellites obtain environmental  data that are processed to provide graphical weather images and  specialized weather products and are the predominant input to numerical  weather prediction models. These images, products, and models are all  used by weather forecasters, the military, and the public. Polar satellites  also provide data used to monitor environmental phenomena, such as  ozone depletion and drought conditions, as well as data sets that are used  by researchers for a variety of studies, such as climate monitoring.", "Unlike geostationary satellites, which maintain a fixed position above the  earth, polar-orbiting satellites constantly circle the earth in an almost  north-south orbit, providing global coverage of conditions that affect the  weather and climate. Each satellite makes about 14 orbits a day. As the  earth rotates beneath it, each satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface twice  a day. Today, there are two operational POES satellites and two operational  DMSP satellites that are positioned so that they can observe the earth in  early morning, mid morning, and early afternoon polar orbits. Together,  they ensure that for any region of the earth, the data provided to users are  generally no more than 6 hours old. Figure 1 illustrates the current  operational polar satellite configuration. Besides the four operational  satellites, six older satellites are in orbit that still collect some data and are  available to provide some limited backup to the operational satellites  should they degrade or fail. In the future, both NOAA and DOD plan to  continue to launch additional POES and DMSP satellites every few years,  with final launches scheduled for 2008 and 2011, respectively.", "Each of the polar satellites carries a suite of sensors designed to detect  environmental data that is either reflected or emitted from the earth, the  atmosphere, and space. The satellites store these data and then transmit  them to NOAA and Air Force ground stations when the satellites pass  overhead. The ground stations then relay the data via communications  satellites to the appropriate meteorological centers for processing. The  satellites also broadcast a subset of these data in real time to tactical  receivers all over the world.", "Under a shared processing agreement among the four processing centers\u2014 NESDIS, the Air Force Weather Agency, Navy\u2019s Fleet Numerical  Meteorology and Oceanography Center, and the Naval Oceanographic  Office\u2014different centers are responsible for producing and distributing via  a shared network different environmental data sets, specialized weather and oceanographic products, and weather prediction model outputs. Each  of the four processing centers is also responsible for distributing the data  to its respective users. For the DOD centers, the users include regional  meteorology and oceanography centers, as well as meteorology and  oceanography staff on military bases. NESDIS forwards the data to NOAA\u2019s  National Weather Service for distribution and use by government and  commercial forecasters. The processing centers also use the Internet to  distribute data to the general public. NESDIS is responsible for the long- term archiving of data and derived products from POES and DMSP.", "In addition to the infrastructure supporting satellite data processing noted  above, properly equipped field terminals that are within a direct line of  sight of the satellites can receive real-time data directly from the polar- orbiting satellites. There are an estimated 150 such field terminals operated  by U.S. and foreign governments, academia, and many are operated by  DOD. Field terminals can be taken into areas with little or no data  communications infrastructure\u2014such as on a battlefield or a ship\u2014and  enable the receipt of weather data directly from the polar-orbiting  satellites. These terminals have their own software and processing  capability to decode and display a subset of the satellite data to the user.

The converged program, NPOESS,  is considered critical to the United States\u2019 ability to maintain the continuity  of data required for weather forecasting and global climate monitoring. To  manage this program, DOD, NOAA, and NASA formed a tri-agency  Integrated Program Office located within NOAA.", "Within the program office, each agency has the lead on certain activities.  NOAA has overall program management responsibility for the converged  system, as well as satellite operations; DOD has the lead on the acquisition;  and NASA has primary responsibility for facilitating the development and  incorporation of new technologies into the converged system. NOAA and  DOD share the costs of funding NPOESS, while NASA funds specific  technology projects and studies. Figure 3 depicts the organizations  coordinated by the Integrated Program Office and their responsibilities.", "Program acquisition plans call for the procurement and launch of six  NPOESS satellites over the life of the program, as well as the integration of  13 instruments, consisting of 11 environmental systems and 2 subsystems.  Together, the sensors are to receive and transmit data on atmospheric,  cloud cover, environmental, climate, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical  observations. The subsystems are to support nonenvironmental search and  rescue efforts and environmental data collection activities. According to  the program office, 7 of the 13 planned NPOESS instruments involve new  technology development, whereas 6 others are based on existing  technologies. In addition, the program office considers 4 of the sensors  involving new technologies critical because they provide data for key  weather products; these sensors are shown in bold in table 1, which  presents the planned instruments and the state of technology on each.", "In addition, the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP), which is being  developed as a major risk reduction initiative, is a planned demonstration  satellite to be launched in 2006, several years before the first NPOESS  satellite launch in 2009. It is scheduled to host three of the four critical  NPOESS sensors (the visible/infrared imager radiometer suite, the cross- track infrared sounder, and the advanced technology microwave sounder),  as well as one other noncritical sensor (the ozone mapper/profiler suite).  NPP will provide the program office and the processing centers an early  opportunity to work with the sensors, ground control, and data processing  systems. Specifically, this satellite is expected to demonstrate the validity  of about half of the NPOESS environmental data records and about 93  percent of its data processing load."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NPOESS Acquisition Strategy", "paragraphs": ["When the NPOESS development contract was awarded, program office  officials identified an anticipated schedule and funding stream for the  program. The schedule for launching the satellites was driven by a  requirement that the satellites be available to back up the final POES and  DMSP satellites should anything go wrong during the planned launches of  these satellites. In general, program officials anticipate that roughly 1 out of  every 10 satellites will fail either during launch or during early operations  after launch.", "Key program milestones included (1) launching NPP by May 2006,  (2) having the first NPOESS satellite available to back up the final POES  satellite launch in March 2008, and (3) having the second NPOESS satellite  available to back up the final DMSP satellite launch in October 2009. If the  NPOESS satellites were not needed to back up the final predecessor  satellites, their anticipated launch dates would have been April 2009 and  June 2011, respectively.", "These schedules were changed as a result of changes in the NPOESS  funding stream. A DOD program official reported that between 2001 and  2002 the agency experienced delays in launching a DMSP satellite, causing  delays in the expected launch dates of another DMSP satellite. In late 2002,  DOD shifted the expected launch date for the final DMSP satellite from  2009 to 2010. As a result, DOD reduced funding for NPOESS by about $65  million between fiscal years 2004 and 2007. According to NPOESS program  officials, because NOAA is required to provide no more funding than DOD  provides, this change triggered a corresponding reduction in funding by  NOAA for those years. As a result of the reduced funding, program officials  were forced to make difficult decisions about what to focus on first. The  program office decided to keep NPP as close to its original schedule as  possible because of its importance to the eventual NPOESS development  and to shift some of the NPOESS deliverables to later years. This shift  affected the NPOESS deployment schedule. To plan for this shift, the  program office developed a new program cost and schedule baseline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NPOESS Costs Have Increased, and Schedules Have Been Delayed", "paragraphs": ["The program office has increased the NPOESS life cycle cost estimate by  $1.2 billion, from $6.9 to $8.1 billion, and delayed key milestones\u2014 including the expected availability of the first NPOESS satellite, which was  delayed by 20 months. The cost increases reflect changes to the NPOESS  contract as well as increased program management funds. The contract  changes include extension of the development schedule, increased sensor  costs, and additional funds needed for mitigating risks. Increased program  management funds were added for non-contract costs and management  reserves. The schedule delays were the result of stretching out the  development schedule to accommodate the change in the NPOESS funding  stream. In addition, the delayed launch dates of the NPOESS satellites have  extended the maintenance and operation of the satellite system from 2018  to 2020.", "When we testified on the NPOESS program in July 2003, we reported that  the program office was working to develop a new cost and schedule  baseline due to a change in the NPOESS funding stream. The program  office completed its efforts to revise the NPOESS cost and schedule  baseline in December 2003.", "As a result of the revised baseline, the program office increased the  NPOESS cost estimate by $638 million, from $6.9 to $7.5 billion. The  program office attributed the $638 million cost increase to extending the  development schedule to accommodate the changing funding stream,  increased sensor costs, and additional funds needed for mitigating risks.  The program office has since increased funds for non-contract costs and  management reserves, which raised its estimate by an additional $562  million to bring the NPOESS life cycle cost estimate to $8.1 billion.  According to program officials, non-contract costs included oversight  expenses for the prime contract and sensor subcontracts. Management  reserves, which are a part of the total program budget and should be used  to fund undefined but anticipated work, are expected to last through 2020.  Table 2 shows a breakdown of the cost increases resulting from the revised  plan.", "Recently, program officials reported that a new life cycle cost estimate  would be developed by the contractor and program office. The program  office expects to brief its executive oversight committee on the results of  its cost estimate analysis by December 2004. The new cost estimate will be  used to help develop the NPOESS fiscal year 2007 budget request. Officials  reported that the new estimate is necessary in order to ensure that the  program will be adequately funded through its life.", "In addition to increasing the cost estimate, the program office has delayed  key milestones, including the expected availability of the first satellite,  which was delayed by 20 months. The program office attributed the  schedule delays to stretching out the development schedule to  accommodate the changing funding stream. Table 3 shows program  schedule changes for key milestones.", "A result of the program office extension of several critical milestone  schedules is that less slack is built into the schedules for managing  development and production issues. For example, the first NPOESS  satellite was originally scheduled to be available for launch by March 2008  and to launch by April 2009. This enabled the program office to have 13  months to resolve any potential problems with the satellite before its  expected launch. Currently, the first NPOESS satellite is scheduled to be  available for launch by November 2009 and to launch the same month. This  will allow the program office less than one month to resolve any problems.

One method  that can help project managers track progress on deliverables is earned  value management. This method, used by DOD for several decades,  compares the value of work accomplished during a given period with that  of the work expected in that period. Differences from expectations are  measured in both cost and schedule variances.", "Cost variances compare the earned value of the completed work with the  actual cost of the work performed. For example, if a contractor completed  $5 million worth of work and the work actually cost $6.7 million, there  would be a \u2013$1.7 million cost variance. Schedule variances are also  measured in dollars, but they compare the earned value of the work  completed to the value of work that was expected to be completed. For  example, if a contractor completed $5 million worth of work at the end of  the month, but was budgeted to complete $10 million worth of work, there  would be a \u2013$5 million schedule variance. Positive variances indicate that  activities are costing less or are completed ahead of schedule. Negative  variances indicate activities are costing more or are falling behind  schedule. These cost and schedule variances can then be used in estimating  the cost and time needed to complete the program.", "Using contractor-provided data, our analysis indicates that NPOESS cost  performance was experiencing negative variances before the revised plan  was implemented in December 2003, and continued to deteriorate after the  implementation of the revised plan. Figure 4 shows the 15-month  cumulative cost variance for the NPOESS contract. From March 2003 to  November 2003, the contractor exceeded its cost target by $16.1 million,  which is about 4.5 percent of the contractor\u2019s budget for that time period.  From December 2003 to May 2004, the contractor exceeded its cost target  by $33.6 million, or about 5.7 percent of the contractor\u2019s budget. The  contractor has incurred a total cost overrun of about $55 million with  NPOESS development less than 20 percent complete. This information is  useful because trends tend to continue and can be difficult to reverse.  Studies have shown that, once programs are 15 percent complete, the  performance indicators are indicative of the final outcome.", "Our analysis also indicates that the program is showing a negative schedule  variance. Figure 5 shows the 15-month cumulative schedule variance of  NPOESS. From March 2003 to November 2003, the contractor recovered  almost $11 million worth of planned work in the schedule. Program  officials reported that within this time period, the program office ordered  the contractor to stop some work until the new baseline was established.  This work stoppage contributed to schedule degradation between March  2003 and August 2003. In September 2003, the program office implemented  portions of the revised plan, which resulted in an improvement in schedule  performance. The revised plan alleviated some of the cumulative schedule  overrun by delaying the deadline for first unit availability by 20 months.  However, based on our analysis, the cumulative schedule variance  indicates slippage in the new schedule. Since December 2003, the  contractor has been unable to complete approximately $19.7 million worth  of scheduled work. The current inability to meet contract schedule  performance could be a predictor of future rising costs, as more spending  is often necessary to resolve schedule overruns.", "According to program office documents, cost and schedule overruns that  occurred before December 2003 were caused by planning activities related  to the revised plan, as well as by technical issues related to the  development of the critical sensors and the spacecraft communications  software. Since the completion of the revised plan, the program\u2019s ability to  meet the new performance goals continues to be hampered by technical  issues with the design complexity, testing, and integration, among other  things, of the critical sensors. These technical issues could cause further  cost and schedule shortfalls.", "Based on contractor performance from December 2003 to May 2004, we  estimate that the current NPOESS contract\u2014which ends in September  2011 and is worth approximately $3.4 billion\u2014will overrun its budget by  between $372 million and $891 million. Our projection of the most likely  cost overrun will be about $534 million, or about 16 percent of the contract.  The contractor, in contrast, estimates about a $130 million overrun at  completion of the NPOESS contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risks Could Further Affect NPOESS Cost and Schedule", "paragraphs": ["Risk management is a leading management practice that is widely  recognized as a key component of a sound system development approach.

In accordance with leading management  practices, the program office developed a NPOESS risk management  program that requires assigning a severity rating to risks that bear  particular attention, placing these risks in a database, planning response  strategies for each risk in the database, and reviewing and evaluating risks  in the database during monthly program risk management board meetings.", "The program office identifies risks in two categories: program risks, which  affect the whole NPOESS program and are managed at the program office  level, and segment risks, which affect only individual segments and are  managed at the integrated product team level. The program office has  identified 21 program risks, including 14 medium to medium-high risks.  Some of these risks include the development of three critical sensors (the  visible/infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS), the cross-track infrared  sounder (CrIS), and the conical-scanned microwave imager/sounder  (CMIS)) and the integrated data processing system; the uncertainty that  algorithms will meet system performance requirements; and the effort to  obtain a security certification and accreditation. Figure 6 includes the 21  program risks and their assigned levels of risk.", "Managing the risks associated with the development of VIIRS and CrIS, the  integrated data processing system, and algorithm performance is of  particular importance because these are to be demonstrated on the NPP  satellite currently scheduled for launch in October 2006. Any delay in the  NPP launch date could affect the overall NPOESS program because the  success of the program depends on the lessons learned in data processing  and system integration from the NPP satellite.", "At present, the program office considers the three critical sensors\u2014VIIRS,  CMIS, and CrIS\u2014to be key program risks because of technical challenges  that each is facing. VIIRS\u2019s most severe technical issue, relating to flight- quality integrated circuits, was recently resolved; however, the program  office continues to consider the schedule for the VIIRS sensor acquisition  to be high risk. The prime contractor\u2019s analysis of the current schedule  indicated that the present schedule is unlikely to be achieved, considering  the technical risks, the optimistically planned integration and test phase,  and the limited slack in the schedule at this stage of the program. VIIRS is  experiencing ongoing technical issues on major subcontracts related to the  motors, rotating telescope, and power supply. As a result of the numerous  ongoing issues\u2014many of which affect system performance\u2014significantly  more modeling, budget allocation work, and performance reviews have  been required than were originally planned. Until the current technical  issues are resolved, delays in the VIIRS delivery and integration onto the  NPP satellite remain a potential threat to the expected launch date of the  NPP.", "The CMIS and CrIS sensor acquisitions are experiencing schedule overruns  that may threaten their respective expected delivery dates. CMIS technical  challenges include unplanned redesigns for receiver and antenna  components, system reliability issues, and thermal issues.
