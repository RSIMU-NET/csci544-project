GAO was asked to review the implementation of this initiative.

However, the agency also has reported progress on the principal Local Solutions indicator in three other ways, depending on whether two key types of funding\u2014cash transfers and certain qualifying trust funds\u2014are included (see figure). These reporting differences make it difficult to compare the indicator from year to year and to quantify the progress needed to achieve the 30 percent target by fiscal year 2015. Moreover, USAID's approach to tracking the Local Solutions indicator has evolved since the launch of the initiative. For example, USAID included funds in Afghanistan and Pakistan, missions the agency previously had planned to exclude. If these missions are excluded, the percentage of mission program funds obligated to local organizations in fiscal year 2012, including qualifying trust funds and cash transfers, decreases by 10 percentage points.", "USAID's principal Local Solutions indicator does not fully reflect activities the agency has undertaken to implement the initiative, and USAID does not have a means to track relevant mission-led evaluations of programs implemented by partner-country organizations.

The agency has had difficulty deciding how best to define this  indicator and report on it consistently; as a consequence, comparing  annual results for this indicator and accurately measuring progress is  unnecessarily complex. In addition, in relying on this funding indicator to  such an extent, USAID does not capture important progress taking place  as the agency adopts the Local Solutions funding approach, such as  missions\u2019 efforts to assess and mitigate risk and carry out monitoring and  evaluation plans, among other things.
