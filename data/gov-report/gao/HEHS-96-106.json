Generally, federal employment training programs target specific populations of workers, such as dislocated workers\u2014those who have been or will be permanently laid off due to plant closures or corporate downsizing. These programs often pay for formal training or other services workers need to find stable employment and, as a result, can reduce employers\u2019 training costs by providing them with trained workers.", "In your September 18, 1995, letter, you expressed concern about the difficulties small employers may have in training their workforce or hiring additional workers with the necessary skills. Because of your interest in ensuring that federal training programs accommodate small employers, you asked that we (1) provide information on the extent to which small employers participate in employment training programs of different types, (2) identify barriers that may limit their participation, and (3) discuss ways to address such barriers.", "To obtain information on small employer training activities, their use of available training programs, and barriers they may face when participatingin programs, we reviewed pertinent literature and studies; interviewed many officials from employer and other associations and federal agencies; and analyzed the most recent employer surveys of training by the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s National Center for the Educational Quality of the Workforce (EQW), the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the University of Kentucky (performed under a grant from the Small Business Administration (SBA)).", "To obtain specific information about barriers faced by employers using particular programs, we conducted six case studies of small employer experiences in selected programs that offered formal training and had different funding sources, program goals, and operations. These case studies included two organizations providing local services to dislocated workers under the federal Job Training Partnership Act\u2019s (JTPA) Title III Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance (EDWAA) program (the North Tennessee Private Industry Council in Clarksville, Tennessee, and The Private Industry Council in Portland, Oregon); two state training fund programs (the Employment Training Panel in Sacramento, California, and the Office of Customized Training in Trenton, New Jersey); and two privately funded and operated apprenticeship programs (the Tooling and Manufacturing Association in Park Ridge, Illinois, and the Employing Bricklayers Association of Delaware Valley in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania).", "Appendixes II, III, and IV discuss the results of these case studies. Because our findings are based on a small number of case studies, they are not generalizable to the employer community as a whole.

For further discussion of our methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Academic and government research has highlighted the crucial importance of a skilled workforce to the nation\u2019s economy. This research has also suggested that the training being provided to current and future workers may not be sufficient to ensure a workforce with the skills necessary for fostering economic growth and improved living standards.Partly in response to these concerns, over the last several years, the administration, the Congress, and the private sector have suggested or implemented several initiatives to enhance the provision and effectiveness of training. Some of these initiatives call for a greater role for employers in determining training needs or conducting training.", "Although many federal training programs focus mainly on the needs of particular types of worker populations (such as dislocated workers), other training programs focus on employers\u2019 training needs. For example, in most states employers can take advantage of programs that provide funding for employment training as an integral part of the state\u2019s economic development strategy. As of 1995, 47 states spent over $350 million for programs that helped employers develop customized formal training programs for their workers. The rationale for these state-funded programs is that worker retraining is critical to economic development. Most of these programs are funded from general state revenues; some states, however, require mandatory employer contributions to state training funds (similar to unemployment insurance payroll taxes). To be eligible for these state programs, employers often must meet financial or industry-specific requirements. To participate in these programs and receive funding for training, employers must prepare detailed training plans about the training they want to provide, be responsible for providing the training, and adhere to specific follow-up requirements.", "Employers may also fund their own training programs, individually, collectively, or in conjunction with unions, to train workers or new hires. Although a 1990 study estimated that employers spend billions each year on training activities, no comprehensive list exists of all privately funded training programs or how employers participate in them. Collaborations among employers and other entities\u2014sometimes called consortia\u2014are often developed mainly to provide member employers with trained workers at reasonable costs. Such consortia have historically existed in industries with technical trade or unionized occupations that have joined together for apprenticeship training.", "Apprenticeship training is a structured approach to formal training in which employers send their workers to classroom training while providing them with supplemental on-the-job training (OJT). Although not required, employers often register their programs with the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT) to take advantage of various benefits. In 1995, Labor had about 34,000 registered apprenticeship programs with over 355,000 apprentices.", "Small employers have special training needs because of the workers they tend to employ, according to experts. Establishments of fewer than 100 workers employ over 50 percent of all workers, and, according to SBA, small employers provide the first work experience for two out of every three workers. Small employers also often hire workers with fewer skills and less education because they tend to pay lower wages than larger employers in their industries or geographic areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Employers May Not Be Taking Full Advantage of Training Programs", "paragraphs": ["Small employers are less likely to use available training programs and resources\u2014especially federally sponsored training programs\u2014than are larger employers, according to the extremely limited quantitative data available. For example, a recent employer establishment survey conducted by EQW found that 22 percent of work places with over 100 employees used government-sponsored training programs, while only about 12 percent of work places with fewer than 100 employees used them. A 1993 University of Kentucky survey also found that, while 44 percent of establishments with 500 or more employees used government training programs, only about 20 percent of those with 100 or fewer employees used them. An employer establishment survey conducted by BLS in 1994 found that although over 50 percent of establishments with 250 or more employees used apprenticeship programs, less than 18 percent of establishments with 50 or fewer employees used them.", "These data are supported by the views of many experts, who believe that the amount and quality of training being provided by small employers may not be sufficient to ensure a workforce with the skills necessary for fostering economic growth. No consensus exists, however, on the type or level of small employer participation appropriate to ensure that present and future workers of small employers are adequately skilled. In addition, several reasons may explain why small employers may not train or participate in available training programs. Finally, use of available training programs may be limited for employers of all sizes. Nonetheless, the significant difference between the use of available programs by small employers compared with larger ones raises questions about why small employers participate less in available training programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Employers May Face Barriers That Discourage Participation in Training Programs", "paragraphs": ["Small employers may face several barriers when participating in available training programs.

This lack of resources makes it more difficult for small employers to pay tuition costs or allow workers to take training during normal work hours because employers would have to absorb the cost of wages paid to workers who are training rather than working. In addition, because small employers are less likely to have staff devoted to training or personnel matters, it may be relatively more costly and time consuming for them to divert resources from production to completing administrative requirements for program participation. Finally, because turnover rates for small employers tend to be higher than for larger employers in the same industry and geographic area, small employers may be less willing or able to absorb the lost costs and benefits of training if the newly trained employee quits or is hired by another employer.", "Economic barriers to training were present to some degree in all the programs we visited\u2014federal, state, and private. In the two EDWAA sites we visited, the costs associated with paperwork requirements somewhat discouraged employers from participating. For example, if an employer wants to provide OJT to a dislocated worker, the employer must, among other requirements, complete a detailed OJT training agreement, specifying what training is to be provided, its duration, the number of participants, wage rates to be paid, the rate of reimbursement, and a description of what participants will learn. The employer must also maintain and make time and attendance reports and other records available to program officials to support amounts reimbursed by the government under these contracts during the training period (which can last 6 months or longer). The employer also must allow program officials to inspect the program site to ensure that training is being done accurately. Officials at the program sites we visited said that because of the significant requirements, employers rarely provide OJT.", "State-funded training programs also had economic barriers that may discourage small employer participation. First, to participate in these programs, employers must comply with extensive paperwork requirements, providing detailed information about their operations, why they need training, and the parameters of the training. Then, they must develop a detailed training plan. Employers told us that, because of the amount of information required and the detailed nature of the information on the application, completing the application process is time consuming and burdensome. Program officials said the application process takes 5 to 6 months or possibly longer; one employer said it took over a year to complete the application process. In addition, to receive all of the requested funding throughout the training period (which can last up to 2 years) employers must meet with program staff and supply updated training information. Finally, when the training is completed, employers must provide information on its impact.", "The small employers we interviewed who were participating in the program said the monitoring requirements were also burdensome and time consuming. These employers participated despite the application and monitoring requirements because they recouped their costs when they received the training funds. However, they noted that other small employers may not be willing to endure the process to receive the training funds. Although state program officials said these requirements were mandated by the program legislation to ensure program accountability, they agreed that small employers may be discouraged by the amount of paperwork and information required.", "In addition, a few of the employers participating in one of these programs said that the program\u2019s requirement that employers allow workers to receive training during normal work hours was difficult and sometimes costly. They said that employees did not always want to attend training during normal work hours and maintaining consistent productivity levels while employees were in training was difficult.", "Finally, one of the apprenticeship programs posed economic barriers to employers. Employers were hesitant to hire and train apprentices from the bricklayer apprenticeship program because they believed it was too costly. Officials overseeing this program said they often had difficulty placing all apprentices because employers said that, although apprentices received reduced wages during the training period, the reduced wages did not offset the apprentices\u2019 lower productivity\u2014a cost they could not afford. A broader economic concern facing employers in this apprenticeship program was the cyclical nature of the construction industry. They said that, even in the best of times, unionized journeymen sometimes cannot work all year because of weather or other factors and hiring apprentices when journeymen lack work would be unfair. One employer also told us it would not be fair to the apprentices to hire them and then lay them off soon after for lack of work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutional Requirements May Limit Participation", "paragraphs": ["Other barriers limiting small employer participation in training programs are institutional, often resulting from a program\u2019s organization or operations. Institutional barriers may limit small employer participation in programs because they may discourage or disqualify small employers from accessing the programs. For example, if a program targets its services primarily to workers rather than employers, it may discourage small employers because they do not have personnel dedicated to finding out about program procedures, which may be confusing or complicated. In addition, if a program limits its services to certain industries, locations, or training needs, employers of all sizes will not be able to take advantage of the program if they cannot fit into any of the targeted groups. Small employers may find it even more difficult if they do not have industry characteristics or training needs in common with other industry employers.", "The EDWAA and apprenticeship programs faced some of these institutional barriers. EDWAA\u2019s traditional focus on workers may discourage small employer participation. First, most of the program\u2019s resources are to be directed to workers\u2019 needs rather than employers\u2019 needs, which may mean that programs target large employers because they are better connected to established human resource networks and can hire more workers out of the program than small employers. One small employer told us that he believed training programs tended to focus on larger employers because they are easier to find. In that respect, programs may serve the needs of larger employers; one employer said that, being a small employer, he cannot afford to wait 6 months to a year until the required training is completed before he can get a trained worker (as a larger employer may be able to do). Moreover, the program allows much flexibility in how local sites involve employers, so that disparate views and approaches to employer participation may result. For example, one site we visited believed that OJT was very important and that employers should take advantage of it. The other site did not actively market this part of the program to employers. Circumstances such as this may be especially problematic for small employers, who have less time and fewer resources to navigate among various program structures to determine the participation requirements.", "The apprenticeship programs also presented some institutional barriers for small employers. Both of the programs we visited provided structured training for specific technical skills needed by similar types of employers in a single geographic area. The training these programs provided was not available to small employers with different training needs or those in a different location. Furthermore, because one of the programs provided training for employers with unionized employees only, employer participation would require an employer to become unionized. This could include signing a collective bargaining agreement and agreeing to other conditions that a small employer may not be willing or able to agree to."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Informational Barriers May Limit Participation", "paragraphs": ["Another barrier that may limit small employer participation is informational\u2014that is, small employers may lack appropriate knowledge of training needs or available training programs. Small employers, because they are less likely to dedicate staff to training and personnel matters, may have more difficulty than larger employers identifying training needs or determining what training programs are available to meet their needs. In addition, small employers may be less involved with established training networks or industry groups or trade associations than larger employers, so they often lack adequate and accurate information about what training programs are available to meet their needs.", "Informational barriers may also limit full participation for the EDWAA and the state training fund programs. For example, many small employers we interviewed that had hired workers through the EDWAA program were generally unaware of the program and did not know that the program would reimburse them for OJT they provided to a dislocated worker. Because small employers were generally unaware of the program, they said that they did not typically seek out these workers for their job vacancies. In addition, many of them had negative opinions about the program, which also influenced their decisions about whether to seek individuals from federal training programs for vacancies. For example, several employers said that they did not believe the quality of participants in federal training programs was very good. These employers, however, were pleased with the skills of the workers they had unknowingly hired through the program. Program officials at the one site we visited (NTPIC in Tennessee) said that current funding restrictions make it difficult to adequately serve individuals and small employers simultaneously. At the other site (TPIC in Oregon), program officials said they continued to believe that they achieved significant employer participation through a number of activities. They also said their encouragement of a \u201cself-directed job search\u201d for dislocated workers means it is quite possible that employers are unknowingly hiring workers who had received services through this program.", "Moreover, several of the small employers we spoke with who were participating in the state training fund programs said they were unaware of the program until contacted by a consortium. While these employers ultimately were able to participate, they believed that other small employers who were not involved with such groups may not be aware of the programs\u2019 availability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consortia Used to Address Small Employers\u2019 Barriers to Participation", "paragraphs": ["Program officials at the sites we visited generally acknowledged that although small employer participation was important to the program\u2019s success, it was often difficult to achieve. They said that they want to reduce many of the barriers to small employer participation but some are more difficult to address than others. They said that institutional barriers\u2014those inherent in the programs\u2019 organization\u2014may require amendments or other changes to traditional operations to be addressed. Programs that had been developed with a specific employer focus (the state training fund and apprenticeship programs), however, were using or encouraging consortia to reduce many of the economic and informational barriers to participation in these programs.", "In the state training fund and apprenticeship programs, consortia usually centered around local community colleges, trade associations, unions, or employers working on behalf of others. In addition, while their activities varied, the consortia typically linked small employers with the services offered by the training programs, including helping employers identify training needs and comply with program requirements. According to the small employers we spoke with who participated in these programs through consortia, consortia were a significant determinant in their participation. Appendixes III and IV highlight the consortia activities and how they helped small employers participate in the programs.", "Although the use of consortia is permitted in EDWAA, we did not find them being used at the sites we visited. Labor officials said, however, that incentives to encourage their development may be insufficient. In 1995, Labor provided about $5 million in demonstration grants to 11 sites to demonstrate the ability of organizations to broker linkages between employers and dislocated workers. Through these demonstrations, these organizations\u2014similar to consortia\u2014are to encourage employers to participate in identifying needed employee skills and developing training curricula designed especially to meet the employers\u2019 needs. Several of the demonstration projects focus on individual clusters of small employers, while others use Employer Advisory Committees so that the workforce needs of employers are the major focus of training provided to dislocated workers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consortia Helped Reduce Economic Barriers", "paragraphs": ["The use of consortia in the apprenticeship and state training fund programs reduced many of the economic barriers to participation. In the apprenticeship program, employers said the use of consortia reduced training costs. According to one employer participating in the apprenticeship program, because the costs of the program were subsidized by all consortia members, any costs he must individually bear for training apprentices were lower than they would have been if he had tried to get similar services at local educational institutions. Other employers said that because the training was cheaper because of this subsidization, they were less concerned about the losses associated with trained workers quitting or being hired by another employer.", "Consortia also helped to reduce economic barriers in the state training fund programs, primarily because they either completed the administrative and monitoring paperwork for the employers or they provided significant help to the employers to complete it. Representatives of several of the major consortia in these programs that we interviewed said their key role was providing help with the paperwork and other program requirements. Employers participating through consortia said that the use of consortia saved them much time and effort in completing the paperwork and other program requirements.

In the apprenticeship programs, the consortia developed a structured training curriculum that could be accessed by all employer members of the consortia. Employers said this significantly reduced the difficulty of identifying training needs. One employer said that he did not have time to identify his training needs, contact local schools to determine who had the appropriate training courses, and put together a curriculum. In that respect, he said, the consortium \u201cput it all together.\u201d In addition, all employers we spoke with believed that, because the training was developed with their input, it was industry based and of a better quality than what was available from local institutions. Finally, because the consortia carried out several activities that promoted the industries and the availability of the training, employers participating in both apprenticeship programs believed the consortia made other small employers aware of the training. One employer who was not participating in one of the programs said he was well aware of the program. He believed it was effective and would use it if he had a need for apprentices.", "The consortia also helped to overcome informational barriers to the state training fund programs. Often, the consortia contacted employers and asked them about their training needs, then worked with them to determine the best way to address those needs. One of the small employers we spoke with said he would not be participating unless one of the consortia had contacted him because he did not know about the program before that.

Because every employer may not want to become involved with a consortium or none may be available, the state training fund programs also provided significant technical assistance to individual small employers interested in the program.", "Both programs had staff or used staff from other organizations to visit employers and walk them through the application requirements. When necessary, program staff also help small employers identify training needs to facilitate the application process. This helps employers who want to participate but may find it too costly or time consuming to provide the necessary information on their own. Program officials said that technical assistance is provided throughout the training period, which can last up to 2 years. During this time, program staff periodically visit the employer and assess the employer\u2019s progress in the training provision. This assessment includes a review of the training curricula, interviews with instructors and students, and a determination that the training is providing necessary skills. Employers told us that this assistance was critical because it helped to reduce the time needed to complete the paperwork and comply with other administrative requirements.", "At the EDWAA sites we visited, the use of technical assistance to help employers reduce participation costs was limited because employers are not typically involved in determining workers\u2019 training needs.

Typically, federally funded programs target specific populations of unemployed or underemployed workers; state- and privately funded programs target employers and their existing workforce (and in some cases, new hires).

Using these criteria, we selected a nonunion program operated by the Tooling and Manufacturing Association (TMA) in Park Ridge, Illinois, and a union program operated by the Employing Bricklayers Association of Delaware Valley (EBA) in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania.", "At each of these six sites, we obtained historical program funding and operation information and requested information from local program officials on the characteristics of employers and workers served and available outcome measures. During the visits to these six sites, we interviewed program administrators, those responsible for funding and overseeing the program; a sample of the service providers, those who actually provided the training; and a sample of small employers that used the program in 1995.

For the EDWAA and apprenticeship programs, we also obtained program information from Labor officials in Washington, D.C."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Findings From Literature on Small Employer Training Activities", "paragraphs": ["Although our main objective was to obtain information on the extent of small employer participation in training programs, a related issue is the amount of training small employers provide. To obtain information on this, we reviewed many studies and interviewed experts and employers about their training activities. We found a consensus that small employers train with less frequency than larger employers and that the training provided by small employers is often not adequate for their needs. In addition, when small employers did train, they often obtained training as a result of an outside source, such as a vendor or consultant, or possibly through an apprenticeship program. However, detailed analysis of these results is complicated because of several methodological differences.", "For example, while most of the experts and literature agreed that small employers had a more difficult time training than did large employers, no consensus existed on what criteria defined a small employer. SBA reported that depending upon the industry or the issue being studied, definitions of small employer vary from those having fewer than 100 employees to those having as many as 500. The many studies we reviewed and our interviews with experts confirmed this. We decided to use employers with 100 or fewer employees for our definition of small employer for several reasons. First, much of the literature used 100 employees as a cutoff point for small employers. Second, experts noted that if an employer has fewer than 100 employees, it is less likely to have a separate human resources function and would therefore have more difficulties with training. Third, local program officials often considered small employers those with 100 or fewer employees. Although the lack of consensus on the definition of small employer makes it difficult to establish the size of a small employer, the lack of a precise definition is secondary to the broad agreement that employers of fewer than 100 workers have particular problems and needs regarding training.", "Another term that lacked a standardized definition was training. Again, although experts generally agreed that training occurred more frequently in larger work places than in small, studies and experts referenced different kinds of training. Descriptions of training included formal (such as classroom training provided by an educational institution), informal (supervisory instruction at the work site), structured (classroom training at the work site), unstructured (ad hoc training for immediate needs), and OJT (training during the workday), which could be formal or informal, structured or unstructured. In many cases, the type of training was not defined in the particular sources, or, if defined, pertained only to that particular source. Furthermore, other sources defined training as related to specific goals, such as total quality management, workplace education, or safety and health regulations.", "The three employer surveys illustrate many of these definitional differences. Each survey asked employers about training and generally found that larger work places provide more training than smaller work places. Differences in survey sampling frames and methodology, format, and scope, however, make a detailed comparative analysis difficult.", "Regarding sampling frame and methodology, all three of the recent employer surveys were a sample of business establishments, which BLS defines as economic units that produce goods or services and are engaged predominantly in one type of economic activity. The use of establishments could be problematic because a small establishment could actually be part of a large employer or a fairly large establishment could actually be part of a relatively small employer. Finally, an establishment and an employer could be one and the same.", "Moreover, the universes from which the samples of establishments were drawn differed, as did the sampling methodology. The sample for the EQW survey, conducted in 1994 and released in 1995, was drawn from Census\u2019 business establishment listing and included over 4,600 establishments with at least 20 employees. The survey omitted establishments with fewer than 20 employees and oversampled establishments in the manufacturing sector and those with 100 or more employees. The sample for the BLS establishment survey, conducted in 1994, released in 1994 but covering 1993, was drawn from BLS\u2019 business establishment list; it included almost 12,000 nonagricultural establishments. BLS included in its sample any establishment with at least one employee. Finally, the sample for the University of Kentucky study, performed under a grant from SBA in 1992 and released in 1993, was drawn from a database of about 9 million establishments held by a private firm in Fairfield, Connecticut. The sample included about 3,600 establishments, with an oversampling of larger employers. Only about one-third, or 1,300 establishments, provided complete responses to the survey.", "The surveys also had significant differences in their scope and format. The EQW survey was a phone survey actually conducted by the Census Bureau. It asked respondents about formal and informal training and precise types of training (such as literacy, basic education, or executive development training). It also asked about the use of outside sources of training, whether training has increased or decreased in the past several years, and the reasons for any such increase or decrease.", "BLS\u2019 survey was a mail survey sponsored by Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration. This survey asked questions primarily on formal training, which BLS defined as training with a structured format and a defined curriculum, including OJT if it met this definition. The questions focused primarily on the incidence and frequency of six specific types of formal training: (1) orientation training, (2) safety and health training, (3) apprenticeship training, (4) basic skills training, (5) workplace-related training, and (6) job skills training. The questions generally did not cover the use of outside sources for training.", "The University of Kentucky study was also a telephone survey conducted by the University\u2019s Survey Research Center. The purpose of the survey was to obtain information on training experiences of workers hired in the previous 3 months only. The questions focused on five categories of training activities: (1) on-site formal training, (2) off-site formal training, (3) informational management training, (4) informal coworker training, and (5) watching others perform."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federally Funded Training: How Two EDWAA Program Sites Provide Services to Workers and Small Employers", "paragraphs": ["The federal government provided about $20 billion for 163 programs that involved some aspect of training in fiscal year 1995.

The governors can also use other factors in addition to those specified in legislation when allocating funds to local areas. In fiscal year 1995, the Congress appropriated about $1.2 billion for dislocated workers under EDWAA.", "JTPA established private industry councils (PIC) to oversee JTPA activities in substate areas, though a great deal of flexibility exists in how services can be carried out at the local level. Of the 616 substate grantees, over half are state or local government agencies, about one-fourth are incorporated PICs, and the remaining grantees are other organizations such as educational institutions or nonprofit associations. The program allows grantees to provide services in house, contract them out to a third party, or do a combination of both. In addition, the grantees have the authority to determine whether they will provide certain services.", "Regarding funding, however, the program does restrict local organizations\u2019 allocation of funds. According to the law, grantees must spend at least 50 percent of the funding they receive on retraining, although substate grantees can request a waiver from the governor to reduce the funding directed to retraining. No more than 25 percent can be spent on needs-related payments and other support services, and no more than 15 percent can be spent on program administration. Depending on the actual allocation decisions, the remaining funds are then spent on basic readjustment services (which include job placement activities).

TPIC\u2019s DWP caseworkers work out of the three centers discussed above. The participant and the DWP caseworker develop a training action plan, which is similar to the ISS.

TMA apprentices are simultaneously enrolled in the community college and can earn college credit for the classroom training and, in some cases, for OJT. Toward this end, TMA does all the paperwork and other activities associated with registration and grade distribution. Both programs have attendance policies and have expelled students when necessary. Both programs also provide grades to the apprentices. TMA apprentices who complete the coursework are recognized in a graduation ceremony and receive a certificate.", "Employers we interviewed believe that the classroom training is well structured and meets their needs because the curricula are industry based. They said that teaching the classes at night on the employees\u2019 own time facilitates their participation for several reasons. First, they could not afford to pay workers wages while they were training. Second, they could not afford to have workers away from the job during the day because the productivity costs would be prohibitive. Several employers said they would not be able to participate if training were held during the day.", "In addition, all of the participating employers we interviewed said the costs associated with the apprenticeship program are reasonable and affordable. TMA employers said tuition fees are lower than they would be for the same courses at the local community college. Participating employers in both programs said they lose money in the first years of training but believe it is cost-effective in the long run if they retain the worker and that training is the best way to gain a skilled worker."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employers Are Responsible for Providing OJT", "paragraphs": ["Federal apprenticeship programs must provide apprentices with OJT. TMA\u2019s program requires 8,000 to 10,000 hours of OJT, which takes 4 to 5 years; EBA\u2019s program requires 4,000 hours, which takes 3 to 4 years. OJT is supervised by a journey worker at the job site in both programs. Program officials want apprentices to learn a broad range of appropriate skills. Yet they cannot closely monitor OJT because officials at both TMA and EBA do not believe it is their role to tell member employers how to train apprentices. However, TMA provides a guide to employers that outlines tasks and performance criteria, and EBA recently developed a report card for apprentices to record their activities and the time spent on various tasks, which provides some oversight of OJT. Program officials and all the employers we interviewed believe that OJT is essential to the success of apprenticeship and the education of an apprentice.", "Participating TMA employers said that providing OJT has some costs such as lowered productivity of the apprentices and of the supervisors who oversee apprentices. They noted, however, that they would be incurring these costs anyway, since they cannot find new workers with the necessary skills. They believe that conducting OJT through the apprenticeship program is cheaper and more effective in the long run than doing it on their own.", "Providing OJT is more difficult to achieve in EBA than in TMA. As stated before, not all EBA apprentices must be employed by a member employer to participate in the program. Often, EBA tries to find employment for apprentices after they have been accepted to the program; however, officials said they currently have apprentices receiving classroom training who are not employed with member employers. EBA officials said finding employers who are willing to take apprentices is sometimes difficult; EBA often places apprentices with the same few employers every year. They said employers may not be willing to incur the additional productivity losses of supervisors who must oversee the apprentices. They also said that often employers will not take apprentices despite the reduced wages that can be paid to apprentices because employers believe the apprentices\u2019 productivity does not justify the wages paid. EBA officials said they believe that these employers were misusing apprentices (for instance, using them for lower cost occupations such as laborers rather than bricklayers); however, EBA cannot force employers to take apprentices. EBA officials said the greatest difficulty in employers\u2019 hiring apprentices, however, is the lack of steady work in the industry. Employers noted that, even in the best of times, experienced workers do not have enough work and it would not be fair to those workers to hire apprentices. Furthermore, hiring apprentices and firing them soon after for lack of work would be unfair.", "Once apprentices get all the required OJT hours and complete the coursework, they receive a certificate of completion from BAT. TMA also provides a journeyman\u2019s card, which is a local credential. Under both programs, graduate apprentices often continue working with the same employer."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Significant Participation by Small Employers", "paragraphs": ["Program officials said employer participation is essential to these apprenticeship programs\u2014not only because employers fund the programs but because the training is based on employer needs. According to TMA officials, one of the primary reasons members join is the availability of apprenticeship training. EBA officials said that apprenticeship training is one of the best ways to ensure a pool of skilled workers in the industry.", "Although program officials do not routinely collect data on the characteristics of employers served by the apprenticeship programs, both TMA and EBA are dominated by small employers. As a result, they tend to have high small employer participation rates in the apprenticeship program.", "Of TMA\u2019s 1,485 members, about 80 percent have fewer than 100 employees; median member size is 12 employees. Similarly, most of the 290 employers participating in TMA\u2019s apprenticeship program have fewer than 100 employees. In addition to the 290 employers, many others have employed apprentices who have already finished classroom training and are continuing to earn OJT hours. Furthermore, TMA officials estimate that about 900 of the 1,485 members have toolrooms that require trained employees and that most of these 900 employers have enrolled apprentices at some point but, given their small size, do not need to train apprentices every year. In this manner, a large portion of TMA\u2019s members are currently participating or have participated in the past. According to TMA officials, the lack of interested, qualified workers often prevents employers from participating. We contacted several employers, most of whom were small, who were not using the TMA apprenticeship training. They noted that they did not need to train workers now because all of their workers were trained and skilled. They noted, however, that they knew about the TMA program and would use it if they needed to train apprentices.", "EBA officials estimated that most of the member employers had fewer than 150 employees. Determining their size, however, was difficult because employer size fluctuates greatly in the construction industry because employers have core staff and hire additional employees as needed, laying them off when a specific contract is completed. The largest EBA employer had 200 employees at its peak. EBA said the participation rate in the apprenticeship program has remained fairly constant at 15 to 20 percent of EBA employers. Both small and large employers have participated\u2014usually the same employers every year. EBA officials also noted that changes in technology have affected the rate of participation; the substitution of other building materials for brick has reduced the need for skilled and apprentice masons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Consortia to Foster Small Employer Participation", "paragraphs": ["Both TMA and EBA are forms of consortia\u2014groups of employers and/or unions working together to obtain training and other benefits to reduce the costs for all involved.

One employer, an owner of a small tool and die operation without a human resources department told us that when he needs new workers, he has to run a newspaper ad, answer telephone inquiries, and interview candidates. He does not have time for that, since he needs to work on the shop floor along with his employees. By relying on TMA to identify and screen workers, he can get qualified workers cheaply and easily. TMA employers also reported that being in an association with other employers helps them network and learn about new developments in the industry.", "Participating employers in both programs said that training apprentices puts them at a competitive advantage over other employers and training costs are outweighed by the long-run benefits of gaining skilled, loyal workers. First, training costs are subsidized by employer dues or other contributions. For example, tuition fees at the community college were more than TMA\u2019s tuition fee. Second, classroom training is scheduled on the employees\u2019 own time. One employer noted that even though the local community college had a similar program to TMA\u2019s, he would not use it because training was only offered during the day and he could not afford to lose employees\u2019 productivity. Third, programs provide services, such as marketing and outreach to find workers and job screening, that save employers time and money. Finally, EBA officials said small employers benefitted by being able to pay apprentices in training lower wages than other employees. Participating employers said they would still provide OJT without these programs but it would be more expensive and they would not teach apprentices what they learn in class.", "Finally, program officials and participating employers said the consortium arrangement protected employers who trained from losing workers to other employers. Since all employer members are investing in training, the incentive for an employer to steal trained workers from other employers is reduced. Also, because training costs are minimized, employers had less fear of losing their investment if they did train."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consortia Relieved Barriers Related to Developing Training Programs", "paragraphs": ["Participating employers noted that the consortia relieved several barriers common to small employers when trying to identify general training needs and sources.

He also noted that the community college training included classroom training as well as OJT, which he really did not need. He said that TMA \u201cput it all together,\u201d not only by providing him the training he needed when he needed it, but by saving him countless hours of determining what to teach.

Officials said employers continue to enroll apprentices if they reap benefits: they pointed to the 600 apprentices as proof of program success. Enrollment of first-year apprentices declined from 259 to 158 between 1989 and 1995, while completions increased from 55 to 77 percent during that time. Program officials explained that fewer people were accepted into the program because admission standards rose, resulting in stronger candidates with a greater probability of finishing the program.

Instructors have been fired in the past on the basis of these monitoring activities.", "Although EBA has no specific performance measures, it relies on feedback from employers and apprentices about the program and takes corrective action as necessary. Although only one-third of EBA\u2019s first-year apprentices are employed with a member employer, apprentices who have finished the classroom training and are earning OJT hours are all employed by a member employer.
