TSA is currently behind schedule in testing and developing initial increments of CAPPS II, due in large part to delays in obtaining needed passenger data for testing from air carriers because of privacy concerns. TSA also has not established a complete plan identifying specific system functionality that will be delivered, the schedule for delivery, and estimated costs. The establishment of such plans is critical to maintaining project focus and achieving intended results within budget. Without such plans, TSA is at an increased risk of CAPPS II not providing the promised functionality, of its deployment being delayed, and of incurring increased costs throughout the system's development. TSA also has not completely addressed seven of the eight issues identified by the Congress as key areas of interest related to the development, operation, and public acceptance of CAPPS II. Although TSA is in various stages of progress on addressing each of these eight issues, as of January 1, 2004, only one--the establishment of an internal oversight board to review the development of CAPPS II--has been fully addressed. However, concerns exist regarding the timeliness of the board's future reviews. Other issues, including ensuring the accuracy of data used by CAPPS II, stress testing, preventing unauthorized access to the system, and resolving privacy concerns have not been completely addressed, due in part to the early stage of the system's development. The following table is a summary of TSA's status in addressing the eight key issues. GAO identified three additional challenges TSA faces that may impede the success of CAPPS II. These challenges are developing the international cooperation needed to obtain passenger data, managing the possible expansion of the program's mission beyond its original purpose, and ensuring that identity theft--in which an individual poses as and uses information of another individual--cannot be used to negate the security benefits of the system. GAO believes that these issues, if not resolved, pose major risks to the successful deployment and implementation of CAPPS II."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The security of our nation\u2019s commercial aviation system has been a long- standing concern, and for over 30 years, substantial efforts have been  undertaken to strengthen it. However, the tragic events of September 11,  2001\u2014which began with the hijacking of four commercial aircraft\u2014 showed that weaknesses in commercial aviation security continued to  exist. Many changes have since been made to strengthen aviation security  and reduce opportunities for terrorists to hijack or destroy commercial  aircraft. However, as recent flight cancellations and other events from  December 2003 through February 2004 have shown, the threat of terrorist  attempts to use commercial aircraft to inflict casualties and damage  remains. With thousands of daily flights carrying millions of passengers,  ensuring that no passenger poses a threat to commercial aviation remains  a daunting task.", "One of the efforts underway to address this task and strengthen aviation  security is the development of a new Computer-Assisted Passenger  Prescreening System that is known as CAPPS II. The prescreening of  passengers\u2014that is, determining whether airline passengers pose a  security risk before they reach the passenger screening checkpoint\u2014is  used to focus security efforts on those passengers representing the  greatest potential threat. Since the late 1990s, prescreening has been  conducted using a computer-assisted system that, based on certain criteria  and behaviors, identifies passengers that may pose a higher risk to aviation  security. These higher-risk passengers and their baggage are subject to  additional and more thorough screening.", "In response to the events of September 11, 2001, and the requirement set  forth in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that a computer- assisted passenger prescreening system be used to evaluate all passengers,  the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) Office of National Risk  Assessment is developing CAPPS II. Unlike the current Computer-Assisted  Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) that operates on airlines\u2019  reservation systems, CAPPS II will be operated by TSA. Further, it will  perform different analyses and access more diverse data, including data  from commercial and government databases, to classify passengers  according to their level of risk. The development of CAPPS II raises a  number of concerns, including whether individuals may be inappropriately  targeted by the system for additional screening, and whether data  accessed by the system may compromise the privacy of the traveling  public.", "We were requested by the Chairman, House Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure; the Chairman, Subcommittee on Technology,  Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations and the Census, House  Committee on Government Reform; and mandated by Public Law 108-90  to assess aspects of the system\u2019s development, including safeguards put in  place to protect the traveling public\u2019s privacy.

A detailed discussion of our scope and  methodology is contained in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["During the past 30 years, the federal government has taken significant  steps to strengthen the screening of passengers flying on U.S. commercial  aircraft. With the increased number of aircraft hijackings that occurred  during the late 1960s and early 1970s, the government directed that all  passengers and their carry-on baggage be screened for dangerous items  before boarding. During the 1990s, as the volume of passengers requiring  screening and the awareness of the terrorist threat against the United  States increased, a computerized system was proposed to help identify  passengers posing the greatest risk to a flight so that they could receive  additional security attention. In 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration  provided funding to a major U.S. air carrier to develop such a  computerized system for prescreening passengers.", "This system, known as CAPPS, was implemented in 1998 and is in use  today by most U.S. air carriers. CAPPS enables air carriers to separate  passengers into two categories: those who require additional security  scrutiny\u2014termed \u201cselectees\u201d\u2014and those who do not. When a passenger  checks in at the airport, the air carrier\u2019s reservation system uses certain  information from the passenger\u2019s itinerary for analysis in CAPPS. This  analysis checks the passenger\u2019s information against the CAPPS rules and  also against a government supplied watch list that contains the names of  known or suspected terrorists. A passenger\u2019s selectee status is then  transmitted to the check-in counter where a code is printed on the  boarding pass of any passenger determined to require additional  screening, and at the screening checkpoint, passengers who are selectees  are subject to additional security measures. CAPPS currently prescreens  an estimated 99 percent of passengers on domestic flights. Certain air  carriers manually prescreen their passengers using CAPPS criteria.", "The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, however, became the impetus  for change in both the way in which passengers are screened and the  entities responsible for conducting the screening. The Aviation and  Transportation Security Act, passed in November 2001, directed that a  computer-assisted passenger prescreening system be used to evaluate all  passengers before they board an aircraft. The act also directed the  creation of TSA within the Department of Transportation. TSA assumed  responsibility for civil aviation security from the Federal Aviation  Administration, and for passenger and baggage screening from the air  carriers.", "Within TSA, the Office of National Risk Assessment was charged with  developing CAPPS II in response to the act\u2019s requirement. TSA plans to  begin operating CAPPS II with a single air carrier and then expand to other  air carriers at dates to be determined. When fully developed, CAPPS II is  envisioned to operate in the following manner.  1.  During the reservation process, the passenger will be required to  provide four pieces of information: full name, home address, home  phone number, and date of birth. This information will be entered into  the Passenger Name Record and sent electronically to CAPPS II.   2.  At a specified time prior to the flight, CAPPS II will request an identity  authentication from commercial data provider(s), meaning that a  passenger\u2019s personal information\u2014full name, home address, home  phone number, and date of birth\u2014will be verified by information in the  databases of one or more of the commercial data providers. Next,  rather than the commercial data provider sending back any personal  information, an identity authentication score will be returned to  CAPPS II that identifies the level of confidence that the data provided  by the passenger is authentic.  3.  After obtaining passengers\u2019 authentication scores, CAPPS II will  conduct risk assessments using government databases, including  classified and intelligence data, to generate a risk score categorizing  the passenger as an acceptable risk, unknown risk, or unacceptable  risk.  4.  When the passenger checks in for a flight at the airport, the  passenger\u2019s risk category will be transmitted from CAPPS II to the  check-in counter. Passengers who are an acceptable or unknown risk  will receive a boarding pass encoded with their risk level so that  checkpoint screeners will know the level of scrutiny required. If the  passenger\u2019s risk is determined to be unknown, additional security  checks will be required. Passengers whose risk assessment is  determined to be unacceptable will not be issued boarding passes;  instead, appropriate law enforcement agencies will be notified. Law  enforcement officials will determine whether the individual will be  allowed to proceed through the screening checkpoint or if other  actions are warranted, such as additional questioning of the passenger  or taking the passenger into custody.", "Figure 1 displays the steps in the CAPPS II passenger prescreening  process.", "TSA program officials and TSA\u2019s draft Business Case for CAPPS II state  that the system will provide significant improvements over the existing  CAPPS. For example, most air carriers currently use CAPPS within their  reservation systems to assess passengers for possible risk, while CAPPS II  will be owned and operated by the federal government. TSA believes that  this consolidation will allow for more effective and efficient use of up-to- date intelligence information and make CAPPS II more capable of being  modified in response to changing threats. In addition, TSA believes that  CAPPS II has the potential to improve identity authentication. Another  expected benefit of the system is the ability to aggregate risk scores to  identify higher-risk flights, airports, or geographic regions.", "Improved identity authentication could reduce the number of passengers  who are falsely identified as needing additional security screening.  Although exact numbers are not available, TSA officials estimate that  currently 15 percent of passengers require additional checkpoint screening  under CAPPS, compared to an expected 1 to 3 percent under CAPPS II.  CAPPS II is also ultimately expected to prescreen all passengers on flights  either originating in or destined for the United States.", "According to the draft Business Case for CAPPS II, the system has an  estimated life cycle cost of over $380 million through fiscal year 2008.  Life cycle costs beyond fiscal year 2008 have not been estimated.

Officials also stated that they were uncertain when the testing that  was deferred from increments 1 and 2 to increment 3 will be completed.  TSA recognizes that system testing is a high-risk area and plans to further  delay the system\u2019s schedule to ensure that sufficient testing is completed.

However, since each commercial provider assesses accuracy  with different measures and criteria, each company\u2019s accuracy  information is not comparable across the industry or to any consistent  standard. In addition, accuracy data for government databases is not  systematically collected. As a result, TSA officials stated that they will  develop and conduct their own tests to assess the overall accuracy of  information contained in commercial and government databases.

Finally, since  databases will be added throughout the system\u2019s development, accuracy  testing will need to continue as additional government and commercial  databases are used.", "In addition to testing the accuracy of commercial databases, TSA plans to  better ensure the accuracy of commercial databases by using multiple  databases in a layered approach to authenticating a passenger\u2019s identity. If  available information is insufficient to validate the passenger\u2019s  identification in the first database accessed, then CAPPS II will access  another commercial database to provide a second layer of data, and if  necessary, still other commercial databases. This layered system, which  relies on multiple databases, is expected by TSA to ultimately save  resources because not all passengers would have to be checked against all  data sources. TSA also plans to improve the overall accuracy of  authentication scores through a process that targets errors such as  misspellings and typographical errors. TSA officials stated that this  process may help to differentiate passengers with similar names.", "TSA program officials said that testing government databases for overall  accuracy will be challenging. For example, TSA does not know exactly  what type of information the government databases contain, such as  whether a database will contain a person\u2019s name and full address, a partial  address, or no address at all.

Consequently, in addition  to using multiple databases and a process to identify misspellings to  correct errors in commercial databases, TSA is also developing a redress  process whereby passengers can attempt to get erroneous data corrected.   However, it is unclear what access passengers will have to information  found in either government or commercial databases, or who is ultimately  responsible for making corrections. Additionally, if errors are identified  during the redress process, TSA does not have the authority to correct  erroneous data in commercial or government databases.

TSA initially planned to conduct stress  testing on an early increment of the system by August 2003. However,  stress testing was delayed several times due to TSA\u2019s inability to obtain  the 1.5 million Passenger Name Records it estimates are needed to test the  system. TSA attempted to obtain the data needed for testing from three  different sources\u2014two U.S. air carriers and a global distribution service,  also known as a reservation company\u2014but encountered problems due to  privacy concerns associated with its access to the data.

TSA plans to provide oversight of CAPPS II through  two methods: (1) establishing goals and measures to assess the program\u2019s  strengths, weaknesses, and performance; and (2) establishing mechanisms  to monitor and evaluate the use and operation of the system. TSA has  established preliminary performance goals and measures for CAPPS II;  however, these measures may not provide all of the objective data needed  to conduct appropriate oversight. In addition, TSA has not fully  established or documented additional oversight controls to ensure that  operations are effectively monitored and evaluated.", "TSA has established preliminary goals and measures to assess the CAPPS  II program\u2019s performance in meeting its objectives. The Government  Performance and Results Act requires that agencies establish goals and  measures in order to appropriately oversee the performance of programs.  As stated in TSA\u2019s draft Business Case for CAPPS II, the agency has  established five strategic objectives with performance goals and measures,  as shown in table 2.", "Goals and measures are intended to allow TSA and DHS management,  other oversight bodies, and the Congress to systematically assess a  program\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and performance, and then identify  appropriate remedies. In this regard, these preliminary goals and measures  represent a good first step. They provide some useful intermediate  performance information on key aspects of the program and, according to  TSA, are tied to DHS and TSA strategic goals. We have previously reported  that TSA had linked its aviation security goals to those of its then parent  department, the Department of Transportation, and that linking goals of  component organizations to goals of the parent organization are helpful in  moving towards a results oriented culture and providing accountability for  results.", "However, CAPPS II performance goals and measures could be  strengthened. Two of the planned goals and measures are potentially  redundant, as the goal of prescreening 100 percent of passengers by   2005 will, by necessity, require meeting the goal of having all airlines  participating in the system. Further, goals to improve the reliability and  effectiveness of CAPPS II could be included. For example, although a  performance measure is established for the percentage of referrals to law  enforcement being verified as representing an increased risk, no goals or  measures are established for assessing whether the system\u2019s performance  is producing accurate scores and not producing errors, such as \u201cfalse  negatives\u201d\u2014when a passenger is not identified for increased screening  when that passenger should have been. This is a key area for which TSA  has acknowledged that data must be identified, quantified, and tracked for  improvement. However, TSA has not developed a measure to assess its  performance in this area. TSA officials stated that they are working with  five universities to assess system effectiveness and management, and will  develop metrics to be used to measure effectiveness of CAPPS II. With this  information, officials expect to review and, as necessary, revise their goals  and objectives to provide management and the Congress with objective  information to provide system oversight.", "In addition, TSA has not fully established policies and procedures to  monitor and evaluate the use and operation of the system. TSA has built  capabilities into CAPPS II to monitor and evaluate the system\u2019s operation  and record actions taken by the program, and it plans to conduct audits of  the system to determine whether it is functioning as intended. However, at  this time, TSA has not written all of the rules that will govern how the  system will operate. Consequently, officials do not yet know how these  capabilities will function, how they will be applied to monitor the system  to provide oversight, and what positions and offices will be responsible for  maintaining the oversight. For example, TSA has not created all of the  policies that will govern CAPPS II operations for compliance with privacy  requirements.

Specifically, TSA plans  appear to address many of the requirements of the Privacy Act, the  primary legislation that regulates the government\u2019s use of personal  information. For example, in January 2003, TSA issued a notice in the  Federal Register that generally describes the Privacy Act system of  records that will reside in CAPPS II and asked the public to comment.  While TSA has taken these initial steps, it has not yet finalized its plans for  complying with the act. For example, the act and related Office of  Management and Budget guidance state that an agency proposing to  exempt a system of records from a Privacy Act provision must explain the  reasons for the exemption in a published rule. In January 2003, TSA  published a proposed rule to exempt the system from seven Privacy Act  provisions but has not yet provided the reasons for these exemptions,  stating that this information will be provided in a final rule to be published  before the system becomes operational. As a result, TSA\u2019s justification for  these exemptions remains unclear. Until TSA finalizes its privacy plans for  CAPPS II and addresses such concerns, we lack assurance that the system  will fully comply with the Privacy Act.", "When viewed in the larger context of Fair Information Practices\u2014 internationally recognized privacy principles that also underlie the Privacy  Act\u2014TSA plans reflect some actions to address each of these practices.  For example, TSA\u2019s plan to not collect passengers\u2019 social security numbers  from commercial data providers and to destroy most passenger  information shortly after they have completed their travel itinerary  appears consistent with the collection limitation practice, which states  that collections of personal information should be limited. In addition,  TSA\u2019s plan to prohibit commercial data providers from using information  they receive from TSA for commercial purposes appears consistent with  the use limitation practice, which states that personal information should  not be disclosed or used for other than the specified purpose except with  consent of the individual or legal authority.", "However, to meet its evolving mission goals, TSA plans also appear to limit  the application of certain of these practices. For example, TSA plans to  exempt CAPPS II from the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements to maintain only  that information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to  accomplish a proper agency purpose. These plans reflect the  subordination of the use limitation practice and data quality practice  (personal information should be relevant to the purpose for which it is  collected) to other goals and raises concerns that TSA may collect and  maintain more information than is needed for the purpose of CAPPS II,  and perhaps use this information for new purposes in the future. Further,  TSA plans to limit the application of the individual participation  practice\u2014which states that individuals should have the right to know  about the collection of personal information, to access that information,  and request correction\u2014by prohibiting passenger access to all personal  information about them accessed by CAPPS II. This raises concerns that  inaccurate personal information will remain uncorrected in and continue  to be accessed by CAPPS II.", "Such actions to limit the application of the Fair Information Practices do  not violate federal requirements. Rather, they reflect TSA\u2019s efforts to  balance privacy with other public policy interests such as national  security, law enforcement, and administrative efficiency. As the program  evolves, it will ultimately be up to policymakers to determine if TSA has  struck an appropriate balance among these competing interests.", "See appendix IV for a more detailed analysis of TSA\u2019s plans to address  privacy issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Redress Process under Development but Significant Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["TSA has not yet finalized a redress process for passengers who are  erroneously delayed or prohibited from boarding their scheduled flights,  termed \u201cfalse positives.\u201d According to TSA officials, a redress process for  such passengers is a critical element of CAPPS II, and TSA intends to  establish a process by which passengers who are subject to additional  screening or denied boarding will be provided the opportunity to seek  redress by filing a complaint. However, officials stated that such a  program cannot be fully developed until key program policies are  finalized, such as the length of time CAPPS II will retain passenger data  and the conditions under which TSA will retain records longer than  normal.", "Although the redress process is not fully developed, TSA officials  identified key elements they expect to include in the process. First, TSA  will use its existing complaint procedures\u2014currently used for complaints  from passengers denied boarding passes\u2014to document complaints and  provide these to the TSA Ombudsman. Complaints relating to CAPPS II  will be routed to the Passenger Advocate, a position to be established  within TSA for assisting individuals with CAPPS II-related concerns. The  Passenger Advocate will represent the passenger and help identify errors  in the system that may have caused a person to be identified as a false  positive. Second, if the passengers are not satisfied with the response  received from TSA with regard to the complaint, they will have the  opportunity to appeal their case to the DHS Privacy Office. Third, TSA  plans to conduct a public awareness campaign to inform travelers about  what to expect from the new CAPPS II process and how to register  complaints if they believe they are erroneously selected for additional  security attention.", "A number of key policy issues associated with the redress process,  however, still need to be resolved. These include defining the role of the  Passenger Advocate and the mechanisms that will be used to inform  passengers of the outcomes of their complaints. More significantly, there  are three concerns regarding data in CAPPS II that may complicate the  redress process. These concerns involve data retention, access, and  correction.", "Data retention: TSA has not yet determined how long CAPPS II will  retain passenger data. Current plans indicate that data on U.S. travelers  and lawful permanent residents will be deleted from the system at a  specified time following the completion of the passengers\u2019 itinerary.   Although TSA\u2019s decision to limit the retention of data was made for  privacy considerations, the short retention period might make it  impossible for passengers to seek redress if they do not register  complaints quickly. TSA could rerun the passenger information  through CAPPS II in an effort to recreate the deleted data, but TSA has  no way of determining whether the results would be the same\u2014the  algorithms used to calculate risk scores change\u2014or that risk scores  were even the reason for the additional screening. Additional screening  can be the result of factors such as setting off the alarm on screening  checkpoint metal detectors or random selection, and not as a result of  a risk score calculated by CAPPS II.", "Data access: TSA has not yet determined what information the  Passenger Advocate will be able to share with passengers who file a  complaint. Although TSA has stated that it is committed to providing  access to information in CAPPS II to the greatest extent feasible, TSA  officials stated that passengers will not have access to any government  data used to generate a passenger risk score due to national security  concerns. TSA officials have also not determined to what extent, if any,  passengers will be allowed to view information used by commercial  data providers.", "Data correction: TSA has not yet determined how the process of  correcting erroneous information will work in practice. TSA  documents and program officials stated that it may be difficult for the  Passenger Advocate to identify errors. Further, it will be the  responsibility of passengers to correct errors in commercial databases  at their source, as TSA will refer the passengers to the original source  of the data to seek correction. Correcting erroneous information is  further complicated by the fact that commercial data providers may not  be obligated to correct their databases, and that names of the data  sources may not even be made available to the passengers due to  licensing agreements.", "To address these concerns, TSA is exploring ways to assist passengers  who are consistently determined to be false positives. For example, TSA  has discussed incorporating an \u201calert list\u201d that would consist of passengers  who coincidentally share a name with a person on a government watch list  and are therefore continually flagged for additional screening. Although  the process has not been finalized, current plans indicate that a passenger  would be required to submit to an extensive background check in order to  be placed on the alert list.

These issues include developing the international cooperation needed to  obtain passenger data, managing the expansion of the program\u2019s mission  beyond its original purpose, and ensuring that identity theft\u2014in which an  individual poses as and uses information of another individual\u2014cannot be  used to negate the security benefits of the system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Cooperation", "paragraphs": ["For CAPPS II to operate fully and effectively, it needs data not only on U.S.  citizens who are passengers on flights of domestic origin, but also on  foreign nationals on domestic flights and on flights to the United States  originating in other countries.

Moreover, as evidenced  by the cancellation for security reasons of several flights to the United  States from December 2003 through February 2004, the use of commercial  aircraft originating in foreign countries may be the means terrorists  choose to use to attempt future attacks.", "To prescreen passengers on flights originating in foreign countries  requires that CAPPS II obtain Passenger Name Record data on passengers  from foreign countries, flying on foreign airlines, or purchasing tickets  through foreign sources. However, obtaining international cooperation for  access to this data remains a substantial challenge. The European Union,  in particular, has objected to its citizens\u2019 data being used by CAPPS II,  whether a citizen of a European Union country flies on a U.S. carrier or an  air carrier under another country\u2019s flag. The European Union has asserted  that using such data is not in compliance with its privacy directive and  violates the civil liberties and privacy rights of its citizens. Its position  extends not only to international flights to the United States, but also to  U.S. domestic flights that carry citizens of European Union countries.", "DHS and European Union officials are in the process of finalizing an  understanding regarding the transfer of passenger data for use by the  Bureau of Customs and Border Protection for preventing and combating  (1) terrorism and related crimes; (2) other serious crimes, including  organized crime, that are transnational in nature; and (3) flight from  warrants or custody for these crimes. However, this understanding does  not permit the passenger data to be used by TSA in the operation of  CAPPS II but does allow for the data to be used for testing purposes.  According to a December 16, 2003, report from the Commission of  European Communities, the European Union will not be in a position to  agree to the use of its citizens\u2019 passenger data for CAPPS II until internal  U.S. processes have been completed and it is clear that the U.S. Congress\u2019s  privacy concerns have been resolved. The Commission stated that it would  discuss the use of European Union citizen passenger data in a second,  later round of discussions.", "TSA officials stated that in the short term, the lack of data on non-U.S.  citizens could potentially affect the implementation of the system\u2019s initial  operating capabilities. Moreover, officials stated that in the longer term, an  inability to obtain data on non-U.S. citizens would hamper the  effectiveness of the system.

However, TSA has stated  that it may expand the number of people targeted for additional security  screening through CAPPS II. In the August 2003 interim final Privacy Act  notice for CAPPS II, TSA stated that the system would seek to identify  terrorists (both domestic and foreign) and not just foreign terrorists as  previously proposed. The August notice also stated that the system could  be expanded to identify persons who are subject to outstanding federal or  state arrest warrants for violent crimes. Finally, in the notice, TSA also  stated that CAPPS II could ultimately be expanded to include identifying  individuals who are in the United States illegally or who have overstayed  their visas.", "DHS officials stated that they believe that such changes are not an  expansion of the system\u2019s mission. Rather, they believe that the mission of  CAPPS II is to strengthen aviation security, and as stated by the DHS Chief  Privacy Officer, identifying wanted violent criminals and fugitives is  consistent with that mission. DHS officials also stated that using CAPPS II  to identify individuals not legally in this country is consistent with the  broader DHS mission to protect the nation\u2019s borders from illegal  immigration. However, focusing on persons with outstanding warrants,  and possibly immigration violators, could put TSA at risk of diverting  attention from the program\u2019s fundamental purpose, which is identifying  persons who pose a threat to aviation security. Expanding the CAPPS II  mission could also lead to an erosion of public confidence in the system,  which program officials agreed is essential to the effective operation of  CAPPS II. This expansion could also increase the number of passengers  erroneously identified as needing additional security attention as well as  the costs of passenger screening. Privacy advocacy organizations also  expressed concern regarding the potential expansion of the CAPPS II  mission to identify persons who are subject to outstanding warrants for  violent crimes and illegal immigrants because they believe these  individuals do not necessarily pose a threat to aviation security.", "According to TSA program officials, the expansion of CAPPS II would also  pose substantial operational challenges that they do not yet know how to  effectively address. For example, implementing these possible changes  could require integration with other data systems, such as the National  Crime Information Center and immigration databases, as well as other  databases that may contain data on persons with outstanding warrants.  This would require involving additional agencies in the system, as well as  additional equipment to effectively query these databases and integrate  responses into CAPPS II.

Successful identity theft  would encompass two elements. First, an individual would have to obtain  the personal identifiers (name, home address, date of birth, and home  phone number) of an individual who would likely be classified by CAPPS  II as an acceptable risk. Next, the person would have to obtain falsified  documents associated with the stolen identity (such as a driver\u2019s license  containing the stolen identifiers with the thief\u2019s picture) to present at the  airport ticket counter and screening checkpoint.", "TSA officials stated that while CAPPS II cannot address all cases of  identity theft, CAPPS II should detect situations in which a passenger  submits fictitious information such as a false address. These instances  would likely be detected since the data being provided would either not be  validated or would be inconsistent with information maintained by the  commercial data provider. Additionally, officials said that identity theft  and other fraud data may be available through credit bureaus, and that in  the future they expect to work with the credit bureaus to obtain such data.  However, they acknowledge that some identity theft is difficult to spot,  particularly if the identity theft is unreported or if collusion, where  someone permits his or her identity to be assumed by another person, is  involved.", "TSA officials stated that there should not be an expectation that CAPPS II  will be 100 percent accurate in identifying all cases of identity theft.  Further, they said that CAPPS II is just one layer in the system of systems  that TSA has in place to improve aviation security, and that passengers  who were able to thwart CAPPS II by committing identity theft would still  need to go through normal checkpoint screening and other standard  security procedures.

However, we believe that our report appropriately addresses this issue in  sufficient detail as it relates to impediments to CAPPS II deployment and  use. Further, presenting more information on this issue would require us  to have discussed CAPPS II with other countries.

However, because  the system is not yet operational, and TSA has not been able to obtain  actual passenger data to conduct tests, no output results existed for us  to review and analyze that would demonstrate whether CAPPS II would  be able to make an accurate predictive assessment of passengers who  may pose a risk to aviation security.", "To determine what safeguards and security measures are in place to  protect the system from abuse and misuse, we reviewed the system\u2019s  draft security plans and TSA\u2019s security policies. We also interviewed  TSA officials with system security responsibilities to determine what  safeguards and security measures are planned and how they will  function.", "To identify how TSA plans to oversee the use and operation of the  system after implementation, we reviewed DHS and TSA policies and  procedures governing oversight of the system.

We also interviewed  privacy and public interest groups, as well as air carriers and airline  associations, to obtain their perspectives on these challenges.

System functionality established at the central processing  center. By completion of increment 1, the system will be functional at the  central processing center and can process passenger data and support  intelligence validation using in-house data (no use of airline data).  Additionally, at this increment, validation will be completed for privacy  and policy enforcement tools; the exchange of, and processing with, data  from multiple commercial data sources; and processing of government  databases to support multiple watch-lists.", "Increment 2. System functionality established to support processing  airline data. At the completion of increment 2, the system is functionally  and operationally able to process airline data. Additionally, the system can  perform functions such as prioritizing data requests, reacting to threat  level changes, and manually triggering a \u201crescore\u201d for individual  passengers in response to reservation changes or adjustments to the threat  level.", "Increment 3. This increment will provide for a functional system that will  use a test simulator that will not be connected to an airline\u2019s reservation  system. System hardware that includes the establishment of test and  production environments will be in place and a facility capable of  performing risk assessment will be established. Design and development  work for system failure with a back up system and help desk  infrastructure will be put in place.", "Increment 4. By this increment a back up location will be functionally and  operationally able to support airlines processing application, similar to the  main location. A help desk will be installed to provide assistance to  airlines, authenticator, and other user personnel.", "Increment 5. Enhanced intelligence interface. At the conclusion of this  increment, the system will be able to receive from DHS the current threat  level automatically and be able to adjust the system in response to changes  in threat levels. The system will also be able to semi-automatically rescore  and reclassify passengers that have already been authenticated.", "Increment 6. Enhanced passenger authentication. This increment will  allow the system to perform passenger authentication using multiple  commercial data sources in the instance that little information on a  passenger is available from original commercial data source.", "Increment 7. Integration of other system users. By the completion of this  increment, TSA Aviation Operations and law enforcement organizations  will be integrated into CAPPS II, allowing multiple agencies and  organizations to do manpower planning and resource allocations based on  the risk level of the nation, region, airport, or specific flight.", "Increment 8. Enhanced risk assessments. This increment provides for the  installation of capabilities and data sources to enhance risk assessments,  which will lower the number of passengers falsely identified for additional  screening. This increment also provides for a direct link to the checkpoint  for passenger classification, rather than having the passenger\u2019s score  encoded on their boarding pass.", "Increment 9.

However, in its efforts to  balance privacy with national security and other public policy interests,  TSA has proposed a number of actions which limit the application of  certain of these practices and consequently, raise privacy concerns. Until  TSA completes its privacy plans and the program is further developed, it  cannot be determined whether the agency has identified all the CAPPS II  privacy risks and taken actions to mitigate them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Plans Appear to Address Many Privacy Act Requirements, but Raise Concerns Pending Further Action", "paragraphs": ["The Privacy Act of 1974 is the primary act that regulates the federal  government\u2019s use of personal information. The act places limitations on  agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal information.", "At this early stage of program development, TSA has taken some initial  actions to respond to the act\u2019s requirements for public notice. In January  2003, TSA issued (1) a notice in the Federal Register that generally  describes the Privacy Act system of records that will reside in CAPPS II  and asked the public to comment, and (2) a proposed rule to exempt this  system of records from seven Privacy Act provisions as permitted under  the act. In August 2003, the agency issued an interim final notice in the  Federal Register that describes planned changes to CAPPS II based on the  public\u2019s comments on the January 2003 notice. The August notice also  stated that TSA would issue a further Privacy Act notice before any  implementation of CAPPS II.", "Other initial TSA plans for CAPPS II are consistent with various Privacy  Act requirements. For example, TSA plans to provide passengers with a  Privacy Act notice that explains the authority for collecting their  information, its principal purposes, and other information as the act  requires. TSA also plans to perform real-time auditing and testing to  identify data quality problems and improve accuracy. This appears  consistent with the act\u2019s provision that agencies maintain only personal  information that is accurate, complete, timely, and relevant. Our  assessment may change after TSA completes its privacy plans and the  program is further developed.", "While TSA has taken these initial steps, it has not yet finalized its plans for  complying with the act. For example, the act and related Office of  Management and Budget guidance state that an agency proposing to  exempt a system of records from a Privacy Act provision must explain the  reasons for the exemption in a published rule. In January 2003, TSA  published a proposed rule to exempt the system from seven Privacy Act  provisions but has not yet provided the reasons for these exemptions,  stating that this information will be provided in a final rule to be published  before the system becomes operational. As a result, TSA\u2019s justification for  these exemptions remains unclear at the present time. Until TSA finalizes  its privacy plans for CAPPS II and addresses such concerns, we lack  assurance that the system will fully comply with the Privacy Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Application of the Fair Information Practices Reflect Efforts to Balance Privacy and National Security Goals", "paragraphs": ["Fair Information Practices are a set of internationally recognized privacy  protection principles. First proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government  advisory committee, the Fair Information Practices are, with some  variation, the basis of the privacy laws and related policies of almost every  country that has addressed privacy protection, including the Privacy Act in  the United States and similar laws in the European Union. For purposes of  this review, we used the eight Fair Information Practices proposed in   1980 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that  were endorsed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1981 as shown  below:  1.  Collection limitation\u2014The collection of personal information  should be limited, should be obtained by lawful and fair means,  and, where appropriate, should be obtained with the knowledge   or consent of the individual.  2.  Purpose specification\u2014The purpose for the collection of personal  information should be disclosed before collection and upon any  change to that purpose, and its use should be limited to that  purpose and compatible purposes.  3.  Use limitation\u2014Personal information should not be disclosed or  otherwise used for other than a specified purpose without consent  of the individual or legal authority.  4.  Data quality\u2014Personal information should be relevant to the  purpose for which it is collected, and be accurate, complete, and  current as needed for that purpose.  5.  Security safeguards\u2014Personal information should be protected  with reasonable security safeguards against risks such as loss or  unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.  6.  Openness\u2014The public should be informed about privacy policies  and practices, and individuals should have ready means of learning  about the use of personal information.  7.  Individual participation\u2014Individuals should have the following  rights: to know about the collection of personal information, to  access that information, to request correction, and to challenge the  denial of those rights.  8.  Accountability\u2014Individuals controlling the collection or use of  personal information should be accountable for taking steps to  ensure the implementation of these principles.", "The Fair Information Practices are not precise legal requirements. Rather,  they provide a framework of principles for balancing the need for privacy  with other public policy interests, such as national security, law  enforcement, and administrative efficiency. Striking that balance varies  among countries and among types of information (e.g., medical versus  employment information). TSA plans state that the Office of National Risk  Assessment will design CAPPS II \u201cto ensure that the highest level of air  nformation ractices are complied with while allowing  to achieve  its mission of protecting the U.S. transportation systems and the public  from potential foreign terrorists.\u201d", "When viewed in this larger context, TSA\u2019s plans reflect actions to address  each of these practices to at least some extent. For example, consistent  with the collection limitation practice, TSA plans to not collect  passengers\u2019 social security numbers from commercial data providers and  to destroy most passenger information shortly after the completion of the  travel itinerary. In addition, TSA plans to prohibit commercial data  providers from using the information they receive from TSA for  commercial purposes appear consistent with the use limitation practice.  Such a prohibition helps prevent the use of personal information in new  ways unless required by law or with the consent of the individual.", "However, to meet its evolving mission goals, TSA plans also appear to limit  the application of certain of these practices. For example, TSA plans to  exempt CAPPS II from the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements to maintain only  that information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to  accomplish a proper agency purpose. These plans reflect the  subordination of the use limitation and data quality practices to other  goals and raise concerns that TSA may collect and maintain more  information than is needed for the purpose of CAPPS II and perhaps use  this information for new purposes in the future. Further, TSA plans to limit  the application of the individual participation practice by prohibiting  passenger access to all personal information about them maintained in the  CAPPS II system  This raises concerns that inaccurate personal  information will remain uncorrected in and continue to be accessed by  CAPPS II. Because CAPPS II is still evolving, the extent to which the  objectives of each practice are fulfilled may change as the program  develops.", "Such actions to limit the application of the Fair Information Practices do  not violate federal requirements. Rather, they reflect TSA\u2019s efforts to  balance privacy with other public policy interests associated with the  mission goals of CAPPS II. TSA, however, has provided little explanation  of how they have determined that CAPPS II will ensure the highest level of  compliance with the Fair Information Practices possible. Further, TSA has  not provided its rationale for other significant plans including exempting  CAPPS II from certain Privacy Act requirements. The absence of such  explanations of these balancing decisions raise privacy concerns. As the  program evolves, it will ultimately be up to policymakers to determine if  TSA has struck an appropriate balance between protecting personal  privacy and other public policy interests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above, J.
