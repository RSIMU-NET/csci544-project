These high-expenditure beneficiaries are an extremely diverse population with varying needs. GAO found that the seven selected states identified or predicted high-expenditure Medicaid beneficiaries using statistics and other approaches. For example, states used risk scores, which estimate an individual beneficiary's expected health care expenditures relative to the average expenditures for beneficiaries in the group. Other approaches included examining service utilization data to identify statistical outliers and using diagnoses, service utilization and claims expenditure thresholds, or clinical judgment to identify or predict high-expenditure beneficiaries.", "To manage costs and ensure quality of care for high-expenditure beneficiaries, the seven selected states used care management and other strategies.", "Care management . All the selected states provided care management\u2014providing various types of assistance such as coordinating care across different providers to manage physical and mental health conditions more effectively\u2014for beneficiaries in their fee-for-service delivery systems. Five of the states also contracted with managed care organizations (MCO) to deliver services for a fixed payment and required the MCOs to ensure the provision of care management services to high-expenditure beneficiaries.", "Other strategies . Some of the seven selected states used additional strategies to manage care for high-expenditure beneficiaries. For example, Indiana officials described a program to restrict, or \u201clock in,\u201d a beneficiary who has demonstrated a pattern of high utilization to a single primary care provider, hospital, and pharmacy, if other efforts to change the beneficiary's high utilization were unsuccessful.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the Medicaid program at the federal level, offered optional tools and other resources to support states' efforts to identify or better manage high-expenditure beneficiaries. For example, CMS officials said states received access to resources and technical assistance on establishing health home programs\u2014which seek to better coordinate care for those with chronic conditions\u2014including how to focus on high-expenditure beneficiaries. CMS officials noted that they supported 23 states' and the District of Columbia's health home programs. CMS also offered several resources that, while not designed specifically to target high-expenditure beneficiaries, have been used to support states in identifying or better managing their care. For example, CMS's Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program offered targeted technical support to states' Medicaid agencies in building their data analytic capacity as they designed and implemented delivery system reforms, which could be used to identify high-expenditure beneficiaries. Officials in two selected states reported that these tools were beneficial for managing the health care costs associated with high-expenditure beneficiaries.

The Medicaid Health Home State Plan  Option, authorized under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,  allowed states to design health home programs to provide comprehensive  care coordination for Medicaid beneficiaries with chronic conditions.  CMS officials we spoke with said the states who chose the option  received access to resources including planning funds and technical  assistance from CMS. For example, CMS issued a brief illustrating how  states could focus their health home programs on high-expenditure  beneficiaries. CMS officials noted that they supported 23 states\u2019 and the  District of Columbia\u2019s health home programs. Among the state officials we  interviewed, South Dakota Medicaid officials said that when they were  establishing their health home program, CMS was helpful in connecting  them with other states that had created similar programs so that they  could learn from other states\u2019 experiences. South Dakota Medicaid  officials stated they would like CMS to continue to bring health home  program managers from several states together to discuss their  successes, challenges, and innovations.

For the Financial Alignment Initiative,  CMS oversaw efforts by states to implement improvements in Medicaid  service delivery aimed at achieving savings for both Medicare and  Medicaid, with one state we spoke with using the initiative to target high- expenditure beneficiaries. As noted earlier, Washington established its  Health Homes demonstration program for dually eligible beneficiaries in  association with the Financial Alignment Initiative. Washington targeted  the demonstration to high-cost, high-risk Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries  based on the principle that focusing intensive care coordination on  beneficiaries with the greatest need provided the greatest potential for  improved health outcomes and cost savings. Washington\u2019s Financial  Alignment Initiative demonstration was approved through 2020, and  Washington officials stated they are hoping to get an extension, because  it has yielded cost savings for both Medicaid and Medicare.

The Medicaid Innovation  Accelerator Program is funded by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Innovation and run by the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, both  within CMS. The goals of the program were to improve care for Medicaid  beneficiaries and reduce costs by supporting states in their ongoing  payment and delivery system reforms through targeted technical support.  The program offered participating states targeted technical support to  Medicaid agencies in building their data analytic capacity as they design  and implement delivery system reforms for high-expenditure  beneficiaries, one of the program\u2019s focus areas. The program worked  with five states on issues such as identifying and stratifying beneficiaries  with complex care needs and high costs, designing effective care  management strategies, and incorporating social determinants of health  into program design activities. In addition to working directly with five  states, the program also offered a national webinar series under the  broader topic of Medicaid Beneficiaries with Complex Care Needs and  High Costs. The webinar series covered a variety of topics, including a  webinar titled \u201cIdentification and Stratification of Medicaid Beneficiaries with Complex Care Needs and High Costs,\u201d which provided information  about different approaches to targeting and assessing the needs of this  population. Vermont Medicaid officials we spoke with said it would be  helpful to have more information about how social determinants of health  impact beneficiaries\u2019 ability to manage their own care.

Among the state Medicaid officials we interviewed, Nevada officials  mentioned participating in the Innovation Accelerator Program.", "State Data Resource Center. State Medicaid agencies have traditionally  been hampered in managing the Medicaid portion of care for dually  eligible beneficiaries, because they lacked data on the Medicare services  these beneficiaries receive, such as hospitalizations, physician visits,  prescription drugs, and skilled nursing facility stays. To address this  challenge, CMS established the State Data Resource Center to facilitate  state access to and use of Medicare data on dually eligible beneficiaries.  Through the program, states had access to technical advisors when  working with CMS Medicare data, which have allowed states to better  predict and identify high-expenditure dually eligible Medicaid  beneficiaries, CMS officials told us. The officials said the State Data  Resource Center provided states with learning opportunities through  webinars and monthly \u201cMedicare Data Workgroup\u201d calls, during which  states shared their data use experiences. CMS officials and CMS  contractors we spoke with said 29 states have received Medicare data,  including all 10 states that participated in the Financial Alignment  Initiative, though not all had projects specifically linked to high- expenditure Medicaid beneficiaries.
