In this report, GAO: (1) describes the status of payment and delivery models implemented and the resources used; (2) describes the center's use of model evaluations; and (3) examines the center's assessment of its own performance. GAO reviewed available documentation, such as model fact sheets and frequently asked questions, and evaluation reports for models that have been implemented.

Going forward, the Innovation Center indicated that the center plans to continue focusing on the use of voluntary participation models and to develop models in new areas, including prescription drugs, Medicare Advantage, mental and behavioral health, and program integrity. Through fiscal year 2016, the Innovation Center obligated $5.6 billion of its $10 billion appropriation for fiscal years 2011 through 2019.", "The Innovation Center has used evaluations of models (1) to inform the development of additional models, (2) to make changes to models as they are implemented, and (3) to recommend models for expansion. For example, Innovation Center officials noted that, for some instances where evaluations have shown reduced spending with maintained or improved quality of care, the center has developed new models that build upon the approaches of earlier models, but with adjustments intended to address reported limitations. In addition, the Innovation Center used evaluations to recommend two models to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary for certification for expansion. According to CMS officials, a model evaluation and a certification for expansion differ in that a model evaluation assesses the impact of a delivery and payment approach for model participants only, while a certification for expansion assesses the future impact on program spending more broadly across all beneficiaries, payers, and providers who would be affected by the expanded model. As a result, the Office of the Actuary used the results of the evaluation and other information, such as Medicare claims data and published studies, to certify the expansion of both models.", "To assess the center's overall performance, the Innovation Center established performance goals and related measures and reported meeting its targets for some goals in 2015, the latest year for which data were available (see table below).", "Innovation Center officials told GAO that the center also recently developed a methodology to estimate a forecasted return on investment for its model portfolio.

At the same time, studies have found that higher levels  of spending do not reliably lead to enhanced quality of care. The Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), has sought to both reduce spending and  improve quality of care for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid,  and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) by testing new ways  for delivering and paying for health care services.

According to officials, the  2016 decrease in obligations for model programs was due in part to some  of the earlier, expensive models ending and to newer models being less  costly than the older models. Officials noted, for example, that a number  of newer models incorporated basic program infrastructure used in  previously implemented models, which allowed for reduced model costs.  Officials also indicated that the decrease in obligations may be due to  newer models using payment approaches that are funded by the  Medicare Trust Fund, rather than funded by the Innovation Center\u2019s  dedicated appropriation. The center\u2019s obligations for both innovation  support and administration increased from around $20 million for each  category in fiscal year 2011 to about $163 million for innovation support  and $119 million for administration in fiscal year 2016.

If the total spending for Medicare services during an episode  was lower than the target price, participating hospitals would receive payments in  addition to the normal fee-for-service payments. If the total spending for Medicare  services during an episode was higher than the target price, participating hospitals would  have to reimburse Medicare. Participants could select up to 48 different clinical episodes  under the model.   The evaluation of BPCI Model 2 found that orthopedic surgery episodes\u2014of which  approximately 90 percent were hip and knee joint replacement surgeries\u2014may have  resulted in reduced program spending and improved quality of care. However, the  evaluation also identified limitations affecting those results. For example, the target prices  for hip and knee replacement surgeries did not account for potential differences in  Medicare spending between elective surgeries and surgeries required after a fracture. As  a result of this limitation, hospitals could attempt to control spending by limiting the  number of episodes associated with higher cost beneficiaries (i.e., those requiring  surgery due to a fracture).  In part to address the design issue identified under BPCI Model 2, Innovation Center  officials told us they developed the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR)  model. Implemented in April 2016, the CJR model tests the same general delivery and  payment approach used in BPCI Model 2, but focuses specifically on hip and knee joint  replacement surgical episodes and adjusts the target price to account for the higher  spending related to hip and knee joint replacement surgeries following a fracture. As of  March 1, 2018, no evaluations of the CJR model have been publicly released.", "The Innovation Center has also used the results from evaluations as one  way to improve the operational and participant support for new models.  According to officials, evaluations have helped them identify lessons  learned regarding support systems, such as which types of systems work  well with which types of models, and then the center incorporated those  lessons when designing the systems for new models. For example,  officials noted that the experience with the learning system from the  Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) models informed the  learning system for the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement  (CJR) model. The lessons learned helped the Innovation Center better  identify where participants would need additional support and the learning  activities\u2014such as webinars and implementation guides\u2014to provide the  needed support during the early stages of model implementation.

Officials also identified changes to operational and participant support  systems, which have included changes to the timing of participant data  reporting, revisions to how data are collected from participants, and  changes to the way learning materials are delivered to participants.

As of September 30, 2016, the Innovation Center  reported that four section 1115A model tests have met these criteria (see  table 4).", "Goal 3: Accelerate the spread of successful practices and models.  For this goal, the first performance measure focuses on the number of  states developing and implementing a health system transformation and  payment reform plan. The second measure focuses on increasing the  percentage of active model participants who are involved in Innovation  Center or related learning activities. As shown in table 5, the Innovation  Center reported meeting its target for the first measure for both fiscal  years 2015 and 2016, but not meeting its target for the second measure.  For the second measure, the Innovation Center noted in its report to  Congress that although the results for fiscal year 2016 showed a slight  decrease in overall participation in Innovation Center or related learning  activities, the majority of models performed higher than their individual  targets. Several models underperformed, however, bringing down the  overall percentage rate.", "In addition to the Goal 3 performance measures, the Innovation Center  identifies two related contextual indicators\u2014which according to officials  are measures that provide supporting information to help understand  trends or other information related to the goal. The first contextual  indicator provides a snapshot of Medicare beneficiary participation at a  given point in time for all models operational for more than 6 months. In  fiscal year 2016, CMS reported that over 3.6 million Medicare fee-for- service beneficiaries participated in models, representing approximately 9  percent of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The second contextual  indicator provides information to help understand the level of interest and  participation among providers in the Innovation Center\u2019s model portfolio.  In fiscal year 2016, the Center estimates that 103,291 providers  participated in Innovation Center payment and service delivery models.", "In addition to the three goals established by the Innovation Center, CMS  has established an agency-wide goal related to the center\u2019s performance.  In 2015, CMS announced goals to help drive Medicare, and the health  care system at large, toward rewarding the quality of care instead of the  quantity of care provided to beneficiaries. One of these goals was to shift  Medicare health care payments from volume to value using alternative  payment models established under the Innovation Center. This agency- wide goal has one performance measure, which is to increase the  percentage of Medicare fee-for-service payments tied to alternative  payment models, such as ACOs or bundled payment arrangements. As  shown in table 6, CMS reported meeting its target for 2015 and 2016.", "Looking forward, officials told us that the Innovation Center has  developed a methodology to estimate a forecasted return on investment  for the model portfolio, and is in the early stages of refining the  methodology and applying it broadly across the portfolio in 2018. As part  of the development efforts, the Innovation Center expects to utilize  standard investment measures used in the public and private sectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment.
