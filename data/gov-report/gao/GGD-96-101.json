Expected to total over $1 trillion in fiscal year 1995, health care spending will consume almost 15 percent of the gross national product, an increase from just over 12 percent in 1990. The amount of fraud within the health care system is, by its nature, impossible to accurately determine. We have previously reported that 10 percent of all health care expenditures may be lost to fraud and abuse.Similarly, industry estimates have placed the annual losses due solely to fraud at somewhere between 3 and 10 percent of all health care expenditures (between $30 billion and $100 billion based on estimated fiscal 1995 expenditures). By whatever estimate, this represents a significant monetary drain on our health care system.", "Health care fraud can take many forms, reach all facets of the industry, and be perpetrated by persons both within and outside the health care industry. A recent report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for example, notes that vulnerabilities to fraud exist throughout the entire health care system, and patterns of fraud are so pervasive that systemic criminal activity is accepted as a \u201cway of doing business\u201d in many segments of the health care industry. A 1995 Department of Justice (DOJ) report on health care fraud states that fraud is being perpetrated not only by individual physicians, but also by public corporations, medical equipment dealers, laboratories, hospitals, nursing homes, and individuals who provide no health care at all but prey upon the system with fraudulent scams. As the DOJ report goes on to note, everyone pays the price for health care fraud, as reflected by higher insurance premiums, increased costs for medical services and equipment, and greater expenditures for Medicare and other public health care programs.", "Successful health care fraud prosecutions illustrate the types of fraudulent activities taking place. Ranging from simple schemes to complex conspiracies, some frauds have even put lives at risk. As described in the 1995 DOJ report, examples of fraudulent activities that have been federally prosecuted include the following: \u2022 An optometrist defrauded Medicare and private insurance companies of over $1.5 million simply by billing for services that were unnecessary or not rendered. \u2022 A husband and wife set up a fraudulent network of offshore corporations and entities, which they used to defraud a private insurance company as well as employer insurance networks in several states. This scheme left policyholders with approximately $6 million in unpaid medical and reinsurance claims. \u2022 A medical supplier fraudulently submitted false statements to the Food and Drug Administration about the efficacy of heart catheters. Three persons died, and 22 others required emergency heart bypass surgery when these devices were distributed to hospitals and physicians.", "We have previously reported that several serious fraud problems are facing public and private payers. First, large financial losses to the health care system can occur as a result of even a single scheme. Second, fraudulent providers can bill insurers with relative ease. Third, efforts to prosecute and recover losses from those involved in the schemes are costly; even convictions often do not result in the recovery of losses. Finally, fraudulent schemes can be quickly replicated throughout the health care system. Moreover, as discussed below, a multiplicity of health care payers\u2014each with its own operating policies and subject to various enforcement agencies\u2014further complicates health care fraud enforcement efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Size and Complexity of Health Care System Complicates Enforcement Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Of the estimated $884 billion spent on health care in 1993, about 44 percent was paid with public sector dollars, and 56 percent was paid with private sector dollars. Federal health insurance programs\u2014such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, the Federal Employees\u2019 Health Benefit Program, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services\u2014collectively accounted for almost three-quarters of all public health care expenditures. Private health insurance\u2014which includes the various Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans, a host of other private health insurance companies, and many employers who self-insure\u2014accounted for about 60 percent of all private sector expenditures.", "Public and private payers in the current health care system number over 1,000. Generally, each payer has its own system of processing health care claims and reimbursing providers. Payers may have different rules, reimbursement policies, claim forms, multiple identification numbers, coding systems, and billing procedures. When combined with the sheer size of the health care industry\u2014an estimated 4 billion health claims are processed annually\u2014this complex system of payers presents considerable challenges for those organizations responsible for detecting and pursuing health care fraud.", "Within this complex system, various federal enforcement agencies have responsibility for investigating health care fraud. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General has primary responsibility for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General has primary responsibility for the Veterans Health Administration, the Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Service has primary responsibility for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, and the Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General has primary responsibility for the Federal Employees\u2019 Health Benefits Program. The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under existing federal criminal statutes, have broader authority to investigate fraud in any public or private program. Other agencies that are involved in health care fraud enforcement include the Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of Labor.", "In addition to federal enforcement agencies, states also have health care fraud enforcement responsibility. Regarding Medicaid, for example, while HHS is responsible for oversight of the program, the agency has largely delegated primary investigative enforcement responsibility to state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, which are predominately funded through federal grants. Regarding private insurance, some states have established insurance fraud bureaus that investigate health care fraud; in other states, the department of insurance has a fraud unit that investigates fraud. While these state agencies can often pursue administrative and civil penalties for health care fraud, most criminal enforcement authority is in the hands of local prosecutors and attorneys general.", "The private sector is also active in health care fraud enforcement. Private insurers have established active anti-fraud programs and special investigative units that work with a wide range of public law enforcement agencies to investigate fraud. These units may report fraud cases to federal or state agencies with health care fraud enforcement responsibility. In addition, a group of private sector health insurers and public sector law enforcement agencies has established the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA), which represents a cooperative effort to prevent health care fraud and improve capabilities to detect, investigate, and prosecute such fraud. The NHCAA conducts anti-fraud education seminars, provides a forum for members to share information on fraudulent schemes, and assists law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud.", "As shown in figure 1.1, while public sector health care fraud is primarily the responsibility of federal enforcement and program agencies, private sector fraud can be pursued by both state and federal enforcement agencies. In some states, private insurers are required by law to report suspected fraud to state enforcement agencies, while reports to federal enforcement agencies are optional at the discretion of the insurer. In addition to the reporting of suspected fraud from insurers to federal and state authorities, fraud-related information can also be shared between federal and state authorities. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOJ officials told us that the Department has placed increasing emphasis on working with the Medicaid Fraud Control Units and NHCAA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Sharing Is Critical to Effective Enforcement Efforts", "paragraphs": ["\u201cIn the 1970s, we found that we were largely dealing with individual providers who were involved in relatively uncomplicated schemes, such as filing false claims which resulted in a few thousand dollars of damage to the Medicare program. Today, it is more common to see cases involving groups of people who defraud the Government. Some of the schemes are relatively complex, often involving the use of sophisticated computer techniques, complicated business arrangements, and multiple locations across state lines. These crimes can cause losses in the tens of millions of dollars to Medicare and Medicaid, as well as to other public and private health insurance programs.\u201d", "Along with the increasing complexity of health care fraud, law enforcement and regulatory agencies and insurers have recognized the importance of coordinating their enforcement efforts and exploring methods for sharing health care fraud information. A health care reform bill introduced before the U.S. Senate in November of 1993 identified a \u201cnational need\u201d to coordinate health care fraud-related information and went on to state that control of fraud and abuse in health care services warrants greater efforts of coordination than those that can be undertaken by individual states or the various federal, state, and local law enforcement programs.", "A coordinated enforcement effort has to involve not only public law enforcement agencies, but also the private sector. Given their position of having daily interaction with health providers, private insurers often possess more information about a provider\u2019s activities than state and federal agencies. This position, coupled with their own incentive to reduce costs, has made insurers another source of information for government investigators and prosecutors.", "Because many insurers have established special investigative units that pursue fraud, these private sector resources can be used to leverage existing public sector investigative resources. The insurance industry has developed sophisticated methods for detecting fraud, and development of contacts with the industry can provide a valuable source of fraud case referrals to the federal government. For example, the FBI recently reported that on the basis of fraud referrals by several private insurance company investigative units, government investigators were able to identify a medical billing company that defrauded $1.5 million from insurance companies across the country. Moreover, because fraudulent schemes often target public and private programs simultaneously, an active anti-fraud enforcement effort involving private insurers may lead to the discovery of additional fraud involving public sector health programs.", "In recent years, there have been various proposals designed to enhance information sharing among federal, state, and private entities involved in health care fraud enforcement. Some proposals, for example, have called for federal immunity legislation to provide protection for persons who report suspected fraud. The purpose of such immunity laws is to encourage insurers and private individuals to report suspected fraud to law enforcement agencies by protecting the individuals from subsequent civil actions. Other proposals have called for establishment of a national, centralized database of health care fraud-related information. The purpose of a centralized database would be to provide public and private sector fraud investigators with easy access to information about health care fraud activity nationwide and to enhance coordination of investigative efforts among insurers and law enforcement agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In an October 6, 1993, letter, the former Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Information, Justice, Transportation, and Agriculture, Committee on Government Operations, asked us to broadly examine health care fraud enforcement issues.

Private sector contacts\u2014representing industry, professional, and special interest organizations\u2014included the American Medical Association, the Health Insurance Association of America, the National Insurance Crime Bureau, and NHCAA.

To the extent practical with just four states, we wanted the selections to reflect a range of immunity and/or anti-fraud enforcement environments. For example, at the time we made the selections: \u2022 Maryland had no state immunity law protecting persons who reported suspected health care fraud, while Massachusetts\u2019 immunity law protected only reports made to the state fraud bureau. Florida and Texas both had broader immunity laws that protected disclosures made to both federal and state agencies.\u2022 Florida and Texas both had state fraud units within the Department of Insurance; Maryland and Massachusetts had independent or stand-alone fraud bureaus. Further, an FBI official told us that FBI field offices in these four states were among the most active in private sector health care fraud investigations.", "In visiting each state, we met with officials from various federal and state prosecutive, investigative, and regulatory agencies\u2014U.S. Attorneys offices, FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service field offices, state departments of insurance and fraud bureaus, and state attorneys general. We also met with general counsel and special investigative unit officials at selected private insurance companies in these four states. As appendix I shows, our total number of contacts in these 4 states included 12 federal offices, 6 state offices, and 8 private insurance companies. To obtain additional insurance company perspectives, we also visited five national insurers at their headquarters located in Connecticut and Illinois, respectively. Thus, in total, we visited 13 private insurance companies.", "At each organization visited, we interviewed those officials responsible for anti-fraud enforcement efforts. Regarding the immunity issue, we obtained information and views about (1) how fraud-related information is being shared between investigative and prosecutive entities, (2) what impact immunity laws (or the absence of such laws) have had on the willingness of individuals to report suspected fraud, and (3) whether a federal immunity law is needed to enhance information sharing. Regarding the centralized database issue, we obtained information about (1) how computerized databases are being used in investigating fraud; (2) whether a national, centralized database is needed to enhance enforcement efforts; and (3) what factors should be considered in establishing such a database.

We identified no federal law that protects persons providing health care fraud-related information to law enforcement agencies. However, there are some related immunity provisions on the federal level. Regarding Medicare and Medicaid, for example, current federal statutory law providing immunity from liability is limited to persons reporting information to peer review contractors about Medicare and Medicaid health care services. This immunity protection is further limited in that it does not apply to persons reporting fraud-related information to federal authorities, such as HHS, the FBI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. It also does not apply to persons who report suspected health care fraud involving private sector insurance, even if the suspected fraud is reported to a federal agency. While most states have enacted immunity laws that protect persons who report suspected health care fraud more broadly than current federal law, the laws vary considerably. For example, some state laws protect sharing of suspected fraud information with any federal or state law enforcement authority, whereas some states protect information sharing only with certain state authorities.", "In recent years, various health care anti-fraud proposals (some included in health care reform bills) have been introduced by the administration and Congress to, among other matters, provide a broader federal immunity statute. The health care reform bills were not enacted, however, and at the time of our review, one health care anti-fraud bill (S. 1088)\u2014which was awaiting congressional consideration\u2014would provide immunity protection more broadly than current federal law. The health insurance and medical industry associations we contacted supported the concept of a federal immunity law. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of the federal and state government fraud investigators and prosecutors and 12 of 13 insurance company representatives we interviewed supported a federal immunity law. In fact, many of the individuals we spoke with thought that federal immunity protection should be broader than the immunity proposed under S. 1088."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Immunity Protects Persons Who Report Suspected Fraud", "paragraphs": ["Broadly viewed, public policy supports both encouraging private entities to participate in the investigation and prosecution of fraud and providing protection to innocent people against unsubstantiated allegations made in bad faith or with malice. That is, given the public interest in crime prevention, reasonable private participation in the investigation and prosecution of crime is a desirable objective. Immunity statutes are one way of encouraging this objective. On the other hand, concerns have been raised about the need to incorporate safeguards to provide individuals with protection against bad faith allegations. Safeguards that have been considered include requirements governing the specificity and credibility of reported information and provisions giving individuals legal recourse against bad faith allegations that could seriously damage an individual\u2019s life and livelihood if publicly disclosed.", "Immunity statutes represent part of the general public policy to encourage private involvement in the prosecution of crime by protecting persons against civil claims subsequently arising from insurance fraud investigations. For instance, the reporting of an individual suspected of fraud may result in the named, suspected party filing a civil suit against the reporter claiming defamation of character. Immunity statutes typically include limiting language, such as \u201cin the absence of malice or bad faith,\u201d which allows an individual claiming defamation the opportunity to show that the reporting party intended to harm the individual. However, where there is an applicable immunity statute and the individual claiming defamation is not able to show malice or bad faith, the reporting party is provided protection from these types of lawsuits.", "It is important to note that a number of civil claims can be raised against insurers stemming from fraud investigations and, in most cases, there is no way to prevent an aggrieved party from filing a civil lawsuit against an individual who reports suspected fraud. An immunity statute does, however, make it more difficult for a claimant to prevail. For example, in a 1992 civil action in Ohio, an individual brought action for damages against a health insurer for reporting suspected fraud to the state insurance department. The focus of the case was whether the plaintiff could recover from the insurer for defamation. The federal district court held that the insurer faced no civil liability for reporting suspected fraud because Ohio law provides immunity to persons who furnish information\u2014in good faith and without malice or fraud\u2014to the Ohio Department of Insurance.

Composed primarily of health care practitioners from within a geographical area, these organizations perform quality assurance and utilization reviews of health care providers seeking reimbursement for their Medicare services. If a peer review organization determines that a practitioner or provider has persisted in violating his obligation to provide services that (1) are medically necessary, (2) meet professionally recognized standards of care, and (3) are cost-effective, the reviewer may recommend that the practitioner or provider be excluded from the Medicare program.

However, to make this protection effective, Congress should consider the addition of a provision, modeled on Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that requires a person to plead with specificity the facts that constitute malice or bad faith in order to invoke this exception to immunity.\u201d", "In 1993 testimony before Congress, the NHCAA Executive Director stated that before forwarding a case for investigation and prosecution, insurers always have to consider the probability of lawsuits for defamation, slander, and malicious prosecution, and that these lawsuits, even if they are completely without merit, are at best very costly to the insurer.During our review, the NHCAA Executive Director told us that encouraging insurers to report fraud is important because the extent of health care fraud is increasing. He noted that, historically, insurers would simply write off fraud and pass the losses on to policyholders because fraud was not deemed to be that significant a problem. He added that some insurers saw no alternative to such write-offs because health care fraud was not considered to be a priority of law enforcement. However, the Executive Director said that insurers now have increased their anti-fraud efforts because they recognize that health care fraud is widespread and because law enforcement (federal and state) has taken a significant interest in investigating and prosecuting such fraud.

The supervisory agent also commented that federal immunity legislation may encourage insurers to report suspected health care fraud. As support for this opinion, he cited his experience in investigating bank fraud cases and explained that leads or referrals from banks increased after federal immunity legislation was strengthened. Federal officials at several of the field offices we visited also said that a federal law would be beneficial because it would provide a standard level of protection in all states.

In one of the states we visited, an FBI supervisory agent told us that the need for a federal immunity law possibly was being overstated by insurance company executives.

One company\u2019s investigator said that S. 1088 might be problematic because the FBI does not have enough resources to address the additional referrals the agency would likely receive.

Representatives from one insurance company told us that the quality of evidence will improve, resulting in more criminal prosecutions for health care fraud offenses. These representatives explained that by working cooperatively together, insurers will be able to show that multiple insurers were defrauded under the same scheme, and this will make it easier to prove the criminal element of intent (i.e., the suspects knowingly defrauded the insurers).

These referrals come from both formal sources (e.g., government agencies, insurers) and informal sources (e.g., fraud hotlines, beneficiaries). The investigative agencies review these referrals and, on the basis of relatively limited information, select the most promising leads for assignment to an investigator. Because suspected fraud referrals typically have not yet been thoroughly investigated, they involve information that is less certain than information about either ongoing investigations or final adverse actions. There is a federal precedent for the creation of a fraud referral database. Such a database has been established at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to obtain and track information about suspected financial institution fraud.", "Officials at 8 of the 31 federal, state, and insurance company offices we visited suggested the creation of a health care fraud referral database as a useful tool to enhance health care fraud enforcement efforts. Many of the respondents to our survey of state insurance commissioners also supported creation of a fraud referral database. Specifically, 22 of the 29 survey respondents who indicated they investigated health care fraud during 1994 favored creation of a fraud referral database.

An insurance company investigator also noted that encouraging private insurers to report suspected fraud to a national database would allow government investigators to better identify fraudulent schemes involving multiple private insurers and\u2014since these schemes tend to involve both private and public sector insurers simultaneously\u2014would very likely also lead to the discovery of more public sector fraud. According to an Assistant U.S. Attorney, in order to be most useful, a suspected fraud referral database would have to include (1) a requirement for all insurers to report suspected fraud, along with a grant of immunity for doing so; (2) a specified reporting format; and (3) a designated entity to centrally collect and maintain the information.", "Concerns were raised, however, about the feasibility of establishing a fraud referral database. For example, unlike the banking and savings and loan industries, the insurance industry is subject principally to state, rather than federal, regulation. One FBI supervisory agent noted that access to suspected fraud referrals was helpful in fighting bank fraud, and a database of health care fraud referrals could help investigators initiate health care fraud cases. The agent said that to encourage private insurers to actively refer suspected fraud, ideally federal law should require mandatory reporting of such fraud and provide immunity for doing so. However, the agent believes that because there is no federal regulatory entity governing private insurers, such a law may not be possible.", "According to an insurance company official, absent such a reporting requirement, private insurers may not feel compelled to report suspected fraud to a national referral database, thus making it less comprehensive in scope and, therefore, less useful to investigators. Also, many states already require insurers to report suspected fraud to state agencies (see app. II). According to a U.S. Postal Service investigator, in those states with suspected fraud reporting requirements, an additional federal reporting requirement might be viewed by some private insurers as being unnecessary.", "In addition, because of the sensitive nature of suspected fraud referral information, several officials noted that security for and access to a database of suspected fraud referrals would likely be a critical issue. According to one FBI supervisory agent, some of the information in a suspected referral database might be nothing more than unsupported allegations, and the release or misuse of such information might ruin an innocent doctor\u2019s reputation or career.
