However, IRS has since moved away from that approach. IRS officials now believe there are limited benefits to establishing goals because IRS cannot control all aspects of compliance and updated methodologies may cause fluctuations in the estimates. IRS does, however, have an impact on taxpayers' compliance through its service and enforcement programs. Without long-term, quantitative goals for improving voluntary compliance, it will be difficult for IRS to determine the success of its compliance efforts and adjust its approaches.", "The Internal Revenue Manual states IRS needs to measure taxpayer compliance and other factors so compliance information and tools can be improved. IRS uses tax gap data to study compliance behaviors and update computer formulas designed to identify tax returns with a high likelihood of noncompliance. Yet IRS has not documented a comprehensive strategy that shows how it intends to use NRP data to update compliance strategies. Officials said the uses of NRP are widely known from general documentation about NRP. Without developing and documenting a strategy for using the NRP data to update compliance strategies, IRS may not fully leverage the compliance data or allocate enforcement resources in the most cost-effective manner, and it may be difficult for Congress and others to understand the merits of what they are being asked to fund."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS re-establish goals for improving voluntary compliance and develop and document a strategy that outlines how it will use its data to update compliance strategies to address the tax gap.

Analyzing  the data can also help identify changes that could be made to tax laws  and regulations that may improve compliance.", "In April 2016, IRS released its most recent tax gap estimate. IRS  estimated that taxpayers should have paid an average of about $2.5  trillion dollars per year in federal taxes for tax years 2008 to 2010. IRS  also estimated that taxpayers paid approximately $2.04 trillion voluntarily  and on time for those years, on average, leaving $458 billion in unpaid  taxes per year. However, IRS estimates that through late payments and  enforcement actions it eventually will collect an additional $52 billion on  average for those years, leaving the average net tax gap at $406 billion  for 2008 to 2010, as shown in figure 1.", "The tax gap estimate is an aggregate estimate of the five types of taxes  that IRS administers\u2014individual income, corporation income,  employment, estate, and excise taxes.

However, if IRS discovers these types of income over the course of  an audit, it could be included in the tax gap estimates. In general, refund  fraud related to identity theft would not be included in the tax gap estimate  because it does not involve evading a tax liability. The tax gap includes  unintentional errors as well as intentional evasion, such as intentionally  underreporting income, intentionally overreporting expenses, and  engaging in abusive tax shelters or frivolous tax schemes.", "There is no single approach to estimating all of the components of the tax  gap. IRS uses NRP examinations of a stratified, random sample of tax  returns along with statistical modeling to produce estimates of  noncompliance for the population of individual income tax return filers.  Other areas of the tax gap are estimated using payment data or other  statistical models. Each approach IRS uses is subject to non-sampling  error and the areas of the estimate that are samples are subject to  additional sampling errors. The uncertainty of the estimates is not readily  captured by standard errors that typically accompany estimates based on  sample data. For that reason, IRS does not report standard errors,  confidence intervals, and statistical comparisons across years.", "Prior to the 2008\u20132010 estimate, IRS had released two other tax gap  estimates that used data from NRP examinations: (1) a tax year 2001 tax  gap estimate that was released in February 2007 and (2) a tax year 2006  tax gap estimate that was released in December 2011. As shown in  figure 2, the gross tax gap estimate has increased, in nominal terms, from  $345 billion for 2001 to $458 billion, on average, for 2008\u20132010, an  increase of $113 billion or about 33 percent. However, when we adjusted  for inflation (using fiscal year 2016 dollars), the gross tax gap estimates  amount to $460 billion in 2001, $530 billion in 2006, and $509 billion in  2008\u20132010. The inflation-adjusted gross tax gap increased by about 11  percent from 2001 to 2008\u20132010; however, the 2008\u20132010 estimate is  slightly lower, by about 4 percent, than the 2006 estimate.", "Over the three estimates, the voluntary compliance rate (VCR)\u2014the  percentage of owed tax for a given year that is paid voluntarily and  timely\u2014has decreased slightly from 83.1 percent for 2006 to 81.7, on  average, for 2008\u20132010. IRS also estimated the VCR and distribution of  tax liability for each component of the tax gap. Generally, employment  taxes have the highest estimated compliance rates while individual  income and estate taxes have the lowest estimated compliance rates.  There was a decrease in the VCR for individual income tax from 79  percent for tax year 2001 to 74 percent in the recent 2008\u20132010 estimate.  According to IRS, this decline, along with the individual income tax\u2019s  increase in the share of liability, contributes to the slight decline in the  overall VCR.", "The amount of the tax gap that IRS estimated it would collect through  enforcement efforts and late payments varied across the three estimates.  In 2001, IRS estimated it would collect $55 billion and that figure would  increase by $10 billion, to $65 billion in 2006. However, for the 2008\u2013 2010 tax gap estimate, the enforced collections or late payments  decreased by $13 billion per year, on average, from the 2006 estimate, to  $52 billion. According to IRS, the methodology used to calculate prior  estimates may have been too optimistic, resulting in an overstatement of  as much as 25 percent. Additionally, IRS stated that the economic  downturn in 2008 reduced the total tax liability from which IRS could  collect revenue over this period.", "However, differences in the tax gap estimates across years may not all be  attributed to changes in taxpayer behavior (voluntary compliance) or IRS  enforcement activities. According to IRS, the tax gap estimates have  increased in part because IRS included some new tax gap components  and updated some methods, which it believes increased the  comprehensiveness and accuracy of the estimates. IRS reported that  changes in economic activity and changes in tax law and administration  also contribute to differences in tax gap estimates over time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enforcement of Tax Laws and GAO\u2019s High-Risk List", "paragraphs": ["In our 2017 High-Risk Report we continued to include Enforcement of Tax  Laws as a high-risk area.

IRS  enforcement of the tax laws helps fund the U.S. government by collecting  revenue from noncompliant taxpayers and, perhaps more importantly,  promoting voluntary compliance by giving taxpayers confidence that  others are paying their fair share. However, IRS still faces challenges to  its capacity for implementing new initiatives and carrying out ongoing  enforcement and taxpayer service programs under an uncertain  budgetary environment.", "Given the estimated size of the tax gap, even modest reductions would  yield significant financial benefits for the country. We have made  numerous recommendations over time to help IRS, the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury), and Congress address tax noncompliance.  Nonetheless, as we have reported in the past, closing the entire gap is  not feasible since it could entail more burdensome record keeping or  reporting than the public is willing to accept or more resources than IRS is  able to commit.

This includes income from sole  proprietors, which accounted for the largest share of individual income  tax underreporting, as shown in table 1. Most business related income tax  return items also had high net misreporting percentages, which is the sum  of the net misreported amount divided by the sum of the absolute values of the amounts that should have been reported, as a percentage. To  show additional detail on aspects of the tax gap, we conducted some  additional analysis on selected line items of the individual NRP data,  which is presented in appendix II.", "As we have previously reported, the extent to which individual income tax  taxpayers accurately report their income is closely aligned to the amount  of income that is reported to them and to IRS by third parties. For  example, according to 2008\u20132010 IRS data, taxpayers misreported over  half of the types of income for which there is little or no third-party  information reporting, such as business income. In contrast, when  employers withhold taxes and report the wages and salaries to  employees and IRS through Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2),  there is better compliance. As shown in figure 4, 1 percent of these types  of income were misreported while nearly 99 percent were accurately  reported on individual income tax returns. Similarly, taxpayers  misreported less than 10 percent of income for which banks and other  financial institutions provided information returns (Forms 1099) to account  holders and IRS that show taxpayers\u2019 annual income from some types of  investments.", "Generally, new requirements on third parties to submit information returns  would require statutory changes. We have previously identified additional  information reporting opportunities as well as improvements that IRS  could make on its own to existing forms and how it uses them. For  example, we suggested in August 2008 that Congress may wish to make  all taxpayers with rental real estate activity subject to the same  information reporting requirements as other taxpayers operating a trade  or business; however, no legislative action has been taken on this  suggestion. We recommended in August 2010 that IRS require  mortgage-secured property addresses to be reported on other forms  (Forms 982 and 1099-C) to help IRS detect taxpayers who fail to pay  taxes on certain forgiven mortgage debts. Legislative and executive  actions have been taken consistent with our recommendation. However,  IRS has not revised two forms to collect specific information from  taxpayers and lenders concerning the amount of forgiven debt attributable  to a principle residence and the locations of a taxpayer\u2019s principle  residence.", "For items subject to substantial third-party information reporting, IRS is  able to use automated processes to address noncompliance. The  automated underreporter program, through which IRS matches amounts  reported on returns with amounts reported on information returns  submitted by third parties, is one such process. This computer matching  program allows IRS to identify discrepancies between tax returns and  information returns and propose automatic changes to taxpayers.", "For items with little to no third-party information reporting, IRS has to rely  on more resource-intensive methods, such as correspondence or face-to- face examinations, to address noncompliance. While these examinations  may be started by reviewing specific line items, they may also be  expanded to cover other areas of the tax returns if there are indications of  misreporting in areas of the return not previously identified.

The self-employment component is  estimated from IRS\u2019s NRP individual income tax data. However, IRS  lacks NRP data for other components of employment tax.

We reported that although the  examinations for the study were completed, IRS had not developed  formal plans to analyze the results to (1) identify areas of noncompliance,  (2) address such noncompliance, or (3) update its employment tax gap  estimate. According to IRS officials, they had not developed formal  plans due to competing research priorities and limited resources and  because the NRP results had not yet been finalized.

Generally, IRS  officials consider those components of the tax gap estimate that are  based on the most current data (2008\u20132010 data) to be more robust.  However, as shown in table 6, IRS recognizes that some component  estimates of the tax gap estimate are more uncertain than others, in part  because some component estimates rely on older data and it is inherently  difficult to estimate some types of noncompliance. IRS has no estimates  for some areas of the tax gap.", "According to IRS officials, IRS has higher amounts of confidence in all of the underpayment components, because they are based on data  from systems that can distinguish enforcement and late payments  from other payments (IRS has the most confidence in these  components);  the individual income nonfiling component, because it is based on a  new methodology combining two methods that incorporate  improvements to the methods used in prior estimates;  the individual income underreporting component, because it is  primarily based on adjusted NPR examination data, which is a  statistically representative sample of individual tax returns; and  the corporation underreporting component, because it is based on  operational examination data, adjusted for selection bias.", "IRS has a lesser amount of confidence in  the estate nonfiling and underreporting data, because they are  forecasts updating estimates based on assumptions made in studies  completed in 2000; and  the withholding taxes (FICA and FUCA) part of the employment  underreporting data, because the data are partially a forecast based  on data from an older compliance study.", "The methodologies used to develop the component estimates differ by  component, resulting in a mix of statistical sample and operational-based  data being used, as well as forecasts from earlier estimates. IRS is  therefore unable to calculate confidence intervals for any of the tax gap  estimates.

This regression-based model controls for variables that  could affect the amount of underreporting IRS examiners detected. IRS  uses this adjustment because it knows its examiners do not detect all  underreported income during examinations, and therefore it adjusts the  NRP data to account for such undetected income when estimating the tax  gap.

Since the tax gap estimates are only updated every few years,  Treasury and IRS officials said there was no way for Treasury or IRS to  show improvements or declines in meeting the goal on a quarterly basis  or over the 2-year goal term.

For example, a downturn in the economy would  likely result in less tax needing to be paid, but it might also cause some  taxpayers to comply less than they otherwise would. Further, separating  those two effects would be difficult, particularly given the unobserved  nature of most noncompliance. Finally, IRS officials stated other factors,  such as IRS services, enforcement efforts, evolving social norms, or  changes in legislation, may affect the overall compliance rate.", "Although IRS may not have full control over all of the factors that affect  voluntary compliance, it does have an impact on taxpayer\u2019s compliance  through its service and enforcement programs. Furthermore, IRS is not  alone in not having full control over the results it seeks to achieve. A  number of methods can be used to map or model the causal relationships  among the inputs, processes, and outputs produced by various strategies  and the forces that influence achievement of outcomes, such as results  mapping and logic modeling. Recognizing that outside influences may  present risks or challenges to achieving outcomes, OMB Circular Number  A-11 states that while agencies cannot mitigate all risks related to  achieving strategic objectives and performance goals, they should  identify, measure, and assess challenges related to mission delivery, to  the extent possible.", "We have previously reported that setting long-term quantitative goals for  IRS offers several benefits. First, compliance goals coupled with  periodic measurements of compliance levels would provide IRS with a  better basis for determining to what extent its various service and  enforcement efforts contribute to compliance. Second, long-term,  quantitative goals would help IRS consider new strategies to improve  compliance, especially since these strategies could take several years to  implement. Third, focusing on intended results can promote strategic and  disciplined management decisions that are more likely to be effective  because managers who use fact-based performance analysis are better  able to target areas most in need of improvement and to select  appropriate interventions. Fourth, agency accountability can be enhanced  when both agency management and external stakeholders\u2014such as  Congress\u2014can assess an agency\u2019s progress toward meeting its goals.", "Likewise, a survey of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development countries and other advanced economies found that some  governments are paying increased attention to estimating tax gaps for  their major types of taxes. Several countries shared their quantitative  goals for reducing the tax gap or increasing their tax revenue with the  survey. For example, Denmark set a target to ensure that the tax gap  does not exceed 2 percent of estimated total tax liability.", "Without long-term, quantitative voluntary compliance goals and related  performance measures, it will be more difficult for IRS to determine the  success of its strategies, adjust its approach when necessary, and remain  focused on results, especially since factors that affect compliance change  over time.

For example, IRS has studied taxpayer behavior in claiming  the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the child tax credit, and the  additional child tax credit. Sometimes these studies are used to develop  legislative proposals that are included as part of the annual budget  process and outlined in Treasury\u2019s annual revenue proposals. Officials  stated the legislative proposals are based on the knowledge of  compliance derived from analysis of NRP data and they are organized  into themes, such as reducing the tax gap, improving voluntary  compliance, or improving tax administration. However, these revenue  proposals are requests for changes to the tax laws and, ultimately, it is at  Congress\u2019s discretion whether to enact them. IRS officials reported that  other times NRP data are used to compute the annual improper payment  rate for the EITC. According to officials, IRS also uses these data to  annually categorize the root causes of EITC noncompliance.", "IRS uses the NRP data to update compliance plans by updating the  Discriminate Function (DIF) formulas. DIF formulas are designed to score  returns for the likelihood that the tax reported on the return is significantly  underreported. DIF scores help IRS ensure that noncompliant taxpayers  are more likely to be selected for examination and compliant taxpayers  are less likely to be unnecessarily examined. IRS determines DIF scores  for individual income, small corporation income, partnership, and S  corporation returns.", "IRS officials described high-level concepts of how the various NRP and  other studies contribute to compliance and enforcement strategies.", "Officials from IRS\u2019s Office of Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics  (RAAS) said they think the various uses of the NRP are widely known  from general documentation about the NRP and its study design. RAAS  officials also noted the fiscal year 2009 budget justification that led to  special funding for the NRP still reflects IRS\u2019s current strategy for  undertaking various NRP studies. Further, IRS officials pointed us to  documentation from the 2000s that discussed a need for a multiyear  research commitment and IRS\u2019s goal to move NRP studies beyond the  individual income tax to include other taxes. We previously recognized  IRS\u2019s commitment to multiyear research and have noted the gains it has  made in regularly estimating compliance. Our analysis of the decade-old  documents found evidence of a commitment to research that generally  seemed sufficient for that period.", "However, IRS officials did not provide us more recent documents that  describe its current efforts to study compliance or show how it plans to  use NRP data to update compliance strategies. IRS officials also provided  us with business plans for some of their other business units and  divisions. The plans we reviewed noted, at a high level, that data and  analysis will be used to improve workload selection but did not discuss  how specific research efforts or the results of those efforts would be  integrated into the missions.", "The Internal Revenue Manual section on the NRP states that IRS needs  to measure taxpayer compliance with federal income tax laws along with  contributing factors so that customer-focused programs and services can  be enhanced or developed and so that compliance information and tools  can be improved. A 2001 NRP prospectus states the NRP will help to  increase public confidence in the fairness of our tax system by helping  IRS identify where compliance problems occur and focus its resources  accordingly. Further, it states that for strategic planning and budget  purposes, IRS requires regular estimates of compliance. The NRP  research efforts support this critical need. According to IRS, the NRP will  also improve IRS\u2019s ability to detect noncompliance; reduce the burden of  unnecessary IRS contacts on compliant taxpayers; and support the  strategic goals, program development, and resource allocation of IRS  operating divisions.", "Using quality information, such as NRP data, to achieve the agency\u2019s  objectives is one of the 17 principles for internal controls. Further, the  standards for internal controls also recognize documentation is a  necessary part of an effective system, but the level and nature of  documentation vary based on the size of an entity and the complexity of  the operational process. Documentation is required to demonstrate the  design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of a system.  Considering the size and relative importance of the tax gap, documenting  a strategy for how IRS plans to use NRP data to reduce the tax gap  would be consistent with internal controls. However, without a strategy  that provides an overall picture of how NRP data are used, it may be  difficult for Congress and other decision makers to understand the merits  of what they are being asked to fund. Further, without developing and  documenting a strategy for incorporating the results of NRP data, IRS  risks not fully leveraging the compliance data it collects or not allocating  enforcement resources in the most cost-effective manner.", "We have a long-standing history of reporting on the need for IRS to  develop a comprehensive compliance strategy:  In 1994, we concluded that until IRS produces a comprehensive  compliance strategy, existing data could be used as part of an interim  compliance strategy that directs resources at the most noncompliant  taxpayers. We found that using such a starting point, IRS could  focus more of its efforts on highly noncompliant areas, such as small  corporation income and sole proprietorship income that made up  almost a third of the tax gap.", "In 2005, we concluded that reducing the tax gap will be a challenging  task given persistent levels of noncompliance and will not likely be  achieved through a single solution. Rather, the tax gap must be  attacked on multiple fronts and with multiple strategies over a  sustained period, thus building a foundation to help taxpayers  voluntarily comply.", "Between 2005 and 2007, we testified six times on the need for IRS to  develop a strategy to attack the tax gap on multiple fronts with  multiple approaches.", "In 2007, we reported on the need for IRS to develop a strategy to  address noncompliant sole proprietor income, which accounts for a  significant share of the tax gap.", "Further, documenting a strategy for using NRP data to guide compliance  efforts would be consistent with two key criteria for removal from the  High-Risk List:", "Action plan: A corrective action plan exists that defines the root  cause and solutions and that provides for substantially completing  corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement  solutions we recommended.", "Demonstrated progress: Ability to demonstrate progress in  implementing corrective measures and resolving the high-risk area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s long-term fiscal projections show that the federal  government is on an unsustainable fiscal path.

In its letter, IRS  stated that the voluntary compliance rate is ill-suited as a strategic or  performance metric for IRS for various reasons. For example, IRS stated  that improving voluntary compliance, determining the success of its  strategies, and adjusting its approach could be accomplished in the  absence of a quantitative goal. However, as we note in the report, setting  long-term strategic goals is essential for results-oriented management,  because such goals explain in greater specificity the results an agency is  intending to achieve.

We agree that IRS may not control all factors that affect  voluntary compliance. However, IRS does influence taxpayer compliance  through its service and enforcement programs. Furthermore, as we point  out in the report, while agencies cannot mitigate all outside influences that  may present risks or challenges to achieving outcomes, they should  identify, measure, and assess such challenges to the extent possible.

This information is presented in  appendix II. Unlike other IRS examinations, NRP examinations can be  used to estimate taxpayer reporting compliance because they are drawn  from a stratified, statistically representative sample of the population of  individual income tax returns. We interviewed IRS officials from RAAS  about their research and analysis of the NRP data, and we gathered  related documentation where available. IRS officials described the quality  review and data reliability processes they used to collect data from the  NRP examinations.", "Because the NRP sample was based on random selections, the sample  was only one of a large number of samples that IRS could have drawn.  Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we express  our confidence in the precision of our estimates based on the sample as a  95 percent confidence interval plus or minus a margin of error. This is the  interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of  the samples that could have been drawn. The estimates presented in  appendix II have margins of error of less than 10 percent or 10  percentage points.

Line items with substantial or some information  reporting tended to have lower overall misreporting percentages. Line  items that had the largest percentage of taxpayers with misreported  income were those for sole proprietor and farming income, both of which  are subject to little to no information reporting.", "Based on the analysis of these data, we also estimate that  line items with the largest mean amounts of underreporting are  business sale and supplemental income or loss;  the business sale line item also has the largest mean amount of  overreporting, averaging $21,000 per return; and  sole proprietor income and farm income have very similar  misreporting data; over 75 percent of the income is misreported and,  of that, over 80 percent is under reported while under 20 percent is  overreported.", "We also analyzed selected credits and deductions to determine the  average noncompliance rates of these line items, as shown in table 8.  Because credits and deductions offset taxpayers\u2019 income or tax owed,  taxpayers who underreported a credit or deduction overreport their tax  liability or tax owed; taxpayers who overreport a credit or deduction  underreport their tax liability or tax owed. However, we did not determine  the extent to which misreporting was because of issues specific to how  taxpayers claimed the credits and deductions or because taxpayers  misreported their income, which could affect eligibility for certain credits  and deductions. For example, the 2016 income limit to claim the Earned  Income Tax Credit (EITC) is $39,296 for single, surviving spouse, or head  of household taxpayers with one qualifying child. If IRS determined that  such taxpayers who claimed the EITC and reported less than $39,296 in  income on their tax returns had underreported their income in order to  stay under the threshold, those taxpayers would no longer be eligible for  the credit and would have overreported the credit.", "Based on the analysis of these data, we estimate that of the selected credits, EITC is the most claimed credit and about half  of the time it is misreported;  thirty-five percent of the time the child tax credit was misreported with  about two- thirds of that being underreported, which is inconsistent  with filing patterns for most of the other credits and deductions; of the selected deductions, the deduction for real estate taxes is most  often claimed and about a quarter of the time it is misreported;  the medical expenses line item has the highest percentage of  misreporting; 80 percent of the time the deduction is overreported;  and  the mortgage interest deduction has the highest average overreported  amount, over $4,000 per return."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Detection Correction Factor\u2019s Effect on Tax Gap Estimation", "paragraphs": ["In estimating the individual income tax gap, the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) applies an econometric technique called detection controlled  estimation (DCE), which is a regression-based model that controls for  variables that could affect the amount of underreporting detected.

According to IRS officials, this approach is reasonable and the best  currently available to attempt to estimate the full amount of underreported  individual income.

The  2008\u20132010 estimate of taxpayers not filing a return was made by  combining the two methods used to estimate the 2006 and 2001 tax  gap estimates. In 2006, IRS used a sample of individuals not  appearing on filed tax returns. In 2001, IRS conducted an \u201cexact  match\u201d between the Census Bureau\u2019s annual Current Population  Survey and IRS data. The 2008\u20132010 estimate of late filers was  based on the total balance due from late filed tax returns, adjusted for  income reported to IRS on information returns. IRS believes its  current methodology is an improvement over the 2006 estimate as it  uses the population data rather than a sample, avoiding  disadvantages resulting from sampling. IRS reported improvements in  the Census and IRS information associated with nonfilers allowed  them to create a better matched dataset and identify nonfilers more  accurately.", "Nonfiling self-employment data: The methodology IRS used to  calculate self-employment tax nonfiling is the same that it used for  individual income tax.

For the 2008\u20132010 estimate, this tax is now reported in  the employment tax category, whereas for the 2001 and 2006  estimates it was reported in the individual income tax category. IRS  officials stated that for the 2006-2010 estimate IRS decided to break  self-employment out separately and report it with the employment tax  because they believe it allows a more comprehensive view of  employment taxes.", "IRS also updated how the underlying data supporting the tax gap are  organized in two ways:", "Changes in net tax gap estimates: As previously mentioned, IRS  published net tax gap estimates by each tax type (individual income,  corporation income, employment, and estate tax) for the first time in  the 2008\u20132010 estimate. IRS officials stated that they made progress  by providing this data. However, IRS is unable to break out the net tax  gap further by tax component because during examinations,  adjustments are not categorized by component (i.e., underreporting,  underpayment, and nonfiling).", "Changes in individual income underreporting: Starting in 2008\u2013 2010, IRS modified the categories it uses to break down the individual  income underreporting component. These changes affect how IRS  calculates the net misreporting percentage (NMP) for individual  income tax, but not how it calculates the tax gap. IRS uses the NMP  to show the relationship between third-party information reporting and  individual income tax reporting compliance. IRS reported the changes  reflect an improvement in methodology. IRS cautions that any  comparison of the 2008\u20132010 NMP to the 2006 NMP estimates  should consider those improvements. The prior calculation method  involved adding offsets to income, such as deductions, exemptions,  and adjustments, which distorted the comparison across categories.
