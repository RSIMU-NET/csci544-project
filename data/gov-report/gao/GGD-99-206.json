The results of this review  are based on our ongoing monitoring of IRS\u2019 modernization efforts that is  being performed at the request of your offices.  Our work was performed  from January 1999 through May 1999 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.  (See appendix I for details on  our scope and methodology.)  The Commissioner provided us with written  comments, which are discussed in the \u201cAgency Comments\u201d section of this  report and are reprinted in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1995, we reported on management and technical weaknesses with IRS\u2019  tax systems modernization that jeopardized its successful completion and  made over a dozen recommendations to correct the weaknesses.    Because of the seriousness of the weaknesses, we placed the  modernization on our 1995 list of high-risk federal programs.  In June  1996, we reported that IRS had made progress in implementing our  recommendations.  However, to minimize the risk of IRS investing in  systems before the recommendations were fully implemented, we  suggested that the Congress limit IRS\u2019 information technology (IT)  spending to certain cost-effective categories.  These spending categories  were those that (1) support ongoing operations and maintenance, (2) correct pervasive management and technical weaknesses, such as a  lack of requisite systems life cycle discipline, (3) are small, represent low  technical risk, and can be delivered in a relatively short time frame, or (4) involve deploying already developed systems that have been fully  tested, are not premature given the lack of a complete systems  architecture, and produce a proven, verifiable business value.  The act  providing IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 appropriations limited IRS\u2019 IT spending to  efforts consistent with these categories.", "In 1997, we again included the modernization on our high-risk list because  IRS had not yet implemented our recommendations.  However, we also  reported that IRS had made progress on the recommendations.  For  example, in May 1997, IRS issued its modernization blueprint.  This  blueprint consisted of four principal components: (1) a systems life cycle, (2) business requirements, (3) functional and technical architectures, and  (4) a sequencing plan.  We briefed IRS appropriations and authorizing  committees on the results of our assessment of IRS\u2019 Modernization  Blueprint in September 1997.  In those briefings and in a subsequent  report, we concluded that the Modernization Blueprint was a good first  step that provided a solid foundation from which to define the level of  detail and precision needed to effectively and efficiently build a  modernized system of interrelated systems.  However, we also noted that  the blueprint was not yet complete and did not provide enough detail for  building and acquiring new systems.  As a result, IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1998  appropriations act again limited IRS\u2019 fiscal year spending to efforts that  were consistent with the aforementioned spending categories.  The act  providing IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1999 appropriations continued these spending  limitations.", "In its fiscal year 1998 and 1999 budget requests, IRS requested over $1 billion for its ITIA account, and the Congress provided $506 million for  the account.  Specifically, it appropriated $325 million in fiscal year 1998,  $30 million of which was rescinded in May 1998 for urgent Year 2000  requirements.  The Congress also provided $211 million in fiscal year 1999.   In providing these sums, the Congress limited IRS\u2019 ability to obligate them  until IRS and the Treasury submitted to the Congress for approval an  expenditure plan that, as stated in the law, (1) implements the IRS  Modernization Blueprint, (2) meets OMB investment guidelines, (3) is  reviewed and approved by IRS\u2019 Investment Review Board, OMB, and  Treasury\u2019s IRS Management Board and is reviewed by GAO, (4) meets  requirements of IRS\u2019 life cycle program, and (5) is in compliance with  acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines, and systems acquisition  management practices of the federal government.  IRS is not requesting any  ITIA funds for fiscal year 2000 but is asking for $325 million for fiscal year  2001.  In our April 1999 testimony, we reported this request was not  adequately justified and suggested that the Congress not provide the funds  until IRS provided the support.", "In December 1998, IRS awarded its Prime Systems Integration Services  (PRIME) contract for systems modernization.  According to IRS, it planned  to \u201cpartner\u201d with the PRIME contractor, among other things, to (1) complete the modernization blueprint, as we recommended, and (2) account for changes in systems requirements and priorities caused by  IRS\u2019 organizational restructuring, new technology, and IRS Restructuring  and Reform Act of 1998 requirements.  In addition, IRS stated that it  planned to establish disciplined life cycle management processes and  structures and mature software development and acquisition capabilities  before it begins building modernized systems.  Because of the  modernization\u2019s high cost and importance, we continued in 1999 to  categorize it as a high-risk federal program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Plans to Submit a Series of Expenditure Plans to Incrementally Justify Modernization Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["To comply with its statutory mandate to submit an expenditure plan to the  Congress before obligating ITIA funds, IRS has developed a strategy where,  in lieu of a single plan, it intends to develop and provide to the Congress a  series of expenditure plans over the life of the modernization.  This  expenditure plan strategy is a by-product of the Commissioner\u2019s overall  approach to the modernization, which is to incrementally invest in  modernized systems in accordance with (1) rigorous systems and software  life cycle management processes and (2) a revised sequencing plan for  migrating from IRS\u2019 legacy systems and master file environment to the  target systems and relational database environment specified in the  blueprint.", "The initial plan requests $35 million for IRS modernization initiatives to be  delivered by October 31, 1999.  This plan proposes three categories of  modernization investments that IRS calls (1) supporting business goals, (2) building management capability, and (3) planning a modern  infrastructure, and is requesting for each category $17 million, $11.6 million, and $6.5 million, respectively.  The supporting business goals  initiatives include the early phases of selected systems development efforts  that are intended to improve taxpayer service by the year 2001 tax filing  season.  The building management capability initiatives provide for  defining and beginning the institutionalization of mature modernization  management and systems engineering processes that are to permit  effective blueprint implementation.  The planning modern infrastructure  initiatives refer to the first steps in establishing the technology foundation  (e.g., networks, operating platforms, system security, etc.) upon which to  build, interconnect, and operate modernized system applications.", "IRS\u2019 stated intention is to submit to the Congress a series of expenditure  plans in the future, the next being in October 1999.  According to IRS, the  October 1999 plan will define follow-on modernization initiatives,  deliverables, and funding requirements into the year 2000.", "Leading public and private sector organizations use an incremental  approach to investing in systems modernization efforts.  In addition, the  Clinger-Cohen Act and OMB policy endorse this approach to funding large  system development investments.  Using this approach, organizations take  large, complex modernization efforts and break them into projects that are  narrow in scope and brief in duration.  This enables organizations to  determine whether a project delivers promised benefits within cost and  risk limitations and allows them to correct problems before significant  dollars are expended, which in turn mitigates the risk of program failure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Expenditure Plan Is an Appropriate First Step and Meets Legislative Requirements", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 initial expenditure plan is an appropriate first step to successful  systems modernization and, with regard to the $35 million being requested  for this increment, satisfies the conditions that the Congress placed on the  use of ITIA funds.

For example, the  expenditure plan only requests funds to establish and selectively  implement an Enterprise Life Cycle (ELC).  This ELC is to provide IRS with  a disciplined and institutional approach for managing its IT investments  throughout their life cycle--from conception, development, and deployment  through maintenance and operation.  This ELC is to be an adaptation of the  PRIME contractor\u2019s commercially available and proven systems life cycle  management approach and associated automated tools, incorporating IRS- unique needs such as key investment decision points.  Once in place at  IRS, the service plans to begin implementing the ELC on its ongoing  modernization initiatives.  According to IRS, future expenditure plans will  provide for ELC implementation on all future project initiatives.", "As another example, the initial expenditure plan requests funds to add  missing system architecture precision and detail to selected system  initiatives. In our February 1998 report, we concluded that while the  architecture in IRS\u2019 May 15, 1997, blueprint provided a solid foundation  from which to build a complete architecture, it did not provide sufficient  detail and precision for building or acquiring new systems.  For example,  the architecture did not allocate business requirements to specific  configuration items (i.e., actual hardware and software components).  As  part of its initial expenditure plan, however, IRS plans to validate existing  business requirements and develop preliminary hardware and software  design specifications for IRS\u2019 ongoing projects.  Additionally, IRS intends  for future expenditure plans to incrementally provide for architectural  specificity for future system initiatives.", "The initial expenditure plan also requests funds for IRS to perform business  system planning, which is to result in a revised modernization sequencing  plan by October 31, 1999.  This initiative is necessary because the May 15,  1997, blueprint sequencing plan does not recognize, for example, the need  to introduce electronic tax administration technologies and capabilities  early in the modernization to respond to the electronic filing requirements  in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.  This revised sequencing  plan is to define the general timing, costs, and benefits of future  modernization projects, and is to be incrementally updated in future  expenditure plans with more specific cost and benefit information as  projects are initiated and business case justifications are developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Condition 2: Meets OMB Information Systems Investment Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["If properly implemented, the ELC that IRS\u2019 initial expenditure plan is to  establish and selectively implement, should meet OMB information system  investment guidelines.

The overriding objective is to  ensure that investment decisions are made in a disciplined and rigorous  manner on the basis of established criteria, such as return-on-investment  and architectural compliance, and that system investments be broken into  a series of increments.  Consistent with these guidelines, IRS\u2019 ELC is to  include processes for identifying alternative solutions, calculating their  projected returns-on-investment, and requiring that selected solutions be  architecturally compliant.  Through its ELC, IRS also plans to require that  systems be acquired and implemented in phased segments that are narrow  in scope and brief in duration.

In lieu of using the system life cycle overview  contained in the blueprint as the framework for developing life cycle  management processes, IRS\u2019 initial expenditure plan provides for  establishing the aforementioned ELC.  IRS decided to do this because it  concluded that adapting the PRIME contractor\u2019s commercially available  methodology to meet its needs would be less costly and faster than  completing its own unique system life cycle contained in its May 15, 1997,  blueprint.  IRS officials also stated that the PRIME contractor\u2019s  methodology offered more capability than the blueprint system life cycle  overview, such as processes for managing business process reengineering.", "We reviewed the PRIME contractor\u2019s commercially available methodology,  and found that it both meets the requirements specified in the blueprint\u2019s  system life cycle overview and is consistent with the approaches that  successful private and public sector organizations use to manage large IT  investments.  If implemented correctly, it should provide IRS with effective  processes and tools for, among other things, planning, controlling,  developing, and deploying information systems based on defined activities,  events, milestones, reviews, and products.

Currently, our  open recommendations fall into three categories: (1) completing the  modernization blueprint, (2) developing the management and engineering  capability to effectively modernize systems, and (3) until the first two  recommendations are implemented, limiting modernization spending to  certain small, cost-effective, low-risk efforts.", "IRS\u2019 initial expenditure plan is consistent with these recommendations.   Specifically, of the $35.1 million being requested, IRS plans to use  approximately $14.6 million for initiatives relating to completing the  blueprint.

The  result is intended to be a revised, business risk-based sequencing plan that  defines the general timing, cost, and benefits of new modernization  projects over the next 3 to 5 years.", "In addition, IRS plans to spend about $11.6 million to develop the  management and engineering capability to build and implement  modernized systems.  Specifically, IRS has designated about $2.2 million for  PRIME and other contractor support to help IRS implement mature  program management practices that are to (1) strengthen IRS\u2019 ability to  manage and control modernization initiatives and (2) ready IRS for an  evaluation by SEI against relevant software/system acquisition capability  maturity model requirements.  IRS has earmarked $9.4 million for defining,  documenting, and implementing its ELC, including training staff in its use,  on ongoing modernization projects.", "Last, IRS plans to spend the remaining $8.9 million on selected relatively  small, low-risk efforts.  For example, IRS is seeking $5.1 million to, among  other things, validate system requirements and update cost-effectiveness  (i.e., business case) justifications for two ongoing projects intended to  provide near-term customer service improvements via better routing of  taxpayers telephone inquiries.

This task was to be completed by April 30, 1999.   According to IRS officials, this task was not adequately completed for  several reasons.  First, the PRIME contractor\u2019s tasking was not adequately  defined and thus resulted in a deliverable that was too narrow in scope.   Second, IRS subsequently became concerned that the PRIME contractor  was not sufficiently independent enough to be defining roles and  responsibilities for itself and IRS.

We also reviewed the business and  systems development life cycle methodology that IRS is modifying to  develop its ELC and were briefed by IRS and its contractors involved in this  effort.  We also attended IRS\u2019 Executive Steering Committee meetings to  observe how IRS top management was directing and controlling the  modernization program and to understand IRS\u2019 strategic modernization  approach and progress.  Last, we analyzed each of IRS\u2019 modernization  initiatives vis-\u00e0-vis the statutory conditions to identify any variances or  inconsistencies.", "To determine whether IRS\u2019 expenditure plan is consistent with our past  recommendations on the tax systems modernization, we extracted from  our inventory of open recommendations those pertaining to IRS\u2019  modernization and grouped them into the following three categories: (1) completing the Modernization Blueprint, (2) developing the  management and engineering capability to effectively modernize systems,  and (3) limiting modernization spending to certain small, cost-effective,  low-risk efforts until the first two recommendations are implemented.  We  then compared IRS\u2019 efforts on its completed, ongoing, and planned  initiatives with the intent of our open recommendations to identify any  variances or inconsistencies.", "To develop other observations on IRS\u2019 systems modernization efforts, we  analyzed IRS\u2019 overall modernization governance structure to determine  whether it provided for top management involvement and analyzed  contractor deliverables against task order requirements and the December 9, 1998, contract awarded to the PRIME contractor.  We also  attended Executive Steering Committee meetings to observe how the  Commissioner and committee members functioned with respect to  established structures and processes, and to understand IRS\u2019 plans for  submitting future expenditure plans.  In addition, we met with and  interviewed the Chief Information Officer and IRS officials responsible for  the day-to-day management and control of the program and the PRIME  contractor, for development of the expenditure plan, and for definition of  IRS and contractor roles and responsibilities.", "We performed our work at IRS headquarters in Washington, D.C., and its  facility in Lanham, Maryland, from January 1999 through May 1999 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contact, Keith Rhodes, Agnes Spruill, Karen  Richey, Lorne Dold, Sherrie Russ, Charles Roney, and Frank Maguire made  key contributions to this report.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
