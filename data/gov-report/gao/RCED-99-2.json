The agency constructs a budget for the National Forest System and other appropriations\u2014including forest and rangeland research and state and private forestry\u2014that indicates how funds will be allocated among line items. The agency submits its proposed budget to the Department of Agriculture for review and any changes about 15 months before the fiscal year begins. Agriculture, in turn, submits the Forest Service\u2019s budget to the Office of Management and Budget for review and any changes about a year before the beginning of the fiscal year in which the funds will be spent.", "The President\u2019s budget is submitted to the Congress no later than the first Monday in February for the fiscal year beginning the coming October 1st. Shortly afterwards, the Forest Service submits its explanatory notes to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Once the Committees review, amend, and approve the agency\u2019s budget, the Congress appropriates funds for the National Forest System and for other Forest Service appropriations as part of the appropriations act for the Department of the Interior and related agencies. The Committees\u2019 reports or the appropriations act may also specify restrictions on certain types of spending and may earmark funds for special activities or projects.", "Once funds are received by the Forest Service, the agency removes funds needed to operate the Washington Office and specifies funding that will be used for national commitments and for special projects. The Washington Office then allocates the remaining funds by line item to its regional offices.", "The appropriation for the National Forest System includes 21 budget and extended budget line items that are generally used to fund the system\u2019s nine programs. A National Forest System program may be funded from one or more line items under the appropriation for the National Forest System. When a program, such as Minerals and Geology, is funded from only one line item\u2014in this instance, Minerals and Geology Management\u2014the line item is referred to as a \u201cbudget line item.\u201d Other programs are funded from two or more line items. For example, the Forest Management program is funded from the Timber Sales Management and the Forestland Vegetation Management line items. These line items are referred to as \u201cextended budget line items\u201d and are aggregated into a budget line item for Forestland Management. (See table 1.1.)", "Funds are usually allocated to the agency\u2019s nine regional offices on the basis of budget allocation criteria developed by the Forest Service. For example, the criteria for allocating funds from the Wildlife Habitat Management extended budget line item to each region include, among other things, the number of acres, the opportunities for habitat restoration and enhancement, and the number of big game species. Regions then distribute the funds by line item to the 155 national forests on the basis of regional budget allocation criteria or on a program-by-program assessment of needs.", "Finally, each national forest office allocates funds to its districts by line item and by the type of activity that will be performed. For example, a national forest office might allocate some funds within the Grazing Management extended budget line item to a district to be used specifically to construct improvements for livestock grazing. District personnel not only receive funding slated for specific activities within each line item, they also track and charge their work accordingly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why the Forest Service Requested More Flexibility in Its Budget Structure", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1992, the Forest Service was cited by the National Performance Review\u2014a White House-led study of ways to improve the efficiency of federal programs\u2014as an example of an agency whose budget structure impeded the productive management and the efficient use of taxpayer dollars. As the Forest Service moved from managing individual resources, such as wildlife, recreation, timber, rangeland, and water, to a more broad-scale, more comprehensive approach to land management (ecosystem management), the agency proposed significant changes in its budget structure for fiscal year 1995 to help implement this management approach and improve efficiency.", "In acting on the Forest Service appropriations for fiscal year 1995, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees (1) consolidated line items in the agency\u2019s budget for which specific amounts of funds are allocated, (2) expanded the agency\u2019s authority to reprogram funds without requesting the Committees\u2019 approval, and (3) restructured the agency\u2019s budget so that all funding to carry out a project\u2014including the funding for services provided by others\u2014is consolidated in the program that will benefit most from the project.

In addition, the budget is still structured primarily by individual resource-specific programs, such as timber sales and wildlife habitat management, although the agency\u2019s strategic goals and objectives increasingly require that these and other programs be integrated to achieve broader stewardship objectives, such as restoring or protecting forested ecosystems.", "The fiscal year 1995 budget reforms also expanded the Forest Service\u2019s ability to move funds between line items without the Appropriations Committees\u2019 approval.

In these instances, it may require other programs that are providing support services to absorb the costs of the services instead of seeking to meet its needs by moving funds between line items or requesting that funds be reprogrammed. This practice circumvents the requirements established by the Appropriations Committees and the agency to move funds between line items and understates a project\u2019s costs.

According to the Forest Service, for most programs, this meant keeping the same, or possibly expanding, the number of activities used to track expenditures. For example, to account for funds allocated to the National Forest System\u2019s 21 line items, the Pacific Northwest office (Region 6) tracks funds for as many as 217 different activities, including many for line items that were eliminated through consolidation. To illustrate, although the fiscal year 1995 budget reforms reduced the number of timber-related extended budget line items in the National Forest System\u2019s appropriation from seven to two, that office still tracks funds for as many as 14 different activities under the two line items, including several activities for the line items that had been eliminated.

Although field and program managers have some flexibility to move funds among activities, district office staff tend to see the distributions as rigid limits to planning and accounting for work. For example, instead of moving funds among activities during a fiscal year, field and program staff may redistribute work charged to activities after the fact to achieve or maintain specific levels of funding within activities (called \u201cretroactive redistribution\u201d).

The agency intends to limit goods and services on national forests\u2014including recreational experiences, commercial sawtimber and other forest products, and livestock and wildlife forage\u2014to the types, levels, and mixes that the lands are capable of sustaining. The documents also make clear that the agency intends to fulfill this responsibility primarily by using an ecosystem-based approach to land management that emphasizes integrating resource-specific programs and activities to maintain and restore the health of forested, aquatic, and rangeland ecosystems.", "The fiscal year 1995 budget reforms created a new line item\u2014ecosystem planning, inventory, and monitoring\u2014to allow the Forest Service to plan more along the boundaries of natural systems. However, the Forest Service\u2019s budget structure remains highly fragmented along the lines of individual resource-specific programs and activities, such as managing timber sales, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and wildfires. This fragmentation works against an integrated approach to land management. For example, the Forest Service\u2019s fiscal year 1997 annual report cites the goal of restoring and protecting forested ecosystems as the agency\u2019s highest priority. However, rather than having one large pool of funds available to achieve this goal and greater discretion to spend funds, a forest or district office may have to use up to 24 different funding sources to implement a plan to restore or protect a forested ecosystem. These funding sources include four National Forest System line items over which the forest and district offices have the most control. Of the remaining 20 funding sources, 7 are from the state and private forestry appropriation, 2 are from the wildland fire management appropriation, 1 is from the land acquisition appropriation, and the other 10 are from various permanent appropriations and trust funds for such activities as brush removal, timber salvage sales, and reforestation.

On the basis of that systemwide survey, he estimated that since fiscal year 1995, on average, about 49 percent of the funds allocated to the Lands program to survey, locate, mark and post, and maintain previously marked property lines between lands in the National Forest System and lands in other ownership (landline location) have been used to support other programs, but charged to the Lands program. Funds allocated to the Lands program for landline location activities average about $14 million a year.", "Other studies have reached similar conclusions. For instance, a March 1998 report by a private consulting firm that examined the Forest Service\u2019s financial systems states that \u201cthe capability to work around \u2019charged as worked\u2019 initiatives is the most serious criticism of the agency\u2019s current accounting and budget infrastructure. This capability is often cited as the primary reason for the Forest Service\u2019s lack of financial credibility.\u201d", "Moreover, \u201ccharging as budgeted\u201d and not \u201cas worked\u201d appears to be occurring at all three levels of National Forest System field management. For example, a March 1998 report by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Office of Inspector General states that 8 out of 10 biological evaluations conducted in one district office were paid for by the Wildlife, Fish, and Rare Plants program instead of the benefiting program (e.g., timber and recreation). Similarly, Wildlife, Fish, and Rare Plants program officials in the Pacific Northwest (Region 6) office observed that the recreation, minerals, and range programs were not providing adequate funds for biological support services to prepare environmental documents, so funds were being taken inappropriately from the wildlife program. And, a briefing paper prepared in 1996 by the Washington Office\u2019s director of the Wildlife, Fish, and Rare Plants program noted that no attempt had been made to fund salary costs within the Washington Office consistent with the concept of benefiting function.", "According to several Forest Service officials we spoke to and agency documents that we reviewed, in some instances, staff from programs providing support services may not always charge their costs to the benefiting program because the program primarily benefiting from the work has not been clearly identified, defined, or understood. For example, work mischarged to fisheries activities in the Wildlife, Fish, and Rare Plants program in the Eastern Region (Region 9) dropped from an average of 60 percent to 12 percent after the region circulated guidance on identifying the benefiting program and the importance of charging work to it. Other regional offices and forest offices have issued similar guidance to clarify specific benefiting programs and activities.", "Some of the confusion in identifying the benefiting program may be because the Forest Service\u2019s budget structure has not kept pace with the agency\u2019s movement away from goals and objectives that clearly benefit one resource-specific program toward using multiple programs to accomplish broader ecosystem-based goals and objectives. Timber as a commodity program versus timber as a tool to achieve a stewardship objective, such as maintaining or restoring a forested ecosystem, is an example. The agency\u2019s Forest Management Program Report for fiscal year 1997 notes that the proportion of total harvest volume removed solely for timber commodity purposes had fallen from 71 percent in fiscal year 1993 to 52 percent in fiscal year 1997. During that time, the proportion removed for forest stewardship purposes\u2014mostly to accomplish a forest ecosystem health-related objective\u2014had grown from 23 to 40 percent. This trend is expected to continue and, by fiscal year 1999, the Forest Service estimates that the proportion of total harvest volume removed solely for timber commodity purposes will have fallen to 46 percent while the proportion removed for forest stewardship purposes will have grown to 54 percent. Although timber sales will increasingly be used as a tool to maintain or restore forested ecosystems, timber sales management under the Forest Management program is still identified as the benefiting function.", "We found instances where field and program managers justified charging the programs providing support services because many programs benefited from the project, so they decided that the program with available funding should pay. For example, a snowmobile club using the Superior National Forest in Minnesota asked permission from the Forest Service to build a snowmobile trail. However, because of the requirements of the Wilderness Act, the trail could not be constructed on lands designated as wilderness. To locate the boundary of the wilderness, the Lands program was required to survey the area of the forest where the trail was to be built and mark and post the boundaries of the wilderness. Officials at the Forest Service\u2019s Washington Office agree that the Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness Resources program was the benefiting program because it is responsible for both recreation and wilderness management. However, the costs to survey, locate, and mark and post the boundaries of the wilderness area were absorbed by the Lands program.", "The forest office\u2019s budget and finance officer justified charging the costs to the Lands program by pointing out that the boundaries of the wilderness area would eventually have to be established anyway. However, the manager of the Lands program in the forest office stated that locating the boundaries of wilderness to build a snowmobile trail was a relatively low priority within that program. Moreover, the funds allocated to that program were needed to meet the Forest Service\u2019s priority of reducing the risks, such as timber theft, soil and water degradation, and encroachments and trespass, to the National Forest System\u2019s resources that are caused by the rapid population growth along the boundaries of the national forests\u2014an area termed the \u201cwildland/urban interface.\u201d", "In an April 1997 report, we stated that the Forest Service had not given adequate attention to improving its accountability for expenditures and performance and that improvements are often left to the discretion of regional offices and forests with uneven or mixed results. The failure of certain regions, forests, and districts to consistently charge the costs of support services to the benefiting programs is another example of an organizational culture of indifference toward accountability. In the April 1997 report, as well as in March 1998 testimony, we observed that strong leadership within the Forest Service would be required to ensure corrective action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Accountability Is Hampered by Inadequate Performance Measures and a Focus on Resource-Specific Outputs", "paragraphs": ["In exchange for the greater flexibility granted to the Forest Service by the fiscal year 1995 budget reforms, the Appropriations Committees expected the agency to, among other things, improve its performance measures and increase its accountability for results.

The agency\u2019s July 1998 Forest Management Program Report for fiscal year 1997 continues this theme, noting that the proportion of total harvest volume removed to accomplish forest ecosystem health-related objectives and other forest stewardship purposes had grown to 40 percent and that by fiscal year 1999 this proportion is expected to increase to 54 percent.", "However, the criteria that the Forest Service used to allocate fiscal year 1998 funds to its field offices to manage timber sales were based solely on managing timber as a commodity rather than on using it as a tool to accomplish a stewardship objective.", "In its first annual performance plan developed under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act), dated February 4, 1998, the Forest Service identified three extended budget line items within the National Forest System appropriation that are available to forest and district offices to restore or protect forested ecosystems, including one for Timber Sales Management. However, all three of the budget allocation criteria for this funding source relate to providing a continuous supply of timber from the national forests, not to restoring or protecting the forested ecosystems. While the agency\u2019s Forest Management Program Report for fiscal year 1997 stresses the fact that the timber being removed from the national forests today includes proportionately more (1) dead and dying trees, as opposed to green timber, and (2) nonsawtimber, as opposed to sawtimber, the criteria for allocating funds appropriated for Timber Sales Management for fiscal year 1998 relate solely to the volume of green timber produced or offered.

The indicators in the MAR report are intended to measure how well the Forest Service\u2019s field offices are, and the agency as a whole is, performing. However, with few exceptions, the agency officials we interviewed considered the MAR report to be, at best, an imperfect measure of the agency\u2019s performance and, at worst, misleading.", "In total, the MAR report has more than 100 indicators for the National Forest System\u2019s nine programs. These indicators include the number of forest plan revisions completed or underway, the number of miles of wilderness trails, the number of heritage sites evaluated or protected, and the number of acres of noxious weeds treated. The indicators are intended to measure how well field offices are performing. Information from the MAR report is also used to report the Forest Service\u2019s performance to the Congress and the public.", "Prior to the beginning of a fiscal year, Forest Service program managers in the Washington Office negotiate performance targets for a handful of MAR indicators for their individual programs. These targets are then allocated by program to the regional, forest, and district offices. At the end of the fiscal year, program staff in the district offices report their accomplishments by indicator to their forest office.

(See table 3.2.) However, none of these MAR indicators provides a good measure of the agency\u2019s progress toward achieving this objective.", "The primary objective of the activities relating to two of the three MAR indicators is to provide for a continuous supply of timber from the national forests, rather than to maintain or restore the health of the lands. For instance, timber stand improvement is defined by the Forest Service as \u201cnoncommercial cutting and other treatments made to increase the growth and improve the quality of trees for timber uses\u201d and reforestation is defined as \u201ctreatments or activities that help to reestablish stands of trees after harvest.\u201d", "The remaining MAR indicator is intended to measure a biological component of a forested ecosystem; that is, its wildlife. However, this indicator measures only the number of acres of terrestrial wildlife habitat restored or enhanced and not the agency\u2019s progress toward accomplishing its stated objective of maintaining well-distributed viable populations of wildlife (the viability or viable populations requirement). Moreover, because the indicator is limited to wildlife, it does not measure the agency\u2019s progress toward maintaining the diversity of other biological components of ecosystems, such as plant communities.", "The Forest Service\u2019s September 30, 1997, 5-year strategic plan also identifies goals and objectives for goods and services on national forests, including providing quality recreational experiences. In addition, the Chief\u2019s March 1998 natural resource agenda for the twenty-first century emphasizes recreation as one of only four key areas on which the Forest Service intends to focus its resources. However, of the six potential funding sources within the National Forest System\u2019s appropriation that are available to forest and district offices to provide quality recreation, four did not have any MAR indicators relating specifically to recreation for fiscal year 1998. In addition, none of the fiscal year 1998 MAR indicators for the remaining two funding sources\u2014recreation management and road maintenance\u2014measures the agency\u2019s progress toward providing quality recreational experiences. Rather than quality and outcomes, the MAR indicators measure quantity or such outputs as seasonal capacity available at developed facilities; the number of miles of roads and recreational trails; the number of permits \u201cin existence\u201d for private recreational cabins, special group events, and other noncommercial special uses; and the number of visitors to the forests. (See table 3.3.)

The plan states that the process should be available in fiscal year 1999 for use in preparing the fiscal year 2000 performance plan. However, as noted by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Office of Inspector General in 1998, the process, which has been under development since at least 1994, (1) is still evolving, (2) has not been implemented, and (3) has not been integrated in the automated real property inventory and management system that the agency has been developing since 1993.", "Not only do the MAR indicators often measure quantity and outputs when they should be measuring quality and outcomes, they do not measure outputs consistently. A frequent complaint by officials we interviewed was that many of the MAR indicators are so broadly defined that two field units reporting identical accomplishments may have expended very different levels of effort and accomplished very different objectives. For example, for fiscal year 1998, one of the MAR indicators for both the Wildlife Habitat Management and the Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Species Habitat Management extended budget line items was the \u201ctotal number of structures constructed.\u201d However, according to agency officials, a structure can be as inexpensive as a wooden box for nesting ducks or as resource-intensive as a fish ladder to increase the number of adult fish migrating upstream. A field unit with few resources, yet eager to meet its performance targets, has an incentive to focus on less resource-intensive activities even though by focusing its efforts on one large project it might actually provide greater wildlife benefits.", "Finally, many Forest Service officials stated that MAR data are not reliable. They told us that they do not expend much effort to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. Moreover, no unit of the National Forest System that we visited systematically reviewed and audited the accuracy of the accomplishments reported by field and program staff, and some have developed so-called \u201ccuff\u201d records and reports that are unique to the units and cannot be combined and reported to the Congress and the public."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Forest Service\u2019s Management Cost and Performance Reporting System Will Not Provide Adequate Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["In exchange for the greater flexibility granted to the Forest Service by the fiscal year 1995 budget reforms, the agency also agreed to implement a management cost and performance reporting system called All Resources Reporting that it has been developing since fiscal year 1988.

As a result, there is (1) currently no clear link between the agency\u2019s ecosystem-based strategic goals and objectives and the resource-specific National Forest System line items in its budget and (2) some confusion within the agency in identifying the program that will benefit most from a project so that costs can be consistently charged to that program.", "As old as the Forest Service itself is the agency\u2019s highly decentralized organizational structure and the considerable autonomy and discretion that field and program managers have in interpreting and applying the agency\u2019s policies and directions.
