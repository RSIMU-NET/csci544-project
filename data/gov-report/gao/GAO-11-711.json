Beginning in 2011, insurers must meet minimum MLR requirements or pay rebates to enrollees. While insurers' first set of data subject to the MLR requirements will be for 2011, and is not due until June 2012, insurers prepared preliminary PPACA MLR data for 2010. GAO examined: (1) what can be learned from the traditional MLR data reported by health insurers prior to PPACA; (2) what factors might affect the MLRs that insurers will report under PPACA; and (3) what changes in business practices, if any, have insurers made or planned to make in response to the PPACA MLR requirements. GAO analyzed premiums, claims, and traditional MLR data for nearly all insurers for 2006- 2009 and interviewed a judgmental sample of seven insurers--selected to provide a range based on their size, profit status, and the number of states in which they operated--about their experiences using the PPACA MLR definition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 2006 through 2009, traditional MLRs on average generally exceeded PPACA MLR standards. This is even without the additional components in the new PPACA MLR that will generally increase MLRs. However, traditional MLRs also varied among insurers. Traditional MLRs within the individual market varied more than those within the small and large group markets, and a larger proportion of individual market insurers generally had lower MLRs. Additionally, traditional MLRs varied more among smaller insurers than among larger insurers in all three markets. Some components of the PPACA MLR requirements may mitigate the implications of some of these variations. The insurers GAO interviewed said their PPACA MLRs will be affected by changes in the MLR formula and their ability to provide more precise data in 2011 and beyond. Most of these insurers reported that the deduction of taxes and fees in the PPACA MLR formula would contribute to the largest change in their 2010 MLRs. Including expenses for activities to improve health care quality was also cited as a factor affecting insurers' MLRs but to a lesser extent. In addition, because insurers had limited time to respond to HHS's interim final rule on PPACA MLRs, which was published in late 2010, they said that their 2010 MLRs were based in part on best estimates. Insurers said they expect their ability to provide more precise PPACA MLR data will improve in 2011 and beyond. Most of the insurers GAO interviewed were reducing brokers' commissions and making adjustments to premiums, as well as making changes to other business practices, in response to the PPACA MLR requirements. Almost all of the insurers said they had decreased or planned to decrease commissions to brokers in an effort to increase their MLRs. Insurers varied on how the PPACA MLR requirements might affect their decisions to implement activities to improve health care quality. While one insurer said that their decision to implement new activities would be affected by whether or not an activity could be included as a quality improvement activity in the PPACA MLR formula, other insurers said that the PPACA MLR requirements are not a factor in such decisions. Insurers also differed on how the PPACA MLR requirement may affect where they do business. One insurer said that they have considered exiting the individual market in some states in which they did not expect to meet the PPACA MLR requirements, while several other insurers said that the PPACA MLR requirements will not affect where they do business. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said that the MLR provision will increase transparency in the insurance market and value for consumers' premiums."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that millions of Americans who rely on private insurance  for health care coverage receive value for their premium dollars, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established  minimum \u201cmedical loss ratio\u201d (MLR) standards for insurers.

Key differences are that it allows insurers to include in  their expenses spending on activities to improve health care quality and  to deduct from their revenues certain tax payments and fees. PPACA  requires insurers offering coverage in the large group market to meet  minimum PPACA MLRs of 85 percent, and in the small group and  individual markets to meet minimum PPACA MLRs of 80 percent, or pay  rebates to their enrollees.

Insurance industry  representatives have expressed concern about the potential for the  requirements to affect the stability of certain insurance markets, and  ultimately consumer choice in those markets.", "You asked us to examine issues related to the MLR requirements in  PPACA.

To assess the  reliability of these data, we reviewed relevant documentation, conducted  interviews with NAIC officials knowledgeable about the data, and  conducted electronic testing of the data to identify obvious errors or  outliers. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. To determine what factors might affect the MLRs  that insurers will report under the PPACA MLR requirements, and what  changes in business practices, if any, insurers have made or plan to  make in response to the PPACA MLR requirements, we interviewed a  judgmental sample of seven insurers to learn about their experiences  reporting 2010 MLRs using the PPACA MLR definition, as well as their  expectations related to future reporting of data that will be subject to the  PPACA MLR requirements. We selected our sample to reflect a variety  of insurers based on certain characteristics, including insurer size as  determined by the number of enrollees; the number of insurance  companies within the insurance groups; profit status; whether the insurer  was publicly traded or privately held; and the number of states in which  the insurer operated. We also interviewed a group of officials from seven  state insurance commissioners\u2019 offices and NAIC officials, which was  convened by NAIC at our request, to obtain their perspectives on issues  related to the transition of the new PPACA MLR requirements for 2011  and beyond.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2010 through July  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

While many states have minimum MLR  standards or MLR reporting requirements, PPACA established federally  required minimum MLRs for insurers operating in the individual and group  insurance markets.", "The MLR formula specified in PPACA differs from the way MLRs have  traditionally been defined. The traditional MLR is generally calculated by  dividing an insurer\u2019s medical care claims by premiums. In the PPACA  MLR formula, the numerator includes insurers\u2019 expenses for activities that  improve health care quality\u2014such as patient-centered education and  counseling, care coordination, and wellness assessments\u2014in addition to  claims. Further, the denominator of the PPACA MLR subtracts from  insurers\u2019 premiums all federal taxes and state taxes and licensing or  regulatory fees (see fig. 1).", "In addition to establishing the new MLR formula, PPACA directed NAIC to  establish recommended definitions and methodologies for calculating  MLRs, subject to certification by the Secretary of HHS. NAIC submitted  its recommendations to HHS on October 27, 2010, and HHS issued its  interim final rule implementing the PPACA MLR requirements in PPACA  on December 1, 2010, with an effective date of January 1, 2011.  According to HHS, the interim final rule adopted NAIC\u2019s  recommendations in full, and included the following key areas.  \uf0b7  Activities that improve health care quality. These include activities  designed to increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes in  ways that can be objectively measured. The activities must be  primarily designed to: (1) improve health outcomes; (2) prevent  hospital readmissions; (3) improve patient safety; (4) implement,  promote, and increase wellness and health activities; and (5) enhance  the use of health care data to improve quality, transparency, and  outcomes. Insurers are also allowed to include health information  technology (IT) expenses needed to accomplish activities that  improve health care quality. Also specified were certain activities that  do not qualify as those that improve health care quality, such as  provider credentialing.  \uf0b7  Federal and state taxes and licensing or regulatory fees. These  include all federal taxes and assessments, excluding taxes on  investment income and capital gains.  \uf0b7  Levels of aggregation for MLR reporting. Insurance companies are  required to report MLRs separately for their individual, small group,  and large group markets for each state in which they are licensed to  operate.  \uf0b7  Credibility adjustments. All insurers experience some random  variability in their claims, where actual claims experience varies from  expected experience. The impact of these deviations is less for health  plans with a larger customer base. To help address the  disproportionate impact of claims variability on small health plans,  adjustments to MLRs are permitted for these plans. Specifically,  MLRs for plans with  less than 1,000 life years will be considered \u201cnoncredible\u201d and will  be presumed to meet the MLR requirements;  \uf0b7  1,000 to less than 75,000 life years will be considered \u201cpartially  credible\u201d and may receive an upward adjustment ranging from   1.2 to 8.3 percentage points, depending on size, and a further  adjustment if they have high deductibles; and  \uf0b7  75,000 life years or more will be considered \u201cfully credible\u201d and will  not receive an adjustment.", "HHS estimates show that for 2011 a small fraction of insurers that offer  plans in the individual, small group, or large group markets would be  considered fully credible, but these insurers account for the majority of the  total life years covered by these types of plans. About half of insurers  that offer plans in the small and large group markets and a little less than  a third of insurers that offer plans in the individual market would be  partially credible and could apply a credibility adjustment.  \uf0b7  Years of data to include in calculating the MLR. Beginning in 2013,  insurers\u2019 MLRs will be calculated based on a 3-year period of the  accumulated experience for the current reporting year and the   2 preceding years. Because insurers will not have 3 years of MLR  data for 2011 and 2012, MLRs for these years will be calculated as  follows: (1) MLRs for 2011 will be calculated on their experience for  2011, (2) MLRs for plans that are fully credible in 2012 will be  calculated based on their experience for 2012, and (3) MLRs for plans  that are partially or noncredible in 2012 will be calculated based on  accumulated experience from 2011 and 2012.", "HHS\u2019s interim final rule also addressed areas that NAIC did not  specifically include in its recommendations, which focused primarily on  the definitions and methodologies used for calculating the MLR. Some  key areas are summarized below.  \uf0b7  Treatment of agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019 commissions and fees. HHS  explicitly listed agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019 commissions and fees as  nonclaims expenses. NAIC did not include any special treatment of  these expenses in its recommendation to HHS, but raised concerns  about the potential impact of the MLR requirements on the ability of  these professionals to continue assisting consumers. HHS officials  have continued to discuss this issue with NAIC. Legislation has also  since been introduced to deduct agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019 fees from  premiums in the MLR calculation.  \uf0b7  Adjustment to the standard for a state\u2019s individual market. In addition  to providing for credibility adjustments, PPACA provided HHS with the  authority to adjust the MLR standard for the individual market in a  state if it determines that the application of the standard may  destabilize the individual market in that state. Although NAIC\u2019s  recommendations to HHS did not specifically address adjustments to  the MLR standard for the individual market, NAIC did raise concerns  about the ability of many insurers to readily achieve an MLR of   80 percent. In the interim final rule, HHS established a process for  states to apply for an adjustment to the MLR standard for the  individual market in that state that included the information states  must provide in their applications and the criteria HHS would use to  assess the applications. As of July 25, 2011, 12 states and   1 territory had applied to HHS for an adjustment; HHS had granted an  adjustment of the MLR in 5 states, did not grant an adjustment in   1 state, and was in the process of reviewing the remaining  applications.  \uf0b7  Oversight. HHS is responsible for direct enforcement of the reporting  and rebate provisions of the MLR requirements, including that the  reports are submitted timely, that the data comply with the definitions  in the regulations, and that rebates are paid timely and accurately.  The interim final rule provides a framework through which HHS may  conduct audits to determine insurers\u2019 compliance with the provisions  and provides that HHS may, in its discretion, accept the findings of  audits that state regulators may conduct of an insurer\u2019s MLR reporting  and rebate obligations, as long as specified conditions are met. The  interim final rule also provides for the imposition of civil monetary  penalties if insurers fail to comply with the requirements.", "HHS received public comments on the interim final rule from  representatives of the insurance industry, consumers, state regulators,  and others, covering a wide range of topics, such as the treatment of  agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019 fees, the methodology for determining credibility  adjustments, and the treatment of taxes. According to HHS officials, HHS  has not determined when it will issue a final rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MLR Reporting", "paragraphs": ["PPACA MLRs will be reported to HHS every June and will reflect insurers\u2019  experiences from the previous calendar year.

For example, figure 2 shows that in 2009 traditional  MLRs in the individual market were more widely distributed than those in  the small and large group markets. Within this variation in the individual  market, a larger proportion of insurers generally had lower MLRs; that is,  they spent a lower percentage of their premiums on medical claims, as  compared to insurers in the small and large group markets. Under  PPACA, states may request adjustments to the MLR standard for the  individual market if application of the standard may destabilize that  market, for example, by causing insurers to exit the market, such that  insurance options are limited in the state.", "Annual fluctuations in insurers\u2019 traditional MLRs were also greater for  insurers in the individual market. For example, 70 percent of insurers in  the individual market experienced an average annual change in their  traditional MLRs of more than 5 percentage points from 2006 through  2009, compared to 46 percent in the small group market and 39 percent  in the large group market. Almost 12 percent of insurers in the individual  market averaged annual changes greater than 20 percentage points,  compared with about 4 percent of insurers in both the small group and  large group markets. Beginning in 2013, insurers will calculate their  PPACA MLRs based on 3 years of data, which could partially mitigate the  impact of variations often experienced by insurers from year to year.", "Traditional MLRs were also more varied for smaller insurers in all three  markets from 2006 through 2009. For example, figure 3 shows that in  2009 traditional MLRs for smaller insurers were more widely distributed  than those for larger insurers, with a higher percentage of smaller  insurers generally reporting lower MLRs. The credibility adjustments in  PPACA allow smaller insurers to upwardly adjust their MLRs. Data for  figure 3 are aggregated across all states that an insurer operates in.  However, since insurers are required to report their PPACA MLRs at the  state level, it is likely that in 2011 and beyond, more insurers will have  less than 75,000 life years in a market at the state level and will be  eligible for a credibility adjustment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PPACA MLRs Will Be Affected by Changes in the MLR Calculation and Insurers\u2019 Ability to Provide More Precise Data in 2011 and Beyond", "paragraphs": ["The insurers we interviewed said their PPACA MLRs will be affected by  changes in the MLR formula, primarily due to the deduction of taxes and  fees in the denominator, and to a lesser extent, the addition of expenses  for activities to improve health care quality in the numerator.

One insurer told us that the effect of  deducting taxes and fees for their 2010 MLRs was more than double the  effect of including their expenses for activities to improve health care  quality in the numerator. Another insurer told us that the effect of taxes  and fees would vary by state because state taxes, such as premium taxes  and other state assessments, can vary. Further, one insurer said that  while the deduction of taxes and fees was the largest component that  affected their 2010 MLRs, and resulted in increased MLRs, if the insurer  were to experience a loss in profits in a future year, and therefore a  reduction in its income taxes, the effect of this deduction could result in a  decrease in MLRs. Regulators from several state insurance  commissioners\u2019 offices also told us that they believed the deduction of  taxes and fees in the PPACA MLR formula would likely have the largest  impact on MLRs reported by insurers in 2010.", "Most of the insurers we interviewed also said including expenses in the  numerator of the PPACA formula for activities to improve health care  quality contributed to changes in the 2010 MLRs compared to what they  would have been under the traditional formula. However, including these  expenses had less of an effect on their MLRs than the deduction of taxes  and fees. One insurer estimated that the inclusion of these expenses in  the PPACA MLR formula would increase their MLRs by 0.5 percentage  points, but this was a fraction of the total estimated 2.0\u20132.5 percentage  point increase in their MLR overall, which the insurer said was primarily  due to the deduction of taxes and fees. Another insurer estimated that the  impact of including their expenses for quality improvement activities  would be less than 2 percentage points, but the deduction of taxes  represented the largest component driving the increase in their 2010  MLRs. In addition, two insurers said that including quality improvement  expenses would have very little impact on their PPACA MLRs. Examples  of activities that improve health care quality that insurers included in their  PPACA MLR were disease management programs, wellness activities,  24-hour nurse phone lines, and care coordination.", "Insurers that issue insurance plans in more than one state said that  disaggregating MLRs by state will likely result in some variation in their  MLRs across states. For example, one insurer said that a higher  proportion of their premium dollars are spent on administrative expenses  in one of their states because they tend to sell lower benefit plans, which  they said have high administrative costs relative to premiums, in this  state. While this insurer historically reported a single MLR combining data  across two states, they said the disaggregation by state required for the  PPACA MLR resulted in lower MLRs in the state with lower benefit plans  compared to the other state. For example, MLRs in this state were   1.5 percentage points lower in the individual market and 4.5 percentage  points lower in the small group market than the MLRs in the other state.  Another insurer said that prior to the PPACA MLR requirements they  priced insurance plans for the small group market to employers located in  two states as a single market. When they calculated the PPACA MLRs  separately for each state they noted variations between the two MLRs  because medical costs were different in each state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurers\u2019 Ability to Provide More Precise Data Will Affect PPACA MLRs Reported in 2011 and Beyond", "paragraphs": ["All of the insurers we spoke with said that their PPACA MLRs for 2011  and beyond will be more precise than the 2010 MLRs reported to NAIC  for several reasons. Because HHS\u2019s interim final rule on PPACA MLRs  was published in late 2010, insurers told us that they used their best  estimates to apply the PPACA definition to experiences incurred earlier in  the year. They said their PPACA MLRs for 2011 and beyond will be more  precise because they will not be based on estimates and they will have a  full year of data that they collected according to the new PPACA MLR  categories. A regulator from one state insurance commissioner\u2019s office  described 2010 as a \u201ctest\u201d year and said it will help insurers better  prepare to report their 2011 MLRs. The regulators also agreed that the  2010 MLR data would not be a clear indicator of insurers\u2019 expenses for  quality improvement activities because insurers\u2019 may vary in how  precisely they report these expenses. In addition, some insurers told us  they had never reported MLRs both by state and by insurance market  prior to the PPACA MLR requirements, and were having challenges  developing reasonable bases for allocating expenses across states and  insurance markets for their 2010 reporting. However, they expected these  issues to be resolved for 2011. For example, one insurer told us that their  medical quality activities are centralized and apply to all markets, but they  must now apportion their expenses for these activities by market, then to  each of their insurance companies, and then by state.

For  example, one insurer told us that their health IT is a centralized function  that is also used for other lines of insurance business, such as Medicare  and Medicaid, which they said are not subject to PPACA MLR  requirements. Another insurer said that determining their health IT  expenses was less clear relative to the other subcategories of activities to  improve health care quality in that it was hard to identify how much of  their internal IT system infrastructure uniquely supported the other eligible  quality activities. In addition, one insurer that only operates in a single  state said that identifying expenses for health IT was challenging when  factors such as facilities and employees\u2019 salaries had to be considered.

This insurer said these reductions will take effect gradually because  they are only being applied to new sales or when groups renew annually.  Another insurer lowered commissions to their brokers in the individual  market in the first quarter of 2011, such that premiums were increased  less than they otherwise would have been, which they expect to result in  an increase in their PPACA MLRs for 2011. In addition, one insurer said  they are considering reducing premiums in 2012 partly in response to the  PPACA MLR requirements and also in conjunction with a reduction in the  number of in-network physicians\u2014the combined strategy would help to  lower enrollee premiums and increase their MLRs.

One insurer said that they may reduce their expenses on activities that  HHS does not consider quality improvement activities in the PPACA MLR  formula, such as retrospective utilization review (a review of a patient\u2019s  records after the medical treatment has occurred) and increase expenses  for activities that qualify, such as prospective utilization review. Another  insurer said that they are no longer focusing as much on preauthorization  for inpatient admissions because this is not an eligible quality  improvement activity in the PPACA MLR formula. This insurer also said  the PPACA MLR requirements provide an incentive to spend more money  on quality improvement activities, which will affect their decisions on  implementing new activities in the future. Conversely, five other insurers  told us that the PPACA MLR requirements are not a factor in decisions  about their activities to improve health care quality.", "Insurers we interviewed also varied on how the PPACA MLR  requirements may affect where they do business.

One for-profit insurer told us that  they plan to exit or stop issuing new business in the individual market in  multiple states as well as consolidating some of their insurance  companies in some states in which they did not think they would meet  PPACA MLR requirements. Several other insurers said that the PPACA  MLR requirements will not affect decisions on where they do business.
