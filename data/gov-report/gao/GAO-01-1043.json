To begin the process of making partial restitution to these victims, the President signed into law the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) in 1990. RECA established the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund), criteria for determining claimant eligibility for compensation, and a program (administered by the Attorney General) to process and adjudicate claims under the act. The Department of Justice (DOJ) established the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) within its Civil Division to administer its responsibilities under the act. Through the end of fiscal year 2000, RECP received 7,819 applications for compensation. Roughly equal numbers of applications have been approved and denied, awarding compensation to about 46 percent of the claimants and denying compensation to about 46 percent. RECA claims are most often denied because the victim's disease is not eligible for compensation under the RECA program. The costs for administering RECP have fluctuated from the first full year of program implementation, fiscal year 1993, through fiscal year 2000. For example, administrative costs were $2.1 million in fiscal year 1993 and $1.3 million in fiscal year 2000. DOJ has procedures in place to certify that funds are appropriately disbursed from the Trust Fund. A review of the payment documentation for 30 randomly selected RECA cases in which compensation was awarded indicated that all payments were made as authorized. To identify and inform candidates of their potential eligibility for compensation under the program and to help them apply for funds, RECP engages in three primary outreach programs.

Many people exposed to radiation resulting from the nuclear weapons testing program subsequently developed serious diseases, including various types of cancer. On October 15, 1990, in order to establish a procedure to make partial restitution to these victims for their suffering, the President signed into law the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). RECA established the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund), criteria for determining claimant eligibility for compensation, and a program (administered by the Attorney General) to process and adjudicate claims under the act. The Department of Justice (DOJ) established the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) within its Civil Division to administer its responsibilities under the act. Almost 2 years later, RECP began processing claims in April 1992. RECA has been amended several times, most recently on July 10, 2000, when the President signed into law the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000.

The law established three claimant categories\u2014uranium mine employees (those who worked in underground uranium mines in certain specified states), downwinders (those who were downwind from aboveground nuclear weapons tests conducted at the Nevada test sites), and onsite participants (those who actually participated onsite in aboveground nuclear weapons tests). Table 1 summarizes the key provisions of RECA by type of claim, prior to the RECA 2000 Amendments.", "In addition to creating eligibility criteria for compensation, the law stipulates that appropriated funds be held in the Trust Fund to pay claims. By law, the Trust Fund is to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury but maintained by the Attorney General. The Attorney General is also responsible for reviewing applications to determine whether applicants qualify for compensation and establishing procedures for paying claims. To discharge these two responsibilities, the Attorney General issued a final regulation implementing RECP on April 10, 1992.", "The regulation established RECP within Justice\u2019s Civil Division and charged it with administering claims adjudication and compensation under the act. To file for compensation, applicants submit the appropriate claims forms along with corroborating documentation to RECP, whose claims examiners and legal staff review and adjudicate the claims. If the claim is approved, Justice authorizes the Treasury Department to make payment from the Trust Fund. If the victim is deceased, compensation may be awarded to the victim\u2019s eligible survivors (e.g., the victim\u2019s spouse or children). Figure 1 shows RECP\u2019s claims adjudication process, including the procedures for refiling and administratively appealing denied claims.", "If RECP denies a claim, it notifies the claimant in writing of the basis for the denial and the claimant\u2019s rights to refile or appeal the claim. Claimants may refile a claim with new information to RECP up to two times. If denied, claimants may file an administrative appeal to a Justice Appeals Officer, who can affirm or reverse the original decision or remand the claim back to RECP for further action. Applicants may also appeal denied claims in the U.S. district courts. RECP officials said that through July 3, 2001, claimants sought a judicial remedy only eight times.", "More recently, the Attorney General approved revisions to the regulations, effective April 21, 1999, to assist claimants in establishing entitlement to an award. The revised regulations modified eligibility restrictions regarding the claimants\u2019 use of tobacco. Prior to the revision, RECP would apply stricter standards if the victim contracted certain qualifying diseases and was a \u201cheavy smoker\u201d or \u201cheavy drinker.\u201d The revised regulations, among other things, allow claimants to submit affidavits to establish smoking use histories and to submit pathology reports showing specified diseases. In addition, the changes permit applicants, whose claims were denied prior to the implementation of these regulations, to file another three times.", "The RECA Amendments of 2000, signed into law by the President on July 10, 2000, expanded the criteria for compensation, opening RECP to more people and establishing a prompt payment period. Some of the major changes include:   permitting eligible aboveground uranium mine employees, uranium mill workers, and individuals, who transported uranium ore, to qualify for compensation; they are entitled to a payment of $100,000; increasing the geographic areas included for eligibility and extending the time period considered for radiation exposure for uranium mine employees;   expanding the list of specified diseases that may qualify individuals for compensation to include other types of cancer and also noncancers (e.g., salivary gland, brain, and colon cancer);   decreasing the level of radiation exposure that is necessary to qualify for compensation for uranium mine employees;  making certain medical documentation requirements less stringent for   eliminating distinctions between smokers and nonsmokers pertaining to diseases such as lung cancer and nonmalignant respiratory diseases; and requiring the Attorney General to ensure that a claim is paid within 6 weeks of approval.", "In addition to RECA, other programs provide compensation to persons who have presumably become ill as a result of working for the federal government in producing or testing nuclear weapons. For example, the Radiation-Exposed Veterans Compensation Act of 1988, in general, provides monthly compensation to veterans who were present at certain atomic bomb exercises, served at Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the post World War II occupation of Japan, or were prisoners of war in Japan. In addition, on October 30, 2000, the President signed into law The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. Title XXXVI of this act establishes the \u201cEnergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program\u201d to, in general, compensate covered employees who contracted certain illnesses resulting from exposure to certain ultra- hazardous materials during employment in Department of Energy facilities that processed or produced radioactive materials used in the production of atomic weapons. Certain uranium employees who are eligible for compensation under RECA may also be eligible for additional compensation and medical benefits under title XXXVI.
