NSPM-14 established a governance structure composed of relevant federal agencies and chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to guide implementation. It also required federal agencies with biodefense responsibilities to collect and assess data on their biodefense activities to, among other things, identify gaps.", "There are a number of challenges, however, that could limit long-term implementation success. Among other things, there was no documented methodology or guidance for how data are to be analyzed to help the enterprise identify gaps and opportunities to leverage resources, including no guidance on how nonfederal capabilities are to be accounted for in the analysis.", "Agency officials were also unsure how decisions would be made, especially if addressing gaps or opportunities to leverage resources involved redirecting resources across agency boundaries. Although HHS officials pointed to existing processes and directives for interagency decision making, GAO found there are no clear, detailed processes, roles, and responsibilities for joint decision-making, including how agencies will identify opportunities to leverage resources or who will make and enforce those decisions. As a result, questions remain about how this first-year effort to catalogue all existing activities will result in a decision-making approach that involves jointly defining and managing risk at the enterprise level. Without clearly documented methods, guidance, processes, and roles and responsibilities for enterprise-wide decision-making, the effort runs the risk of failing to move away from traditional mission stovepipes toward a strategic enterprise-wide approach that meaningfully enhances national capabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the February 2020 report, GAO made four recommendations to the Secretary of HHS, including working with other agencies to document methods for analysis and the processes, roles, and responsibilities for enterprise-wide decision making.

Catastrophic biological threats  highlight the inextricable link between security and public health  concerns. These threats\u2014whether naturally-occurring, intentional, or  accidental\u2014have the potential to cause loss of life and sustained damage  to the economy, societal stability, and global security. The vast and  evolving biological threat landscape includes threats of naturally-occurring  infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and safety and security lapses at  facilities that house biological threat agents. For example, the  unpredictable nature of naturally-occurring disease, such as the novel  coronavirus (COVID-19), poses a threat to humans. As of March 5, 2020,  COVID-19 has spread from China to nearly 80 countries, including the  United States, which has over 150 cases and nearly a dozen deaths  associated with the virus. This novel virus poses a public health and  economic threat, and may eventually be declared a pandemic, as seen  with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Infectious  diseases, such as coronaviruses, can be transmissible from animals to  humans, demonstrating how our relationships with animals may increase  the risk of disease transmission among people, pets, livestock, and  wildlife.", "Since March 2011, we have called for a more strategic approach to  guiding the systematic identification of risks, assessing resources needed  to address those risks, and prioritizing and allocating investments across  the biodefense enterprise. At that time, we said the biodefense  enterprise would benefit from institutionalized leadership with sufficient  time, responsibility, authority, and resources needed to promote efficiency  and accountability. Similarly, so that leadership can help to ensure that  federal programs are well coordinated, and that gaps and duplication in  capabilities are avoided, we called for a strategy that would help ensure  that plans and actions across various biodefense functions are cohesive,  compatible, and mutually reinforcing.", "Signed into law in December 2016, the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) required the departments of Defense  (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS),  and Agriculture (USDA) to jointly develop a national biodefense strategy  and associated implementation plan. In September 2018, the White  House issued the National Biodefense Strategy (Strategy) and  characterized it as a new direction to protect the nation against biological  threats, stating that its implementation would promote a more efficient,  coordinated, and accountable biodefense enterprise. At the same time,  the President issued the Presidential Memorandum on the Support for  National Biodefense/National Security Presidential Memorandum-14  (NSPM-14), which details a governance structure and implementation  process to achieve the Strategy\u2019s goals. For example, it established two  governing bodies: the Biodefense Steering Committee\u2014chaired by the  Secretary of HHS\u2014and the Biodefense Coordination Team to support the  efforts of the Steering Committee.", "Our testimony today highlights key findings from our February 2020  report, which analyzed the extent to which the Strategy and related  implementation efforts are designed to allow an enterprise-wide  approach. We made four recommendations to HHS in our report, aimed  at improving the Strategy\u2019s implementation. HHS concurred with our  recommendations.", "For our February 2020 report, we evaluated the early Strategy  implementation efforts of HHS, DOD, USDA, and DHS; the departments  of State, Justice (specifically the FBI), and Veterans Affairs (VA); and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We analyzed the Strategy and  associated plans, reviewed agency products created in response to  requirements set forth in NSPM-14, and solicited perspectives from key  officials in the eight agencies named above. More information on our  scope and methodology can be found in the report. The work on which  this statement is based was performed from October 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Biodefense Strategy Provides Opportunity to Create an Enterprise-Wide Approach, but Implementation Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["We found that the National Biodefense Strategy and associated plans  bring together all the key elements of federal biodefense capabilities,  which presents an opportunity to identify gaps and consider enterprise- wide risk and resources for investment trade-off decisions. However,  challenges with planning to manage change; limited guidance and  methods for analyzing capabilities; and lack of clarity about decision- making processes, roles, and responsibilities while adapting to a new  enterprise-wide approach could limit the success of the Strategy\u2019s  implementation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Framework Created to Assess Enterprise-Wide National Biodefense Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The National Biodefense Strategy and its associated plans bring together  the efforts of federal agencies with significant biodefense roles,  responsibilities, and resources to address naturally-occurring, accidental,  and intentional threats. The Strategy and plans also provide processes for  collecting and analyzing comprehensive information across the  enterprise, an important step toward the kind of enterprise-wide strategic  decision-making we have called for. The Strategy defines the term  \u201cbiothreat\u201d broadly to include all sources of major catastrophic risk,  including naturally-occurring biological threats, the accidental release of  pathogens, and the deliberate use of biological weapons. Officials we  interviewed noted that this is the first time that the federal government  has identified activities across the whole biodefense enterprise and  assessed resources and gaps to address multiple sources of threat  regardless of source.", "The Strategy also outlines high-level goals and objectives to help define  priorities. NSPM-14, which was issued to support the strategy,  established a structure and process by which federal agencies can  assess enterprise-wide biodefense capabilities and needs, and  subsequently develop guidance to help inform agency budget  submissions. NSPM-14 lays out, in broad strokes, a process to identify  biodefense efforts and assess how current resources support the  Strategy, how existing programs and resources could better align with the  Strategy, and how additional resources, if available, could be applied to  support the goals of the Strategy. As shown in figure 1, this process  begins through a data call with participating agencies documenting all  biodefense programs, projects, and activities within their purview in a  biodefense memorandum.", "In interviews, officials from participating agencies stated that the NSPM- 14 processes constitute a new approach to identifying gaps and setting  budget priorities for biodefense, and that they viewed the approach as  generally well designed. Additionally, agency officials said that the  assessment and joint policy guidance development process outlined in  NSPM-14 offered some promise for helping agencies identify the  resources necessary to achieve the Strategy\u2019s goals. Nevertheless,  officials from all of the agencies we interviewed, even those with the most  optimistic views on the leadership and governance structure design,  tempered their responses with the caveat that implementation is in such  early stages that it remains to be seen how effective these structures will  actually be once tested."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["In our February 2020 report, we also identified challenges that if not  addressed could hinder enterprise-wide biodefense efforts. Specifically,  although the Strategy and associated plans establish the foundation for  enterprise risk management, we and biodefense agency officials  identified multiple challenges that could affect the Strategy\u2019s  implementation. These include challenges individual agencies faced  during the initial data collection process as well as a lack of planning and  guidance to support an enterprise-wide approach. In our analyses and  interviews, we found that parts of the process in the first year were  underdeveloped, raising questions about (1) the plans to support change  management practices and ensure that early-implementation limitations  do not become institutionalized in future years\u2019 efforts; (2) guidance and  methods for meaningfully analyzing the data; and (3) the clarity of  decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities.", "Challenges adapting to new procedures. During our interviews, agency  officials reported challenges they faced in the first-year\u2019s data collection  effort. These challenges may have led to incomplete data collection, but  are not wholly unexpected given they occurred in the context of the  individual agencies and officials adapting to new procedures and a  broader cultural shift from how they have approached their biodefense  missions in the past. Officials told us that because of the learning involved  the first time through the process, agencies may not have submitted  complete or detailed information about their biodefense programs. Some  officials we interviewed voiced concern that this first-year effort could set  a poor precedent for these activities in future years if the challenges are  not acknowledged and addressed. For example, an official noted that  committing to the first-year\u2019s results as the \u201cbaseline\u201d for future years of  the Strategy\u2019s implementation could compound or institutionalize the  issues encountered in the first year. Officials from HHS and Office of  Management and Budget staff stressed that this process will be iterative,  with the first year being primarily about outlining the existing biodefense  landscape.", "Our prior work on organizational transformations states that incorporating  change management practices improves the likelihood of successful  reforms and notes that it is important to recognize agency cultural factors  that can either help or inhibit reform efforts. However, the agencies  involved in implementing the Strategy do not have a plan that includes  change management practices that can help prevent these challenges  from being carried forward into future efforts, and help reinforce  enterprise-wide approaches, among other things. To address this issue,  we recommended the Secretary of HHS direct the Biodefense  Coordination Team to establish a plan that includes change management  practices\u2014such as strategies for feedback, communication, and  education\u2014to reinforce collaborative behaviors and enterprise-wide  approaches and to help prevent early implementation challenges from  becoming institutionalized. HHS concurred with this recommendation.", "Guidance and methods for analyzing data. We found a lack of clear  procedures and planning to help ensure that the Biodefense Coordination  Team is prepared to analyze the data, once it has been collected, in a  way that leads to recognition of meaningful opportunities to leverage  resources in efforts to maintain and advance national biodefence  capabilities. In particular, HHS (1) has not documented guidance and  methods for analyzing the data, including but not limited to methods and  guidance for how to account for the contribution of nonfederal capabilities;  and (2) does not have a resource plan for staffing and sustaining ongoing  efforts. Specifically, we found that the processes for the Biodefense  Coordination Team to analyze the results of all the individual agency data  submissions and identify priorities to guide resource allocation were not  agreed upon or documented prior to the agency efforts and continue to  lack specificity and transparency. In our interviews, officials from four  agencies said they were uncertain about fundamental elements of the  implementation process, including how information gathered will be used  to identify gaps and set priorities. Additionally, the initial effort to collect  information on all programs, projects, and activities focused on existing  federal activities and did not include a complete assessment of  biodefense capabilities at the nonfederal level \u0336 capabilities needed to  achieve the goals and objectives outlined in the Strategy.", "Officials we interviewed also expressed concern about the resources that  the Biodefense Coordination Team had available to it, both in the first  year and on an ongoing basis. The officials told us that not all agencies  were able to provide a full-time detailee to help support the team. We  have previously reported that agencies need to identify how interagency  groups will be funded and staffed. However, officials from multiple  agencies told us that the initial planning for the staffing and  responsibilities for the Biodefense Coordination Team had not been  finalized. Without a plan to help ensure sufficient resources and mitigate  resource challenges for ongoing efforts, the Biodefense Coordination  Team risks not having the capacity it needs to conduct meaningful  analysis, which would undermine the vision created by the Strategy and  NSPM-14. To address these issues, we recommended the Secretary of  HHS direct the Biodefense Coordination Team to (1) clearly document  guidance and methods for analyzing the data collected from the agencies,  including ensuring that nonfederal resources and capabilities are  accounted for in the analysis, and (2) establish a resource plan to staff,  support, and sustain its ongoing efforts. HHS concurred with both  recommendations.", "Roles and responsibilities for joint decision-making. The governing  bodies overseeing the National Biodefense Strategy\u2019s implementation\u2014 the Biodefense Steering Committee and Biodefense Coordination  Team\u2014did not clearly document key components of the assessment  process and roles and responsibilities for joint decision-making in the first  year of NSPM-14 implementation. This raises questions about how these  bodies will move from an effort to catalog all existing activities to decision- making that accounts for enterprise-wide needs and opportunities. For  example, officials from multiple agencies were not certain how the  governing bodies would make joint decisions regarding priority-setting  and the allocation of resources, how they would assign new biodefense  responsibilities if gaps were identified, and to what extent the Biodefense  Steering Committee could enforce budgetary priorities, if at all.", "We also found a lack of shared understanding and agreement about how  the interagency process would work to align resources toward any  identified gaps and reconfigure resources for any identified redundancies  or inefficiencies. Additionally, we found that Presidential memorandums  guiding the process did not detail specific decision-making principles or  steps for reaching consensus or even for raising decision points about  how to best leverage or direct resources across the enterprise in  response to any gaps or inefficiencies. Similarly, agency officials we  interviewed were not clear how this process would work, how decisions  would be made, or how agencies would agree to take on new  responsibilities to bridge gaps to achieve the Strategy\u2019s goals.", "Further, the governing bodies have not fully defined the roles and  responsibilities for making enterprise-wide decisions that affect individual  agency budgets and for enforcing enterprise-wide budget priorities. As  with other parts of the NSPM-14 implementation process, the details  regarding specific roles and responsibilities for directing and enforcing  budget decisions lack detail and specificity. Additionally, officials from four  agencies stated that the charter for the Biodefense Coordination Team  has not been finalized, further delaying the articulation of roles and  responsibilities and the ability to establish a shared agenda and common  operating picture. As a result, some officials remain skeptical of the  effectiveness of any decisions made.", "We previously reported that effective national strategies should help  clarify implementing organizations\u2019 relationships in terms of leading,  supporting, and partnering. In the context of the Strategy, that includes  how enterprise-wide decisions about leveraging or directing resources to  fill gaps and reduce inefficiency will be made and by whom. Similarly, our  previous work has found that articulating and agreeing to a process for  making and enforcing decisions and clarifying roles and responsibilities  can improve the clarity surrounding a shared outcome, and that  articulating these agreements in formal documents can strengthen  agency commitment to working collaboratively and provide the overall  framework for accountability and oversight. Uncertainty around the  mechanisms to identify enterprise-wide priorities along with the lack of  clearly documented and agreed upon processes, roles, and  responsibilities for joint decision-making jeopardize the Strategy\u2019s ability  to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the nation\u2019s biodefense  capabilities. To address this issue, we recommended that the Secretary  of HHS direct the Biodefense Coordination Team to clearly document  agreed upon processes, roles, and responsibilities for making and  enforcing enterprise-wide decisions. HHS concurred.", "In conclusion, the current COVID-19 outbreak demonstrates that  responding to the ever-changing nature and broad array of biological  threats is challenging. The National Biodefense Strategy calls for the  need to improve state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, federal,  regional, and international surveillance systems and networks to contain,  control and respond to biological incidents. As the current coronavirus  outbreak continues to cross regional and international borders, the federal  government must take necessary steps to protect the American public.", "At the same time, we must not lose sight of the next threat. The National  Biodefense Strategy and NSPM-14 put in place a framework to be able to  assess threats and make difficult decisions about how to apply limited  resources to achieve the best benefit. However, the Strategy is only as  good as its implementation. Taking the necessary steps to address the  recommendations we have made regarding managing this cultural  change, analyzing data, ensuring sufficient resources to maintain  implementation efforts, and clearly articulating roles and responsibilities  for joint decision-making will better position our nation for the threats we  face today and in the future.", "Chairwoman Maloney, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes our prepared statement.
