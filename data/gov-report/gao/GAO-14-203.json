This report addresses (1) the federal government's efforts to ensure the availability of broadband services for small businesses, and (2) the effect of selected federally funded and municipal networks on broadband service and small businesses. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from five federal agencies that support broadband deployment and research on broadband availability. GAO interviewed service providers that received federal funding, municipal network operators, and small businesses in four states, and collected speeds and prices for broadband services in selected communities in these states. The states, communities, and businesses were selected based on the presence and use of a federally funded or municipal network.", "GAO is not making any recommendations.

For example, the Community Connect grants require providers to serve all businesses and residences in deployment areas. Since these federal programs do not target deployment to small businesses, they do not measure the impact on small businesses. However, BIP has a specific goal to increase access to rural Americans and provide broadband speeds to businesses, and in August 2013, the United States Department of Agriculture reported BIP's funding had resulted in over 5,800 businesses' receiving new or improved broadband service since 2009. Other programs have broader goals and measures related to the program's purpose, such as serving schools and libraries.", "Improvements to broadband service have resulted from federal funding and the existence of municipally operated networks. Service providers have used federal funding for expansions and upgrades, such as building out to previously unserved areas and replacing old copper lines with fiber optic cable, resulting in faster and more reliable broadband connections. GAO examined broadband services for 14 federally funded and municipal networks and found they tended to have higher speeds than other networks. For example, in 9 of the 14 communities where GAO collected information on broadband speeds and prices, federally funded or municipal networks offered higher top speeds than other networks in the same community and networks in nearby communities. Additionally, prices charged by federally funded and municipal networks were slightly lower than the comparison networks' prices for similar speeds. Prices for lower to mid-range speed tiers available from federally funded and municipal networks in nonurban areas also compared favorably to prices in urban areas in the same state. However, providers in urban areas were more likely than those in nonurban areas to offer higher speeds. According to small businesses GAO met with, the speed and reliability of their broadband service improved after they began using federally funded or municipal networks. Furthermore, according to small business owners, the improvements to broadband service have helped the businesses improve efficiency and streamline operations.

For example, Intermountain Cable in  eastern Kentucky used a Community Connect grant to expand its  broadband network to Hurley, Virginia. According to officials at  Intermountain Cable, Hurley previously only had satellite broadband  service. SandyNet, a municipal broadband provider in Sandy, Oregon,  used BIP funding to build fiber optic lines, allowing SandyNet to expand  its wireless service further into rural areas.

The price differences are greater in the 7 to 10 Mbps download range,  where federally funded and municipally operated networks\u2019 prices were  on average about $30 less per month than nonfederally funded networks  in the same community and about $35 less per month than networks in  comparison communities. There were some cases where federally funded  or municipal networks offered substantially lower prices than networks in  comparison towns, such as the municipal network in Windom, Minnesota,  which offered 10 Mbps download service for approximately $38 a month,  while two networks in a comparison town offered the same speed for  about $100 to $110 per month.

The lower prices offered by networks in nonurban  communities could be due to providers having lower costs to recoup  because some receive federal or municipal support or due to the limits  imposed by weak market demand, typical of many nonurban areas. In this  analysis it is difficult to identify the exact reason for the lower prices in the  nonurban communities.

Table 5 lists  the locations visited, the nearby towns, and the urban areas visited in  each state. In total we collected pricing information on fourteen nonurban  towns that received federal funding or have a municipal network, 14  nonurban comparison towns, and 8 urban areas. We used the National  Broadband Map, a joint effort of NTIA and FCC to analyze and map  broadband speeds, and comparable efforts managed by the states to  identify wireline service providers in these locations. For each service  provider identified, we collected information on advertised download and  upload speeds offered to small businesses and the monthly rate charged.  We collected unbundled, month-to-month pricing when available. Some  service providers required a customer to have a telephone line and some  required a contract ranging from 2 months to 2 years. If the service  provider did not provide separate pricing for small businesses, we  collected residential speed and pricing information. We obtained this  information from service providers\u2019 websites or if not available online by  calling the company directly. We requested speed and pricing for each  city and town in the sample\u2014either by the town\u2019s name or by a specific  address if the service provider required one. We analyzed the  information collected to identify difference in speeds and prices between  the locations with federally funded or municipal networks and similar  towns without such networks, as well as between urban and nonurban  locations. Because this information is drawn from a nonprobability  sample, it cannot be generalized to all locations with federally funded or  municipal networks, all urban locations, or all nonurban locations.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2013 to February  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Speeds and Prices Offered by Federally Funded and Municipal Broadband Service Providers That Were Part of GAO\u2019s Analysis, as of September 30, 2013", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: Speeds and Prices Offered by  Federally Funded and Municipal Broadband  Service Providers That Were Part of GAO\u2019s  Analysis, as of September 30, 2013 Top  available  advertised  speed (Mbps)", "Most common speed  subscribed to by  businesses (Mbps)", "Information for broadband speed and pricing is reported here only for the Georgia Communications  Cooperative, a member of the North Georgia Network.
