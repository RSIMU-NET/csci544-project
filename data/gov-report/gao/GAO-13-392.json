To conduct this study, GAO selected states and programs based on characteristics affecting pass-through grants management. GAO reviewed documentation on government-wide regulations and selected federal pass-through grant programs; reviewed monitoring reports and audits of state pass-through entities; and interviewed federal and state officials, as well as subrecipients and others with relevant expertise.

Specific program policies can provide additional requirements for individual grant programs related to disbursement of funds. For example, as with the programs we reviewed, authorizing legislation may contain statutory limits on the amount of funds that states and local governments can withhold from the grant awards for their own administrative expenses. To ensure states comply with federal requirements and agency regulations for disbursing federal grant funds, federal agencies monitor aspects of pass-through grants related to administrative costs that states withhold and timeliness of reimbursement. According to their monitoring procedures, selected federal agencies also review the results of states' \"single audits\"--annual audits performed on many recipients of federal funds.", "Selected states' pass-through grant disbursement practices varied for the three programs GAO reviewed, but generally complied with federal requirements.

This network of grantors  and grantees provides many services critical to the nation\u2019s interest, and  by leveraging the funds and expertise of entities within the granting  network, these services can be delivered more efficiently. Over the last  several years, current economic conditions have placed financial strain on  all governmental sectors\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014as well as nonprofit  organizations, and the efficient management of these grant programs at  all levels is critical.

These pass-through grants use  entities such as local governments and nonprofit organizations that are  located where services are needed to deliver the services and allow  states flexibility to determine the specific purposes and needs to which  grant funds should be directed. With these grant programs, federal  agencies partner with grantees not solely to deliver services, but also to  determine which subrecipients receive funds and aid in program  administration. With multiple levels involved, administrative challenges  can include transfer of funds, funding of grant administration at various  levels, and oversight of the subrecipients to which funds are passed.

We then selected three federal  pass-through programs to gain information on the federal pass-through  grant process, reviewed documentation on the selected programs, such  as program and monitoring guidance, and discussed application of this  guidance with agency officials. We selected programs within these  agencies that were of a typical size for that agency.

Massachusetts is a medium-sized commonwealth in the Northeast  Census region that has a relatively high per capita granting amount.  Tennessee is a medium-sized state in the South Census region with an  average per capita granting amount.

This process typically involves subrecipients  applying for grant funds and, if grant funds are awarded, entering into a  grant agreement with the prime recipient. After prime recipients enter into  agreements with subrecipients, funds may be distributed to the  subrecipient. Funds for many grants to subrecipients are distributed on a  reimbursable basis, with the subrecipient incurring an expense and then  reporting that expense to the prime recipient who then reimburses the  subrecipient. Significant gaps in the time or amount of funding provided  could lead to financial instability of the subrecipient.", "States, as prime recipients, may exercise flexibility in many aspects of  pass-through grant administration.

States have some flexibility  in determining whether a grant will be distributed on a reimbursement  basis or through a cash advance. For the selected programs in the  selected states, the frequency with which subrecipients were allowed to  request a reimbursement ranged from whenever the subrecipient needed  funds to once a quarter. For example, in Tennessee, all selected grant  programs allowed subrecipients to request reimbursements once a  month. In Massachusetts, CSBG subrecipients received a portion of their  grant on a monthly basis, while recipients of the Byrne JAG program were  generally allowed to request reimbursements once a quarter.

According to state officials we interviewed, subrecipients  generally receive payment within 30 days, particularly since the payments  are delivered through electronic fund transfer. However, according to  these state officials, if reimbursement delays occur, they are generally  related to a lack of documentation required for approval.", "States may withhold a portion of a grant to help defray the costs of  managing the grant, and the states we reviewed exercised some flexibility  in their use of these funds. Allowable administrative costs can generally  include areas such as personnel or accounting costs. For pass-through  grants, the state may be able to use these funds for expenses related to  monitoring subrecipients. States may specify how they intend to use  administrative funds in documents submitted to the granting agency. The  states and programs we reviewed varied in how they described their use  of administrative funds. For example, as noted earlier, according to HHS  documents, up to 5 percent of a state\u2019s CSBG funds can be reserved for  administrative expenses, including monitoring activities. Furthermore,  state plans may provide more specific information regarding the use of  administrative funds. For instance, in the CSBG program for  Massachusetts, a portion of the 5 percent allocated for CSBG  administrative expenses and monitoring activities is earmarked for staff  salaries and associated fringe benefits. Another portion is earmarked for  direct administrative expenditures, such as office supplies, travel, and  state overhead.", "Federal program officials we spoke with said most states use the  maximum administrative funds allowed. They noted that they had seen  some states in the past use less than the maximum\u2014using these funds  for service delivery instead\u2014but they have seen these states begin to  withhold the maximum amount. Most state program officials we spoke  with said that they did withhold the full amount allowed for these costs.  However, in Tennessee, CSBG granting officials said they did not always  use the 5 percent allowed for special projects, but they plan to use the full  5 percent in the future.", "For the selected programs and states we reviewed, we found that states  worked within the federal requirements of their grant programs and  reimbursed the subrecipients within the time allowed in their grant  agreements. State agency officials for the selected federal programs in  each of the three selected states told us they had not received any  complaints from their subrecipients regarding timeliness of grant  reimbursements. Each of the three states had established procedures  and used automated systems to reimburse its subrecipients. In addition,  we learned that the states withheld administrative funds for federal grant  programs appropriately, in accordance with the amounts set by the  programs.", "Our review of the most recent federal agency monitoring reports for the  three programs reviewed in Illinois, Massachusetts, and Tennessee  showed that monitors found no issues related to excessive administrative  allowances or delays in fund disbursement. Monitoring reports were  completed for all selected states between 2008 through 2012. For the  Byrne JAG and state-administered CDBG program, all selected states  had at least one on-site review during this time period. For the CSBG  program, HHS conducted one on-site review of our selected states and is  currently drafting a report of the review. In addition, recent single audit  results for these three states do not indicate significant noncompliance  related to administrative allowances or fund disbursements.

Some subrecipients who commented on  the timeliness of reimbursement said they were reimbursed in a timely  manner. Other subrecipients we interviewed said they were aware of the  requirements for administrative funds withheld by states for their pass- through grant program. Nevertheless, even though their states generally  complied with federal regulations, some subrecipients we interviewed  expressed concerns related to reimbursement timeliness and  administrative funds withheld. While these concerns generally did not  identify instances of noncompliance with federal requirements, they did  illustrate how the pass-through grant process, subrecipients\u2019 perceptions  of the process, and state practices can potentially impact subrecipients.  For instance, although their states withheld administrative funds within  federal law, a few subrecipients we spoke with expressed frustration over  the amounts withheld because they did not feel their organizations were  being adequately reimbursed for their own administrative expenses. In  2010, we reported finding differences in the rate at which state and local  governments reimburse nonprofit organizations in select states. In  particular, we found that these differences, including whether nonprofit  organizations are reimbursed at all, depend largely on the policies and  procedures of the state and local governments that award federal funds to  nonprofit organizations.", "In addition, states may have their own processes to manage the  disbursement of state grant funds, which can affect subrecipients. For  example, subrecipients we spoke to in Illinois cited a delay in receiving  reimbursements of grant funds from their state general fund, which some  subrecipients said negatively affected the services they provide.  According to Illinois state officials, because the state has insufficient cash  to meet all obligations and has set priorities for paying monies from the  Illinois general fund, there can be up to a 9-month delay in disbursing  state grant funds that originate from the state\u2019s general fund. According to  a quarterly report issued by the Illinois Comptroller\u2019s Office, as of  December 31, 2012, pending vouchers from the state\u2019s general fund  dated back to August 2012. While these funds are not federal grant funds,  delays of this nature could affect a subrecipient\u2019s ability to deliver  services, particularly if the subrecipient is a smaller organization. As  subrecipients, nonprofit organizations often receive grants from multiple  sources to fund their services, and absent a sufficient safety net, such  delays in funding could hinder a nonprofit organization\u2019s ability to continue  to effectively partner with the federal government to provide services to  vulnerable populations. According to one subrecipient we interviewed,  despite having foundation funds to help mitigate cash flow issues, his  organization had to cut programs that served vulnerable populations\u2014 programs funded, in part, by pass-through grants\u2014because of issues  with the state funding for these services.", "In focus groups we held with subrecipients, several other concerns were  raised that can be linked to the multiple layers involved in managing pass- through grants. For example, the award process for pass-through grants  involves two steps\u2014allocating funding to states and awarding funds to  subrecipients\u2014which subrecipients said could extend the time it takes to  receive a grant and cause funding uncertainty for a subrecipient.  Furthermore, although monitoring serves as an important tool for internal  control, distinct federal and state monitoring requirements may lead to  additional responsibilities for subrecipients. For example, some  subrecipients we interviewed said they may have to report the same or  similar information to multiple granting entities, resulting in duplicative or  redundant reporting. Federal agencies may require states, as part of their  responsibilities as pass-through entities, to conduct monitoring site visits  of subrecipients; however, the three federal agencies we selected may  also conduct site visits to select subrecipients. Some subrecipients in our  focus groups that are required to have a single audit expressed frustration  that state monitors are looking at much of the same information contained  in the single audit. Some subrecipients in our focus groups said they  dedicate a significant amount of time to each step of the monitoring  process, so duplicative or redundant reporting may reduce the amount of  time they can devote to service delivery. We have additional work under  way for the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs that looks more closely at federal grants management reform  efforts, including what actions have been taken to address challenges  such as communicating with grantee recipients.

To select these programs, we examined data on  grant programs from USASpending.gov to determine the amount federal  agencies awarded in grant funds across the agency and the amount of  grant funds awarded by grant program. We identified programs that had  significant pass-through requirements with a range of subrecipients. We  also identified programs in which we had conducted past work in order to  leverage resources. Table 3 presents the programs we selected and the  criteria for this selection.", "To determine states\u2019 practices in disbursing federal grant funds to  subrecipients, we identified three states to illustrate variation in states\u2019  management of pass-through grants. We based the decision on state  population, the amount of federal grants awarded to the state, and the  census region (as shown in table 4). We also considered the per capita  grant amount for each state, recommendations of subject matter experts  and stakeholders in the field of grant administration, and results from a  2010 Urban Institute study on nonprofit organizations\u2019 perceptions of   With the subject matter expert  states\u2019 grant administration practices.recommendation and the survey results, we identified states with a range  of reputations in grant administration.", "We conducted site visits at each of these three states, interviewing state  financial control officials, such as staff from the state auditor or state  comptroller office, to identify state procedures for managing grant funds.  We also interviewed administrators of the three selected programs to  determine their procedures for administering the selected grant programs.  We reviewed monitoring reports for select states\u2019 administration of the  selected programs. We also reviewed 3 years worth of single audit  reports for the select states to identify potential cash management issues.  While the programs and states we reviewed present differences in the  management of pass-through grants, they do not represent a  generalizable sample, thus information we obtained from them cannot be  generalized to all federal agencies and related grant programs or state  recipients. However, they provide insights and examples related to pass- through grants management.", "To determine the impact on recipients of state practices in disbursing  grant funds, we convened focus groups of subrecipients in each of the  three states we visited. In each state, we conducted two focus groups:  one of subrecipients from local governments and one of subrecipients  from nonprofit organizations. The primary criterion for selecting  participants was that they were subrecipients of federal grants. To identify  these subrecipients, we used sources including the Single Audit  Clearinghouse, referrals from state agency officials or nonprofit  organizations, and state-specific sources of information on grantees.  Each focus group had from 4 to 8 participants and there were a total of 34  participants across the three states. At these focus groups, we discussed  how federal and state management of pass-through grants positively  impacted their organizations as well as suggestions for improvement. We  also reviewed external literature and discussed concerns with stakeholder  groups including the National Council of Nonprofits and the National  Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 to April 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Carol Patey, Assistant Director;  Veronica Mayhand; Sarah McGrath; Jeffrey Niblack; Robert Robinson;  Cynthia Saunders; Albert Sim; Sabrina Streagle; and Michelle Wong  made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
