TALF was designed to reopen the securitization markets in an effort to improve access to credit for consumers and businesses. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY), which manages TALF, is authorized to lend up to $200 billion to certain eligible borrowers in return for collateral in the form of securities that are forfeited if the loans are not repaid. To assist in this effort, Treasury has pledged $20 billion of TARP funds in the form of credit protection to the program in the event the loans are not repaid. As of December 2009, FRBNY has made about $61.6 billion in TALF loans, of which $47.5 billion remained outstanding. For most TALF-eligible collateral, FRBNY will stop providing new TALF loans in March 2010, while new-issue CMBSs will be accepted as collateral on new TALF loans through June 2010. Treasury and FRBNY analyses project minimal, if any, use of TARP funds for TALF-related losses, and Treasury currently anticipates a profit. While GAO found that the overall risks TALF poses to TARP funds are likely minimal, GAO analyses showed that CMBSs potentially pose higher risk of loss than ABSs. As shown in figure 1, ongoing uncertainty in the commercial real estate market and TALF exposure to legacy CMBSs warrant ongoing monitoring. Finally, TALF may present risks beyond the potential risks to TARP, such as the risk that FRBNY might fail to identify material noncompliance with program requirements by TALF participants. Because the Federal Reserve views TALF as a monetary policy tool, however, statutory limitations on GAO's authority prohibited GAO from auditing FRBNY's role in administering TALF. Treasury has not fully documented its rationale, as part of its decision-making processes, for reaching final decisions related to the risks of TALF--including decisions involving other agencies. For example, the outcomes of Treasury's internal analysis of the amount of equity that TALF borrowers should hold in TALF ABS collateral, along with other TALF program terms, sometimes differed from FRBNY's. However, there was no clear documentation or explanation of how the discrepancies were resolved or how final decisions were made with FRBNY. Documenting the rationale and basis for these decisions would increase transparency and strengthen internal controls for TALF decision-making processes. Moreover, a sound decision-making process would help ensure that TALF objectives are being met and that it is functioning as intended. Unless Treasury documents the basis for major program decisions that it made with the Federal Reserve, it cannot demonstrate accountability for meeting the goals of TALF and could unnecessarily place TARP funds at risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The recent financial crisis disrupted the securitization markets\u2014which  have funded an increasing share of consumer credit and small business  loans in recent years\u2014making credit less available to households and  small businesses. This \u201ccredit crunch\u201d has been a major factor behind the  weak economy and slow recovery. The Term Asset-Backed Securities  Loan Facility (TALF), which the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve) first announced in November 2008, was  created to help restore the securitization markets. The Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) provides credit protection for this program under the  Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), as authorized under the  Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA). The Federal  Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY), which manages TALF, is authorized  to lend up to $200 billion in 3- or 5-year nonrecourse loans to investors to  purchase AAA-rated asset-backed securities (ABS) and commercial  mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which are, in turn, pledged as  collateral for the loans. Nonrecourse loans are provided against collateral,  and if the loans are not repaid, FRBNY\u2019s only recourse is to assume  control of the pledged assets. If borrowers do not repay their TALF loans,  Treasury will fund the purchase of up to $20 billion of the collateral  backing the loans from FRBNY, creating exposure that places TARP funds,  and therefore taxpayers, at risk.", "EESA, which authorized TARP, also provided GAO with broad oversight  authorities for actions taken under TARP and requires GAO to report at  least every 60 days on TARP activities and performance. To fulfill our  statutorily mandated responsibilities, we have been monitoring and  providing updates on TARP programs, including TALF, in prior 60-day  reports. This report expands on previously reported TALF activities.", "The Federal Reserve created TALF under Section 13(3) of the Federal  Reserve Act, which permits the Federal Reserve to authorize a Federal  Reserve Bank to lend to nondepository institutions in \u201cunusual and  exigent circumstances.\u201d The Federal Reserve viewed creation of TALF as  part of its monetary policy activities because, having already reduced the  federal funds target rate to close to zero, it needed additional mechanisms,  like TALF, to provide liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in key  credit markets. GAO is prohibited by statute from auditing deliberations,  decisions, or actions by the Federal Reserve or any Federal Reserve bank  that are related to monetary policy matters. Accordingly, although the  Federal Reserve and FRBNY voluntarily gave us access to TALF-related  documents and staff, our review of TALF was limited and we did not  evaluate the actions of the Federal Reserve with respect to TALF. For  example, we did not assess FRBNY\u2019s system of internal controls or the  role of TALF participants\u2014such as agents, borrowers, or auditors\u2014in  certifying and validating compliance with the program\u2019s terms.

FRBNY has a  precertification process to streamline the process for certain eligible  borrowers. TALF precertification documents indicate that borrowers must  be deemed to be top-tier financial entities\u2014that is, they must be seen as  industry leaders and be ranked among the largest entities in the industry  or have some of the largest operations. During our audit, FRBNY officials  told us that they review loan requests from all borrowers that meet general  eligibility criteria, and that not all borrowers need to be precertified;  indeed, most are not precertified. Applicants must work through a TALF  agent throughout the application process. Because the agents must  demonstrate that they know a potential borrower and must vouch for its  reputation, they put applicants through a \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d program  based on provisions in the Patriot Act. Once this process is completed,  TALF agents submit a loan request package to FRBNY that includes:    borrower identification information, such as name, address, and tax  loan information, such as the requested loan amount ($10 million  minimum), the term of the loan, the loan rate, and the type of interest rate  (fixed or floating) that corresponds to the type of collateral offered;   collateral information, such as the CUSIPs of the securities, asset class  and subclass, price and face value of the collateral, the weighted average  life of the collateral, and the haircut amount\u2014a percentage assigned to  the loan based on the asset class, or subsector where appropriate, of the  collateral and its weighted average life;   any appropriate filing documents, including a prospectus and offering  documents of the securities expected to be pledged; and   proof of purchase for the ABSs and CMBSs that are being offered as  collateral.", "Next, the Bank of New York Mellon and FRBNY verify the data that the  TALF agents provide and, among other things, ensure that the ratings  submitted for the securities are the most recent. For legacy CMBS  collateral, FRBNY evaluates whether the price the TALF borrower paid  was reasonable based on pricing information FRBNY receives from the  collateral monitors and Bank of New York Mellon. The collateral  monitors, Trepp LLC and PIMCO, also conduct stress tests on pledged  legacy CMBS collateral to help ensure that the loan amounts will not  exceed the stressed value of the pledged securities. Three weeks prior to  each ABS subscription, a newly issued ABS undergoes a risk assessment  by FRBNY (with PIMCO\u2019s support) to determine if it is likely to be  accepted as TALF collateral. The issuer must provide FRBNY any  information it provided the NRSROs so FRBNY can conduct its own credit  risk assessment.

The haircut represents the difference between  the value of the proposed collateral and the value of the loan (table 2).", "As discussed earlier, the Bank of New York Mellon holds the collateral  throughout the life of the loan. As the collateral securities generate cash  flows, the Bank of New York Mellon makes all principal and interest  payments to FRBNY on behalf of the TALF borrower. The borrower may  earn returns from the collateral after all loan obligations have been  satisfied. As shown in figure 2, any returns that the collateral assets earn  beyond the required principal and interest payments is delivered to the  borrower via the TALF agent after all monthly loan payment obligations  are met. FRBNY retains a portion of the interest that is calculated using  Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) rates plus 25 basis points (approximately  the FRBNY\u2019s cost of funds). The remaining part of the TALF loan interest  payment is transferred to TALF LLC, which would use the funds to  purchase surrendered collateral before accessing funds from Treasury.  This accumulated interest from TALF loans is held in an account called  the cash collateral account, and the Bank of New York Mellon is  authorized to invest these funds on behalf of TALF LLC to earn interest  income.", "TALF offers nonrecourse loans, which allow borrowers to walk away\u2014or  stop paying a loan\u2014with no personal exposure for the unpaid portion of  the debt. In this case, borrowers would surrender their collateral through  a TALF agent, which would submit a collateral surrender form to FRBNY.  Within 10 days of receiving the surrender notice, the Bank of New York  Mellon cancels the outstanding balance of the loan and transfers the  related collateral to FRBNY. FRBNY has the option to sell the collateral to  TALF LLC (see fig. 3) at a price equal to the then outstanding principal  amount of the TALF loan plus accrued but unpaid interest. This process  has several steps:    FRBNY sends a purchase notice to TALF LLC. To purchase surrendered  assets, TALF LLC first uses funds that have been accumulating in the cash  collateral account (as of December 31, 2009, the account contained  approximately $198 million).", "When these funds are exhausted, TALF LLC borrows money to purchase  any surrendered assets. Its first source of borrowed funds is Treasury,  which has committed up to $20 billion in TARP funds to the TALF program  for this purpose. To obtain these funds, TALF LLC must submit a request  to Treasury (as the subordinate lender) one business day prior to the  desired funding date. Treasury\u2019s loan rate is equal to the 1-month London  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate plus 300 basis points.", "If the $20 billion TARP loan commitment is fully exhausted, TALF LLC  must ask FRBNY for a loan to purchase any additional surrendered assets.  FRBNY has committed to provide up to $180 billion to TALF LLC for this  purpose. TALF LLC must submit a borrowing request to FRBNY (as senior  lender) one business day prior to the desired funding date. The FRBNY\u2019s   loan rate is equal to the 1-month LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points.

Treasury and FRBNY  assessments, along with our analyses, however, suggest that a number of  factors reduce the likelihood of this occurring. First, certain TALF features  are designed to protect TARP funds and also limit taxpayer exposure.  Specifically, FRBNY officials told us that risks in TALF are managed based  on four pillars: credit protection, credit ratings, FRBNY due diligence, and  market discipline. FRBNY also sought market perspectives on the level of  returns from TALF-eligible securities that would be required to encourage  market participation while also ensuring proper due diligence by TALF  participants, which in turn reduces the risks to taxpayers. Second, most  ABSs issued since the credit crisis began contain features such as  increased levels of subordination and overcollateralization that reduce the  likelihood that TALF borrowers will stop payment on their loans. Third,  Treasury and FRBNY analyses project minimal, if any, likelihood that  TARP funds will be used for TALF-related purchases, and Treasury  currently projects a profit from TALF. While TALF poses minimal risks to  TARP even in adverse market conditions, our analyses showed that  CMBSs held as collateral as of September 2009 potentially pose higher  risks than ABSs and under adverse conditions losses could exceed $500  million. TALF presents a range of other taxpayer risks beyond those  presented to TARP funds. Such risks include the risk that FRBNY might  not identify instances of material noncompliance with program  requirements by TALF participants. However, because of statutory audit  limitations on GAO, this review has been limited to presenting only  descriptive information about FRBNY\u2019s role in TALF and we cannot  evaluate FRBNY\u2019s TALF operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Scenarios Could Provide TALF Borrowers with Economic Incentives to Stop Payment on Their Loans", "paragraphs": ["As of January 8, 2010, there have been no collateral surrenders by any  TALF borrowers, but in some instances, a TALF borrower could have an  economic incentive to stop payment on a loan and surrender the  underlying collateral. A number of scenarios could result in a borrower  walking away from a loan. For example, the collateral could lose value so  that the loan amount exceeded the value of the collateral. Or, the expected  returns from the collateral could be less than the cost of financing the  loan. Also, interest rates could rise across the board, decreasing the  market value of the collateral or making refinancing more difficult.", "A borrower can lose equity in the collateral if the collateral\u2019s value falls  below the outstanding loan balance. As discussed earlier, TALF\u2019s  established haircuts determine the amount of equity borrowers have in  their collateral. This equity represents the amount of money that a TALF  borrower would lose by surrendering the collateral and not repaying the  loan. For example, if the ABSs a borrower seeks to use as collateral on a  TALF loan were initially valued at $100,000, a haircut of 10 percent would  provide the TALF borrower with a $90,000 loan and require $10,000 of its  own funds to acquire the securities. This $10,000 represents the borrower\u2019s  equity in the securities. If the value of the collateral were to decline\u2014such  that the borrower could sell the securities only for some amount less than  $90,000\u2014and especially if it declined dramatically, the borrower could  decide to cut further losses by stopping payments on the loan and  surrendering the collateral. The borrower is particularly likely to make this  choice if such a situation occurs at the point when the loan matures.", "As TALF currently works, TALF borrowers earn the difference between  the ABS\u2019s return and the cost of borrowing from FRBNY on the TALF loan,  multiplied by the inverse of the borrower\u2019s percent equity stake. However,  if the returns on TALF collateral are less than initially anticipated, the  TALF loan costs could exceed them, providing another incentive to stop  making payments. This situation would be most likely to develop if the  underlying loans in the securities defaulted or otherwise failed to meet the  terms of the original loan agreement. In this situation, if the returns were  less than the total cost of the TALF loan\u2014the interest and principal due\u2014 a borrower might stop payment on the loan or surrender the collateral to  FRBNY.", "Investors might also choose to surrender collateral at the maturity of their  TALF loan if overall interest rates on credit increased significantly above  levels available at the time the underlying securities were issued. A large  increase in interest rates would lower the market value of the securities,  especially for those with a fixed interest rate, because future cash flows  would be worth less. In this scenario, a borrower could wind up owing  more to FRBNY at maturity than the securities were worth. The borrower  would need to raise funds at higher interest rates to pay back the TALF  loan, but the collateral would be worth less than the new loan, potentially  making it difficult to find a lender. This situation would provide an  economic incentive for the borrower to surrender the collateral and walk  away from the loan. Nevertheless, many of the longer-term securities  pledged as collateral for TALF loans have floating interest rates. Generally,  floating rate securities do not decline in value when interest rates increase  because the interest rates on the securities also increase.", "TALF borrowers will not necessarily stop payment on a loan even with  one or more of these economic incentives. For example, a market  participant and a Treasury official told us that TALF borrowers wanted to  avoid \u201creputation risk\u201d by not walking away from their loans\u2014even if it  might be in their financial interest to do so. By continuing to pay on their  loans, even at some loss, borrowers could protect their reputations. Other  market participants we spoke with, however, did not mention concerns  about reputation, though they thought it was unlikely that TALF borrowers  would stop payment on their loans.", "Moreover, FRBNY and Treasury officials believe that the most important  disincentive for borrowers to stop payment on a TALF loan and surrender  collateral is maintaining a positive return based on the difference between  the cost of the TALF loan and the return of the underlying ABS collateral.  Even if the value of the collateral declines and removes the borrower\u2019s  equity, these officials stated that borrowers were not likely to walk away  from the loan if they were still receiving positive cash flow from the asset.  While this assumption may be reasonable, it is conceivable that investors  subject to mark-to-market accounting might choose to walk away from an  ABS that was still paying the required scheduled interest and principal  payments but had lost sufficient market value. Investors would be most  likely to walk away if they owed significantly more on the loan than the  current value of the asset so that walking away from the asset would have  positive implications for the borrower\u2019s reported profitability. As of  January 8, 2010, no TALF borrowers had surrendered collateral to FRBNY.

We discussed these protections with FRBNY  officials but did not evaluate FRBNY compliance with them because of the  limitation of our statutory audit authority. FRBNY officials told us that  risks in TALF are managed based on four pillars: credit protection, credit  ratings, FRBNY due diligence, and market discipline.", "Credit protection is provided primarily by the borrower\u2019s equity in the  security (set by the haircuts) and a portion of the interest rate on TALF  loans that provides accumulated excess interest in TALF LLC. FRBNY  officials said that haircuts were designed to approximate multiples of  stressed historical impairment rates for ABSs. The size of the haircut is  important, because if it is set too low, the borrower will have less equity in  the collateral and, in the circumstances that we have discussed, could  have an incentive to walk away. The excess interest from TALF loans  accumulated in TALF LLC also protects taxpayers, because this money  would be used before TARP funds to purchase collateral surrendered from  unpaid loans. FRBNY officials said that such features were designed to  ensure that the haircuts and excess interest would result in no credit  losses for Treasury or the Federal Reserve.", "The Federal Reserve requires that TALF collateral be rated AAA or its  equivalent by two of the nationally recognized statistical rating  organizations that it deems eligible to provide credit ratings for TALF,  among other requirements for credit ratings. Collateral that is offered  that has a lower rating is not eligible for TALF. The rating requirement  helps ensure that the securities TALF accepts as collateral present  minimal credit risks.", "FRBNY due diligence serves as another pillar of taxpayer protection. As  discussed earlier, FRBNY, with the support of its collateral monitors,  reviews the credit risks related to individual assets FRBNY might consider  accepting as TALF collateral. In addition, for legacy CMBSs, FRBNY  reserves the right to reject any collateral and has not disclosed its  selection criteria to reduce the likelihood that only the poorest-performing  collateral is put forward for TALF loans.", "The final pillar, market discipline, includes the TALF borrowers\u2019 due  diligence conducted on the risks related to the underlying collateral, given  their equity in the collateral, as set by the haircut. Such discipline includes  reviewing the prospectuses and understanding how the structure of the  underlying securities impacts its overall risks. Investors purchasing ABSs  would generally review the terms of the security, the anticipated risks, and  the likely return. In addition, TALF borrowers help to facilitate price  discovery.", "These design features are intended to help ensure that TALF borrowers  hold equity in the underlying TALF collateral, that such collateral is highly  rated, and that TALF borrowers carry out the same due diligence on TALF  collateral that they would conduct on any other security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rates of Return for TALF Borrowers on TALF Collateral Have Declined for Most TALF Collateral from Their Highs Earlier in 2009", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, TALF borrowers earn the difference between the ABS\u2019s  coupon rate of return and the cost of borrowing from FRBNY on the TALF  loan. According to FRBNY officials, they, along with officials from the  Federal Reserve and Treasury, were aware of the importance of striking a  balance between achieving returns on equity that would encourage  program participation in the stressed market conditions when TALF was  announced, while also ensuring that investors had incentives for due  diligence and that the program would be less attractive during times of  less market stress. If borrowers saw an opportunity to earn excessive  returns due to a poorly designed program, borrowers might not conduct  appropriate due diligence on the underlying securities, which could put  taxpayers at risk. Moreover, because the loans are nonrecourse much of  the borrowers\u2019 risk is shifted to FRBNY and Treasury, while most of the  earnings potential remains with borrowers. FRBNY gathered information  on the rates of return that would entice potential TALF participants by  surveying market participants about expected returns for TALF-eligible  asset classes.", "To understand the changes in returns on equity over time and the  reasonableness of those returns from the perspective of helping to ensure  that taxpayers were not subsidizing high returns, we analyzed fluctuations  in returns on TALF eligible collateral from March 2009 through September  2009. As seen in figure 4, returns generally decreased for select classes of  TALF-eligible collateral between the first TALF operation in March 2009  and September 2009, with limited exceptions.", "Most asset classes demonstrated a significant decline in returns, from a  peak of 43 percent among the first student loan ABS accepted under TALF  to lows of -5 percent for 1-year prime auto tranches and 2-year auto  leases, suggesting that if investors had used TALF to finance the purchase  of these auto-related TALF eligible securities they would have locked in  losses. However, in a sign that health may be returning to the ABS  markets, no TALF borrowings were needed to finance the purchase of  these negative return securities as the issuances were fully funded by non- TALF investors. The most dramatic decreases in returns have been in the  auto loan tranches with longer-term maturities and private student loan  ABSs. The average expected return for TALF borrowers that used prime  auto loan ABSs as TALF loan collateral declined by nearly a fifth after  March 2009. All of the TALF-eligible private student loan ABS transactions  that were completed between May 2009 and August 2009 had a unique  option feature that significantly lessened investor\u2019s expected returns on  equity. Additionally, the September 2009 increase in return for subprime  credit cards was primarily due to the unique structure of an issuance by a  large subprime issuer.", "The trend of decreasing returns on equity in the overall market for most  asset classes indicates that the returns required to attract investors have  decreased since TALF\u2019s implementation, as ABS investors perceive the  assets to be less risky. In addition, the trend demonstrates that taxpayer  subsidies to TALF borrowers have not, over the course of the program,  provided what might be considered excessive returns. Although returns  were high in the beginning, they diminished once the ABS markets started  to revive and overall perceived risk began to decrease. Moreover, the trend  toward negative TALF returns on equity have coincided with a drop in  TALF participation by TALF borrowers in those asset classes as the rate  on the securities\u2019 bonds falls below the loan rate charged by the FRBNY.  This occurrence is consistent with FRBNY\u2019s intention for TALF financing  to become less attractive as the ABS market improves and can be viewed  as indicating normalization in the market, since investors can purchase  such ABSs without TALF funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Securitizations Have Generally Been Structured with More Credit Protections since the Credit Crisis Began", "paragraphs": ["Certain elements of the securities themselves also reduce the risk of loss  to TALF and the taxpayer.

Credit enhancements are features in the structure of a securitization  that protect investors from losses due to defaults on the underlying loans  in the securities. Two main forms of credit enhancement include  subordination, which helps ensure that more highly rated tranches in a  security receive priority of payment, and overcollateralization, which  ensures that funds are available if a borrower stops paying or other credit  problems develop with the underlying loans. For additional details on the  various types of credit enhancement, see appendix V.", "Credit enhancements offer several benefits. First, they provide a cushion  against losses, making it less likely that TALF borrowers will decide not to  repay their loans and surrender the collateral because of credit  performance problems in the ABS or CMBS markets. Second, credit  enhancements reduce the probability that TALF LLC will suffer principal  losses on surrendered ABSs and CMBSs from unpaid loans. For this  reason, credit enhancements also provide TALF LLC with an incentive to  decide to hold surrendered collateral to maturity. This reduces potential  losses to TARP funds, which would finance TALF LLC\u2019s purchase of such  ABS and CMBS.", "We reviewed the credit enhancements on every TALF-eligible ABS issued  between the program\u2019s initiation in March 2009 and September 2009 and  compared them with credit enhancements on ABSs by the same issuer  between 2006 and 2008 to identify any changes. As shown in figure 5, the  level of enhancement for every TALF-eligible asset class increased.", "In particular, credit enhancements on ABSs backed by private student  loans, nonauto floor plans, auto leases, and motorcycle loans at least  doubled after the credit crisis. In other words, from the perspective of  protecting TARP funds, taxpayers would receive more than double the  amount of credit protection for these particular asset classes compared  with these issuers\u2019 ABSs before the financial crisis. This increase was a  combination of market demands and credit rating agencies\u2019 more stringent  requirements for achieving AAA ratings on many ABSs.

Accordingly, the total expenditures from  TARP funds would include only the $100 million placed in TALF LLC,  which is in the form of a loan that would be repaid. According to the terms  of the agreement between FRBNY and Treasury, Treasury will receive 90  percent of the monies accumulated in TALF LLC when the program  expires.

Any assets purchased by TALF LLC would first be paid for  with the excess interest and related interest income that had accumulated  in TALF LLC, which totaled almost $200 million at the end of December  2009. According to the contractor, the analysis of potential loss of TARP  funds did not include this excess interest, so the total estimated losses  could be largely offset by accumulated interest. In fact, the contractor and  Treasury officials said that a subsequent analysis that included projections  for the accumulation of excess interest\u2014and is updated on a quarterly  basis\u2014currently projects more than $1 billion in profit related to  Treasury\u2019s TALF exposure.", "To assess the reasonableness of Treasury\u2019s position that TALF may  actually earn money rather than expose the taxpayer to any losses, we  reviewed the Treasury contractor\u2019s model\u2014which is central to estimating  losses for the various asset classes accepted in TALF. We found this model  appeared to incorporate generally reasonable loss assumptions for the  three asset classes that we reviewed and that comprise the largest portion  of the TALF portfolio: credit cards, auto loans, and student loans. That is,  many of the loss estimates were fairly conservative when compared to  recent historical results for these specific assets. For each asset class, the  contractor estimated expected loss percentages based on its own research  and analysis, which was used to generate total-loss estimates. The model  calculates total losses for each TALF borrower on each asset held in the  TALF portfolio. The portfolio includes current TALF collateral and  projections for future TALF collateral that borrowers will use for TALF  loans, based on information the contractor received from Treasury.  Potential Treasury losses from these various scenarios were calculated by  taking the total loss for the TALF borrower and subtracting the equity that  the TALF borrower holds in ABSs. Any difference is considered a loss,  first to TALF LLC and potentially to Treasury (through TARP funds) if  loans extended to TALF LLC for its purchase of TALF collateral are not  repaid.

Treasury and its  contractor said that CMBS losses were unlikely for a number of reasons  ranging from the relatively large haircuts (at least 15 percent) required on  CMBS loans to the level of credit enhancement associated with CMBSs  accepted for TALF. However, due in part to the recently weak economy,  commercial real estate continues to undergo price deterioration that  potentially poses risks to the TALF legacy CMBS portfolio and could lead  to increased delinquencies and defaults on commercial real estate  mortgages. For example, the potential risks that CMBSs pose to TALF, and  thus to TARP, are underscored by the fact that 63 percent of TALF\u2019s CMBS  portfolio was underwritten in 2006 and 2007, when underwriting standards  were at their worst. Moreover, as figure 6 shows, commercial real estate  prices have been falling since early 2008, following the deterioration in the  overall U.S. economy, and shortly thereafter CMBS delinquencies began to  rise sharply. The Federal Reserve and Treasury have continued to note  their ongoing concerns about this segment of the market.", "In addition, prices on CMBSs experienced volatility between May 2008 and  November 2009. Even the highest credit quality AAA legacy CMBSs that  were used as collateral for TALF loans during the third quarter of 2009 had  dropped by one third, on average, between May and November 2008  during the most severe period of the credit crisis. While prices have  recovered since the expansion of TALF to include CMBSs in the second  quarter of 2009, market observers project that the sector will continue to  perform poorly into 2010.", "In light of the ongoing distress in the commercial real estate market, we  analyzed the prices and values of 99 percent of the CMBS collateral  backing loans made by FRBNY during the third quarter of 2009. We  compared the prices at the time the loans were made with the lowest  prices in November 2008, a period of extreme stress for CMBSs. Our  analysis revealed that if legacy CMBSs accepted as TALF collateral as of  September 2009 reached market values equivalent to November 2008  levels, about 88 percent of such collateral would have fallen to levels at  which the TALF borrower\u2019s equity would be eliminated. Moreover, more  than $3.5 billion owed by TALF borrowers\u2014or about 85 percent of the  total value of TALF legacy CMBS loans\u2014would have negative equity in  this scenario. This extreme market stress scenario would result in a loss in  market value on the part of these TALF borrowers of nearly $1.2 billion.  The haircut investment for these borrowers totals $665 million, providing  significant economic incentive to walk away, which would result in a  worst-case loss of about $500 million for TALF.", "While this worst-case scenario provides useful information for Treasury to  consider as it monitors risk associated with TALF, we agree with the  Federal Reserve and Treasury that there are a number of factors that  affect whether such losses would be realized even in this adverse scenario.  First, as discussed in the ABS analysis, the accumulated excess interest in  TALF LLC would help offset potential losses. As of December 31, 2009, the  fund had almost $200 million in excess interest, which will continue to  increase every month in the absence of any asset purchases. Second, the  risk that all or a large portion of CMBS assets would be surrendered is  significantly mitigated by an FRBNY requirement that legacy CMBSs  prepay a portion of any returns in excess of certain limits. In short, the  requirement helps ensure that the TALF borrower will retain an equity  interest in the underlying CMBSs. The longer the term of the TALF loan  (assuming that the underlying collateral provides a return) the more equity  the borrower holds, and the less likely the borrower is to surrender the  CMBS collateral. Third, as with ABSs, and as indicated by Treasury  officials, TALF LLC could hold the securities acquired at a discount from  par\u2014instead of selling them\u2014and earn interest income and the equity  forfeited by the borrower as long as the underlying mortgages in the  security continue to perform well. Fourth, the estimated loss represents  less than 1 percent of total TALF loans as of December 2009, and total  TALF CMBS loans represent about 14 percent of all TALF loans. Because  CMBSs is a small portion of the portfolio, it would present a smaller  proportion of total losses. However, if recent TALF borrowing trends hold,  CMBS loans are likely to increase as the percentage of total TALF loans.  Finally, only senior credit-enhanced tranches within each CMBS can be  accepted as collateral. Thus, even if credit losses on the commercial  mortgages underlying the TALF CMBS securitizations are significantly  higher than currently expected in today\u2019s stressed commercial real estate  environment, these senior tranches are unlikely to experience principal or  interest payment interruptions. While losses associated with CMBSs  currently appear unlikely, these securities warrant ongoing scrutiny  because of continuing economic uncertainty and the distressed conditions  in the commercial real estate market."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Treasury Worked with the Federal Reserve and FRBNY to Analyze Risks Related to TALF but Did Not Fully Document Analysis Supporting Final Decisions", "paragraphs": ["FRBNY, the Federal Reserve, and Treasury worked in a collaborative  manner to design certain elements of TALF, according to these agency  officials.

This reduction coincides with the launching of TALF but may also reflect  assistance from the numerous government stimulus programs, especially  those focused on the auto industry. While fixed credit card rates have  remained fairly flat in recent years, variable credit card rates have  increased by approximately one percent since TALF\u2019s inception. FRBNY  officials attributed the elevated credit card rates to increased charge-offs,  which have raised companies\u2019 costs of funds. These rate changes could  also be the result of credit card companies\u2019 efforts to anticipate the  implementation of the remaining part of the Credit Card Accountability  Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, which will take effect in  February 2010.", "FRBNY officials said that it is possible that without TALF interest rates on  loans to consumers and small businesses would be much higher than they  are now. Issuers of TALF-eligible ABSs have told FRBNY that without  TALF they would have made fewer loans and those loans would have been  at higher rates. Data on private student loan rates are difficult to obtain,  but FRBNY officials said that Sallie Mae has reduced its rates on private  student loans over the past few months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TALF Loan Volumes and the Composition of TALF Participants Have Changed since the Program Began", "paragraphs": ["As illustrated in table 3, the volume of TALF loans made since the  inception of the program has fluctuated by month, with loan volumes  peaking in May 2009 and June 2009. As of December 31, 2009, a total of  $61.6 billion in TALF loans had been granted; however, the balance of  loans outstanding at that date was $47.5 billion due to loan prepayments  and principal paydowns. As we reported previously, agency officials  indicated that improvements in securitization and loan markets had made  issuers less dependent on TALF support. However, according to FRBNY  officials, other issuers remain more heavily dependent on investor access  to TALF financing. FRBNY officials noted that there have been a number  of prepayments, and market participants also told us that financing under  TALF was now less favorable because better financing terms could be  found in the private sector for certain asset classes. Notably, the first and  only subscription for new-issue CMBSs occurred in November 2009.  FRBNY and Treasury officials stated that the slow new-issue CMBS  activity may be due to the length of time it takes to complete a deal.", "As shown in figure 9, approximately 75 percent of TALF loans involved the  purchase of ABSs backed by auto loans and leases, credit card receivables,  and student loans. This activity reflects the historical trends in auto, credit  card, and student loan securitizations, which represent the majority of the  ABS markets.", "CMBS (legacy 14%; new issue 0%)", "According to Treasury and Federal Reserve officials, TALF was designed  to encourage broader investor participation in the securitization markets,  with the goal of reviving consumer lending. These officials noted that the  securitization markets stopped functioning in 2008 when many investors  stopped purchasing these securities. The lack of securitization market  activity disrupted a significant source of funding for businesses and  consumers. Gradually, some of these investors have returned to the  markets, but at a slower rate than during past market downturns.  Specifically, Treasury officials noted increasing participation in TALF  securitization by asset managers, hedge funds, and traditional institutional  investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. They consider  the return of investors to the securitization markets to be a measure of the  program\u2019s success. Hedge funds traditionally have not invested in ABSs  because of the low returns relative to other opportunities.

The difference is called a spread,  and wide spreads, or large differences, generally indicate that participants  perceive high risk in the market that requires a high rate of return. As  perceived risk declines, differences in such prices decrease, or narrow.  During the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, spreads likely  reflected high expected costs of selling securities prior to their maturity,  which contributed to low desirability for those securities. Figure 10 shows  the change in spreads in the following TALF-eligible asset classes: auto  loan, credit card, student loan, and CMBS. A trend of widening spreads in  these asset classes began in mid-2007, indicating negative perceptions  about risk.

Treasury officials noted that personnel at both agencies were responsible  for a variety of tasks in tracking TALF-related metrics.

We also found that Treasury  officials did not have a plan to collect and analyze information related to  assets that might be placed in TALF LLC\u2014assets to which Treasury would  have an exposure. Such information might include the purchase and sale  price of the assets, their current market value, total outstanding loans by  Treasury to TALF LLC for the ABS purchases, and the rationale behind  TALF LLC\u2019s possible future sale of assets. Treasury has not yet developed  such a plan because no TALF collateral has been surrendered thus far, and  Treasury believes it is unlikely that it will have to use TARP funds to  finance TALF LLC\u2019s purchase of surrendered collateral. Moreover,  Treasury does not have a plan to publicly communicate such information  in the event that collateral is surrendered and placed there.

Without a system for  tracking and reporting on any potential assets such as CMBSs that are  surrendered to TALF LLC, Treasury cannot assure transparent  management of these assets or determine if it is achieving its goals under  CBLI with respect to the use of TARP funds for TALF-related activities.  Further, without properly planning for its role in managing the collateral  should they have to be purchased by TALF LLC, Treasury may not be able  to effectively assess any risks associated with such assets or exercise  appropriately its decision-making responsibilities regarding the potential  sale of any assets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["TALF is one of several programs created by the Federal Reserve to help  address the recent crisis in the financial sector. Specifically, this program  was designed to restart securitization markets, a critical part of financial  markets. Given the myriad of programs initiated to stabilize the financial  system and increase credit availability, it is difficult to attribute  improvement in markets to any one program. Nevertheless, according to a  variety of indicators, TALF appears to be contributing to measured  improvements in the securitization markets. As of December 31, 2009,  $61.6 billion in loans were made through TALF and TALF LLC had  received $100 million of the $20 billion in TARP funds committed to the  program. In addition to the $20 billion, funds provided by FRBNY to  operate TALF could expose additional risks. However, because we are  statutorily prohibited from auditing the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy  activities, we believe our ability to completely assess and report on  taxpayers\u2019 exposure to the entire program or the Federal Reserve\u2019s  management of the program is limited.", "Although the government has taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk  of loss from TALF, in the long term risks remain. For example, while  analyses by the Federal Reserve and a Treasury contractor that were  based on predictions of market performance and other factors estimated  that a loss of a substantial portion of the $20 billion TARP commitment  would be unlikely based on current conditions in the securitization  markets, we found that until the TALF borrowers repay their loans, TALF  still presents risks. While we acknowledge that overall market conditions  have generally improved since 2008, some asset classes\u2014specifically  CMBS\u2014are still performing poorly and may continue to perform badly for  the foreseeable future. Moreover, markets remain fragile and predicting  how the overall ABS markets will perform in the future and how  borrowers might respond to new declines in the markets is difficult. A  return to 2008 conditions could have adverse impacts on the program,  such as significantly reducing the value of TALF collateral, providing an  economic incentive for borrowers to walk away from their loans, and  requiring TARP funds be used to buy TALF collateral. However, several  TALF program features make this less likely.", "Treasury, which worked with FRBNY and the Federal Reserve on certain  decisions related to TALF, was not able to provide documentation on how  these decisions were made. As we noted in past TARP reports, Treasury  has yet to develop systems to ensure the transparency and accountability  for TARP activities by implementing a strong, transparent strategic  framework with appropriate oversight mechanisms. Among other things,  these mechanisms would ensure accountability by tracking why decisions  are made, and whether goals are being achieved. Documenting the basis  for decisions is an important part of the decision-making process.  Moreover, documenting the rationale for major program decisions would  help ensure that the program objectives are being met and that it is  functioning as intended. Unless Treasury documents the rationale for  major program decisions that it made with the Federal Reserve, it cannot  demonstrate accountability for meeting the goals of TALF and could  unnecessarily place TARP funds at risk.", "Believing it is highly unlikely that it will have to use TARP funds to finance  ABS purchases by TALF LLC, Treasury has not taken steps to develop a  set of metrics or a plan for tracking and reporting on the performance of  the collateral that could be placed in TALF LLC. While TARP funds may  never be used to finance purchases of ABS or CMBS used as TALF  collateral, Treasury should at least be prepared for the possibility. Without  a plan for collecting and analyzing such data, Treasury would have to  develop one as it is financing or after it has financed collateral purchases  by TALF LLC and risks being ill prepared to make informed decisions on  whether TALF LLC should keep collateral until the securities mature or  sell them. Unlike many other programs that were developed and  implemented in the midst of the crisis, Treasury has an opportunity to be  strategic by developing a plan in the event that its role in TALF is  triggered. In addition, without a plan Treasury cannot measure TALF\u2019s  success in meeting its goals under CBLI with respect to any assets that are  placed in TALF LLC.

Treasury and the Federal Reserve   also provided technical comments that we have incorporated as appropriate.", "In their response Treasury welcomed our recognition that TALF  contributed to improvements in the securitization markets but believed  that the draft report understated the success of the program. In so doing  Treasury reiterated several points that were already underscored in the  draft report. For example, as discussed in the draft report and Treasury\u2019s  response, we acknowledged that securitization volumes in markets had  come to a complete halt in 2008, but increased after TALF\u2019s first  subscription in March 2009. Moreover, we also noted that recent TALF  subscription levels for the majority of eligible asset classes have tapered  off, which is an indication that investors\u2019 perception of risk has decreased.  As we have noted in our previous TARP reports, any assessment of the  effectiveness of TALF is complicated by the fact that a variety of programs  have been established by the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and others to  stabilize the markets\u2014making it virtually impossible to definitively single  out and measure TALF\u2019s impact.", "Treasury also stated that it disagreed with our methodology related to  potential losses for CMBSs.  As we discussed in the report, the adverse  scenario analysis of the TALF CMBS portfolio was not intended to project  an expected loss amount for this portfolio but to help assess the possible  range of losses in TALF.  We used a stress scenario and selected loss  assumptions that were similar to those the Federal Reserve imposed on  the 19 bank holding companies that participated in the 2009 stress test.  Treasury states that it would take a 65 percent loss on underlying  commercial real estate prices to experience losses. While we agree that  this is an unlikely event, commercial real estate prices have already fallen  by an average of 43 percent since prices peaked. Combined with the fact  that CMBSs have much longer time horizons than other TALF ABS asset  classes and hence greater uncertainty of outcomes, we continue to believe  that CMBS warrants ongoing attention.", "Treasury also noted that it appreciates the recommendations GAO makes  in the report to strengthen the documentation of decisions Treasury made  concerning changes to the program.  Treasury stated it is committed to  ensuring that not only TALF, but TARP as a whole, is administered in a  way that protects the taxpayer. We believe that development of a sound  decision-making process that includes steps for formal approval and  documentation of the basis of the final decisions at an appropriate  management level will improve transparency and accountability of the  TALF program. As we noted in past TARP reports and most recently in the  October 2009 report, Treasury has yet to develop systems to ensure the  transparency and accountability for TARP activities by implementing a  strong, transparent strategic framework with the appropriate oversight  mechanisms. Among other things, these mechanisms would ensure  accountability by tracking why decisions are made and whether goals are  being achieved.", "Finally, regarding our recommendation that Treasury review what data to  track and metrics to disclose to the public in the event that TALF LLC  purchases surrendered assets from FRBNY, Treasury noted that it will  continue to enhance its existing reporting on its investments in TALF that  strikes an appropriate balance between its goal of transparency and the  need to avoid compromising either the competitive positions of investors  or Treasury\u2019s ability to recover funds for taxpayers. We believe that having  a plan in place for tracking and reporting on the performance of any  collateral that could be placed in TALF LLC will help Treasury strike that  balance.", "In its comments, the Federal Reserve did not agree with our  recommendation that Congress consider providing GAO with authority to  audit the Federal Reserve\u2019s TALF operational and administrative actions  because it disagreed that there are limitations on GAO\u2019s authority to audit  these Federal Reserve activities.  The Federal Reserve also noted that it  fully cooperated in GAO\u2019s conduct of this audit and provided us access to  records and personnel.", "The Federal Reserve did cooperate and voluntarily provided all access we  requested in this audit of Treasury.  We appreciate this cooperation, which  enabled us to factually describe the TALF program and to evaluate  Treasury\u2019s involvement in it.  However, we believe the express statutory  prohibition in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 714(b) on GAO auditing the Federal Reserve\u2019s  monetary policy and discount window activities, which the Federal  Reserve believes include TALF\u2019s operation and administration, prohibits  us from auditing the Federal Reserve\u2019s TALF activities, even from the  perspective of TARP. We limited the scope and conduct of this audit  accordingly, and thus did not request access to information to audit the  Federal Reserve\u2019s performance of these activities.  Further, the Federal  Reserve\u2019s decision to voluntarily provide requested access in this instance,  while helpful, does not create GAO authority for access to information the  agency may not volunteer, nor GAO authority to audit the Federal  Reserve\u2019s TALF operational activities or other performance.  In our view,  our lack of authority to audit the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions limited our  ability to fully assess the risk to taxpayer funds presented by TALF.

Next, we  assessed how Treasury reviewed the risks of the various asset classes  considered for TALF eligibility by collecting and analyzing reports that  Treasury requested through a contractor, Bank of New York Mellon, which  in turn subcontracted the work to NSM Structured Credit Solutions, which  has since been acquired and is now known as RangeMark. We also  reviewed the subcontractor\u2019s methodology for assessing the likelihood of  loss to TARP funds and interviewed the subcontractor, contractor, and  Treasury officials about the assumptions in the loss model.

To analyze  changes in interest rates for auto loans and credit cards, we reviewed  quarterly data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s G.19 Consumer Credit Release, a  widely used data source, as well as weekly data provided by  BankRate.com. We selected the auto, credit card, student loan, and CMBS  asset classes because they were the most widely traded in securitization  markets and the latter had recently experienced significant trading and  price volatility. Because reliable interest rate data for private student loans  and commercial mortgages were more difficult to obtain, we collected and  analyzed data only on auto loans and credit cards.

This provides an alternative approach to the Department  of the Treasury (Treasury) subcontractor\u2019s analysis, and provides an  estimate of how large losses potentially could be in the event that the  markets returned to their November 2008 lows.

In addition, TALF loans were spread across 6 of the 7 TALF  ABS subscription months between March and September. Nevertheless, it  is a nonprobability sample and is not necessarily generalizable to all TALF  deals.", "We modeled TALF collateral cash flows using assumptions consistent with  the FRBNY\u2019s assumptions on the rate at which ABS principal is paid back  to investors.

These  incremental spreads were compared with the widest levels seen in  November 2008 for the appropriate asset class and expected average life.  November 2008 spreads were obtained from Wall Street ABS-dealer  weekly price data that are published for the more widely traded ABS  classes.

As outlined below, the market participants in  securitization\u2014borrowers, consumer and small business lenders,  investment banks or pool assemblers, credit rating agencies, and  investors\u2014each derive specific benefits from the transaction. For  example, borrowers might gain access to loanable funds with more  favorable terms, such as longer repayment periods and lower interest  rates, than may otherwise be available. Similarly, securitization offers  consumer and small business lenders a funding source for making new  loans, improving balance sheet and capital management, and diversifying  fee or income streams. Securitization also allows the cash flows from asset  pools to be structured to satisfy the maturity, risk, and return preferences  of investors.", "The degree to which participants receive these benefits depends, in large  part, on how efficiently the markets for securitized assets are functioning.  With accurate and more comprehensive performance data regarding  financial assets, capital markets can more easily profile the risk of a pool  of similar assets. This risk can be divided and sold to investors who are  willing to purchase it at an acceptable risk-adjusted return, sometimes  called the \u201cinvestor-required yield.\u201d As the markets for securitized asset  classes grow in volume and liquidity, and as the performance and risk  characteristics of those assets become better understood, investor- required yields on particular ABSs and transaction costs of securitizing  those assets may decline. Declining investor-required yields and  transaction costs can lower the cost of financing for consumer and small  business lenders and ultimately borrowers.

Loan-level servicing advances are not repaid until the borrower repays all  the money advanced or from the proceeds of the sale of the repossessed  property (the likely scenario in a default).
