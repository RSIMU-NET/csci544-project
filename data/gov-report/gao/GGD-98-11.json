Harrison Street, opened in May 1996. The Main Post Office contains a two-floor mail processing facility, seven floors of office space, and a retail sales operation. It replaced the old Main Post Office, which was located across the street from the new facility. The old Main Post Office was completed in 1932 and consisted of nine floors of workroom space. In 1990, the USPS Board of Governors approved a plan to construct the new Main Post Office as a means of improving mail service in Chicago, which until this year had EXFC scores that were significantly below the national average.", "The new Main Post Office was part of the Postal Service\u2019s 1987 Greater Chicago Area Facility Plan, which called for decentralizing postal operations in the Chicago area to accommodate population and mail volume shifts from the city to the suburbs. The new Main Post Office was to be a state-of-the-art mail processing facility, which would be supplemented by six new or expanded mail processing facilities throughout the Chicago area. Although construction of the new Post Office originally was estimated to be complete by April 1993, the new facility did not open until May 1996. In addition, in September 1997, renovation of an annex called the \u201cSugar House\u201d was completed\u2014work that was done after the Postal Service discovered that the new Main Post Office would not be large enough to house all operations that the Postal Service planned to move into the new facility and that the new facility would not meet operational needs.", "About 5,300 employees work at the new Main Post Office, including about 4,900 mail processing and distribution staff, 300 district support staff, and about 100 Postal Inspection Service employees. The new Main Post Office has automated mail handling equipment and occupies about 900,000 square feet of space, compared to about 2.3 million square feet of space at the old facility.", "In March 1990, the USPS Board of Governors initially approved $199.7 million for construction of the new Main Post Office. From December 1991 through February 1996, the Board of Governors approved four additional funding requests totaling $133.2 million. The facility\u2019s final projected cost was $332.9 million, including the annex renovation.", "Your congressional district, which consists of the northern part of Chicago and adjacent suburbs, is served by both the Chicago and Northern Illinois postal districts, 2 of 85 nationwide postal districts. The Chicago Postal District, headquartered in the new Main Post Office, serves ZIP Codes beginning with 606, 607, and 608, including the Chicago portion of your congressional district and part of Niles, IL. The Northern Illinois Postal District, headquartered in Carol Stream, IL, serves ZIP Codes beginning with 600, 601, 602, 603, 610, and 611, including the cities of Evanston, Golf, Lincolnwood, Morton Grove, and Skokie and parts of Harwood Heights and Glenview.

Constituents who are served by the Northern Illinois Postal District receive mail processed in Palatine, IL, which processes about 5.5 million pieces of mail a day.", "You indicated that your constituents have complained about mail service in your district for many years. In conversations with your office, we were told that many of the complaints focused on service provided by the Graceland postal station in Chicago. The complaints related to the delivery of mail, including misdelivery and nondelivery, as well as problems with forwarding of mail. Graceland station serves a densely populated area of Chicago that contains many high-rise residential units. According to the Postal Service, Graceland station handles the second-highest volume of mail in Chicago and makes about 40,000 deliveries daily.", "Complaints about mail service in Chicago were discussed during USPS appropriations hearings before Congress in 1987 and were the subject of a separate congressional hearing in 1996. In 1990, at your request, we reviewed Postal Service management and operations in your district. This work involved reviewing a lengthy record of correspondence between you and the Postal Service. Letters from the Postal Service contained descriptions of numerous commitments and promised actions that were unfulfilled or did not have a lasting impact on the mail delivery problems. At that time, mail service problems focused on the high-growth areas of your district, such as Lincoln Park. We identified three potential causes of the problems: inadequate postal facilities; improper mail processing and delivery practices; and incomplete addresses on mail, coupled with incomplete information on customers\u2019 mail boxes. In response to our work, the Postmaster General provided a list of corrective steps that we believed at the time would address the problems if they were properly implemented.", "However, in 1994, continuing complaints about mail service in Chicago prompted the Postmaster General to visit the city and establish a task force to address the problems. The task force found mail that was late, lost, or had been thrown away; a \u201cbunker mentality\u201d when it came to interacting with customers; and facilities without telephone service for customers and staff ill-equipped to answer and respond to simple inquiries. The task force worked to address these problems by helping management staffs plan their daily workloads; hiring additional carriers; streamlining processes; and increasing employee training. In addition, a new management team was installed in Chicago.", "EXFC scores for Chicago have improved considerably in recent years. The percentage of First-Class, overnight mail delivered on time increased from 66 percent in the second quarter of fiscal year 1994 to 90 percent in the third quarter of fiscal year 1997, 2 percent below the national average. The Chicago Postal District Manager said the improved EXFC scores were the result of (1) more automation, (2) new and expanded facilities throughout the Chicago area, (3) more and better training of employees, (4) better management and more accountability, and (5) dismissal of poor performers and recognition of good employees.", "In recent years, the Postal Service has also undertaken a major effort to automate its operations and reduce labor costs, including using more temporary and part-time employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In June 1996, you requested that we review the reasons for the cost overruns at the new Chicago Main Post Office.

At that time, you requested that we perform additional work regarding Graceland station, which is located in your congressional district.", "To obtain information on the reasons for the cost overruns at the new Chicago Main Post Office, we interviewed USPS officials; submitted written questions to the Postal Service; reviewed documentation of the cost estimates for the facility, including justifications for cost increases, project planning documents, and Board of Governors meeting minutes; and reviewed Postal Inspection Service reports on the project. We also met with Chicago postal officials, including the Great Lakes Area Operations Vice President, Chicago District Manager, Chicago District Senior Plant Manager, and a Postal Inspection Service official; and we toured the new Main Post Office.

This review was performed from February to May 1997 by two teams of operational, retail, and administrative staff from the Chicago and Northern Illinois postal districts serving the Ninth Illinois Congressional District. The teams were supported by a real estate specialist, a design and construction specialist, and an operations analyst from the Chicago Facilities Service Office. In addition, an outside architectural/engineering firm was retained to assist in the review. We reviewed the report that resulted from this facility survey.", "To obtain performance data on the Graceland station, we first interviewed postal officials to determine what performance data and indicators are maintained by the Postal Service. We then asked Postal officials to provide data pertaining to workload/workforce issues (the number of deliveries, routes, and carriers, volume of mail delivered, amount of carrier sick leave and overtime); timeliness (EXFC scores, the number of routes with delayed mail, amount of curtailed and delayed mail, and the number of carriers leaving the station late); and the number of delivery-related complaints received during the weeks of September 14 through 20, 1996, and January 18 through 24, 1997.

According to the Postal Service, the data provided were the best performance measures available on the two stations.", "To compare Graceland\u2019s performance with a similar station in another city with a higher EXFC score than Chicago\u2019s, we reviewed the EXFC scores for 1996 in other U.S. cities and contacted the Postal District Managers in three Northern cities (Philadelphia, New York, and Boston) where the weather conditions and population densities were similar to those in Chicago. We provided the Postal District Managers in those three cities with data on the volume of mail processed and the number of business and residential deliveries at Graceland station and asked them to identify any similar stations in their districts serving densely populated areas with many high-rise residential units. The Boston Postal District Manager identified the Brookline, MA, station and provided performance data on that station for the two time periods in our review. The Postal District Managers in Philadelphia and New York did not identify any stations in their districts that were comparable to Graceland.", "We recognized certain limitations of comparing performance data on two stations. These limitations included the number of variables that affect mail delivery, such as the makeup of residential, business, and curbside deliveries being made and the type of terrain covered.

The estimates for the two sites differed because the developer-owned Clark Street site included $39 million for land, while the Harrison Street site had no land acquisition costs because it was owned by the Postal Service. However, compared to the Clark Street site, construction costs were higher on Harrison Street because it was a smaller site, and the structure had to be built on piers above the railroad tracks.", "The Postal Service preferred constructing on the Clark Street site and only considered the Harrison Street site as an alternative. However, the city of Chicago was opposed to constructing the postal facility on the Clark Street site because it conflicted with the city\u2019s long-range plans for the area. Postal officials said that the Board was aware of the city\u2019s opposition to constructing on the Clark Street site when it approved the initial funding, but the Board was informed by the Assistant Postmaster General for Facilities that he hoped the Postal Service could solve its problems with the city and conclude negotiations on the Clark Street site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "December 1991 Increase", "paragraphs": ["\u201cWhile the building planned for the Harrison Street site is functionally very similar to the facility planned on Clark Street, there is a marked difference in the site conditions and, therefore, the structure of the building and associated docks, maneuvering area, and parking.

The tracks in question are located two blocks south of Union Station, which handle all commuter rail lines serving the southern and western portions of the city and suburbs. Amtrak also uses the same tracks for interstate passenger service. While we were cognizant that construction on the Harrison Street site would pose some constraints on our ability to keep costs within budget, the extent to which the tracks and overall railroad operation would impact construction was not fully appreciated when initial estimates were made.\u201d", "Further, the Harrison Street site was located next to the Chicago River.

According to the April 1994 DAR, about 60 percent of the new Post Office\u2019s construction was complete at that time. The DAR indicated that the decision to incorporate processing for the 17 ZIP Codes and automated mail processing plans into the new facility required a complete redesign of the workroom layout.

Other unanticipated costs involved dealing with a water tunnel and an abandoned freight tunnel under the site that were found after construction began.", "The DAR also indicated that the adjacent Polk Street bridge, which was closed by the city in 1993 because of safety concerns, was needed to provide access to the new facility. Postal officials believed that the Chicago Union Station Company, an Amtrak subsidiary, took responsibility for maintaining the bridge when it acquired the property. The DAR indicated that the Postal Service was in the process of negotiating an agreement for repairing the Polk Street bridge, that it was confident of recovering the repair costs from the Chicago Union Station Company, and that work on repairing the bridge should proceed to ensure truck access to the new Main Post Office by the time the facility was completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "June 1995 Increase", "paragraphs": ["In June 1995, the Board approved a third cost increase for the new Main Post Office.

These reasons included (1) the city of Chicago\u2019s opposition to allowing construction on the preferred site and the lack of a separate DAR for the alternative site; (2) increased costs resulting from having the Postal Service build over active railroad tracks at the alternative site; (3) construction during major changes in Postal Service structure, operations, and management personnel; (4) proceeding with construction despite incomplete designs and automation plans; and (5) an overall lack of coordination between USPS headquarters and the field.", "In addition, the Inspection Service reported that continuous turnover of decisionmakers at the Postal Service diminished overall accountability for the project.

Further, the Inspection Service said information that had been presented to the Board of Governors in budget requests was inadequate and minimized negative aspects of the project.", "In its May 1995 presentation to the Board, the Inspection Service made the following four recommendations about future major capital projects: (1) an on-site Project Manager should be assigned responsibility for all aspects of projects from start to finish; (2) the validation process for large projects should include a thorough review and approval by personnel familiar with operations, equipment, and fixed mechanization issues; (3) recommendations made by the Board of Governors\u2019 Capital Improvement Committee should be followed; and (4) the Inspection Service should selectively review projects costing under $10 million.", "The Postal Service indicated that in response to the report, it has made the following changes: (1) a Facility Activation Manager was selected to oversee large projects; (2) the review and validation process for large projects has been enhanced through meetings with operating managers, functional staff, and headquarters executives; and (3) the Postal Service is adhering to the recommendations made by the Board of Governors\u2019 Capital Improvement Committee (see app. III). With regard to the fourth recommendation, the inspector in charge of the review told us that the Inspection Service began selectively reviewing projects costing under $10 million in fiscal year 1997 and is now more involved in monitoring major capital projects early in the process, such as by reviewing preliminary DARs, than it was during the new Chicago Main Post Office project.", "We asked the Postal Service why the additional funding requests in April 1994 and June 1995 were presented in closed, rather than open, sessions of the Board of Governors. The Postal Service responded that at the time of those two meetings, USPS was negotiating with the architectural firm and general contractor on change orders, and it would not have been in the Postal Service\u2019s best interest to disclose the amounts being requested for various changes. An additional reason cited by the Postal Service for closing the meetings was that the Inspection Service was conducting an ongoing investigation of the project.", "We also asked Postal officials whether they believed they would have proceeded with the project or pursued an alternative, such as renovating the old Main Post Office, had they initially known the new facility\u2019s final cost. An official who was involved in the facility\u2019s planning said that the old Main Post Office was too old and large to be feasibly renovated. In a written response, the Postal Service said that it could not speculate what alternatives management and the Board would have chosen in 1990 had the final costs been known at the time.
