To address these problems, DOD initiated the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) program, which is to provide a joint, integrated, standardized military personnel and pay system across all military components. In November 2004, DOD accepted the design for the first of three phases, DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay). GAO reviewed DOD's management of the requirements definition for the system as well as the program's management structure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD faces significant management challenges with DIMHRS, a major system acquisition program that is expected to lead to major changes in the processing of military personnel and pay. To its credit, DOD has begun taking steps to ensure that the requirements and the design for the first phase of the program are consistent with each other by tracing backward and forward between the detailed requirements and the system design, and it did obtain formal user acceptance of the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) high-level requirements. However, it has not obtained user acceptance of the detailed requirements. Furthermore, it has not ensured that the detailed requirements are complete and understandable. For example, requirements for the interfaces between DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and existing systems have not yet been fully defined because DOD has not yet determined how many legacy systems will be partially replaced and thus require modification. Furthermore, DOD is still determining whether the data requirements provided to the contractor for system design are complete. Finally, an estimated 77 percent of the detailed requirements are difficult to understand, based on GAO's review of a random sample of the requirements documentation. These challenges increase the risk that the delivered system capabilities will not fully meet the users' needs. Moreover, although DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) is to be an integrated system, its development is not being governed by integrated tools and approaches, such as an integrated program management structure, enterprise architecture, and master schedule. Furthermore, while DOD is appropriately attempting to maximize the use of commercial, off-the shelf (COTS) products in building the new system, it has not adequately followed some important best practices associated with COTS-based system acquisitions. For example, DOD's program plan/schedule does not adequately recognize the needs of end-user organizations for the time and resources to integrate DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) with their respective legacy systems and to prepare their workforces for the organizational changes that the system will introduce. DOD's requirements definition challenges and shortcomings in program governance can be attributed to a number of causes, including the program's overly schedule-driven approach and DOD's difficulty in overcoming its long-standing cultural resistance to departmentwide solutions. Unless these challenges are addressed, the risk is increased that the system will not provide expected capabilities and benefits on time and within budget. Given the limitations in some DOD components' ability to accurately pay military personnel, it is vital that these risks be addressed swiftly and effectively."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As we first reported in 1993, the Department of Defense (DOD) has had  serious problems with military personnel and pay systems, including  shortcomings in its ability to properly pay military personnel and to  monitor and track them to, from, and within their duty stations. We  recently reported that such problems continue today, particularly for  Army Reserve and National Guard troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  These long-standing problems can be attributed, in part, to    hundreds of supporting information technology (IT) systems, many of  which perform the same tasks and store duplicate data; the need for manual data reconciliation, correction, and entry across these  nonintegrated systems; and the large number of data translations and system interfaces.", "To address these problems, DOD initiated the Defense Integrated Military  Human Resources System (DIMHRS) program, which is to provide a joint,  integrated system that is standardized across all military components.  The system is to be Web-based and maximize the use of commercial,  off-the-shelf (COTS) software. DOD plans to acquire and deploy DIMHRS  in three phases:    DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay)\u2014military personnel hiring, promotion,  retirement, etc., and pay;   DIMHRS (Manpower)\u2014workforce planning, analysis, utilization, etc.; and    DIMHRS (Training).", "DOD accepted the design of the first system phase\u2014DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay)\u2014in November 2004 and is now proceeding with  development of the system. Deployment to the Army and the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is to begin in the second quarter  of fiscal year 2006, followed by deployment to the Air Force, Navy, and  Marine Corps.", "The first phase, DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay), is intended to focus particularly  on    providing joint-theater commanders with accurate and timely human    providing active service members, reservists, and National Guard  members with timely and accurate pay and benefits, including those  performing in theaters of operation or combat; and   providing an integrated military personnel and payroll system that uses  standard data definitions across all services and service components,  thereby reducing multiple data entries, system maintenance, pay  discrepancies, and reconciliations of personnel and pay information.", "The system design for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) is based on requirements  defined to reflect a new, joint approach to processing military personnel  and pay; this new approach is expected to result in major changes to  current business processes.", "Given the importance of DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) to DOD\u2019s ability to  manage military personnel and pay, we initiated a review, under the  authority of the Comptroller General, of the management of the DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) acquisition. Our objectives were to determine    whether DOD has effective processes in place for managing the definition  of the requirements for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and   whether DOD has established an integrated program management  structure for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and is following effective processes  for acquiring a system based on commercial software components.", "On November 30, 2004, we briefed officials from DOD\u2019s Joint  Requirements and Integration Office, the Navy Program Executive Office  (IT), and DOD\u2019s Joint Program Management Office on the results of our  review. This report transmits the briefing. The full briefing, including our  scope and methodology, is reprinted as appendix I. We performed our  work from January through November 2004, in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Management of the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) Requirements Definition Has Recently Improved, but Key Aspects of Requirements Definition Remain a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not effectively managed important aspects of the requirements  for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) to ensure that they are complete, correct,  and unambiguous. Requirements are the foundation for designing,  developing, and testing a system. Incorrect or incomplete requirements  have been commonly identified as a cause of systems that do not meet  their cost, schedule, or performance goals. Disciplined processes and  controls for the definition and management of requirements are defined in  published models and guides, such as the Capability Maturity Models  developed by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute  and standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers.", "DOD\u2019s management of DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) requirements had several  shortcomings:    First, DOD did not initially ensure that the system requirements and  system design were aligned. DOD required the contractor to base the  system design only on high-level (more general) requirements, providing  detailed requirements to the contractor for information only. However,  according to the program office, the system design should be based on the  detailed requirements, and following our inquiries, the program office  began tracing backward and forward between the detailed requirements  and the system design to ensure consistency. Among other things, DOD is  analyzing financial system standards to ensure that all applicable  standards are included in the requirements and design for DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay). Without consistency between requirements and design,  the risk is increased that the developed and deployed system will not fully  satisfy financial system standards and users\u2019 needs.", "Second, DOD did not ensure that the detailed requirements include  important content and that they are clear and unambiguous. The  requirements for the interfaces between DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and  existing systems are not yet complete because DOD has not yet  determined the extent to which legacy systems will be replaced and thus  require modification in order to interact with the new system.  Furthermore, DOD is still determining whether the data requirements  provided to the contractor for system design are complete. Finally, about  77 percent of the detailed requirements are difficult to understand, based  on our review of a random sample of the requirements documentation.  Our review showed that this documentation did not consistently provide a  clear explanation of the relationships among the parts of each requirement  (business rules; information requirements; and references to regulations,  laws, standards, and so on) or adequately identify the sources of data  required for computations. If requirements are not complete and clear,  their implementation in the system is not likely to meet users\u2019 needs.", "Third, DOD has not obtained user acceptance of the detailed requirements.", "As we have pointed out, when business process changes are planned,  users\u2019 needs and expectations must be addressed, or users may not accept  change, which can jeopardize the effort. One way to ensure and  demonstrate user acceptance of requirements is to obtain sign-off on the  requirements by end-user representatives. However, although the DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) program obtained the user organizations\u2019 formal  acceptance of the high-level requirements, the process used to define the  detailed requirements has not resulted in such acknowledgment of  agreement on the requirements. Program officials stated that gaining  formal agreement from some of the user organizations would delay the  program and be impractical because of end users\u2019 reluctance to accept a  set of joint requirements that requires end users to make major changes in  their current ways of processing military personnel and pay actions. We  have previously observed this challenge and have stated that DOD\u2019s  organizational structure and embedded culture work against efforts to  modernize business processes and implement corporate information  systems such as DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) across component lines.  Nevertheless, not attempting to obtain agreement on DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) requirements increases the risk that users will not accept  and use the developed and deployed system, and that later system rework  will be required to make it function as intended DOD-wide and achieve  stated military human capital management outcomes.", "According to DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) officials, a number of actions have  been taken to reduce the risk that users will not accept the system,  including conducting numerous focus groups, workshops, demonstrations,  and presentations explaining how the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) software  product could address DOD\u2019s existing personnel/pay problems.", "However, DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) officials stated that support for the  system by the services\u2019 executives is mixed. For example, the officials said  that (1) Army executives are committed to implementing and using the  DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) system because they believe it will address  many problems that the Army currently faces; (2) Air Force officials  generally support the system but say they do not yet know whether the  system will meet all their needs; and (3) Navy and Marine Corps  executives are not as supportive because they are not fully convinced that  DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) will be an improvement over their existing  systems.", "The shortcomings in DOD\u2019s efforts to effectively manage DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) requirements are attributable to a number of causes,  including the program\u2019s overly schedule-driven approach and the difficulty  of overcoming DOD\u2019s long-standing cultural resistance to departmentwide  solutions. These shortcomings leave DOD without adequate assurance that  the requirements will accurately reflect the end users\u2019 needs and that the  resulting system design is reflective of validated requirements that will  fully meet DOD\u2019s needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have a Well-Integrated Management Structure for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and Is Not Following All Relevant Supporting Acquisition Management Processes", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have a well-integrated structure for managing DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay), which DOD has described as an integrated program,  and it is not following some key supporting processes for acquiring  COTS-based business systems.", "Program responsibility, accountability, and authority are diffused. Leading  organizations ensure that programs are structured to ensure that a single  entity has clear authority, responsibility, and accountability for the  program. For DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay), these are spread among three key  stakeholder groups whose respective chains of command do not meet at  any point below the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense levels.  Responsibility for requirements definition rests with a joint requirements  development office, which is accountable through one chain of command.  Responsibility for system acquisition rests with the program office, which  is accountable through another chain of command. Responsibility for  preparing for transition to the new system rests with the end-user  organizations\u201411 major DOD components reporting through five different  chains of command. This is consistent with our earlier observation that  DOD\u2019s organizational structure and embedded culture have not adequately  accommodated an integrated, departmentwide approach to joint systems.  Without a DOD-wide integrated governance structure for a joint,  integrated program like DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay), the risk is increased  that the program will not produce an integrated set of outcomes.", "The system has not been defined and designed according to a DOD-wide  integrated enterprise architecture. In accordance with the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, DOD has been developing  a departmentwide Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and it has  been reviewing some programs, such as DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) with  proposed obligations of funds greater than $1 million, for consistency with  the BEA. In April 2003, the DOD Comptroller certified DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) to be consistent with the BEA on the basis of the program  manager\u2019s commitment that the yet-to-be-developed system would be  designed to be consistent with the yet-to-be-developed architecture. To  follow through on this commitment, DOD included a requirement in the  DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) contract that the systems specification be  compatible with the emerging BEA.", "DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) officials recognize that the April 2003  architectural certification is preliminary and stated that DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) will undergo another certification before the system  deployment decision. By that time, however, lengthy and costly design and  development work will have been completed. The real value in having and  using an architecture is knowing during system definition, design, and  development what the larger blueprint for the enterprise is, so that these  can be guided and constrained by this frame of reference. Aligning to the  architecture after the system is designed would require expensive system  rework to address any inconsistencies with the architecture.", "Program stakeholders\u2019 activities have not been managed according to a  DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay)-integrated master plan/schedule. An effective  master plan/schedule should allow for the proper scheduling and  sequencing of activities and tasks, allocation of resources, preparation of  budgets, assignment of personnel, and criteria for measuring progress.  However, the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) program plan/schedule is based on  the contractor\u2019s and program office\u2019s activities and does not include all the  activities that end-user organizations must perform to prepare for DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay), such as the redesign of legacy systems and interfaces,  business process reengineering, and workforce change management.  Without a true master plan/schedule of activities that includes all DOD  program stakeholders, the risk increases that key and dependent events,  activities, and tasks will not be performed as needed, which in turn  increases the risk of schedule slippage and program goal shortfalls.", "Some, but not all, best practices associated with acquiring COTS-based  business systems are being followed. An example of a best practice that  DOD is following is to discourage the modification of commercial software  components without thorough justification; DOD\u2019s contract includes  award fees that give the contractor incentives to, among other things,  minimize the customization of the COTS software. An example of a best  practice that DOD is not following is to ensure that plans and schedules  explicitly provide for preparing users for the new business processes  associated with the commercial components. DOD does not have an  integrated program plan/schedule that provides for end-user organization  activities that are associated with preparing users for the changes that the  system will introduce. Because it is not following all best practices  associated with acquiring COTS-based systems, DOD is increasing the risk  that DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) will not be successfully implemented and  effectively used.", "DOD\u2019s efforts to employ an integrated program management approach  have not been effective for a number of reasons, including DOD\u2019s long- standing cultural resistance to departmentwide solutions.

DOD has begun to remedy  these omissions by taking actions such as tracing among requirements  documents and system design documents to ensure alignment, but user  organizations\u2019 acceptance of requirements has not occurred. Moreover,  although DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) is to be an integrated system, it is not  being governed by integrated tools and approaches, such as an integrated  program management structure, integrated DOD business enterprise  architecture, and an integrated master plan/schedule.", "Furthermore, while DOD is appropriately attempting to maximize the use  of COTS products in building DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and is following  some best practices for developing COTS-based systems, others are not  being followed.", "The absence of the full complement of effective processes and structures  related to each of these areas can be attributed to a number of causes,  including the program\u2019s overly schedule-driven approach and the difficulty  of overcoming DOD\u2019s long-standing cultural resistance to departmentwide  solutions.

At a minimum,  this should include    ensuring that joint system requirements are complete and correct, and that  they are acceptable to user organizations;   establishing a DOD-wide integrated governance structure for DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) (1) that vests an executive-level organization or entity  representing the interests of all program stakeholders\u2014including the Joint  Requirements and Integration Office, the Joint Program Management  Office, the services, and DFAS\u2014with responsibility, accountability, and  authority for the entire DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) program and (2) that  ensures that all stakeholder interests and positions are appropriately  heard and considered during program reviews and before key program  decisions;    ensuring that the degree of consistency between DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay)  and the evolving DOD-wide business enterprise architecture is  continuously analyzed and that material inconsistencies between the two,  both potential and actual, are disclosed at all program reviews and  decision points and in program budget submissions, along with any  associated system risks and steps to mitigate these risks;   developing and implementing a DOD-wide, integrated master  plan/schedule of activities that extends to all DOD program stakeholders;    ensuring that all relevant acquisition management best practices  associated with COTS-based systems are appropriately followed; and    ensuring that an event-driven, risk-based approach that adequately  considers factors other than the contract schedule continues to be used in  managing DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in app. II), the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness stated that DOD  largely agrees with the thrust of our recommendations, and that it is  already following, to the extent practicable, the kind of acquisition best  practices embodied in them. The department also made two overall  comments about the report and provided a number of detailed comments  pertaining to five of our six recommendations.", "The first overall comment was that our espousal of certain system  acquisition management best practices resulted in incongruity among our  recommendations. In particular, DOD indicated that our recognition that  DOD is appropriately limiting modification of COTS products (a best  practice) is incongruous with our recommendation that requirements be  acceptable to user organizations (another best practice). It further stated  that if it acted on all comments that it received on requirements from all  sources, as it suggested we were recommending, then this would result in  excessive modification to the COTS product. We do not agree with DOD\u2019s  points; we suggest that a careful reading of our recommendations would  show that the department has not correctly interpreted and characterized  those recommendations that pertain to this overall comment. Specifically,  our report does not recommend that DOD act on all comments obtained  from all sources, regardless of the impact and consequences of doing so.  Rather, the report contains complementary recommendations for ensuring  that the system requirements are acceptable to user organizations and  discouraging changes to the COTS product unless the life-cycle costs and  benefits justify making them. In short, our recommendations concerning  system requirements are intended to provide DOD with the principles and  rules that it should apply in executing a requirements-acceptance process  that permits all stakeholder interests and positions to be heard,  considered, and resolved in the context of what makes economic sense.  While DOD\u2019s comments note that a process was followed to screen out  user inputs that, for example, necessitated changes to the COTS product,  this process did not provide for the effective resolution of such inputs, as  shown in our report by certain user organizations\u2019 comments: specifically,  that their involvement in defining detailed requirements was limited, that  their comments on these requirements were not fully resolved, and that  they were not willing to sign off on the requirements as sufficient to meet  their needs. This lack of resolution is important because not attempting to  obtain some level of stakeholder acceptance of requirements increases the  risk that the system will not adequately meet users\u2019 needs, that users will  not adopt the system, and that later system rework will be required to  rectify this situation.", "The second overall comment was that the department was already  employing acquisition management best practices, to the extent  practicable, and that the management process for the program is  innovative and groundbreaking for DOD, going far beyond what is required  by the department\u2019s regulations. For example, the department commented  that the system-requirements documentation far exceeds that which has  been available for any other system effort. We do not dispute DOD\u2019s  comment about efforts on this system relative to other system  acquisitions, because our review\u2019s objectives and approach did not extend  to comparing DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) with other DOD acquisitions.  However, our review did address DOD\u2019s use of key acquisition  management best practices on DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay), and in this  regard we support the department\u2019s recognition of the importance of these  practices. In our report, we have provided a balanced message by  recognizing instances where best practices were being followed, such as  when DOD began tracing detailed system requirements to the system  design following inquiries that we made during the course of our review.  However, we do not agree that at the time we concluded our work DOD  was following all relevant and practicable best practices; examples of  these practices are cited in our report and discussed below in our  response to DOD\u2019s detailed comments on our individual  recommendations.", "In its comments specific to our six recommendations, the department  agreed without further comment with one recommendation (to develop  and implement a DOD-wide, integrated master plan/schedule of activities  that extends to all DOD program stakeholders). In addition, it either  partially agreed or partially disagreed with our other five  recommendations, and it provided detailed comments on each. Generally,  DOD\u2019s areas of disagreement relate to its view that it is already performing  the activities that we recommend.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to ensure that joint  system requirements are complete and correct and acceptable to user  organizations. In this regard, DOD stated that it has already taken great  pains to ensure that the requirements are complete and correct, although  its comments stated that this assurance has occurred \u201cto the extent that  any documentation  this massive can be correct.\u201d It also  stated that the requirements are fully traceable to the system design, and  that the high-level requirements were validated in accordance with DOD  regulations. It added that it has taken various steps to gain users\u2019  acceptance of the system, including a change management process,  briefings, and prototype demonstrations.", "We do not disagree that DOD has taken important steps to meet the goals  of requirements completeness and correctness. Likewise, we do not  disagree that since receiving our draft report for comment, the department  might have completed the important requirements-to-design traceability  steps that it began in response to our inquiries, which we describe in our  report. However, DOD\u2019s comments contain no evidence to show that it has  addressed the limitations in the requirements\u2019 completeness and  correctness that we cite in the report, such as those relating to the  interface and data requirements, and they do not address the  understandability issues we found relative to 77 percent of the detailed  requirements. Moreover, DOD stated in its comments that its latest  program review revealed 606 business process comments and 17 interface  comments that it deemed noncritical, although it noted that they were still  being analyzed.", "We also do not disagree that DOD has taken steps to gain user acceptance  of the system. However, they did not gain acceptance of the detailed  requirements that the system is to be designed to meet, which is the focus  of our recommendation. As we point out in the report, not attempting to  obtain agreement on the detailed requirements increases the risk that  users will not adopt the system as developed and deployed, and that later  system rework will be needed to address this.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that it continuously  analyze the degree of consistency between DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and  the evolving DOD-wide BEA so that the risks of material inconsistencies  are understood and addressed. In doing so, DOD stated that the DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) requirements comprise the military personnel and pay  portion of the architecture and that as one of the first major systems  developed using all the principles of this architecture, DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) is and will remain fully consistent with it. We do not agree  with DOD\u2019s comments that the system is consistent with the BEA. As we  state in our report, DOD could not provide us with documented, verifiable  analysis demonstrating this consistency and forming the basis for the DOD  Comptroller\u2019s April 2003 certification of this consistency. Rather, we were  told that this certification was based on the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay)  program manager\u2019s stated commitment to be consistent at some future  point. However, as we note in our report, the real value of an architecture  is that it provides the necessary context for guiding and constraining  system investments in a way that promotes interoperability and minimizes  overlap and duplication. Without it, expensive system rework is likely to  be needed to achieve these outcomes. As we also note in our report, the  absence of verifiable analysis of DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) architectural  compliance was in part due to the state of the BEA, which we have  reported as not being well-defined and missing important content.  Recognizing this, as well as the pressing need for DIMHRS\u2019s  (Personnel/Pay) promised capabilities, our recommendation calls for  ongoing analysis of DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) and the BEA to understand  the risks of designing and developing the system outside the context of a  well-defined architecture.", "DOD partially disagreed with our recommendation that it establish a  DOD-wide governance structure in which responsibility, accountability,  and authority for the entire program are vested in an executive-level  organization or entity representing the interests of all program  stakeholders. In doing so, the department described the roles,  responsibilities, and authorities for various program stakeholders;  however, it did not explain its reason for not agreeing with the  recommendation, and only one of its comments bears relevance to our  recommendation. Specifically, it commented that the Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness) has full responsibility and  accountability for the program. We do not agree. As we state in our report,  DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) is a DOD-wide program involving three distinct  stakeholder groups whose respective chains of command do not meet at  any point below the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense levels.  Thus, we concluded that responsibility, accountability, and authority for  the program are diffused, with responsibility for developing functional  requirements resting with the Joint Requirements and Integration Office,  responsibility for system acquisition resting with the Joint Program  Management Office, and responsibility for preparing for the transition to  DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) resting with 11 major end-user organizations.  Under this structure, only the Joint Requirements and Integration Office is  accountable to the Under Secretary, and the two distinct other stakeholder  groups are not accountable to the Under Secretary.", "This means, as we state in the report, that no single DOD entity is  positioned to exercise continuous leadership and direction over the  entire program.", "The department also partially disagreed with our recommendation to  follow all relevant acquisition management best practices associated with  COTS-based systems. According to DOD\u2019s comments, all of these best  practices are currently being followed, including the three that we cite in  our report as not being followed: (1) ensuring that plans explicitly provide  for preparing users for the impact that the business processes embedded  in the commercial components will have on their respective roles and  responsibilities, (2) proactively managing the introduction and adoption of  changes to how users will be expected to use the system to execute their  jobs, and (3) ensuring that project plans explicitly provide for the  necessary time and resources for integrating commercial components with  legacy systems. In this regard, the department stated that the DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) program had documented every change in current  practices and policies that will be required for the military services, as well  as future practices and policies, and that these were fully vetted through  the functional user community. It also described a number of activities  that it has undertaken to prepare and train users in the COTS product and  other aspects of DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay).", "We do not dispute whether DOD has performed activities intended to  facilitate the implementation of DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay). However, the  best practices that we identified as not being followed, which form the  basis of our recommendation, are focused on effectively planning for the  full complement of activities that are needed to prepare an organization  for the institutional and individual changes that COTS-based system  solutions introduce. Such planning is intended to ensure, among other  things, that key change management activities, including the dependencies  among these activities, are defined and agreed to by stakeholders,  including ensuring that adequate resources and realistic time frames are  established to accomplish them. In this regard, DOD agreed in its  comments that it does not have an integrated master plan/schedule for the  program, which is an essential tool for capturing the results of the  proactive change management planning that the best practices and our  recommendation advocate. Both published research and our experience in  evaluating the acquisition and implementation of COTS-based system  solutions show that the absence of well-planned, proactive organizational  and individual change management efforts can cause these system efforts  to fail.", "The department partially disagreed with our last recommendation to adopt  a more event-driven, risk-based approach to managing DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) that adequately considers factors other than the contract  schedule, stating that it is currently using an event-driven, risk-based  approach and revising the schedule when necessary. We support DOD\u2019s  comment, as it indicates that DOD has decided to begin following such an  approach. However, during the course of our work this was not the case.  For example, we observed at that time that the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay)  program intended to accelerate its deployment schedule to meet an  externally imposed deadline and that it was not until we raised concerns  about the associated risks of doing so, as well as the absence of effective  strategies to mitigate these risks, in an earlier draft of the briefing included  in this report, that the department changed its plans. Also during the  course of our work, we observed that program activities were truncated or  performed concurrently in order to meet established deadlines. For  example, as we describe in our report, data requirements (which are  derived from higher-level information needs) were provided to the  contractor before information needs were fully defined because the  contractor needed these data requirements to complete the system design  on schedule. It was this kind of focus on schedule that led to our  recommendation to adopt a more event-driven, risk-based approach.  However, in light of DOD\u2019s comment that it intends to do so, we have  slightly modified our recommendation to recognize this decision.", "All our recommendations are aimed at reducing the risk of failure on this  important program, which we and DOD agree is critical to the  department\u2019s ability to effectively manage military personnel and pay.

The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) characterization of our objectives  is not correct. As stated in our report, our objectives were to  determine whether DOD had effective processes in place for managing  the definition of requirements for the Defense Integrated Military  Human Resources System (DIMHRS) (Personnel/Pay) and whether it  established an integrated program management structure and followed  effective processes for acquiring a system based on commercial  software components. Accordingly, we assessed the processes used to  manage DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay), and the content of the  requirements, against relevant best practices, many of which are  embodied in DOD and federal policies and guidance, and against  federal guidance, federal accounting standards, and prior GAO reports.   2.  We do not believe that our finding that DOD is appropriately limiting  modification of commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) products (a best  practice) is incongruous with our recommendation that requirements  be acceptable to user organizations (another best practice).  Furthermore, our report does not recommend that DOD act on all  comments regardless of impact. Our recommendations concerning  system requirements are intended to provide DOD with the principles  and rules that it should apply in executing a requirements-acceptance  process that permits all stakeholder interests and positions to be  heard, considered, and resolved in the context of what makes  economic sense. Furthermore, our report makes complementary  recommendations that discourage changes to COTS products unless  fully justified on the basis of life-cycle costs, benefits, and risks.  Finally, while we do not dispute whether DOD has followed a process  to screen out comments that would have necessitated COTS  modification, DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) users said that this process did  not allow for effective resolution of the comments, which is the basis  for our recommendation aimed at gaining user acceptance of  requirements.  3.  We have not concluded that DOD had not done enough to ensure that  all stakeholders have had full input to the requirements. Our  conclusion was that DOD had not obtained user acceptance of the  detailed requirements, and that this choice entails risks.  4.  We disagree. Our report neither states nor suggests that DOD act on all  comments that it receives on requirements from all sources. Also, see  comment 2.  5.  See comment 10.  6.  We acknowledge DOD\u2019s implementation of certain best practices as  noted in our report. However, at the time we concluded our work,  DOD was not following all relevant and practicable best practices, as  we discuss in our report.  7.  We do not dispute DOD\u2019s comment about efforts on DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay) relative to other system acquisitions because our  review\u2019s objectives and approach did not extend to comparing the two.  See comment 1 for a description of our objectives. Furthermore, while  it is correct that DOD\u2019s regulations only require stakeholder agreement  with the Operational Requirements Document, our evaluation was not  limited to whether DOD was meeting its own policy; we also evaluated  whether DOD\u2019s processes were consistent with industry and  government best practices.  8.  We do not disagree that DOD has taken important steps to meet the  goals of requirements completeness and correctness, and we do not  have a basis for commenting on whether the department might have  completed important requirements-to-design traceability steps since  we completed our work. However, as we state in our report, these  tracing steps began in response to the inquiries we made during the  course of our review. Furthermore, DOD\u2019s comments contain no  evidence to show that it has addressed the limitations in the  requirements\u2019 completeness and correctness that we cite in the report,  such as those relating to the interface and data requirements, and they  do not address the understandability issues we found relative to an  estimated 77 percent of the detailed requirements. Moreover, DOD  even stated in its comments that its latest program review revealed 606  business process comments and 17 interface comments that it deemed  noncritical, although it noted that they were still being analyzed.  9.  We do not dispute DOD\u2019s position that the Joint Requirements  Oversight Council\u2019s validation of the Operational Requirements  Document is all that is required by DOD regulation, and we do not  have a basis for commenting on whether its documentation of  requirements for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) was innovative and  unprecedented. Our review objective relating to requirements, as  stated in our report, was to address whether DOD has effective  processes in place for managing the definition of the requirements. To  accomplish this objective, and as also stated in our report, we analyzed  DOD\u2019s requirements management efforts against recognized best  practices.  10.  We do not disagree that DOD has taken numerous steps to gain user  acceptance of the system. However, as we point out in the report, user  organizations still had questions and reservations concerning the  requirements. Not adequately resolving these issues, and thereby  gaining user acceptance of requirements, increases the risk that a  system will be developed that does not meet users\u2019 needs, that users  will not adopt the developed and deployed system, and that later  system rework will be required to rectify this situation.  11.  We do not question that DOD has reviewed the detailed requirements  since we completed our review. However, we challenge DOD\u2019s  comment that all questions have been resolved for two reasons. First,  DOD\u2019s comments contain no evidence to show that it has addressed  the limitations in the requirements\u2019 completeness and correctness that  we cite in the report, such as those relating to the interface and data  requirements, or the understandability issues we found relative to an  estimated 77 percent of the detailed requirements. Second, in its  comments, DOD acknowledges that 606 questions remain regarding  requirements and design issues.  12.  We agree that the detailed requirements are not the sole vehicle for  gaining user acceptance of the system. Rather, they are one vehicle to  be used in a continuous process to ensure acceptability of a system to  end users. Industry and government best practices advocate users\u2019  understanding and acceptance of requirements, and these practices are  not limited to high-level requirements descriptions, but rather apply to  more detailed requirements descriptions as well.  13.  We do not dispute that the roles and responsibilities of the Executive  Steering Committee are defined and documented. In fact, we cite the  committee\u2019s responsibilities in our report.  14.  We agree that DOD has forums and processes for communicating  stakeholder interests. However, we do not agree that these have  provided for effective resolution of concerns and comments, as we  describe in our report. Also, see comment 10.  15.  We disagree. In our view, any entity, whether it is an individual, office,  or committee, can have responsibility, accountability, and authority for  managing a program. Moreover, we intentionally worded the  recommendation so as not to prescribe what entity should fulfill this  role for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay). Rather, our intent was to ensure  that such an entity was designated and empowered.  16.  We disagree. DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) is a DOD-wide program  involving three distinct stakeholder groups whose respective chains of  command do not meet at any point below the Secretary and Deputy  Secretary of Defense levels. As we state in our report, responsibility,  authority, and accountability for DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) is in fact  diffused among three stakeholder groups with responsibility for  requirements with the Joint Requirements and Integration Office,  responsibility for acquisition with the Joint Program Management  Office, and responsibility for transition to DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay)  with the 11 end users\u2019 organizations. Furthermore, under the current  structure, only one of the three stakeholder groups, the Joint  Requirements and Integration Office (JR&IO), is accountable to the  Under Secretary, and authority over DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) is  spread across the three groups. Accordingly, the intent of our  recommendation is for DOD to create an accountability structure that  can set expectations for stakeholders and hold them accountable.  17.  See comment 2. Furthermore, we agree that the department should not  replicate \u201cas is\u201d processes. However, as our report points out, the  users\u2019 comment process did not provide for effective resolution;  therefore, users stated that they were not willing to sign off on the  requirements as sufficient to meet their needs. The intent of our  recommendation is to ensure that the system\u2019s functional acceptability  to users is reasonably ensured before the system is developed, thereby  minimizing the risk of more expensive system rework to meet users\u2019  needs.  18.  We do not believe and nowhere in our report do we state or suggest  that stakeholders should be granted veto power. Also, see comments 2  and 3.  19.  We disagree. As stated in our report, DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) had a  preliminary architectural certification with the Business Enterprise  Architecture (BEA) in April 2003. However, DOD could not provide us  with documented, verifiable analysis demonstrating this consistency  and forming the basis for the certification, in part because the BEA  was incomplete. Rather, we were told that this certification was based  on the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) program manager\u2019s stated  commitment to be consistent at some future point, and the system is  scheduled to undergo another certification before the system  deployment decision. Moreover, we had previously reported that the  BEA, including the military personnel and pay portions of the  architecture, was not complete, and thus not in place to effectively  guide and constrain system investments. As we state in our report, the  real value in having an architecture is knowing, at the time when  system definition, design, and development are occurring, what the  larger blueprint for the enterprise is in order to guide and constrain  these activities.  20.  We disagree. See comment 21.  21.  We disagree. As we state in our report, DOD is not following three  relevant best practices. These practices are focused on effectively  planning for the full complement of activities that are needed to  prepare an organization for the institutional and individual changes  that COTS-based system solutions introduce. Such planning is  intended to ensure, among other things, that key change management  activities, including the dependencies among these activities, are  defined and agreed to by stakeholders, including ensuring that  adequate resources and realistic time frames are established to  accomplish them. In this regard, DOD agreed in its comments that it  does not have an integrated master plan/schedule for the program,  which is an essential tool for capturing the results of the proactive  change management planning that the best practices and our  recommendation advocate. Moreover, available plans did not include  all activities that end-user organizations will need to make regarding  organizational changes and business process improvements associated  with the system, such as revising the duties that are now performed by  pay specialists and personnel specialists. This concern was stated by  representatives of the DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay) offices in the services  and DFAS, who stated that current plans do not adequately address the  activities, time frames, and resources they will need to complete the  transition to DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay). Furthermore, at the time that  we completed our review, DOD had yet to identify all the legacy  systems that would interface with DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay), and so  DOD could not estimate the time and resources that will be needed to  develop and implement legacy system interfaces with DIMHRS  (Personnel/Pay). Both published research and our experience in  evaluating the acquisition and implementation of COTS-based system  solutions show that the absence of well-planned, proactive  organizational and individual change management efforts can cause  these system efforts to fail.   22.  See comment 21. Furthermore, among the ambiguities in the detailed  requirements that we cite in our report are references that do not  clearly state the associated practice or policy.  23.  See comments 8 and 22. In addition and as stated in our report, the  process used to define detailed requirements has yet to result in user  acceptance. Specifically, according to end-user representatives from  each of the services, the detailed requirements were difficult to  understand because they were shared in a piecemeal fashion and did  not include sufficient detail. Furthermore, these representatives stated  that they were not willing to sign off on the requirements.  24.  We do not dispute that DOD has provided demonstrations of and  training on the COTS product. However, as we point out in our report,  users still have questions on DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay), which will be  based on the COTS product, including how it will be used to perform  personnel and pay functions, and how it will change the roles and  responsibilities of end users. Moreover, proactive management of the  organizational and individual change associated with COTS-based  system solutions requires careful planning for the full range of  activities needed to facilitate the introduction and adoption of the  system, and as we state in the report and DOD agreed in its comments,  the department does not have the kind of integrated master plan that  would reflect such planning.   25.  We do not dispute that existing plans have been reviewed and  approved by the contractor and an independent reviewer. However,  we disagree that these plans sufficiently incorporate all the change  management activities that are needed to position DOD for adoption  and use of DIMHRS (Personnel/Pay). In the absence of an integrated  master schedule, which the department acknowledges in its comments  as yet to be developed, DOD cannot adequately ensure that the full  range of organizational and individual change management activities  will be effectively performed.  26.  We support DOD\u2019s stated commitment to follow a more event-driven  risk-based approach, and have slightly modified our recommendation  to recognize this commitment. Nevertheless, it is important to note  that the approach that we found the department taking during the  course of our review was schedule driven, meaning that program  activities were truncated or performed concurrently in order to meet  established deadlines. For example, as we describe in our report, data  requirements (which are derived from higher-level information needs)  were provided to the contractor before information needs were fully  defined because the contractor needed these data requirements to  complete the system design on schedule. Also during our review, the  program had developed plans for accelerating system deployment in  order to meet an externally imposed deadline. After we raised concern  about the risks of accelerating the schedule, and the lack of adequate  risk-mitigation strategies, DOD changed its plans.   27.  At the time of our review, we observed that the contract was a driver  for the schedule. For example and as our report states, in March 2004,  JR&IO provided a version of the detailed requirements to the  development and integration contractor in order to meet the  contractor\u2019s schedule, even though it had received thousands of  comments on the requirements from users that it had yet to examine  and resolve.   28.  We support DOD\u2019s comment that it will revise the schedule if events  do not occur as anticipated because it is consistent with our  recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, the following persons made key  contributions to this report: Nabajyoti Barkakati, Harold J.
