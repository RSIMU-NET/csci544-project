The disruption of control systems could have a significant impact on public health and safety, which makes securing them a national priority. GAO was asked to testify on portions of its report on control systems security being released today. This testimony summarizes the cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and the potential impact of attacks on control systems; identifies private sector initiatives; and assesses the adequacy of public sector initiatives to strengthen the cyber security of control systems. To address these objectives, GAO met with federal and private sector officials to identify risks, initiatives, and challenges. GAO also compared agency plans to best practices for securing critical infrastructures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Critical infrastructure control systems face increasing risks due to cyber threats, system vulnerabilities, and the serious potential impact of attacks as demonstrated by reported incidents. Threats can be intentional or unintentional, targeted or nontargeted, and can come from a variety of sources. Control systems are more vulnerable to cyber attacks than in the past for several reasons, including their increased connectivity to other systems and the Internet. Further, as demonstrated by past attacks and incidents involving control systems, the impact on a critical infrastructure could be substantial. For example, in 2006, a foreign hacker was reported to have planted malicious software capable of affecting a water filtering plant's water treatment operations. Also in 2006, excessive traffic on a nuclear power plant's control system network caused two circulation pumps to fail, forcing the unit to be shut down manually. Multiple private sector entities such as trade associations and standards setting organizations are working to help secure control systems. Their efforts include developing standards and providing guidance to members. For example, the electricity industry has recently developed standards for cyber security of control systems and a gas trade association is developing guidance for members to use encryption to secure control systems. Federal agencies also have multiple initiatives under way to help secure critical infrastructure control systems, but more remains to be done to coordinate these efforts and to address specific shortfalls. Over the past few years, federal agencies have initiated efforts to improve the security of critical infrastructure control systems. However, there is as yet no overall strategy to coordinate the various activities across federal agencies and the private sector. Further, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacks processes needed to address specific weaknesses in sharing information on control system vulnerabilities. Until public and private sector security efforts are coordinated by an overarching strategy, there is an increased risk that multiple organizations will conduct duplicative work. In addition, until information-sharing weaknesses are addressed, DHS risks not being able to effectively carry out its responsibility for sharing information on vulnerabilities with the private and public sectors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to join today\u2019s hearing on the cyber threat  to control systems.

These systems and assets\u2014such as the electric power grid,  chemical plants, and water treatment facilities\u2014are essential to the  operations of the economy and the government. Recent terrorist attacks  and threats have underscored the need to protect our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures. If vulnerabilities in these infrastructures are exploited, our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures could be disrupted or disabled, possibly  causing loss of life, physical damage, and economic losses.", "Although the vast majority of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are  owned by the private sector, the federal government owns and operates  key facilities that use control systems, including oil, gas, water, energy,  and nuclear facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Control Systems Are Used in Many Critical Infrastructures", "paragraphs": ["Control systems are computer-based systems that are used within many  infrastructures and industries to monitor and control sensitive processes  and physical functions. Typically, control systems collect sensor  measurements and operational data from the field, process and display  this information, and relay control commands to local or remote  equipment. Control systems perform functions that range from simple to  complex. They can be used to simply monitor processes\u2014for example, the  environmental conditions in a small office building\u2014or to manage the  complex activities of a municipal water system or a nuclear power plant.", "In the electric power industry, control systems can be used to manage and  control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power.  For example, control systems can open and close circuit breakers and set  thresholds for preventive shutdowns. The oil and gas industry uses  integrated control systems to manage refining operations at plant sites,  remotely monitor the pressure and flow of gas pipelines, and control the  flow and pathways of gas transmission. Water utilities can remotely  monitor well levels and control the wells\u2019 pumps; monitor flows, tank  levels, or pressure in storage tanks; monitor water quality characteristics  such as pH, turbidity, and chlorine residual; and control the addition of  chemicals to the water.", "Installing and maintaining control systems requires a substantial financial  investment. DOE cites research estimating the value of the control  systems used to monitor and control the electric grid and the oil and  natural gas infrastructure at $3 billion to $4 billion. The thousands of  remote field devices represent an additional investment of $1.5 billion to  $2.5 billion.

Distributed control systems typically are used within a single processing  or generating plant or over a small geographic area, while SCADA systems  typically are used for large, geographically dispersed operations. For  example, a utility company may use a distributed control system to  manage power generation and a SCADA system to manage its distribution.", "A SCADA system is generally composed of six components: (1)  instruments, which sense conditions such as pH, temperature, pressure,  power level, and flow rate; (2) operating equipment, which includes  pumps, valves, conveyors, and substation breakers; (3) local processors,  which communicate with the site\u2019s instruments and operating equipment,  collect instrument data, and identify alarm conditions; (4) short-range  communication, which carry analog and discrete signals between the local  processors and the instruments and operating equipment; (5) host  computers, where a human operator can supervise the process, receive  alarms, review data, and exercise control; and (6) long-range  communications, which connect local processors and host computers  using, for example, leased phone lines, satellite, and cellular packet data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Plays a Critical Role in Helping Secure Critical Infrastructures and Their Control Systems", "paragraphs": ["Several key federal plans focus on securing critical infrastructure control  systems.

In addition, DHS\u2019s National Infrastructure Protection  Plan specifically identifies control systems as part of the cyber  infrastructure, establishes an objective of reducing vulnerabilities and  minimizing the severity of attacks on these systems, and identifies  programs directed at protecting control systems. Further, in May 2007, the  critical infrastructure sectors issued sector-specific plans to supplement  the National Infrastructure Protection Plan.

In June 1999,  237,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from a 16-inch pipeline and ignited an  hour and a half later, causing three deaths, eight injuries, and extensive  property damage.
