If travel to IDP- or CZTR-designated areas begins during one month and concludes during another (known as cross-month travel), members could receive 2 full months of benefits. GAO conducted this review under the Comptroller General's authority to initiate such reviews. GAO evaluated DOD's (1) process for reviewing IDP areas and (2) internal controls over servicemembers' temporary duty travel to areas designated for IDP and CZTR benefits.

While combatant commanders have taken the initiative periodically to make recommendations to designate or terminate IDP areas, DOD has not conducted annual reviews of existing IDP designations in accordance with its guidance to ensure that conditions in these areas continue to warrant such designation. Also, DOD has not updated its guidance to reflect current responsibilities for initiating annual reviews or to include factors used to determine when conditions in foreign areas pose the threat of physical harm or imminent danger to servicemembers on duty in these locations. DOD conducted 6 annual reviews between 1992 and 2006. When conducting reviews, DOD has queried combatant commanders using a set of factors to determine the nature of threats to servicemembers. However, DOD has not incorporated these factors into its guidance. By conducting annual reviews in accordance with its guidance, DOD could strengthen its oversight of IDP designations to ensure that conditions in designated areas continue to pose the threat of physical harm or imminent danger to servicemembers and that these areas should continue to be designated. Internal controls over servicemembers' temporary duty travel to areas designated for IDP or CZTR benefits need to be strengthened. While two DOD components have instituted policies to regulate and monitor cross-month travel to these areas, there is no similar departmentwide policy to ensure that travel to areas designated for IDP or CZTR benefits needs to cross calendar months. Data limitations prevented GAO from determining the full extent of temporary duty travel to areas designated for IDP and CZTR benefits, as well as how much of this travel crosses calendar months. The U.S. Central Command and U.S. Army, Europe--which collectively account for 62 percent of IDP areas and 86 percent of CZTR benefit areas--have developed policies and controls to monitor and regulate cross-month travel to areas designated for IDP and CZTR benefits to preclude, in their view, the appearance of abuse of these benefits. By establishing internal controls such as a departmentwide policy and periodic audits to monitor cross-month travel, DOD could ensure all areas are covered and further strengthen its management of IDP and CZTR benefits. DOD tracks IDP costs and servicemembers' compensation that qualifies for CZTR benefits. While DOD reports the cost of IDP to Congress as part of its budget request, the department does not report servicemembers' compensation that qualifies for CZTR benefits. Combat zone tax relief benefits could allow servicemembers to exclude a significant portion of their income from federal taxes.

In particular,  servicemembers who are assigned, deployed, or travel on temporary duty  to certain foreign areas are eligible for certain special pays and benefits.   These include (1) imminent danger pay for servicemembers on duty in  foreign areas designated by the Secretary of Defense in which a  servicemember is subject to the threat of physical harm or imminent  danger on the basis of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime  conditions and (2) combat zone tax relief benefits that permit  servicemembers to exclude all or a portion of their compensation from  federal taxes while serving in specific areas designated by the President  through Executive Order, known as combat zones, or in areas designated  by Congress, known as qualified hazardous duty areas (see app. I and II).", "Servicemembers may also qualify to receive combat zone tax relief  benefits when they are performing military duty outside of a combat zone  or in a congressionally established qualified hazardous duty area if   (1) duty in this area is in direct support of military operations in a combat  zone or qualified hazardous duty area and (2) the duty qualifies a  servicemember for hostile fire or imminent danger pay based on the risks  and dangers related to the combat zone. If a servicemember travels to an  area designated for imminent danger pay or combat zone tax relief  benefits, and the travel begins during one month and concludes during  another month (known as cross-month travel), the servicemember  receives 2 full months of the special pay and benefit. Combat zone tax  relief benefits can provide significant financial benefits, especially if a  servicemember qualifies for this benefit on more than one occasion during  a calendar year.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for designating  imminent danger pay areas and certifying locations where military service  is in direct support of combat zone operations.  Over the past few decades,  DOD has designated an increasing number of areas for imminent danger  pay. Since imminent danger pay was first authorized on October 1, 1983,  the number of areas designated for this pay has increased from a few to 54  areas due primarily to the global security environment, according to DOD.  DOD has stated that a goal is to limit imminent danger pay to only those  servicemembers who face the threat of physical harm or imminent  danger, and DOD\u2019s guidance requires at least annual reviews of  designated areas to determine whether conditions warrant the continued  designation. In addition, since September 2001, DOD has certified military  service in several countries as directly supporting combat operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq. Currently, these locations include Djibouti, Jordan,  Pakistan, the Philippines, and Yemen, among others (see app. III).", "We have previously reported that clear policies, procedures, criteria, and  management oversight are needed to help agencies use resources  effectively and efficiently to meet organizational and program objectives.", "We also previously reported that the federal government\u2019s total costs to  provide military compensation are substantial and rising and that the  nation\u2019s growing fiscal concerns will require DOD and the federal  government to consider difficult trade-offs in the years ahead. According  to DOD, since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism, military basic  pay has increased approximately 25 percent. DOD has reported paying  more than $2 billion in hostile fire and imminent danger pay to  servicemembers assigned, deployed, or traveling on temporary duty.  Furthermore, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service calculated that  between tax years 2003 and 2005, active duty servicemembers collectively  qualified to exclude more than $26 billion of their compensation as a result  of performing duty that qualified for combat zone tax relief benefits. This  amount includes servicemembers who performed duty in areas that DOD  has designated as in direct support of military operations in combat zones.", "Because of broad congressional interest in military pay and compensation,  we prepared this report under the authority of the Comptroller General to  conduct evaluations at his own initiative. Our objectives were to evaluate  DOD\u2019s (1) process for reviewing imminent danger pay area designations  and (2) internal controls over servicemembers\u2019 temporary duty travel to  areas designated for imminent danger pay and combat zone tax relief  benefits.

We compared this guidance to the objectives and  fundamental concepts of internal control defined in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. We also held discussions  with knowledgeable officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness), the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each of the  services, and the geographic combatant commands. We also reviewed  questionnaires completed by commanders at unified combatant  commands with geographic responsibility and used by the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) to evaluate area  designations and the threat of imminent danger. To understand the extent  to which DOD has internal controls in place to monitor servicemembers\u2019  temporary duty travel to foreign areas designated for imminent danger pay  or combat zone tax relief benefits, we reviewed DOD\u2019s Foreign Clearance  Guide that establishes DOD policy for military personnel traveling  overseas as well as combatant commands\u2019 travel policies. We discussed  these with officials responsible for approving travel in accordance with  the Foreign Clearance Guide. We also obtained and analyzed 28,404 travel  vouchers processed by individual servicemembers using the Defense  Travel System, from October 1, 2002, through September 30, 2005. To  assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed knowledgeable  officials, reviewed relevant documentation, and conducted electronic  testing. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our work. However, data limitations prevented us from determining the  full extent of temporary duty travel to areas designated for imminent  danger pay or combat zone tax relief benefits, the total number of trips  taken by individual servicemembers during fiscal years 2003 through 2005,  or how much of this travel crossed calendar months. Furthermore, we  were unable to extrapolate travel patterns from the Defense Travel System  to DOD travel as a whole. Under DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulations, authorizing officials are responsible for determining the  necessity of trips and funds availability for temporary duty travel.  Further, DOD guidance states that DOD airlift authorizing officials shall  ensure that an official purpose is served by air travel.  Therefore, we did  not evaluate whether the purpose of the trips were valid, but we did note  that the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Army, Europe, have developed  policies and controls to preclude, in their view, the appearance of abuse of  imminent danger pay and combat zone tax relief benefits.

For instance,  DOD deferred the 1998 review pending the anticipated revision of its  imminent danger pay guidance to incorporate criteria for determining  whether conditions in designated areas continue to pose the threat of  physical harm or imminent danger from civil war, civil insurrection,  terrorism, or wartime conditions to servicemembers. However, this  revision did not occur. The department initiated the ongoing 2006 review  shortly after we began our review. According to officials from the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), the  department deferred reviews between 2002 and 2006 because it did not  want to create additional work for combatant commanders during ongoing  operations, and department officials also believe that conditions in most  designated areas had not changed sufficiently since the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, and the start of the Global War on Terrorism to result  in termination of designated areas.

However, as previously  discussed, the combatant commanders have not forwarded  recommendations on existing designations to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs  of Staff, on an annual basis in accordance with DOD\u2019s guidance and the  Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) has not requested  them to do so on an annual basis.

The  Comptroller General published these standards in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government, which sets out management control  standards for all aspects of an agency\u2019s operations. These standards are  intended to provide reasonable assurance of meeting agency objectives.  Two of the standards of internal control\u2014risk assessment and control  activities\u2014state that an agency should establish clear objectives as well as  appropriate policies, procedures, and plans with respect to its activities to  ensure effective and efficient use of resources to meet organizational  objectives.", "Neither the statute that authorizes imminent danger pay nor DOD  guidance define what constitutes the threat of physical harm or imminent  danger or contain criteria to determine this. However, in 1997, DOD  developed a questionnaire that contains specific factors that it continues  to use to evaluate requests from combatant commands to designate new  imminent danger pay areas as well as to review existing imminent danger  pay designations. These factors help DOD to gather consistent information  that supports its goal to limit imminent danger pay to those members  placed in direct or imminent danger.  The factors consider     acts of violence against U.S. personnel, such as assassinations,  homicides, sabotage, kidnapping, aggravated battery, property damage,  terrorizing, extortion, rioting, and commandeering vessels or hijacking  aircraft;  insurrection, war, or wartime conditions, including fighting that  occurs sufficiently close to servicemembers that creates a substantial  probability of death or bodily injury to servicemembers, causes  servicemembers to fear for their safety, or creates danger to human life  or property;   terrorism conditions, including the existence of terrorist organizations  that have the intent or ability to harm servicemembers or terrorist  threat levels indicative of an imminent threat;     security environment, that places U.S. forces at risk. DOD also  considers existing security measures including threat condition levels  and operating tempo levels, as well as restrictions on leave and off-duty  travel and measures taken by the host government to protect  servicemembers; travel restrictions, including restriction of servicemembers to duty  stations, installations, or defined sections of the area; and   presence of dependents in the area, including school-age dependents,  whether dependents are targets, and the security measures in place to  protect them.", "We reviewed 54 completed questionnaires for imminent danger pay\u2014some  for the same countries over a period of time\u2014that were submitted by  combatant commands to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Personnel and Readiness) between 1998 and 2005. We found that DOD is  using information supplied on these questionnaires, in conjunction with  threat assessments, to inform decisions to designate new imminent danger  pay areas and to review existing designations to ensure that they continue  to be appropriately designated. For instance, DOD denied requests from  the U.S. Central Command to designate Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan for  imminent danger pay in 2001 because the support provided in the  questionnaires did not demonstrate an imminent threat of physical harm  or danger to servicemembers based on civil war, civil insurrection,  terrorism, or wartime conditions in those areas. DOD also denied a request  from the U.S. European Command in 2003 to designate a number of areas,  including Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Cyprus, for imminent danger  pay based on the probability of increased danger to military personnel due  to their involvement in combat operations related to Iraq as well as general  terrorist threats to DOD personnel. The Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness) determined that there was not  sufficient support of an imminent threat of personal harm to  servicemembers on official duty in these areas. In contrast, DOD has  designated areas, such as Ethiopia, for imminent danger pay based on  facts and circumstances that indicate the likelihood that U.S. personnel  might be harmed as a result of civil unrest. Beginning in 2006, Congress  authorized the Secretary of Defense to retroactively designate an area for  imminent danger pay, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.", "Despite the demonstrated usefulness of these questionnaires to decision  makers, DOD has not incorporated factors contained in the questionnaire  into its imminent danger pay guidance. For example, DOD does not  include minimum terrorist threat levels, one such potential factor  identified in the questionnaire, in its imminent danger pay guidance. While  terrorist threat levels for a country may change over time and are raised  and lowered on the basis of new information and analysis, in the past DOD  officials responsible for overseeing imminent danger pay have considered  establishing minimum terrorist threat levels of \u201chigh\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d to  help assess the imminence of threats and dangers from terrorism.  Although DOD has yet to do so, we believe that establishing a minimum  terrorist threat level threshold needed for an area to be designated for  imminent danger pay could help to limit imminent danger pay to those  servicemembers who truly face an imminent threat or danger to their lives  and would likely reduce the number of imminent danger pay area  designations. Currently, DOD identifies terrorist threat levels using the  Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s four step scale (see fig. 1) that describes the  severity of a threat.", "For example, using Defense Intelligence Agency terrorism threat levels, if  current threat levels for designated areas remain constant and DOD was to  establish a minimum terrorist threat level of \u201csignificant\u201d for areas to be  designated for imminent danger pay, then designations for 19 currently  designated areas with threat levels below \u201csignificant\u201d would be  terminated. These areas include Angola, Burundi, Croatia, and Haiti.   However, 29 areas with \u201chigh\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d terrorist threat levels, such  as Indonesia, the Philippines, Columbia, Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, and  Syria, would continue to qualify for imminent danger pay.  Due to  changing world circumstances since July 2006, the terrorist threat levels  may have changed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have a Departmentwide Policy to Monitor Cross-Month Travel to Areas Designated for Imminent Danger Pay or Combat Zone Tax Relief Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Internal controls over servicemembers\u2019 temporary duty travel to areas  designated for imminent danger pay or combat zone tax relief benefits  need to be strengthened.

In addition, DOD\u2019s  temporary duty travel policy and its Foreign Clearance Guide, which  implements this policy, provide mechanisms for the unified combatant  commands to regulate travel to foreign locations. Before any  servicemember makes an official visit to a foreign country, including areas  where servicemembers qualify for imminent danger pay or combat zone  tax relief benefits, the visit must be reviewed and approved by both the  U.S. embassy in the host country (country clearance) as well as by the  sponsoring unified commander (theater clearance).

According to U.S. Central Command officials, they  instituted this policy to preclude, in their view, the appearance of abuse of  imminent danger pay and combat zone tax relief benefits.

All five sea areas and all but 3 of  the 27 countries in the U.S. Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility are  designated for imminent danger pay, and 16 of these countries as well as  all sea areas are designated for combat zone tax relief benefits (see app. I).", "To enforce its policy, the U.S. Central Command has established an  electronic database with internal controls that automatically alert officials  to any proposed temporary duty travel that crosses calendar months.

If the proposed travel  dates cross calendar months, the Travel Clearance Office requests that the  traveler changes the dates of the trip or provide justification for why the  trip needs to occur at that time. According to a command official,  appropriate justification may include mission requirements or the limited  availability of flights. However, according to an official, most travelers  choose to change the dates of travel to avoid crossing months.", "In 2005, U.S. Army, Europe, which was delegated authority by the U.S.  European Command to approve travel to locations in the former Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, instituted a policy precluding cross-month travel\u2014 although this was minimal\u2014to Bosnia-Herzegovina; Croatia; Serbia and  Montenegro, including Kosovo; Macedonia; and Slovenia in order to  prevent, in their view, the perceived abuse of combat zone tax relief  benefits. These areas, excluding Slovenia, are designated for imminent  danger pay and combat zone tax relief benefits and constitute  approximately 8 percent of the areas currently designated for imminent  danger pay and approximately 14 percent of the areas currently designated  for combat zone tax relief benefits.

For instance, servicemembers  traveling in areas designated for imminent danger pay or combat zone tax  relief benefits qualified for 2 full months of imminent danger pay and  combat zone tax relief benefits for 745 (about 3 percent) of the 28,404  trips. Also, during 831 (about 3 percent) of the 28,404 trips, individual  servicemembers traveled to areas designated for imminent danger pay or  combat zone tax relief benefits at some point during a single month,  although their travel crossed calendar months. As a result, these  servicemembers qualified for 1 month of imminent danger pay or combat  zone tax relief benefits.

While DOD has significantly increased the number  of areas designated for imminent danger pay over the past 14 years, it has  conducted reviews of these areas only six times between 1992 and 2006,  and the current review is ongoing.  In addition, we believe that updating  guidance to reflect the responsibility of the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) for reviewing area designations and  incorporating factors into its guidance to determine what specifically  constitutes imminent danger, would clarify responsibilities and establish  standard criteria for use in meeting the objectives of the imminent danger  pay program.", "Clearly, it is important that servicemembers are appropriately  compensated for the duties they perform, particularly when there are risks  associated with those duties. It is also important that DOD ensure the need  for cross-month travel as both the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Army,  Europe, are doing. Although these two commands have instituted policies  and internal controls to preclude the perceived abuse of imminent danger  pay and combat zone tax relief by regulating and monitoring cross-month  travel, no requirement exists for DOD to monitor cross-month travel to 38  percent of areas currently designated for imminent danger pay and 14  percent of areas currently designated for combat zone tax relief benefits.  Managing these programs effectively is important, as the nation\u2019s growing  fiscal concerns will require DOD and the federal government to consider  difficult trade-offs in the years ahead. In addition, internal controls to  monitor cross-month travel could ensure all designated areas are covered  and further strengthen DOD\u2019s management of imminent danger pay and  combat zone tax relief benefits.", "Finally, combat zone tax relief benefits can be substantial.

DOD stated that the department  believes that comprehensive reviews of imminent danger pay should be  conducted at least biennially. DOD\u2019s current imminent danger pay  guidance requires at least annual reviews of areas designated for imminent  danger pay. We continue to believe that DOD should conduct reviews of  areas designated for imminent danger pay in accordance with its guidance,  which is reflected in our recommendation. If DOD believes that the  appropriate time period for conducting these reviews is biennially, as  reflected in its comments, then DOD should update its imminent danger  pay guidance accordingly.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation to establish  departmentwide policies and internal controls that include periodic audits  to monitor cross-month travel to ensure that the travel needs to cross  calendar months. DOD stated in written comments that doing so would  add unnecessary bureaucracy and cost to its travel system and believes  that our recommended action is already implemented in existing travel  procedures that require thorough review and management of the necessity  and cost-effectiveness of travel by DOD personnel. Further, DOD  commented that our review found no apparent abuse of cross-month  travel and the two commands that collectively account for the majority of  imminent danger pay and combat zone tax relief benefits have developed  theater-specific policies and controls to monitor and regulate cross-month  travel. As stated in our scope and methodology and the report, data  limitations prevented us from determining the full extent of temporary  duty travel to areas designated for imminent danger pay and combat zone  tax relief benefits, as well as how much of this travel crossed calendar  months. Further, we reviewed only temporary duty travel vouchers  processed using DOD\u2019s Defense Travel System. We did not review travel  that was processed in DOD\u2019s numerous legacy travel systems, and  therefore did not reach any conclusions as to whether servicemembers  have scheduled travel in a fiscally responsible manner or have attempted  to maximize this pay and benefit by scheduling cross-month travel. We  recognize DOD has procedures in place to review and authorize travel.  Our recommendation addresses the need to have greater monitoring of  travel trends.  Moreover, although two commands have instituted policies  and internal controls to preclude the perceived abuse of imminent danger  pay and combat zone tax relief by regulating and monitoring cross-month  travel, no requirement exists for DOD to monitor cross-month travel to the  38 percent of areas currently designated for imminent danger pay and the  14 percent of areas currently designated for combat zone tax relief  benefits not covered by these two commands. Also, while we recognize  that these commands currently reflect the majority of areas designated for  imminent danger pay and combat zone tax relief benefits, security  conditions are subject to change over time.

This  nonprobability sample of areas was selected to ensure that each  geographic combatant command was represented. In addition, we sought  to include imminent danger pay areas where designation was limited to  either land, or airspace, or water areas, or the designation was for the  entire area including land, air, or water areas.  For purposes of our  analysis, we considered an area to be designated for imminent danger pay  if DOD had designated any portion of the area (land, airspace, or water)  for imminent danger pay.  We also reviewed other relevant DOD  documents related to DOD\u2019s review of imminent danger pay and combat  zone tax relief benefits from 1992 through 2006.

Under DOD\u2019s  Financial Management Regulations, authorizing officials are responsible  for determining the necessity of trips and funds availability for temporary  duty travel. Further, DOD guidance states that DOD airlift authorizing  officials shall ensure that an official purpose is served by air travel.  Therefore, we did not evaluate whether the purposes of the trips were  valid. We analyzed travel vouchers from the Defense Travel System  because it is the only system that captures temporary duty travel from all  four services.", "We also reviewed data from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service\u2019s  Operational Data System that captures the balance of travel data for the  Army that is not processed using the Defense Travel System. Data from  the Operational Data System frequently were missing information about  trip destinations.

We tested this approach with the U.S. Central  Command. First, we attempted to obtain data from the U.S. Central  Command\u2019s finance office that processes travel vouchers. Due to data  limitations and concerns about the accuracy of data in the automated  business service system, a document processing system used to approve  travel orders, we were unable to use this approach. Second, we sought to  use theater clearance requests and approvals to determine the extent of  cross-month travel to the U.S. Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility.  However, database limitations prevented us from using this approach. For  instance, if more than one servicemember was listed on a travel clearance  request submitted to the U.S. Central Command\u2019s travel clearance office,  only the name of the most senior official was listed in the database and  information on the pay grades of junior servicemembers would not be  available for analysis.  In addition, we could not determine the accuracy of  travel dates contained in the Travel Clearance Office\u2019s database because  itinerary changes are not always captured in the database.", "The scope of this review excluded servicemembers deployed or assigned  to foreign areas. The scope also excluded servicemembers who served as  part of crews on aircraft and, with the exception of data provide by the  U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, ships because aircraft and ship movements are  dictated by operational needs and mission requirements, and generally, do  not have the same degree of flexibility associated with scheduling  temporary duty travel.  To assess the reliability of data obtained from the  Defense Travel System, we (1) reviewed existing documentation related to  the data sources, (2) electronically tested the data to identify problems  with completeness or accuracy, and (3) interviewed knowledgeable  officials about the data.  We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "For purposes of our analysis, we defined cross-month travel as any  temporary duty travel of 30 days or fewer that begins during one month  and concludes during the following month. This cross-month travel may  encompass travel to a single location or multiple locations during a 30-day  period. During this time, a servicemember may travel to areas designated  for imminent danger pay or combat zone tax relief, areas not designated  for these special pays and benefits, or to both areas designated and not  designated for such benefits.", "However, we do not know the portion of overall travel that these trips  represent because some DOD locations were not using the Defense Travel  System to process travel vouchers during the time of our review.  As a  result, we cannot extrapolate travel patterns based on the data we  obtained and analyzed from the Defense Travel System. We also requested  and received information on GAO\u2019s FraudNet hotline as well as the DOD  Inspector General hotline on inquiries related to servicemembers  scheduling cross-month travel to potentially maximize combat zone tax  relief benefits. GAO\u2019s FraudNet did not receive any calls concerning  servicemembers scheduling travel to maximize imminent danger pay or  combat zone tax relief benefits. Two calls received by the DOD Inspector  General\u2019s hotline were not substantiated.
