MCC based its assessments on an evolving set of criteria: early, general guidance to the countries followed by later, more specific guidance. MCC's analyses of the projects' economic impact were limited in that some of the assumptions and data used may not reflect country conditions. As a result, the projects selected on the basis of the analyses may not achieve compact goals. In the two countries we visited, Madagascar and Cape Verde, MCC conducted the analyses with limited country participation, which resulted in countries' having little understanding of the process. MCC and the three countries have made progress in establishing compact country structures for oversight and management, procurement, fiscal accountability, and monitoring and evaluation, although some of these structures are not yet complete. The oversight structures allow for country management with MCC review, but some organizations were not fully staffed for months after the compacts entered into force. Madagascar and Cape Verde have implemented fiscal accountability structures for MCC-funded projects, and established procurement structures with effective characteristics; however, these structures are still largely untested and some are still under development. Finally, MCC and the countries have established monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track and account for program results. However, limitations in the baseline data collected, linkage to economic analyses, methods of addressing uncertainty associated with program results, and the timely design of randomized controlled trials may constrain MCC's ability to monitor and evaluate program results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2004, Congress established the Millennium Challenge  Corporation (MCC) to administer the Millennium Challenge Account  (MCA) for foreign assistance.

MCC uses 16 indicators divided into three  categories: Ruling Justly, Encouraging Economic Freedom, and Investing in  People. To be eligible for MCA assistance, countries must score above the  median relative to their peers on at least half of the indicators in each  category and above the median on the indicator for combating corruption.  MCC used these quantitative indicators, as well as the discretion implicit in  the Millennium Challenge Act, to select 17 countries as eligible to apply for  MCA compact assistance for fiscal years 2004 and 2005.

Eligible countries are invited to submit  compact proposals, which are to be developed in consultation with  members of civil society, including the private sector and  nongovernmental organizations (NGO). The eligible country also  identifies an \u201caccountable entity\u201d to manage the programs funded by  MCC. Eligible countries submitting proposals are not guaranteed  funding; instead, MCC assesses proposals through its due diligence  review. As of May 2006, 14 of the 17 countries selected as eligible in  fiscal year 2004 or 2005, and 1 of the 6 countries selected as eligible for  the first time in fiscal year 2006, had submitted proposals accepted by  MCC for due diligence review. 2. MCC\u2019s due diligence review. MCC determines whether the proposal  that an eligible country has submitted meets MCC criteria to ensure  that proposed programs will be effective and funds will be well-used.  Due diligence primarily occurs between MCC\u2019s acceptances of an  \u201copportunity memo\u201d and an \u201cinvestment memo.\u201d MCC assembles a  transaction team of MCC staff, personnel from other U.S. agencies, and  consultants to conduct a preliminary assessment of a country\u2019s  proposal and reports the team\u2019s findings in an opportunity memo to the  MCC investment committee. The MCC investment committee consists  of MCC\u2019s CEO, vice presidents, and other senior officials. If the  opportunity memo is approved, the transaction team launches a  detailed due diligence review. The team assesses the country proposal,  reports its findings, and makes recommendations based on its  assessment in an investment memo to the MCC investment committee.  As of May 2006, MCC was conducting due diligence analyses of seven  eligible country proposals. 3. Compact negotiation and MCC Board approval. MCC may enter into  compact negotiations with the eligible country before the investment  memo is completed. If compact negotiations are successful, MCC staff  formally submit the compact for MCC Board approval. Once the board  approves the compact, MCC and the eligible country may sign it. As of  March 2006, MCC had signed compacts with 8 of the 17 countries  determined eligible in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. (See fig. 2.)

MCC\u2019s assessment also indicated  that the government had not directly asked the consulted groups to  identify obstacles to growth. However, MCC found that these groups  concurred with the priorities identified in the country proposal.

MCC\u2019s guidance also took into account the country\u2019s  experience in using a consultative process to develop other national or  poverty reduction strategies. If the compact was built on these  consultations, MCC required some additional consultations to provide  justification of country priorities in the MCA proposal.", "Incomplete documentation.

Similarly, information for MCC\u2019s  travel expenses is prepared at MCC headquarters office and daily  communicated to NBC through manual processes. MCC is aware of the  need to address these issues and is working with NBC to mitigate or  eliminate the manual processes.", "Monitoring.

Also, MCC conducted its  first comprehensive survey of internal controls, performed by outside  consultants, in conjunction with its annual audit. In addition, MCC has  formed formal review panels to monitor the progress of addressing  findings from internal and external reviews. For example, consistent  with OMB guidance, MCC formed an FMFIA Management Review Panel  to assess the results of the internal control survey along with the  findings of MCC\u2019s independent financial auditors. Similarly, MCC  implemented a specific procedure to address recommendations from  reviews and audits performed by its Inspector General (IG).", "Reporting. MCC has made progress in establishing a process for  assessing and reporting on the operating effectiveness of its internal  controls. MCC established a formal board-level audit committee whose  responsibilities include (1) financial controls; (2) the integrity of the  reporting process; and (3) performance of the independent audit  process. In addition, MCC\u2019s FMFIA Management Review Panel assessed  the results of the internal control survey, along with the findings of  MCC\u2019s independent financial auditors.

However, despite having plans to increase its staff  by an additional 38 percent between May and September 2006, MCC does  not systematically assess its staffing needs, has not developed a human  capital plan, and has not yet fully implemented its improved performance  management system, as follows:  Staffing. Although MCC has completed an assessment of its human  capital needs since our April 2005 recommendation, it does not  systematically track the use of staff time on an ongoing basis. MCC\u2019s  updated assessment of its human capital needs shows that it plans to  increase its staffing from 218 staff, as of May 2006, to approximately 300  staff, as of September 2006. MCC also has created an organization chart  that includes the specific approved positions for each department under  the new 300-person staffing model, and it is hiring for many of these  positions using limited-term appointments to provide greater flexibility  in filling future needs. According to MCC officials, MCC made its case  to OMB for increasing staffing to 300 persons on the basis of an analysis  of MCC staffs\u2019 recollection of the amount of time they spent developing  the Georgia compact, which was thought to have been the most  complex compact development process to date. However, MCC officials  felt that this analysis may not have fully captured the amount of time  spent by some departments in developing the compact. Retrospective  analysis was necessary because MCC does not track employees\u2019 time on  mission-related projects on an ongoing basis. Without such data, MCC  management is not able to systematically assess the staffing  requirements needed to carry out MCC\u2019s mission and consistently align  its human capital with its changing needs.", "Recruitment and retention. MCC has identified priorities and  committed resources for recruitment and is developing a human capital  plan to address retention and training. To support its effort to hire  approximately 82 additional staff between May and September 2006,  MCC has retained an outside consultant firm to work on-site and help  with recruitment and has identified positions as first- or second-tier  hiring priorities. MCC officials also told us that they are developing an  overall human capital plan that will include planned activities and a time  frame for identifying critical skills and competencies for MCC\u2019s key  positions. The officials stated that the human capital plan also will  include a strategy for staff retention and will address staff training.  Currently, MCC has developed procedures for providing employees with  outside training.

In keeping with our recommendation, MCC  has established a performance-based compensation framework. MCC  provided us with documentation of its employee ratings process,  showing that employee expectations and performance reviews were  keyed to organizational goals. However, according to MCC officials,  MCC did not incorporate the departmental performance plans for the  year into the performance framework for 2006 until March 2006, as the  annual performance plan neared completion. MCC is shifting from a  calendar year to a fiscal year performance evaluation schedule to better  align employee compensation with its annual corporate goals.

We focused our review for objectives 1 and 2 primarily on the first three  countries with signed compacts\u2014Madagascar, Cape Verde, and Honduras.  These countries\u2019 compacts were the first to enter into force. To further our  analysis for objectives 1 and 2, we also visited Cape Verde and Madagascar  in January and February 2006. We selected Cape Verde and Madagascar for  our site visits because they had advanced further than Honduras in filling  key positions and beginning compact implementation. While in Cape Verde  and Madagascar, we interviewed a number of MCC, Millennium Challenge  Account (MCA), and government officials and visited project sites.", "To identify MCC\u2019s evaluation criteria and process for evaluating eligible  country proposals in due diligence, we reviewed MCC guidance and the  record of MCC analysis contained in (1) MCC\u2019s \u201cdue diligence books,\u201d  which are its internal records of how it assessed proposals submitted by  Madagascar, Cape Verde, and Honduras, and (2) investment memos, which  are MCC\u2019s analyses based on due diligence and internal recommendations  to its investment committee. These documents are restricted from public  dissemination due to their sensitive nature, but MCC made them available  to us for analysis. We have coordinated with MCC on describing the  information from these books in general terms without disclosing sensitive  information. We used MCC\u2019s definition of the due diligence process as  beginning with MCC\u2019s opportunity memo and ending with the acceptance  of the investment memo by MCC\u2019s investment committee. Our review,  therefore, may not capture some changes and decisions made by MCC or  eligible countries during proposal development and compact negotiations.  To evaluate MCC\u2019s assessments of proposals\u2019 consultative process, project  coherence, environmental and social impact, and institutional and financial  sustainability, we relied primarily on MCC\u2019s data and analysis contained in  the due diligence books and, to some extent, in the investment memos. We  compared MCC\u2019s analysis in these documents with criteria outlined in  MCC\u2019s guidance. We were able to perform only limited independent  verification of the use and adequacy of these criteria during our site visits.  With regard to its economic analyses, MCC also made available to us the  spreadsheet models it used to develop the economic rate of return  calculations that formed the basis for its evaluations of the suitability of  country-proposed projects for MCC funding. We independently analyzed  these spreadsheets and validated their logic and conclusions on the basis of  a review of economic literature and practices. In addition, in Madagascar,  we conducted a series of focus groups with country officials to assess the  data and logic used by MCC in developing their economic analysis.", "To assess MCC\u2019s compact implementation structures, we reviewed the  compacts with Madagascar, Cape Verde, and Honduras and the  supplemental agreements required for those compacts to enter into force.  We supplemented this review with our site visits to Madagascar and Cape  Verde.

We addressed the following four areas of MCC\u2019s  implementation structures:  To determine the form of governance structures and key positions in  these three countries, we reviewed the requirements of MCC compacts  and supplemental agreements. We determined the progress of the  country organizations in Madagascar, Cape Verde, and Honduras in  filling these positions and establishing these structures by analyzing  MCC\u2019s reported staffing and status information.

In  the context of MCC as an evolving organization, we felt it was  important to discuss the evolving nature of guidance to provide a  balanced perspective regarding the process that eligible countries had  to follow to sign compacts. 2. MCC stated that our concern regarding baseline data quality stems  from one survey in Madagascar. However, we found issues with data  reliability in Madagascar with both the Agricultural Productivity Survey  and Household Survey. In the second survey, the error was smaller;  therefore, we focused on the Agricultural Productivity Survey to  illustrate the more significant example.", "The measurement of land values is very important for Madagascar's  monitoring and evaluation plan. Both the compact-level goal of  increasing household income and the program objective of increasing  investment in rural Madagascar are measured in terms of land values.  In each of the zones, the expected increase in household income is  estimated at 5 percent of the average land value, and the expected  increase in investment is estimated at 27 percent of the average land  value. With a large error in baseline data, it will be difficult to  accurately track progress toward the compact-level goal and program  objective. 3. MCC noted that not every benefit can be isolated and measured during  implementation, and that disaggregating may not be feasible. We  recognize that not all outcomes of the economic analysis can be  directly tracked with indicators at different levels of monitoring or for  impact evaluation. There are trade-offs between cost and level of detail.

We agree that  countries could have requested informal guidance from MCC.  According to MCC, they did provide verbal guidance to countries  regarding the need to link projects to compact goals.", "However, MCC rejected tourism and preschool education projects  proposed by Honduras because they were not linked to the  impediments to growth that emerged from the consultative process.  MCC also rejected projects in Cape Verde because MCC\u2019s due diligence  did not indicate that these projects addressed key constraints in Cape  Verde. Given that these two countries submitted projects that did not  meet project coherence criteria, MCC\u2019s verbal guidance may not have  been sufficient to direct countries to submit proposals meeting these  criteria.", "We recognize that MCC was simultaneously addressing a number of  issues during its initial years of operation\u2014selecting eligible countries,  setting up MCC as an organization, and developing guidance and  policies while also working with countries to finalize compacts.

State noted that we did not detail the methodology and composition of  our Madagascar focus groups. We summarized the composition of the  focus groups in the letter of this report. We met with these 29  individuals, including representatives of MCA-Madagascar and  Madagascar ministries, during the course of our week in Madagascar  and reviewed with them the assumptions used in MCC\u2019s economic  model for its projects. As previously discussed in this report, we found  that these officials were not closely involved in MCC\u2019s economic  analysis. According to MCC and Madagascar officials, an MCC  economist met with four Madagascar representatives in Paris, France,  during compact negotiations and reviewed the model with them at that  time. (MCC officials did travel to Madagascar during due diligence to  assess proposed projects.) When we discussed this with MCC officials,  they stated that not traveling to Madagascar to develop the model was a  mistake, and one that has not been repeated. 3. State commented that we do not rebut MCC\u2019s point that countries\u2019  degree of involvement depended on their capability and willingness to  participate. (See comment 2.)", "In its letter, which is reprinted in appendix V, MCC agreed that in some  cases, the level of country engagement on economic analysis could be  improved. MCC also now requires that countries engage an economist  on the core country team, provides examples of the economic rate of  return analysis, and has MCC economists make early technical  guidance trips to work with the core country team and the core country  team economist. These procedures were not in place when MCC  conducted the economic analysis for Madagascar, Cape Verde, or  Honduras.", "By not thoroughly involving the countries in this analysis, MCC risks  not meeting its stated principle of focusing on results. In MCC\u2019s results- based framework, the economic model is the basis for determining  performance targets against which funding is conditioned. MCA- Madagascar may find that the targets are unrealistic if the targets have  not been thoroughly discussed with, and understood by, Madagascar  officials. 4. State noted that the time for the in-country MCA organizations to hire  staff compares favorably with general government hiring. Management  unit officials are hired by a compact country\u2019s MCA program steering  committee, not the U.S. government. As such, it is not \u201cgeneral  government hiring\u201d and should not be compared with it.  5. State correctly observed that we did not offer MCC a recommended  alternative to its taking the time to find good candidates for positions.  We did not make a recommendation for addressing this issue because  MCC has adopted a policy implementing the authority given it by  section 609(g) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 to make grants  to facilitate compact development and implementation. MCC\u2019s current  policy includes a provision where, if certain conditions are met, it may  fund an eligible country\u2019s request for \u201cmanagement support payments\u201d  for salaries, rent, and equipment for the country\u2019s team prior to  compact signature. We have added a discussion of this policy in the  letter of this report to clarify this point.", "6.", "In referring to our discussion about the different maturity of internal  control between Madagascar and Cape Verde, State pointed out that  differences in the maturity of internal control between the countries  are to be expected, given that some countries have historically more  well-developed systems. We agree that different countries will differ in  their maturity of internal control due to historical differences in the  underlying systems and accountability infrastructures. The current  maturity of internal control in each country, however, is a key  consideration in assessing risk and establishing effective oversight  mechanisms to deal with the unique risks in the key financial processes  and activities of each country. 7. State referred to \u201cGAO\u2019s reliance on project evaluation criteria that  make use of randomized controlled trials to measure success.\u201d This  comment misconstrues our findings on the use of randomized  controlled trials.
