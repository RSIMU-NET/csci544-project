The agency did not fully implement access controls, which are designed to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities. Specifically, the agency did not always (1) enforce strong policies for identifying and authenticating users by, for example, requiring the use of complex (i.e., not easily guessed) passwords; (2) limit users\u0092 access to systems to what was required for them to perform their official duties; (3) ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords for system administration, was encrypted so as not to be easily readable by unauthorized individuals; (4) keep logs of network activity or monitor key parts of its networks for possible security incidents; and (5) control physical access to its systems and information, such as controlling visitor access to computing equipment. In addition to weaknesses in access controls, EPA had mixed results in implementing other security controls. For example, EPA conducted appropriate background investigations for employees and contractors to ensure sufficient clearance requirements had been met before permitting access to information and information systems. However,", "EPA had not always securely configured network devices and updated operating system and database software with patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.", "EPA had not always ensured equipment used for sanitization and disposal of media was tested to verify correct performance.", "An underlying reason for the control weaknesses is that EPA has not fully implemented a comprehensive information security program. Although EPA has established a framework for its security program, the agency has not yet fully implemented all elements of its program. Specifically, it did not always finalize policies and procedures to guide staff in effectively implementing controls; ensure that all personnel were given relevant security training to understand their roles and responsibilities; update system security plans to reflect current agency security control requirements; assess management, operational, and technical controls for agency systems at least annually and based on risk; and implement a corrective action process to track and manage all weaknesses when remedial actions were necessary.

Agencies accomplish this objective by designing and implementing  controls that are intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized  access to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities.  Inadequate access controls diminish the reliability of computerized  information and increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification,  and destruction of sensitive information and disruption of service. Access  controls include those related to (1) protection of system boundaries, (2)  user identification and authentication, (3) authorization, (4) cryptography,  (5) audit and monitoring, and (6) physical security.", "Boundary protection controls logical connectivity into and out of networks  and controls connectivity to and from devices connected to the network.  For example, multiple firewalls can be deployed to prevent both outsiders  and trusted insiders from gaining unauthorized access to systems, and  intrusion detection technologies can be deployed to defend against  attacks from the Internet. Unnecessary connectivity to an organization\u2019s  network increases not only the number of access paths that must be  managed and the complexity of the task, but also the risk of unauthorized  access in a shared environment. National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) guidance states that agencies should provide  adequate protection for networks and employ information control policies  and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between  designated sources and destinations within information systems.", "EPA has established network boundaries, but did not always adequately  enforce those boundaries to secure connectivity into and out of its  networks. For example, at one location, network boundaries did not have  adequate segregation between a public library and the EPA facilities in  Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. In addition, EPA had allowed  unrestricted inbound use of an encrypted protocol that could be used to  access EPA internal networks. As a result, EPA\u2019s networks were  vulnerable to unnecessary and potentially undetectable access at these  points.", "A computer system must be able to identify and authenticate different  users so that activities on the system can be linked to a specific  individual. When an organization assigns a unique user account to a  specific user, the system is able to distinguish that user from another\u2014a  process called identification. The system must also establish the validity  of a user\u2019s claimed identity by requesting some kind of information, such  as a password, that is known only by the user\u2014a process known as  authentication. The combination of identification and authentication\u2014such  as a user account/password combination\u2014provides the basis for  establishing individual accountability and for controlling access to the  system. NIST 800-53 recommends that information systems uniquely  identify and authenticate all users (or processes on behalf of users) and  that systems establish complex passwords to reduce the likelihood of a  successful attack. NIST also recommends using multifactor authentication  to access user accounts via a network.", "While EPA has developed an interim security policy that addresses  identification and authentication and a draft procedure that is based on  NIST guidance, the agency did not always adequately implement these  interim requirements. For example, EPA did not authenticate routing  protocols on several of its internal network devices, leaving them  vulnerable. In addition, EPA did not enforce its own password complexity  requirements or change passwords for multiple servers. Further, EPA did  not require two-factor authentication for remote authentication and access  to e-mail accounts. As a result, EPA\u2019s networks and systems are at  increased risk that an unauthorized individual could guess a legitimate  user\u2019s identification and password combination and gain access to these  devices.", "Authorization is the process of granting or denying access rights and  permissions to a protected resource, such as a network, a system, an  application, a function, or a file. For example, operating systems have  some built-in authorization features such as permissions for files and  folders. Network devices, such as routers, have access control lists that  can be used to authorize a user who can access and perform certain  actions on the device. A key component of granting or denying access  rights is the concept of \u201cleast privilege.\u201d Least privilege is a basic principle  for securing computer resources and information. This principle means  that a user is granted only those access rights and permissions needed to  perform official duties. To restrict legitimate user access to only those  programs and files needed to perform work, agencies establish access  rights and permissions. \u201cUser rights\u201d are allowable actions that can be  assigned to a user or to a group of users. File and directory permissions  are rules that regulate which users can access a particular file or directory  and the extent of that access. To avoid unintentionally authorizing user  access to sensitive files and directories, an agency must give careful  consideration to its assignment of rights and permissions.", "NIST requires federal agencies to grant a user only the access and rights  to information and information systems needed to perform official duties.  National Security Agency (NSA) network security best practice guidance  recommends prohibiting root from logging directly into a remote system.  The guidance also recommends creating a set of filtering rules, also  known as an access control list, which permits the traffic identified on the  list and prohibits other traffic.", "Although EPA has established an access control methodology based on  least privilege and need-to-know principles, it did not always limit user  access rights and permissions to only those necessary to perform official  duties. For example, EPA allowed for a large number of unused accounts  across several network domains. At one location, EPA did not have  adequate restrictions on a sensitive server to control access in managing  and administering network devices either locally or remotely, leaving them  vulnerable. In addition, EPA had not removed the accounts of former  employees. The result of these weaknesses is an increased risk of  unauthorized access to EPA systems and information.", "Cryptography underlies many of the mechanisms used to enforce the  confidentiality and integrity of critical and sensitive information.  Cryptographic tools help control access to information by making it  unintelligible to unauthorized users and by protecting the integrity of  transmitted or stored information. A basic element of cryptography is  encryption. Encryption is the conversion of data into a form, called a  cipher text, which cannot be easily understood. Encryption can be used to  provide basic data confidentiality and integrity by transforming plain text  into cipher text using a special value known as a key and a mathematical  process known as an algorithm. NIST guidelines state that agencies  should use encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access  sessions and encrypt sessions between host systems. The NIST  standard for an encryption algorithm is Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS) 140-2.", "EPA did not always effectively encrypt certain sensitive information. For  example, EPA did not always encrypt private keys stored on certain  servers and had used a weak password encryption feature on network  devices. In addition, the agency allowed the use of insecure network  protocols to manage network devices. The agency also did not always  use a FIPS-compliant algorithm to encrypt passwords on three support  servers we reviewed. These weaknesses expose critical and sensitive  information to unnecessary risk of unauthorized access, modification, or  destruction.", "To establish individual accountability, monitor compliance with security  policies, and investigate security violations, it is crucial to determine what,  when, and by whom specific actions have been taken on a system.  Agencies accomplish this by implementing system or security software  that provides an audit trail, or a log of system activity, that can be used to  determine the source of a transaction or attempted transaction and to  monitor a user\u2019s activities. Audit and monitoring involves the regular  collection, review, and analysis of auditable events for indications of  inappropriate or unusual activity, and the appropriate investigation and  reporting of such activity. Automated mechanisms may be used to  integrate audit monitoring, analysis, and reporting into an overall process  for investigation and response to suspicious activities. Audit and  monitoring controls can help security professionals routinely assess  computer security, perform investigations during and after an attack, and  even recognize an ongoing attack. Audit and monitoring technologies  include network and host-based intrusion detection systems, audit  logging, security event correlation tools, and computer forensics.", "NIST guidance states that agencies should retain sufficient audit logs to  allow monitoring of key activities, provide support for after-the-fact  investigation of security incidents, and meet organizational information  retention requirements.", "Although EPA has many useful mechanisms at its disposal to help  prevent and respond to security breaches, such as firewalls and intrusion  detection systems, it has not consistently implemented integrated and  responsive audit and monitoring. For example, EPA had not enabled  auditing on a server used for receiving confidential data from commercial  entities. Furthermore, more than 150 of EPA\u2019s network devices had  remote logging set to a severity level that was not sufficient for logging  important security information. In addition, the number of error logs on  one server database system was set so low that old logs would be  overwritten as soon as this number was reached, thus removing the old  logs from use. As a result, EPA is limited in its ability to establish  accountability, ensure compliance with security policies, and investigate  violations.", "Physical security controls are a key component of limiting unauthorized  access to sensitive information and information systems. These controls  are important for protecting computer facilities and resources from  espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. They involve restricting physical  access to computer resources and sensitive information, usually by  limiting access to the buildings and rooms in which the resources are  housed and periodically reviewing access rights granted to ensure that  access continues to be appropriate based on established criteria. Such  controls include perimeter fencing; surveillance cameras; security guards;  gates; locks; environmental controls such as smoke detectors, fire alarms  and extinguishers; and uninterruptible power supplies. NIST guidance  states that federal agencies should implement physical security and  environmental safety controls to protect employees and contractors,  information systems, and the facilities in which they are located.", "EPA had implemented numerous physical security controls for protecting  its information, information systems, and employees. For example, the  agency used electronic badges, guards, magnetometers, and x-ray  machines to help control access to computing environments at two  locations. EPA had also implemented environmental and safety controls  such as temperature and humidity controls as well as emergency lighting  to protect its staff and sensitive IT resources.", "Nonetheless, EPA did not always ensure that these controls were  consistently implemented. For example, over a period of 5 days, five staff  members at one location used their electronic badges to gain access to  the computer room, but they were not on the list of staff authorized to  enter the area. Two of these staff members were contractors, and the  other three were EPA staff. Similarly, EPA did not always effectively  control access to sensitive IT equipment kept in server or  telecommunication rooms. To illustrate, visitor logs were incomplete for  several rooms that contained sensitive IT equipment. These logs did not  always include information such as the visitor\u2019s purpose for visiting the  room, the time of departure, or the type of identification used to sign in.  As a result, EPA has diminished assurance that its computing resources  are protected from inadvertent or deliberate misuse including sabotage,  vandalism, theft, and destruction. EPA officials stated that the access  controls list issue had been resolved and that IT equipment in the rooms  would be moved as part of its data center consolidation effort. The  agency also provided a subsequent response stating that most of the IT  equipment had been moved. We have not yet verified this information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Did Not Effectively Implement Other Controls", "paragraphs": ["In addition to access controls, other important controls should be in place  to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an agency\u2019s  information.

Weaknesses in these areas  increase the risk of unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, or loss of  sensitive information and information systems supporting EPA\u2019s mission.  EPA had personnel security controls in place.", "Configuration management controls ensure that only authorized and fully  tested software is placed in operation, software and hardware are  updated, patches are applied to these systems to protect against known  vulnerabilities, and changes are documented and approved. To protect  against known vulnerabilities, effective procedures must be in place,  appropriate software installed, and patches updated promptly. Up-to-date  patch installation helps mitigate flaws in software code that could be  exploited to cause significant damage and enable malicious individuals to  read, modify, or delete sensitive information or disrupt operations. NIST  guidance states that agencies should document approved system  changes and retain records of configuration changes to systems and that  agencies should configure security settings to the most restrictive mode  consistent with operational requirements. Both NIST and NSA guidance  recommend that certain system services be disabled.", "EPA has developed, documented, and established procedures to manage  configuration changes. For example, although the agencywide  configuration management procedure is still a draft document, EPA\u2019s  Office of Technology Operations and Planning has developed,  documented, and implemented a change management process and  procedures document that is intended to provide formal and standardized  processes and procedures for identifying, assessing, approving,  implementing, and accounting for changes to EPA information systems.  In addition, the agency uses a central tool to request, approve, and track  the status of configuration change requests. The system owners or  managers have responsibility for documenting these changes. According  to agency officials, EPA uses an automated tool for applying patches that  are intended to correct software security vulnerabilities.", "Despite these efforts, EPA had not always implemented configuration  management controls. For example, although the agency has an  automated tool in place for managing changes, officials could only  provide records of approved changes for four of the six systems we  reviewed. Information for the other two systems consisted only of e-mails  describing the changes. Furthermore, information for only two of the six  systems included the unique change request number generated by the  tool; this number could be used to research and determine whether a  change had been formally approved. During a demonstration of the tool,  an EPA official suggested that we contact system owners for system- specific change reports. However, change information provided by the  system owners varied in content, and the agencywide configuration  management guide did not instruct them on how such records should be  documented.", "Similarly, EPA had not securely configured its networks and databases in  accordance with NIST guidance and web applications and operating  systems were not always configured to the most restrictive settings in  accordance with NIST guidance. Moreover, some EPA information  systems and network devices were running outdated software that was  no longer supported by the manufacturer, resulting in EPA being unable  to effectively patch them for vulnerabilities. In addition, newly released  security patches, service packs, and hot fixes had not been installed in a  timely manner, and several critical systems had not been patched or were  out of date, and some had known vulnerabilities. Without adequate  security controls, EPA systems are susceptible to many known  vulnerabilities.", "The destruction of media and their disposal are key to ensuring the  confidentiality of information. Media can include magnetic tapes, optical  disks (such as compact disks), and hard drives. Agencies safeguard used  media to ensure that the information they contain is appropriately  controlled or disposed of. Media that are improperly disposed of can lead  to the inappropriate or inadvertent disclosure of an agency\u2019s sensitive  information, including the personally identifiable information of its  employees and customers. NIST guidance states that verifying the  selected information sanitization and disposal process and testing of  media is an essential step for maintaining confidentiality. EPA has  documented a media protection policy through its interim network security  policy that states that all IT resources scheduled for disposal must be  adequately sanitized to protect the confidentiality of agency information  and that appropriate security controls such as those prescribed by NIST  must be applied. EPA has a supplemental disk sanitization procedure,  and program offices have the option to develop their own separate  procedures if needed.", "However, EPA did not provide evidence that equipment used for disposal  of sensitive information had been tested to ensure that it was working  properly. Specifically, EPA could not provide documentation or support to  verify whether or not media disposal equipment had been tested for three  systems. Additionally, both sanitized and unsanitized hard drives were  being kept together in the storage area for one system. None of the drives  were labeled to show whether or not they had been sanitized, which could  allow intended or unintended access to sensitive data on an unsanitized  hard drive. Until EPA tests, documents, and implements information  security controls for media disposal and sanitization, increased risk exist  that the agency\u2019s sensitive information may not be adequately protected.", "The greatest harm or disruption to a system comes from the actions, both  intentional and unintentional, of individuals. These intentional and  unintentional actions can be reduced through the implementation of  personnel security controls. According to NIST guidance, personnel  security controls help agencies ensure that individuals occupying  positions of responsibility (including third-party service providers) are  trustworthy and meet established security criteria for these positions.  According to NIST, personnel security controls include, among other  things, that the agency develop a formal personnel security policy and  screen individuals prior to authorizing access to an information system.  EPA\u2019s security policy for personnel screening states that the type of  investigation should be based on the sensitivity of the position and the  level of public trust.

In addition, two of the six plans did not reflect controls  identified in the current NIST Special Publication 800-53. two controls for moderate systems, publically accessible content and  least privilege\u2014allowing only authorized access for users\u2014were not  reflected in system security plans. An EPA official with responsibility for  one of the system\u2019s that had an outdated plan attributed this to the  agency not having a security procedure in place to clearly explain how  updated federal guidance should be implemented. In a fiscal year 2010  report,agency\u2019s system security plans were not current.", "EPA\u2019s Inspector General also indentified instances where the  EPA officials informed us that the agency was replacing its current  automated tool for managing security with one that is intended to improve  system security planning, among other activities. Currently in the pilot  stage, the new tool is to provide a built-in system security planning  capability and a central location to store all system security  documentation. However, until EPA updates system security plans and  finalizes security plan procedures, the agency may not have assurance  that controls are being effectively implemented for its systems.", "NIST, Special Publication 800-53. complying with agency policies and procedures designed to reduce these  risks. FISMA also includes requirements for training personnel with  significant responsibilities for information security. OMB guidance states  that personnel should be trained before they are granted access to  systems or applications. The training is intended to ensure that personnel  are aware of the system\u2019s or application\u2019s rules, their responsibilities, and  their expected behavior. In addition, EPA interim policy requires annual  security awareness training to be completed by all personnel and those  personnel with significant network security roles and responsibilities to  complete sufficient information system security training and continuing  education to ensure compliance with agency policy.", "EPA has implemented a security awareness training program and  maintains training records as part of its e-learning system: users of EPA  systems are required to complete and pass a web-based course.  According to EPA\u2019s fiscal year 2011 FISMA report, the Chief Information  Officer reported that 100 percent of EPA\u2019s employees had completed the  required security awareness training.", "EPA also uses its e-learning system to deliver training content for  employees who have significant network and system security roles.  However, for this group of employees, the Chief Information Officer  reported that approximately 81 percent had completed training related to  their specialized security responsibilities. According to EPA officials, the  agency has been unable to enforce the specialized security training  requirement, which has led to reporting a lower percentage. In addition,  officials also noted that formalized standard procedures related to  specialized training are not well documented, including to what extent  employees should complete specialized training and the specific actions  to take if an employee does not complete the training.", "To assist with addressing these inconsistencies, the senior agency  Information Security Officer distributed a memorandum to information  security officials that describes the requirement for employees with  significant information security responsibilities. Specifically, EPA has  determined that, at a minimum, all employees with significant security  responsibilities should complete two courses using the e-learning system  or through another mechanism. In addition, EPA sent e-mails to its  information security officers that denote what positions include the  requirement to complete the two-courses. However, EPA\u2019s actions did not  ensure that all employees with significant security responsibilities met this  requirement. Until EPA implements a procedure to enforce the completion  of specialized security training and tailors the training to specific roles, the  agency will not have reasonable assurance that its staff have the  adequate knowledge, skills, and abilities consistent with their roles to  protect the confidentiality of the information housed within EPA systems  to which they are assigned.", "Another key element of an information security program is to test and  evaluate policies, procedures, and controls to determine whether they are  effective and operating as intended. This type of oversight is a  fundamental element because it demonstrates management\u2019s  commitment to the security program, reminds employees of their roles  and responsibilities, and identifies and mitigates areas of noncompliance  and ineffectiveness. FISMA requires that the frequency of tests and  evaluations of management, operational, and technical controls be based  on risks and occur no less than annually. OMB directs agencies to meet  their FISMA-required controls testing by drawing on security control  assessment results that include, but are not limited to, continuous  monitoring activities. EPA\u2019s interim security assessment procedure  requires that information system security controls be assessed annually  to meet FISMA\u2019s requirements and to support continuous monitoring.", "EPA had documented that management, operational, and technical  controls for five of six systems were tested or reviewed. Assessment  results for five systems consisted of self assessments generated by  EPA\u2019s Automated System Security Evaluation and Remediation Tracking  (ASSERT) tool, used for continuous monitoring, along with vulnerability  assessments for two of the five systems. However, the agency did not  provide any information demonstrating that controls for a clean air  markets division system had been tested or reviewed at least annually.  The last assessment for the system had been completed during fiscal  year 2009. An EPA official stated that testing would be completed during  fiscal year 2012.", "We also identified data reliability challenges with EPA\u2019s ASSERT tool.  The data reliability weakness with this tool was previously reported by  EPA\u2019s Inspector General in 2010.in 2011 that the agency had not implemented continuous monitoring   The Inspector General also reported  procedures or a strategy. As a result, EPA has less assurance that  controls over its information and information systems are adequately  implemented and operating as intended.", "Remedial action plans, also known as plans of action and milestones  (POA&M), help agencies identify and assess security weaknesses in  information systems, set priorities, and monitor progress in correcting the  weaknesses. NIST and OMB guidance specify steps that federal  agencies should take to address identified security weaknesses.", "NIST standards state that organizations must periodically assess  security controls in their information systems and develop and  implement plans of action to correct deficiencies and reduce or  eliminate vulnerabilities.", "OMB guidance specifies information that should be recorded for each  POA&M, including a description of the weakness identified, the audit  or other source where it was identified, and key milestones with  completion dates.", "NIST guidance also states that POA&Ms should be updated to show  progress made on current outstanding items and to incorporate the  results of the continuous monitoring process.", "OMB guidance further states that initial milestone and completion  dates should not be altered; rather, changes to dates should be  recorded in a separate column.", "Further, EPA procedure states that any IT security finding and  recommendation that results from a review, audit, assessment, test, or  from another source must be assigned a risk level and assessed for  appropriate action.", "EPA uses an automated tool to record and track remediation of  vulnerabilities. This tool contains fields for entering a description of each  weakness, where it was reported, the risk level, milestones describing  appropriate actions and their completion dates, and the status of actions  taken. However, the manner in which the agency uses the tool can  preclude retrieval of specific POA&Ms and pose weaknesses with data  reliability. For example, EPA officials were unable to locate certain  POA&Ms pertaining to findings and recommendations in fiscal year 2011  reports from EPA, the agency\u2019s Inspector General, and GAO. These  officials could not find the requested information because POA&M entries  did not have all the information called for by federal guidance. In  particular, these entries lacked a specific description of each weakness  and did not list the report where the weakness had initially been identified.  Additionally, the tool does not have built-in safeguards to keep individuals  who have access to POA&Ms from altering initial milestone and  completion dates. Since the Chief Information Officer and other agency  officials use POA&M information to track the progress of corrective  actions, inaccurate milestone information could hinder their efforts to  effectively remediate program and system-level IT security weaknesses.", "The EPA Inspector General had also documented weaknesses in the  agency\u2019s remediation process. In its fiscal year 2011 FISMA report, the  Inspector General found that EPA does not consistently create POA&Ms  for vulnerabilities and the agency missed remediation deadlines for about  20 percent of the POA&Ms that have been created. Another fiscal year  2011 Inspector General report found that data in the agency\u2019s POA&M  tracking tool is unreliable, and that EPA lacked the skills and resources  needed to identify and remediate ongoing cyber threats.", "EPA officials noted that deficiencies in the way that the current tool is  used are expected to be addressed when the new remediation tool is  deployed agencywide in fiscal year 2013. Until weaknesses with EPA\u2019s  remediation of vulnerabilities have been resolved, they will compromise  the ability of the Chief Information Officer and other EPA officials to track,  assess, and report accurately the status of the agency\u2019s information  security.", "Contingency planning is a critical component of information protection. If  normal operations are interrupted, network managers must be able to  detect, mitigate, and recover from a service disruption while preserving  access to vital information. Contingency plans detail emergency  response, backup operations, and disaster recovery for information  systems. To mitigate service disruptions, these plans should be clearly  documented, communicated to potentially affected staff, updated to  reflect current operations, and regularly tested.

Contingency plans were in place  for five of the six systems we reviewed. The contingency needs for the  one remaining system were addressed in disaster recovery plans.  However, the agency did not follow its own procedures or NIST guidance  for approving contingency plans, reviewing them annually, and updating  them as necessary. All six of the plans lacked evidence that they had  been signed by the approving officials. According to EPA, an approving  official does not need to sign a contingency plan because the plan is  included in each system\u2019s certification and authorization package and  approval of the package applies to all documents within it. The agency  provided documentation indicating that system security plans were part of  certification and authorization packages, and two systems had  contingency plans embedded in their respective system security plans.  However, EPA did not provide clear evidence that contingency plans  were included in certification and authorization packages for the other  four systems. In addition, two of the six plans had no evidence of having  had an annual review. Without clear dates for initial approvals and  subsequent reviews, EPA employees and contractors cannot be certain  that they have access to current, updated versions of contingency plans.", "In addition to providing current information, plans are to provide adequate  contact information on personnel who may be needed during an  emergency. For example, the National Computer Center Hosting Systems  contingency plan states that personal contact information should include  home addresses, cell phone numbers, pager numbers, and alternate  contact information. Among the six plans reviewed, five did not provide  full contact information for some staff listed, giving only office telephone  numbers and e-mail addresses or, in some cases, office numbers alone.  Having inadequate information could jeopardize the agency\u2019s ability to  contact key personnel during an emergency.", "To help ensure that contingency plans are viable and will meet an  agency\u2019s needs during an emergency, these plans should be tested at  least annually. While EPA provided evidence that it had tested three of  the six plans in 2011, it did not provide the requested test results for the  other three plans.", "The EPA Inspector General has also noted deficiencies with the agency\u2019s  contingency planning.

One system on the third list was not included on either of the  first two inventories provided by EPA. Furthermore, three systems were  erroneously listed twice, with minor variations of the spelling of the  system names as the distinguishing information between the duplicate  entries. These errors could be due to inadvertent data entry errors, as the  agency places responsibility on individual information security officers to  update the central systems inventory that is maintained in its ASSERT  tool.
