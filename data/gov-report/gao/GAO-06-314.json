These projects, which were generally constructed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, include water storage facilities and delivery structures for agricultural purposes. Serious concerns have arisen about their maintenance and management. GAO was asked to examine (1) BIA's estimated deferred maintenance cost for its 16 irrigation projects, (2) what shortcomings, if any, exist in BIA's current management of its irrigation projects, and (3) any issues that need to be addressed to determine the long-term direction of BIA's irrigation program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["BIA estimated the cost for deferred maintenance at its 16 irrigation projects at about $850 million for 2005, although the agency is in the midst of refining this estimate. BIA acknowledges that this estimate is a work in progress, in part, because some projects incorrectly counted new construction items as deferred maintenance. To further refine its estimate, BIA plans to hire engineering and irrigation experts to conduct thorough condition assessments of all 16 irrigation projects to correctly identify deferred maintenance needs and costs. BIA's management of some of its irrigation projects has serious shortcomings that undermine effective decisionmaking about project operations and maintenance. First, under BIA's organizational structure, officials with the authority to oversee irrigation project managers generally lack the technical expertise needed to do so effectively, while the staff that have the expertise lack the necessary authority. Second, despite federal regulations that require BIA to consult with project stakeholders in setting project priorities, BIA has not consistently provided project stakeholders with the necessary information or opportunities to participate in project decisionmaking. The long-term direction of BIA's irrigation program depends on the resolution of several larger issues. Of most importance, BIA does not know to what extent its irrigation projects are capable of financially sustaining themselves, which hinders its ability to address long-standing concerns regarding inadequate funding. Information on financial sustainability, along with accurate deferred maintenance information, are two critical pieces of information that are needed to have a debate on the long-term direction of BIA's irrigation program. Once this information is available, the Congress and interested parties will be able to address how the deferred maintenance will be funded and whether entities other than BIA could more appropriately manage some or all of the projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The scarcity of water in the western part of the United States makes  irrigation critical to the continued success of agricultural activities. There  are over 100 irrigation works on Indian reservations primarily across the  western United States. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian  Affairs (BIA), which is responsible for providing social and economic  services to Indians, as well as managing land and natural resources held in  trust by the United States for Indians, currently refers to these irrigation  works as either \u201cirrigation projects\u201d or \u201cirrigation systems.\u201d There are 16  irrigation projects where water users are charged for the operation and  maintenance of the irrigation works by BIA. The remaining systems, on  which BIA does not charge an annual operation and maintenance fee, are  operated and maintained through a collaborative effort which generally  involves other BIA programs, tribes, and water users.", "The 16 irrigation projects, which were generally initiated in the late 1800s  and early 1900s by the Department of the Interior, include water storage  facilities and delivery structures for agricultural purposes. The projects  were constructed as part of the federal government\u2019s Indian assimilation  policy to foster agricultural opportunities and provide economic benefits to  Indian communities. Over time, non-Indians began buying or leasing the  land served by the projects for agricultural purposes, and project  stakeholders evolved from Indian water users and the tribes within the  reservations to include non-Indian water users as well. Many of the water  users today are non-Indian.", "A number of prior reports on BIA\u2019s irrigation projects have documented  that the annual operations and maintenance fees have historically been set  too low to cover the full cost of running the projects. In addition, problems  have been reported with collecting the fees that have been assessed.  Because of insufficient funding, project maintenance has been consistently  postponed, resulting in an extensive and costly list of deferred  maintenance items. The kinds of such deferred maintenance range from  repairing or replacing dilapidated irrigation structures to clearing weeds  from irrigation ditches. In addition to the deferred maintenance, water  users have expressed concern that BIA has been unresponsive in  addressing the projects\u2019 ongoing operations and maintenance needs.", "The 16 irrigation projects are located in 4 of BIA\u2019s 12 regions\u2014Rocky  Mountain, Northwest, Southwest, and Western. Management of these  projects is decentralized, with local or regional BIA offices responsible for  project management. Fourteen projects are overseen by local BIA agency  superintendents, and the 2 largest projects are overseen directly by  regional directors. The agency superintendents that oversee projects report  to their respective regional director. BIA\u2019s irrigation and engineering  experts, who provide technical assistance to the projects, are located in  each region as well as in the BIA central Irrigation, Power, and Safety of  Dams offices (central irrigation offices) located in Washington, D.C., and  other BIA locations in the western United States. The regional irrigation  staff and central irrigation office staff do not have line authority over the  projects.", "Federal regulations specify that in making judgments about the work and  actions necessary for the proper operation, maintenance and  administration of the projects, the official in charge \u201c\u2026 consults with water  users and their representatives, and with tribal council representatives, and  seeks advice on matters of program priorities and operational policies.\u201d  Furthermore, the regulations state that \u201cclose cooperation between the  Indian tribal councils, the project waters users and the Officer-In-Charge   is necessary and will be to the advantage of the entire  project.\u201d BIA\u2019s irrigation manual and handbook also contain language  directing project staff to involve project stakeholders in the management of  the projects.", "In response to ongoing concerns about maintenance and management of  the irrigation projects, in December 2003 Senator Conrad Burns and  Congressman Dennis Rehberg, both of Montana, sponsored a town hall  meeting with local water users and BIA officials to discuss problems at  BIA\u2019s irrigation projects. In this context, we were asked to examine (1)  BIA\u2019s estimated deferred maintenance cost for its 16 irrigation projects; (2)  what shortcomings, if any, exist in BIA\u2019s current management of its  irrigation projects; and (3) any issues that need to be addressed to  determine the long-term direction of BIA\u2019s irrigation program.", "To address the objectives of this report, we collected documentation on  BIA\u2019s 16 irrigation projects from officials in BIA\u2019s central irrigation office,  and we visited and collected information from each of BIA\u2019s four regional  offices that oversee the 16 irrigation projects. We also visited 9 of the 16  projects, where we collected project-specific information from BIA  officials and project stakeholders. We also met with and collected  documentation from the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Reclamation, the primary agency responsible for irrigation management,  for comparative purposes. Specifically, to examine estimated deferred  maintenance costs, we reviewed BIA\u2019s lists of deferred maintenance items  and cost estimates, and the methodology BIA used to develop these lists  and estimates. We concluded that these data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report based on a review of relevant controls,  reliability tests, and interviews with agency officials about the collection  and management of the data. We did not develop our own estimate of  deferred maintenance. To determine what, if any, management  shortcomings exist, we reviewed relevant federal regulations and agency  guidance, and analyzed BIA-wide and project-specific management  protocols and systems for the 9 projects we visited. Finally, to determine  any issues needing to be addressed to determine the long-term direction of  the projects, we reviewed prior studies on BIA\u2019s irrigation program and we  discussed the long-term direction of the program with BIA irrigation  officials and project stakeholders. A more detailed description of our  objectives, scope and methodology can be found in appendix I.

The Act of July 4, 1884, provided the Secretary of the  Interior $50,000 for the general development of irrigation on Indian lands.  Over the years, the Congress continued to pass additional legislation  authorizing and funding irrigation facilities on Indian lands.", "BIA\u2019s irrigation program includes over 100 \u201cirrigation systems\u201d and  \u201cirrigation projects\u201d that irrigate approximately 1 million acres primarily  across the West. BIA\u2019s irrigation systems are non revenue-generating  facilities that are primarily used for subsistence gardening and they are  operated and maintained through a collaborative effort which generally  involves other BIA programs, tribes, and water users. In contrast, BIA\u2019s 16  irrigation projects charge their water users an annual operations and  maintenance fee to fund the cost of operating and maintaining the project.  Most of BIA\u2019s irrigation projects are considered self-supporting through  these operations and maintenance fees. The 16 irrigation projects are  located on Indian reservations across the agency\u2019s Rocky Mountain,  Northwest, Southwest, and Western regions (see fig. 1).", "BIA\u2019s management of the 16 irrigation projects is decentralized, with  regional and local BIA offices responsible for day-to-day operations and  maintenance. Table 1 provides the tribe or tribes served by each of the 16  irrigation projects along with the year each project was originally  authorized.", "The irrigation facilities constructed by BIA included a range of structures  for storing and delivering water for agricultural purposes. Figure 2  highlights an example of the key structural features found on BIA\u2019s  irrigation projects.", "The beneficiaries of BIA\u2019s projects have evolved over time and at present  are quite diverse. Over the years, non-Indians have bought or leased a  significant portion of the land served by BIA\u2019s irrigation program. As a  result, current water users on BIA\u2019s projects include the tribes, individual  Indian landowners, non-Indian landowners, and non-Indian lessees of  Indian lands. The extent of non-Indian landownership and leasing ranges  significantly across BIA\u2019s irrigation projects (see table 2). For example, 100  percent of the land served by the Colorado River Irrigation Project is Indian  owned, while only about 10 percent of the land served by the Flathead  Irrigation Project is Indian owned.", "Federal regulations and internal BIA guidance require that BIA collaborate  with water users, both Indian and non-Indian, in managing the irrigation  projects. For example, federal regulations state that close cooperation  between BIA and water users is necessary and that the BIA official in  charge of each project is responsible for consulting with all water users in  setting program priorities. In addition, BIA\u2019s manual requires that BIA  \u201cprovide opportunities for water user participation in matters relating to  irrigation project operations\u201d and that BIA\u2019s officer-in-charge \u201cmeet  regularly with water users to discuss proposed [operation and  maintenance] assessment rates \u2026  general operations and  maintenance.\u201d Although BIA guidance does not define \u201cregularly,\u201d BIA\u2019s  Irrigation Handbook explicitly recommends that project staff meet at least  twice annually to discuss work performed over the course of the year and  allow for water user feedback and suggestions for the coming year.  Furthermore, BIA\u2019s Irrigation Handbook states that, at a minimum, BIA  should discuss annual project budgets and work plans with water users.", "Since their inception, BIA\u2019s 16 irrigation projects have been plagued by  maintenance concerns. Construction of the projects was never fully  completed, resulting in structural deficiencies that have continually  hindered project operations and efficiency. In addition, water users and  BIA have reported that operations and maintenance fees provide  insufficient funding for project operations. Due to insufficient funding,  project maintenance has been consistently postponed, resulting in an  extensive and costly list of deferred maintenance items. Such deferred  maintenance ranges from repairing or replacing dilapidated irrigation  structures to clearing weeds from irrigation ditches.", "In addition, concerns regarding BIA\u2019s management of the projects have  been raised for years, particularly in regard to its financial management  practices. For example, problems concerning BIA\u2019s billing practices for its  operations and maintenance fees have been raised by many, prompting  independent review on more than one occasion. We and the Department of  the Interior\u2019s Inspector General have both identified serious problems with  the land use records BIA has used to develop its annual operations and  maintenance bills. In response, BIA instituted a new financial management  system called the National Irrigation Information Management System,  which has begun to address some of the billing errors. However, concerns  still exist regarding the accuracy of the data in the billing system. The  accuracy of some of the information in the irrigation billing system is  dependant on the irrigation program receiving accurate and timely  information from other BIA programs, such as land ownership and leasing  information from BIA\u2019s Real Estate Services program.", "In 2001, the Yakama tribe and individual tribal members filed appeals  challenging the Wapato Irrigation Project\u2019s operation and maintenance fees  for the pre-2000 and year 2000 bills. Furthermore, the Wapato Irrigation  Project agreed to not send any bills to the tribe or its members since 2001.

This initial estimate was based, in part, on preliminary  condition assessments of irrigation structures and equipment for each of  BIA\u2019s 16 irrigation projects. These preliminary condition assessments  generally consisted of visual inspections to classify each project\u2019s structure  and equipment using a scale of good, fair, poor, critical and abandoned  based on the apparent level of disrepair. BIA staff then estimated how  much it would cost to repair each item based on its condition classification.", "BIA generally defines deferred maintenance as upkeep that is postponed  until some future time. Deferred maintenance varies from project to  project and ranges from cleaning weeds and trees which divert water from  irrigation ditches, to repairing leaky or crumbling check gates designed to  regulate water flow, to resloping eroded canal banks to optimize water  flow. Figure 3 shows examples of deferred maintenance on some of the  irrigation projects we visited (clockwise from the upper left, figure 3 shows  (1) a defunct check gate and overgrown irrigation ditch at the Fort Belknap  Irrigation Project, (2) a cattle-crossing eroding a canal bank and impairing  water flow at the Wind River Irrigation Project, (3) a crumbling irrigation  structure at the Crow Irrigation Project, and (4) a check gate leaking water  at the Colorado River Irrigation Project). For detailed information on key  maintenance issues for each of the nine projects we visited, see appendix  II.", "BIA officials acknowledged that their fiscal year 2004 deferred  maintenance estimate was only a starting point and that it needed to be  revised for three key reasons: (1) the individuals who conducted the  assessments were not knowledgeable about irrigation projects or  infrastructure; (2) not all projects used the same methodology to develop  their deferred maintenance cost estimates; and (3) some projects  incorrectly counted new construction items as deferred maintenance.", "BIA\u2019s preliminary condition assessments were conducted by computer  specialists, rather than by people with the expertise in irrigation or  engineering needed to accurately assess project infrastructure. BIA  contracted with geographic information system experts primarily to  catalogue the structures on each project. These geographic information  system experts also observed the condition of the structures they  catalogued and classified the condition of each structure, based on the  level of apparent disrepair, as part of the overall effort to inventory and  map key structures on each project. Consequently, some items identified  as being in \u201cpoor\u201d condition may in fact be structurally sound but simply  appear cosmetically dilapidated, whereas other structures classified as  being in \u201cgood\u201d condition may in fact be structurally dilapidated but  appear cosmetically sound. For example, according to BIA staff at the  Colorado River Irrigation Project, the recent repainting of certain check  gates disguised severe rust and structural deterioration of key metal  parts.", "BIA staff used inconsistent methodologies to develop the cost estimates  for deferred maintenance. According to BIA staff, the deferred  maintenance cost estimates were developed by different people,  sometimes using different or unknown methodologies for assigning cost  values to deferred maintenance items. For example, some projects  developed their own cost estimates and sent them to BIA\u2019s central office  for inclusion in its overall figures, while BIA regional staff developed  cost estimates for other projects based, in part, on information from  BIA\u2019s preliminary condition assessments.", "Some projects incorrectly included new construction items as deferred  maintenance. According to BIA, work that would expand a project or  its facilities should not be categorized as deferred maintenance.  Therefore, expanding an existing water delivery system or constructing  a new building is not deferred maintenance. However, some projects  incorrectly counted new construction items as deferred maintenance.  For example, the Fort Hall Irrigation Project included increasing the  capacity of its main canal for about $15.3 million, the Duck Valley  Irrigation Project included building new canals for about $1.3 million,  and the Flathead Irrigation Project included building a new warehouse  for about $147,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In 2005, BIA Revised the Estimate Downward to about $850 Million, but It Is Still a Work in Progress", "paragraphs": ["To improve the accuracy of its deferred maintenance estimate in 2005 and  to help staff develop, track, and continuously update deferred maintenance  lists and cost estimates, BIA implemented MAXIMO\u2014a facilities  management system linked to the geographic information system mapping  inventory developed from its preliminary condition assessments. Using  data from MAXIMO, BIA revised its total deferred maintenance estimate  for the irrigation projects downward to about $850 million for fiscal year  2005. Figure 4 shows the current deferred maintenance cost estimate for  each of the 16 projects. In the summer of 2005, BIA technical experts from  the central irrigation office conducted training for BIA irrigation projects  on how to use MAXIMO to enter information on maintenance needs, and  how to correctly define deferred maintenance. Projects used this system to  revise their list of deferred maintenance items and associated cost  estimates in fiscal year 2005. While MAXIMO is still being tailored to the  needs of the irrigation program, its implementation generally standardized  the process for identifying and calculating deferred maintenance among  projects.", "Despite the implementation of MAXIMO, BIA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 estimate of  deferred maintenance is still inaccurate for the following reasons:  Some projects continued to incorrectly count certain items as deferred  maintenance. Despite training, some projects continued to incorrectly  count certain items, such as new construction items and vehicles, as  deferred maintenance. For example, the Fort Hall Irrigation Project  included the installation of permanent diversion structures for about  $2.1 million, the Wapato Irrigation Project included constructing  reservoirs for about $640,000, and the San Carlos Indian Works  Irrigation Project included building a new office for about $286,000. In  addition, some projects included the cost of repairing vehicles or buying  new ones in their deferred maintenance estimates, despite BIA\u2019s new  guidance that such items are not deferred maintenance. According to  BIA officials, while projects can consider the weed clearing postponed  due to broken vehicles as deferred maintenance, the delayed repair of  the vehicle itself is not deferred maintenance. For example, the Wind  River Irrigation Project included an excavator vehicle for about $500,000  and the Crow Irrigation Project included dump trucks for about  $430,000.", "Some projects provided BIA with incomplete information. According  to BIA officials, some projects did not do thorough assessments of their  deferred maintenance needs, and some may not be including legitimate  deferred maintenance items, such as re-sloping canal banks that have  eroded by crossing cattle or overgrown vegetation. Moreover, both the  Walker River and the Uintah Irrigation Projects failed to provide  information detailing their deferred maintenance costs, and several  projects lumped items together as \u201cother\u201d with little or no explanatory  information other than \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d\u2014accounting for almost one- third of BIA\u2019s total deferred maintenance cost estimate for its irrigation  projects (see fig. 5).", "BIA made errors when compiling the total deferred maintenance cost  estimates. For example, BIA inadvertently double-counted the estimate  provided by the Colorado River Irrigation Project when compiling the  overall cost estimate, according to BIA officials. Additionally, BIA  officials erroneously estimated costs for all structures, such as flumes  and check gates, based on the full replacement values even when items  were in good or fair condition and needed only repairs. These structures  account for over one-third of BIA\u2019s total deferred maintenance estimate  (see fig. 5).", "While the inclusion of incorrect items and calculation errors likely  overestimate BIA\u2019s total deferred maintenance costs, the incomplete  information provided by some projects may underestimate total costs.", "To further refine its cost estimate and to develop more comprehensive  deferred maintenance lists, BIA plans to hire experts in engineering and  irrigation to periodically conduct thorough condition assessments of all 16  irrigation projects to identify deferred maintenance needs and costs.  According to BIA officials, these thorough condition assessments are  expected to more accurately reflect each project\u2019s actual deferred  maintenance, in part because experts in engineering and irrigation who can  differentiate between structural and cosmetic problems will conduct them.  These assessments will also help BIA prioritize the allocation of potential  funds to complete deferred maintenance items because they will assign a  prioritization rating to each deferred maintenance item based on the  estimated repair or replacement cost as well as the overall importance to  the project. The first such assessment was completed for the Flathead  Irrigation Project in July 2005, and BIA plans to reassess the condition of  each project at least once every 5 years, with the first round of such  condition assessments completed by the end of 2010."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Shortcomings in BIA\u2019s Management of Some Irrigation Projects Undermine Effective Decisionmaking", "paragraphs": ["BIA\u2019s management of some of its irrigation projects has serious  shortcomings that undermine effective decisionmaking about project  operations and maintenance.

BIA  regional directors, agency superintendents, and agency deputy  superintendents who oversee the projects do not generally have  engineering or irrigation expertise, and they rely heavily on the project  managers to run the projects. (See fig. 6 for an organizational chart  showing the lines of authority for providing oversight of a typical BIA  irrigation project.) Of the nine projects we visited, only two had managers  at the regional or agency levels who are experts in irrigation or engineering.  At the same time, BIA staff with the irrigation and engineering expertise\u2014 regional irrigation engineers and central irrigation office staff\u2014have no  authority over the 16 projects under BIA\u2019s current organizational structure.  Consequently, key technical decisions about project operations and  maintenance, such as when or how to repair critical water delivery  infrastructure, do not necessarily get the technical oversight or scrutiny  needed.", "This organizational structure and reliance on the project managers breaks  down when the person managing the project lacks the expertise required  for the position\u2014that is, in cases in which BIA has had difficulty filling  project manager vacancies and has, as a result, hired less qualified people  or has the agency deputy superintendent temporarily serving in the project  manager position. Of the nine projects we visited, four lacked project  managers for all or part of the 2005 irrigation season and five project  managers were experts in engineering or irrigation.", "The GAO Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool recommends  that federal agencies analyze the knowledge and skills needed to perform  jobs appropriately and provides guidance on organizational structure and  identification of potential risks to the agency in that structure.  Specifically, it recommends that adequate mechanisms exist to address  risks\u2014such as the risks associated with staff vacancies or hiring less  qualified staff.", "When the project manager is under-qualified and unchecked by managers  who heavily rely on his or her decisionmaking, the potential for adverse  impacts on the operations and maintenance of an irrigation project  increases. For example, at the Crow Irrigation Project in 2002, a project  manager with insufficient expertise decided to repair a minor leak in a key  water delivery structure by dismantling it and replacing it with a different  type of structure. The new structure was subsequently deemed inadequate  by BIA\u2019s irrigation experts, and the required reconstruction delayed water  delivery by about a month. In addition, at the Blackfeet Irrigation Project in  2000, the accidental flooding and subsequent erosion of a farmer\u2019s land was  inadequately addressed by project and agency management who decided to  use a short-term solution over the objections of the regional irrigation  engineer, who lacked the authority to override the project manager and  agency superintendent\u2019s technical decision, despite their lack of expertise.  At the time of this report, the regional irrigation engineer continues to  negotiate the implementation of a long-term and technically sound  solution.", "Furthermore, BIA lacks protocols to ensure that project managers consult  with, or get input from, BIA\u2019s technical experts before implementing  technically complex decisions about project operations and maintenance,  further exacerbating problems and undermining management  accountability. For example, in the 2002 incident at the Crow Irrigation  Project discussed above, the project manager was not required to consult  with, notify, or get approval from either the regional irrigation engineer or  central irrigation office staff, despite his lack of expertise and the  complexity of the flume replacement project he undertook. According to  BIA officials, if the project manager had consulted an engineer, his plan to  replace the flume with two small culverts would have been rejected before  work began because it was technically insufficient and would not have  been completed before the start of the approaching irrigation season."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BIA Has Not Consistently Provided Information and Opportunities for Stakeholders to Participate in Setting Project Priorities", "paragraphs": ["A second serious management shortcoming is the extent to which some  projects involve water users in decisionmaking. Federal regulations, as  well as BIA guidance, call for involving project stakeholders\u2014that is, tribal  representatives as well as both Indian and non-Indian water users\u2014in the  operations and maintenance of each project. Specifically, federal  regulations state that BIA is responsible for consulting with all water users  in setting program priorities; BIA\u2019s manual requires that BIA provide  regular opportunities for project water users to participate in project  operations; and BIA\u2019s Irrigation Handbook recommends that BIA meet at  least twice a year with project water users to discuss project budgets and  desired work.", "Despite such requirements and recommendations, BIA has not consistently  provided the opportunities or information necessary for water users to  participate in such decisionmaking about project operations and  maintenance. The frequency of meetings between BIA and its project water  users varied considerably on the nine projects we visited, from rarely  (generally zero meetings per year), to periodically (generally more than one  meeting per year), to regularly (generally more than three meetings per  year), as shown in figure 9. For example, both the Blackfeet and Colorado  River Irrigation Projects hold regular meetings with both tribal and  individual water users, with meetings held quarterly at the Blackfeet  Irrigation Project and monthly at the Colorado River Irrigation Project. In  contrast, BIA officials on the Pine River Irrigation Project do not meet with  any non-tribal water users, and BIA officials at the Fort Belknap Irrigation  Project have held few water users meetings in recent years. There was no  meeting with water users at the Fort Belknap Irrigation Project to kick-off  the 2005 irrigation season because the project manager position was  vacant, worsening an already adversarial relationship between water users  and BIA, according to water users and a local government official. Also,  BIA officials on the Crow Irrigation Project have no regularly scheduled  meetings with either the tribe or individual water users and, in fact, failed  to send a single representative to the meeting it called in 2005 for water  users to voice their concerns about project management and operations.", "In addition to a lack of regular meetings with all project water users, BIA  has not consistently shared the type of information about project  operations and finances that water users need to meaningfully participate  in project decisionmaking. Although BIA officials at the Colorado River  Irrigation Project share information on their budgets with water users and  work collaboratively with water users to develop annual work priorities in  accordance with BIA\u2019s Irrigation Handbook, not all projects we visited  provide or solicit this type of information. For example, BIA staff at the  Wapato Irrigation Project does not solicit water users\u2019 input on project  priorities or share information on the project\u2019s budget, according to water  users we spoke with, and BIA officials at the Crow Irrigation Project do not  share this type of critical information. However, some of the projects we  visited have recently begun to share information on project spending and  involve project water users in developing project priorities, despite not  doing so historically. For example, the project management at the  Blackfeet Irrigation Project began sharing budget information with its  water users during the 2005 season, and the new project management at  the Fort Belknap Irrigation Project stated that they plan on involving  project water users in setting project priorities in the 2006 season.", "Moreover, although some project managers and their staff are  approachable and responsive on an individual basis, according to water  users on some projects we visited, others stated that project management  on some of BIA\u2019s irrigation projects were generally inaccessible and non- responsive. For example, BIA officials acknowledged that a former project  manager at the Blackfeet Irrigation Project told water users to sue BIA to  get information on project decisionmaking. In addition, some expressed  concerns that BIA is less responsive to non-Indians because BIA\u2019s mission  does not specifically include non-Indians. Consequently, some non-Indian  water users have opted to go directly to their congressional representatives  to raise their concerns. For example, non-Indian water users at the Wapato  Irrigation Project have sought congressional intervention on several  occasions to help compel BIA staff to disclose information about project  finances, such as information related to proposed operations and  maintenance fee debts and data on project land not being billed for  operations and maintenance. In addition, Senator Conrad Burns and  Congressman Dennis Rehberg of Montana co-sponsored a town hall  meeting in 2003 to provide local water users an opportunity to voice project  concerns to BIA officials. Requests by non-Indian water users for project  management and regional staff to address the lack of water delivery at the  Crow Irrigation Project during the month of August 2005 went largely  unanswered by BIA, resulting in congressional intervention. Such lack of  access and communication about project operations limits the ability of  water users to have an impact on project decisions as well as the ability of  BIA to benefit from this input."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Direction of BIA\u2019s Irrigation Program Depends on Resolution of a Number of Larger Issues", "paragraphs": ["The long-term direction of BIA\u2019s irrigation program depends on the  resolution of several larger issues. Of most importance, BIA does not know  the extent to which its irrigation projects are capable of financially  sustaining themselves, which hinders its ability to address long-standing  concerns regarding inadequate funding. The future of BIA\u2019s irrigation  program also depends on the resolution of how the deferred maintenance  will be funded. BIA currently has no plans for how it will obtain funding to  fix the deferred maintenance items, and obtaining this funding presents a  significant challenge in times of tight budgets and competing priorities.  Finally, it might be more appropriate for other entities, including other  federal agencies, tribes, and water users, to manage some or all of the  projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Extent to Which Projects Are Capable of Sustaining Themselves Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["BIA does not know the extent to which Indian irrigation projects are  capable of sustaining themselves. Reclamation law and associated policy  require the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation to test the  financial feasibility of proposed projects comparing estimated  reimbursable project costs with anticipated revenues. The Bureau of  Reclamation then uses these reimbursable cost estimates to negotiate  repayment contracts with water users, where appropriate. In contrast,  Indian irrigation projects were authorized to support Indian populations  residing on reservations without regard to whether the projects could be  financially self-sustaining. As a result, neither the Congress nor project  stakeholders have any assurance that these projects can sustain  themselves. For example, a comprehensive 1930 study of BIA\u2019s irrigation  program concluded that the Blackfeet and Fort Peck Irrigation Projects  should be abandoned. Specifically, the report noted, \u201cfter a very careful  study of all the available data relating to these projects, including a field  examination, we are firmly convinced that any further attempts to  rehabilitate and to operate and maintain these projects \u2026 can result only in  increasing the loss that must be accepted and sustained by the  Government. Adequate preliminary investigations and studies to which  every proposed project should be subjected, in our opinion, would have  condemned  \u2026 these \u2026 projects as unfeasible.\u201d", "Despite this lack of information on the overall financial situation for each  of the projects, in the early 1960s BIA classified more than half of its 16  projects as fully self-supporting, on the basis of annual operations and  maintenance fees they collected from water users. These self-supporting  projects do not receive any ongoing appropriated funds. These projects are  subject to full cost recovery despite the absence of financial information to  demonstrate that the water users could sustain this financial burden. The  Blackfeet and Fort Peck Irrigation Projects were two of the projects  classified as fully self-supporting. While the specific financial situations for  the Blackfeet and Fort Peck Irrigation Projects have likely changed since  the 1920s, BIA does not know if these projects, or any of the other Indian  irrigation projects, are financially self-supporting.", "The heavy reliance on water users to sustain these projects has created  ongoing tension between the water users and BIA. Some water users have  complained to BIA that they cannot afford the operations and maintenance  fees and they pressure BIA to keep the fees as low as possible. The Bureau  of Reclamation recently conducted a study of the Pine River Irrigation  Project and concluded that some of the water users could not conduct a  profitable farming operation with the 2005 operations and maintenance fee  of $8.50 per acre. BIA has not responded to the Bureau of Reclamation  study, and in October 2005 BIA proposed doubling the rate to $17.00 per  acre for the 2006 irrigation season even though water users claim that they  cannot afford to pay a higher fee. The operations and maintenance fee has  been set at $8.50 at the Pine River Irrigation Project since 1992 and,  according to BIA officials, the collections do not provide adequate funds to  properly operate and maintain the project. As a result, BIA estimates that  the deferred maintenance at the project has grown to over $20 million.  Without definitive information on the financial situation of each project,  BIA cannot determine what portion of project operations and maintenance  costs can be reasonably borne by the water users and to what extent  alternative sources of financing, such as congressional appropriations,  should be pursued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "There Is No Plan for How to Fund the Deferred Maintenance", "paragraphs": ["Despite the estimated $850 million in deferred maintenance and the degree  to which it impedes ongoing operations and maintenance at BIA\u2019s irrigation  projects, BIA currently has no plan for funding the list of deferred  maintenance items. Funding deferred maintenance costs in the hundreds of  millions of dollars will be a significant challenge in times of tight budgets  and competing priorities. Nonetheless, officials stated that the agency has  made little effort to identify options for funding the deferred maintenance.  BIA acknowledges that income from ongoing operations and maintenance  fees would likely be inadequate to cover the deferred maintenance, yet the  agency has done little to identify alternative means of funding. According  to officials, BIA has not asked the Congress for supplemental funding to  cover the deferred maintenance. For example, water users report that the  $7.5 million appropriated for BIA\u2019s irrigation projects for fiscal year 2006  resulted from lobbying by concerned water users, not from BIA\u2019s efforts.  To date, BIA has primarily focused on developing and refining an accurate  estimate of the cost to fix the deferred maintenance items. While  developing an estimate of the projected cost is important, BIA officials  believe that the agency also needs to develop a plan for ultimately funding  the deferred maintenance.", "Developing a plan for funding the deferred maintenance is complicated by  competing priorities and a crisis-oriented management style that  complicates preventative maintenance, according to BIA officials. The  current state of disrepair of most of the irrigation projects results in  frequent emergency situations concerning project operations and  maintenance. As a result, BIA irrigation staff spends a significant amount of  its time addressing emergency maintenance situations, to the detriment of  other maintenance needs that are essential to sustaining the projects over  the long term. As a result of this \u201ccrisis-style\u201d management, BIA has limited  time to devote to non-emergency issues such as the list of deferred  maintenance items. Furthermore, this \u201ccrisis-style\u201d management prevents  BIA from devoting adequate time to preventative maintenance. For  example, irrigation staff at Wind River Irrigation Project stated that making  \u201cband-aid\u201d emergency repairs on a regular basis prevents them from  addressing long-standing deferred maintenance needs, as well as from  conducting strategic improvements that would help sustain the project  over the long term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "It Might Be More Appropriate for Other Entities to Manage Some or All of the Projects", "paragraphs": ["It may be beneficial to consider whether other groups for whom irrigation  is a priority or an area of expertise could better manage some of the  irrigation projects, including other federal agencies, Indian tribes, and  water users. BIA must balance its irrigation management responsibilities  with its many other missions in support of Indian communities. As the  federal agency charged with supporting Indian communities in the United  States, BIA\u2019s responsibility is to administer and manage land and natural  resources held in trust for Indians by the U.S. government. Administration  and management of these trust lands and resources involves a wide variety  of responsibilities, including law enforcement, social services, economic  development, education and natural resource management. Given the  multitude of responsibilities that BIA must balance, there are inherent  limits on the resources and knowledge that BIA is able to devote to any one  program. As a result of these limitations and competing demands, officials  report that irrigation management is not a priority for BIA. The fact that  many water users on the irrigation projects are now non-Indian may further  encourage BIA to prioritize and devote more resources to other programs  before irrigation management.", "Successful management of the irrigation projects by other groups would  depend on the unique characteristics of each project and its water users.  Potential groups who may be able to assume management for some  irrigation projects or portions of some irrigation projects include the  following:  The Bureau of Reclamation. As the federal agency charged with  managing water in the western United States, the Bureau of  Reclamation has extensive technical experience in managing irrigation  projects and has served in a technical or advisory capacity to BIA\u2019s  irrigation staff. Furthermore, efforts have been made in the past to turn  over some BIA irrigation projects to the Bureau of Reclamation and the  Fort Yuma Irrigation Project is currently operated by the Bureau of  Reclamation. In addition, the Bureau of Reclamation utilizes  management practices for its irrigation projects that maximize  information sharing and collaboration with water users. For example, in  contrast to BIA, the Bureau of Reclamation delegates responsibility for  much of the day-to-day operations and maintenance on its irrigation  projects to irrigation districts, which are organized groups of water  users.", "Indian Tribes. Officials report that some of the tribes have staff with  extensive knowledge of irrigation and water management, as well as  technical training. Some tribes stated that they have a vested interest in  seeing their respective projects succeed, and they would like to assume  direct responsibility for their reservation\u2019s irrigation project, assuming  the deferred maintenance items are fixed before the turnover occurs.  Turning over some of the BIA projects to Indian tribes would be an  option where tribes have the management and technical capability to  assume responsibility for an irrigation project.", "Water Users. Water users have extensive familiarity with the day-to-day  management of the projects and in some cases already handle many  day-to-day operations and maintenance activities. For example, the  Crowheart Water Users Association, a group of water users at the Wind  River Irrigation Project, have successfully assumed responsibility for  most of the maintenance needs on their portion of the project. In  exchange for their efforts, BIA refunds to the Crowheart Water Users  Association 50 percent of their annual operation and maintenance fees.  Through this arrangement, the Crowheart Water Users Association  believes it has been able to more effectively address maintenance needs  and increase project efficiency. Turning over some of the BIA projects to  water users would be an option where water users share similar  interests and have positive working relationships, as well as the desire  to organize an irrigation district or association.", "Any successful alternative management option would have to consider the  sometimes disparate interests and priorities among water users. In some  cases, a combination of the various alternative management options may  be beneficial and feasible. This type of arrangement is currently being  considered for the Flathead Irrigation Project, where BIA is currently in the  process of turning over the operation and management of the project to a  collaborative management group that may include the tribe, individual  Indian water users, and non-Indian water users. However, regardless of the  alternative management option, water users and tribal officials repeatedly  stated that they would not be willing or able to take over project operations  and maintenance unless the deferred maintenance had already been  addressed or adequate funding was available to address the deferred  maintenance needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since BIA historically has not had adequate funds to operate and maintain  the projects, the projects are in a serious state of disrepair. BIA is in the  process of implementing its plan to develop an accurate list and estimate of  the deferred maintenance needs for each project. However, some of the  projects also have day-to-day management shortcomings regarding  technical support and stakeholder involvement that need to be addressed.  BIA\u2019s decentralized organizational structure combined with the difficulty in  attracting and retaining highly qualified project managers at remote Indian  reservations led to some poor decisionmaking at some of the projects. It is  critically important that project managers, especially those with less than  desirable qualifications, have the necessary level of technical support to  prevent poor decisions from being made in the future.", "A lack of adequate stakeholder involvement at some projects has also  seriously undermined project accountability. Unlike most other BIA  programs, the operations and maintenance of the irrigation projects are  funded almost entirely by the project beneficiaries\u2014the water users, many  of whom are non-Indian. Consequently, BIA is accountable to these water  users and these water users expect to have an active voice in project  operations and maintenance. Some projects have not fulfilled their  obligations to regularly meet with project stakeholders, creating an  adversarial environment in which BIA and project water users do not trust  each other. This failure to involve stakeholders in the management of their  own projects means that BIA does not benefit from water user expertise  and has resulted in widespread feelings that BIA is non-responsive and  evasive, alienating many water users who feel disenfranchised. Moreover,  this failure has limited the ability of stakeholders to hold BIA accountable  for its decisions and actions.", "In addition to some shortcomings with BIA\u2019s ongoing day-to-day  management of some of the projects, we also found that information on the  financial sustainability of the projects is needed to help address the long- term direction of BIA\u2019s irrigation program. BIA\u2019s 16 irrigation projects were  generally built in the late 1800s and early 1900s to further the federal  government\u2019s Indian policy of assimilation. The government made the  decision to build these projects to support and encourage Indians to  become farmers. This decision was generally not based on a thorough  analysis designed to ensure that only cost effective projects were built. As a  result, the financial sustainability of some of the projects has always been  questionable, ultimately creating tension between BIA and its water users.  BIA is under constant pressure to raise annual operations and maintenance  fees to collect adequate funds to maintain the projects, while many water  users contend that they do not have the ability to pay higher fees. Without a  clear understanding of the financially sustainability of the projects, BIA  does not know whether it is practical to raise operation and maintenance  fees, or whether alternative sources of financing should be pursued.  Information on financial sustainability, along with accurate deferred  maintenance information, are both critical pieces of information needed to  have a debate on the long-term direction of BIA\u2019s irrigation program. Once  this information is available, the Congress and interested parties will be  able to address how the deferred maintenance will be funded and whether  entities other than BIA could more appropriately manage some or all of the  projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior take the following three  actions.", "To improve the ongoing management of the projects in the short-term, we  recommend that the Secretary direct the Assistant Secretary for Indian  Affairs to  provide the necessary level of technical support for project managers  who have less than the desired level of engineering qualifications by  putting these projects under the direct supervision of regional or central  irrigation office staff or by implementing more stringent protocols for  engineer review and approval of actions taken at the projects; and  require, at a minimum, that irrigation project management meet twice  annually with all project stakeholders\u2014once at the end of a season and  once before the next season\u2014to provide information on project  operations, including budget plans and actual annual expenditures, and  to obtain feedback and input.", "To obtain information on the long-term financial sustainability of each of  the projects, we recommend that the Secretary direct the Assistant  Secretary for Indian Affairs to conduct studies to determine both how  much it would cost to financially sustain each project, and the extent to  which water users on each project have the ability to pay these costs.
