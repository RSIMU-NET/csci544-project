As a result, EPA requested assistance from and established a joint task force with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to evaluate compliance with relevant health and safety requirements at hazardous waste incinerators. The task force\u2019s 1991 report summarized the results of inspections at 29 such facilities and made five recommendations to EPA and four to OSHA. These recommendations were intended as follow-through measures to correct violations detected during the inspections, educate the combustion industry, improve the coverage of inspections, educate compliance officials, and prompt EPA to conduct research and revise incinerators\u2019 permits as necessary.", "In response to your request for information on whether hazardous waste incineration facilities are following federal health and safety requirements, we determined (1) what the status of the task force report\u2019s recommendations is, (2) what the results of subsequent inspections and enforcement actions at the 29 facilities have been, and (3) whether EPA or OSHA have taken other actions beyond those recommended by the task force to better protect health and safety at hazardous waste incineration facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) authorizes EPA to set minimum operating requirements for hazardous waste facilities to protect the public and the environment. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 authorizes the Department of Labor, through OSHA, to establish standards to protect workers\u2019 health and safety. Under both statutes, states can be authorized to inspect facilities, take enforcement action against facility owners/operators, and assess penalties at facilities that fail to meet states\u2019 federally approved RCRA or OSHA programs. EPA has authorized 46 states to implement their own RCRA programs, and OSHA has authorized 23 states to implement their own OSHA programs. The federal government is responsible for implementing RCRA and OSHA programs in the remaining states.", "According to EPA\u2019s general operating requirements for hazardous waste facilities, workers must be trained to know the environmental requirements that apply at their facility, and facilities must have contingency plans and emergency procedures for accidents. To ensure facilities\u2019 compliance with regulatory or permit-related requirements, EPA recommends that its regions or the states inspect facilities annually. Every other year, EPA recommends an in-depth inspection lasting several days, rather than the annual 1-day walk-through. Facilities that accept Superfund waste must be inspected within the 6-month period prior to receiving such waste. During inspections, EPA and the states complete checklists of items to review while observing facilities\u2019 operations and reviewing facilities\u2019 records and files.", "OSHA\u2019s health and safety regulations are intended to ensure that employees can recognize and avoid unsafe conditions and are instructed in the handling of any special equipment, among other things. At hazardous waste facilities, employees must receive special hazardous material training. To ensure compliance with OSHA\u2019s regulatory requirements, federal or state OSHA inspectors conduct either \u201cprogrammed\u201d (planned) inspections or \u201cunprogrammed\u201d inspections to follow up on complaints, referrals, or accidents.", "The scheduling of federal programmed inspections is based on industries\u2019 history of health or safety violations. Facilities within the types of industries that have a history of many violations receive programmed inspections for health or safety by OSHA\u2019s field offices. OSHA also reserves some resources to conduct programmed health inspections at randomly selected facilities having a history of few health violations. States may use different methods for scheduling programmed inspections. OSHA and the states conduct unprogrammed inspections in response to complaints, referrals, and accidents resulting in catastrophes or fatalities.", "According to an OSHA Office of Policy official, during fiscal year 1993, about half of the inspections were programmed, or targeted, as a result of particular industries\u2019 violations. The remainder of the inspections were unprogrammed. OSHA\u2019s inspections rely on inspectors\u2019 observations as well as interviews with employees and reviews of records.", "As of November 1994, 162 incinerators were operating in the United States. Of these, 141 had their final permits, which impose facility-specific operating requirements. The remaining 21 were considered in interim status. When an existing hazardous waste facility first becomes subject to RCRA\u2019s requirements for permits, it generally assumes \u201cinterim status\u201d until its operator completes the permit application process. A facility under interim status is allowed to continue operating under general operating requirements, pending EPA\u2019s or the state\u2019s approval of the facility\u2019s final permits.", "In May 1990, after local citizens and workers made complaints or allegations about waste handling practices at an incinerator in North Carolina, EPA requested that the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) evaluate health threats posed by the incinerator. Although routine RCRA inspections conducted while the facility operated from 1976 through 1989 had not detected or confirmed these allegations, ATSDR concluded that waste handling operations at the facility had posed a significant health threat to employees.", "In September 1990, at EPA\u2019s request, OSHA and EPA formed a task force to evaluate compliance with health and safety requirements at 29 hazardous waste incinerators, including all commercial facilities with final permits, all facilities under interim status, and all incinerators burning Superfund waste. The task force\u2019s May 1991 report summarized the results of these joint inspections. In total, EPA and OSHA detected 395 violations. The task force\u2019s report made five recommendations to EPA and four recommendations to OSHA to improve the coverage of inspections and educate compliance officials and industry, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA and OSHA Have Fully Implemented Some Report Recommendations but Not Others", "paragraphs": ["Of the task force\u2019s recommendations, EPA and/or OSHA have fully implemented three.

Although the task force\u2019s report recommended that EPA adopt some of the task force\u2019s inspection procedures so that EPA could better scrutinize industry\u2019s compliance with the agency\u2019s regulations, EPA did not fully implement the recommendation. In particular, the task force\u2019s inspectors used a new checklist that expanded the checklist used during EPA\u2019s routine inspections. This new checklist was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and not just the presence of employee training programs, contingency responses, and emergency plans. Furthermore, interviews of employees during the task force\u2019s inspections assessed employees\u2019 knowledge of environmental requirements and employees\u2019 ability to carry out contingency plans and emergency procedures. But in general, during routine inspections, EPA or the states only review employers\u2019 records to ensure that employers have a training program and that plans are on file.", "After the task force made its recommendations in December 1990, an EPA Assistant Administrator sent a memo to regional administrators asking that they distribute the task force\u2019s inspection checklist and employee interview guide to their staff and the states. EPA\u2019s Technical Assistance Branch Chief also orally instructed regional enforcement section chiefs to include items from the task force\u2019s checklist in the regions\u2019 routine inspections. In addition, EPA included the new checklist in the agency\u2019s inspection training manual and training courses.", "However, some of the EPA regions and states did not adopt the task force\u2019s checklist as suggested or directed because, according to regional compliance and enforcement officials, they were not aware of headquarters\u2019 instructions. Furthermore, according to an EPA Technical Assistance Branch official, EPA headquarters did not follow up to ensure that inspection procedures were changed because EPA believed the changes would be made, since it included the checklist in the training manual and training courses. An EPA Technical Assistance Branch Chief said that even if regions and states had adopted the task force\u2019s checklist and interview guide, it would be difficult for inspectors to duplicate the information obtained during the task force\u2019s inspections because the inspections included both EPA\u2019s and OSHA\u2019s interviews and were very focused. However, according to a regional inspector, while time is a factor during inspections, interviews of employees could routinely be included in all inspections, routine or in-depth, or on a case-by-case basis. These interviews would help confirm industry\u2019s compliance with EPA\u2019s requirements and assess employees\u2019 knowledge of required duties.", "As a result of our work, EPA\u2019s Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance issued a memorandum, dated September 23, 1994, to Regional Administrators and other RCRA officials requiring them to adopt the task force\u2019s inspection protocol, which includes using the revised checklist and employee guide, for workers\u2019 safety and health in regional RCRA Compliance Evaluation inspections. In addition, the memorandum requires that regional inspectors refer these violations to regional OSHA officials.", "EPA\u2019s research on the use of certain operating equipment and review of permits. EPA did not fully implement the recommendation that it conduct research on the cause for and impact of using certain operating equipment\u2014automatic waste feed cutoffs and emergency safety vents, or vent stacks\u2014and that it reopen permits, as necessary, to address the use of this equipment. During the task force\u2019s inspections, EPA observed the frequent use of automatic waste feed cutoffs at about half of the 29 facilities and the frequent use of vent stacks at 9 of these facilities. Automatic waste feed cutoffs prevent waste from entering the combustion chamber of an incinerator when operating conditions fluctuate outside certain parameters, such as those for temperature. Vent stacks protect workers and equipment by releasing gases when equipment malfunctions. While both are considered safety devices, EPA considers their frequent use an indication of poor operating practices. In particular, the frequent use of waste feed cutoffs (1) may be a sign of unsteady operation and (2) may cause the residue to be treated less efficiently. Furthermore, gases released through vent stacks contain more hazardous particles than gases routed through the air pollution control devices.", "In response to the recommendation, EPA conducted experiments at two of its research incinerators. However, because of funding and equipment limitations, EPA\u2019s initial tests did not fully answer questions about the effects of using waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks. EPA believed that states had taken steps to place controls on the use of these devices at the facilities that the task force had found to have the greatest number of cutoffs and releases. Because these tests were inconclusive and because EPA believed that states had taken steps to control frequent usage, EPA did not review or revise other permits to place controls on the use of this equipment at the other facilities that the task force had found to have an excessive number of cutoffs and releases. For example, at one facility that the task force found to have an excessive number of waste feed cutoffs, no action has been taken. State officials told us they wanted to place controls on the use of waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks at this facility, but because EPA\u2019s regulations do not specifically address controls over this equipment, the use of any such controls would have to be negotiated when the permit was renewed. In commenting on our report, EPA stated that its concern is not with the use of automatic waste feed cutoffs per se, but with facilities that may frequently use automatic waste feed cutoffs. This is especially true when facilities exceed their permits\u2019 operating limits if the waste feed cutoffs occur while waste remains in the system.", "EPA drafted a policy memorandum in 1992 to provide guidance to permit writers so they could place proper controls on the use of waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks in new permits and permits for facilities requesting modifications. EPA did not complete the draft memorandum because of other priorities, such as the agency\u2019s need to work with the regions and states on implementing the newly issued boiler and industrial furnace regulations and focusing on site-specific incinerator issues. According to an official in the Permits and State Programs Division, EPA did, however, revise its permit writers\u2019 training to include guidance on controlling the use of waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks. However, according to a combustion expert and Alternative Technology Section Chief, a policy memorandum would further support regions\u2019 and states\u2019 efforts to place controls over the use of waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks. State officials expressed a desire for such guidance.", "By December 1996, EPA plans to revise its 1981 regulations for incinerators to, among other things, clarify that exceeding a permit\u2019s operating parameters or bypassing the air pollution control device violates the permit regardless of whether an automatic waste feed cutoff occurs. In the interim, 21 incinerators currently are awaiting their final RCRA permits. In May 1993, EPA placed a high priority on issuing permits for existing combustion facilities that do not have final permits. While EPA does not anticipate that all of these facilities will be granted permits by December 1996, it hopes to make substantial progress.", "OSHA\u2019s education of compliance officials (inspection expertise). OSHA has not implemented the task force\u2019s recommendation that the agency improve its inspection expertise. According to an OSHA Office of Policy Official, a memorandum of understanding entered into with EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement in 1990 might have resulted in improved inspection expertise and knowledge of hazardous waste incinerators\u2019 operations for OSHA. This memorandum provides a framework for exchanging information and technical and professional assistance, conducting joint EPA-OSHA inspections, referring violations to each agency, and coordinating compliance and enforcement information.", "According to an OSHA Office of Policy official, although the memorandum was implemented, it did not result in improved inspection expertise or increased knowledge. A Senior Enforcement Counsel with EPA told us that EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement did not have oversight responsibilities for inspection and enforcement activities at hazardous waste facilities. Furthermore, EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement did not provide information to EPA headquarters\u2019 compliance staff who are responsible for directing EPA\u2019s regional compliance activities at hazardous waste facilities, including inspection and enforcement\u2014which are conducted primarily at EPA\u2019s regional and state levels. Because EPA headquarters did not direct the regions to coordinate their inspections of combustion facilities with OSHA and the regions did not suggest that states coordinate their inspections of combustion facilities with OSHA, the memorandum was not fully carried out.", "However, in June 1994, EPA consolidated inspection and enforcement responsibilities in the agency\u2019s new Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. According to an EPA Senior Enforcement Counsel official and an OSHA Office of Policy official, the consolidation of the responsibility to develop policy and guidance for inspections and enforcement actions within the new office will aid in carrying out the purpose of the memorandum and therefore in meeting the intent of the task force\u2019s recommendation. Furthermore, in September 1994, EPA\u2019s new Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance directed regions to inform OSHA of any facilities found in violation of RCRA\u2019s health and safety requirements, as required by the memorandum of understanding.", "In commenting on our report, OSHA stated that it has trained 245 federal and state compliance officers at its Training Institute to increase their knowledge of hazardous waste sites\u2019 operations. We recognize that OSHA does have a training program that disseminates knowledge of hazardous waste site operations for its enforcement officials and that this training program has continually been improved. However, our discussions with officials in OSHA\u2019s Training Institute and OSHA\u2019s Directorate of Policy and Office of Field Programs reveal that OSHA has not made any changes to the training given to its enforcement officials as a result of the task force\u2019s recommendations.", "OSHA\u2019s inspection coverage. OSHA also has not implemented the recommendation that the agency improve the coverage of its inspections by specifically including hazardous waste incinerators on its lists of programmed inspections. The refuse systems industry, which includes commercial hazardous waste incinerators, had a priority ranking, in terms of relative risk when compared with other industries, of 122 out of 324 in fiscal year 1991, and 150 out of 372 in fiscal year 1992. Following the task force\u2019s report, OSHA instructed that in fiscal years 1991 and 1992, any programmed inspections conducted at facilities included in the refuse systems industry be limited to two sectors of the industry\u2014\u201cDisposal and Collection of Acid Waste\u201d facilities and \u201cIncinerator Operations\u201d facilities. However, even though incinerators were given a higher priority for being inspected within the refuse systems industry, the refuse systems industry was not ranked sufficiently high enough, with respect to relative risk, to result in any programmed inspections at hazardous waste incinerators. According to OSHA\u2019s Director of Data Analysis, OSHA did not inspect incinerators under this initiative because few of OSHA\u2019s federal or state offices have sufficient resources to conduct health inspections at industries that are not ranked in the top 100. Following fiscal year 1992, OSHA no longer restricted inspections of refuse systems industries to facilities that dispose of or collect acid waste or that incinerate. Furthermore, in fiscal year 1993, the refuse industry\u2019s relative risk fell to 220."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Results of Subsequent Inspections and Enforcement Actions by EPA and OSHA at Facilities Inspected by the Task Force", "paragraphs": ["Since the task force made its inspections, EPA and/or OSHA, and states have inspected 22 facilities that have operating incinerators. However, the types of inspections conducted after the task force\u2019s inspections differed in scope from the task force\u2019s inspections, and EPA, OSHA, and the states have not detected as many or the same pattern of health or safety violations as did the task force.", "Since 1990, EPA and the states conducted 108 inspections at the 22 facilities and detected 630 violations. These inspections found a wider range and variety of violations than the task force found. However, fewer violations have been detected in the categories that the task force assessed, including personnel training, contingency plans, and emergency response. While EPA said that this may be due, in part, to improvements in industry\u2019s training of its workers as a result of the task force\u2019s inspections, as noted earlier, EPA\u2019s inspections only determined whether training programs existed. On the other hand, the task force\u2019s inspections focused on the effectiveness of training for the workers. Furthermore, EPA\u2019s and the states\u2019 subsequent inspections were broader in scope and looked at all aspects of the facilities\u2019 operations. As a result, violations of a wider array of regulatory requirements were detected, including those for the facilities\u2019 noncompliance with permits, the management of containers, and incinerator operation requirements. These subsequent inspections and enforcement actions resulted in an additional $4 million in collected penalties. According to EPA and state officials, all but one of the incineration facilities have returned to compliance following these inspections. (App. I contains additional information on the number and types of violations detected during the task force\u2019s and subsequent inspections.)", "OSHA and the states have conducted few health or safety inspections since the task force\u2019s inspections, and those that have been conducted were narrow in scope. OSHA and the states have not conducted any programmed health or safety inspections at the 22 operating incineration facilities since 1990 because the industries were ranked as a low priority, and they were not randomly selected for inspection. For example, in fiscal year 1993, OSHA\u2019s relative risk and priority ranking for commercial incinerators was 220 out of the 381 industries ranked. According to OSHA\u2019s Director of Data Analysis, it is not surprising that OSHA has not scheduled any programmed inspections at hazardous waste incinerators because of their relatively low risk and because of the low probability of their being randomly selected.", "An OSHA Office of Policy official said that OSHA prefers to target its resources at industries that OSHA views as more dangerous to workers\u2019 health and safety, such as manufacturing and construction industries.", "OSHA has, however, responded to eight complaints or referrals at five incineration facilities and collected about $22,000 in penalties. According to our analysis of the violations that OSHA found after the task force\u2019s inspections, none were violations detected by the task force at those five facilities. The violations have since been resolved.

OSHA is planning to issue a regulation requiring hazardous waste facilities, including incinerators, to have accredited training programs for workers. However, OSHA has no means to ensure that all facilities submit programs and receive accreditation.", "Partially in response to public concerns about incinerators and other types of combustion facilities, in May 1993, EPA issued a draft strategy for ensuring the safe and reliable combustion of hazardous waste. As part of that strategy, EPA designated the issuance of new incinerators\u2019 permits a low priority for 18 months so it could focus its resources on issuing permits for existing facilities under interim status, including the 21 discussed previously. In addition, the strategy calls for incorporating dioxin emission standards in new permits and incorporating more stringent controls over metals. EPA has directed regions to use the stricter operating standards as guidance for writing and issuing new permits if permit writers determine that these new standards are necessary to protect human health and the environment. EPA also targeted combustion facilities, including a total of 10 incinerators and other hazardous waste combustion facilities, for two separate enforcement initiatives in September 1993 and February 1994. These initiatives focused primarily on hazardous waste combustion operations and resulted in EPA-and state-assessed fines of over $9 million.", "As directed by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, OSHA is developing new standards and procedures for accrediting training programs for workers at hazardous waste facilities, including incinerators. OSHA expects this requirement to become final in December 1994. OSHA intends that the proposed regulation will result in workers\u2019 reduced exposure to hazardous substances and thus will help prevent fatalities and illnesses. Under the proposed regulation, all employees working on-site and exposed to hazardous substances and health or safety hazards will receive OSHA\u2019s accredited training. However, OSHA has no method to ensure that (1) all hazardous waste facilities submit training programs for accreditation and (2) all facilities\u2019 programs are accredited. OSHA and the states plan to rely on inspections to verify that facilities are complying with the requirement.", "However, since 1990, OSHA and the states have conducted few inspections at hazardous waste incineration facilities, and given the relatively low risk that the agency assigns to incinerators, OSHA and the states would only conduct inspections at incinerators if they were randomly selected or in response to complaints, referrals, or accidents. EPA could be of assistance to OSHA to ensure that facilities have accredited programs by, for example, (1) verifying, during inspections by EPA and the states, whether training programs have received accreditation from OSHA and, if not, informing OSHA and (2) providing OSHA with EPA\u2019s hazardous waste facility identification data, which would give OSHA an inventory of such facilities that OSHA currently does not have. OSHA could use such information to track which facilities have not submitted training programs for accreditation. However, OSHA has not explored with EPA the ways in which EPA could assist OSHA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["EPA and OSHA have generally followed up on the task force\u2019s recommendations. However, EPA has not fully implemented two key recommendations that, in our view, could be undertaken relatively easily. In particular, some EPA regions and states have not adopted the revised checklist and employee interview guide as requested by EPA headquarters in December 1990, in part, because EPA did not follow up to ensure that regions and states did so. In response to our work, EPA recently issued another memorandum that specifically directs regions and states to adopt the task force\u2019s inspection protocol, which includes the revised checklist and employee interview guide. If regions and states follow through and implement this requirement, inspectors will be better able to determine not only that employees have received the required training but also the effectiveness of that training. However, because EPA issued this memorandum only recently, it is too soon to know if the regions and states will follow the agency\u2019s directive.", "Furthermore, although some states took action to improve the operations of facilities that made frequent use of automatic waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks, EPA and the states did not revise permits at other facilities that the task force also found were frequently using this equipment. However, in 1992, EPA drafted guidance for permit writers to clarify the use of these operating devices in new permits and permits for which modifications were being requested, but it never completed the guidance. While EPA plans to revise regulations for incinerators that will clarify when this operating equipment can be used, at the earliest these regulations will not be completed until the end of 1996. In the meantime, EPA hopes to make substantial progress in issuing RCRA permits for 21 facilities under interim status. Without guidance to include controls on the use of automatic waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks, some of these permits may not include these stricter operating requirements.", "OSHA plans to make one substantive improvement, as required by the 1986 Superfund amendments act, to improve workers\u2019 health and safety by accrediting hazardous waste training programs. Under current plans, however, the agency will have no way of knowing whether this requirement is actually being met. On the other hand, by working with EPA, either through the memorandum of understanding or directly with EPA staff, OSHA could explore what assistance EPA could provide OSHA to determine compliance with its accreditation requirement. This assistance could include relying on EPA and states to identify, through RCRA inspections, facilities failing to have OSHA-accredited training programs and refer them to OSHA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that EPA regions and states comply with EPA\u2019s directive to adopt the task force\u2019s inspection protocol to assess the effectiveness of training for workers, contingency plans, and emergency preparedness, we recommend that the Administrator, EPA, follow up, after an appropriate interval, to ensure that federal and state inspectors include revised procedures in their inspections.", "To ensure that permit writers have the necessary guidance to place controls on automatic waste feed cutoffs and emergency vent stacks prior to EPA\u2019s issuance of revised regulations for incinerators in 1996, we recommend that the Administrator, EPA, complete and issue the agency\u2019s draft guidance relating to waste feed cutoffs and vent stacks.", "To ensure that all hazardous waste facilities\u2019 training programs receive accreditation, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the Administrator, OSHA, to work with EPA to develop a means to ensure that all hazardous waste facility employers submit their training programs to OSHA and receive required accreditation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["EPA and OSHA provided us with written comments on a draft of this report.

While we recognize that OSHA took some actions to carry out these recommendations, such actions neither resulted in any programmed inspections of hazardous waste incinerators, thus improving OSHA\u2019s coverage of inspections, nor improved inspection expertise. As discussed earlier, the memorandum of understanding between OSHA and EPA was ineffective in improving the inspection expertise of OSHA\u2019s inspection officers because no joint inspections were conducted at incinerators as a result of the memorandum.

We appreciate EPA\u2019s efforts to follow up on the task force report\u2019s recommendations and believe that the report accurately reflects actions taken by the agency, such as revising permit writers\u2019 training to include improved approaches to control the use of emergency safety vents and automatic waste feed cutoffs, thus increasing permit writers\u2019 consciousness of this issue. 2.    We have revised the report to clarify that the report did not call for revising all existing incinerator permits but, rather, only those permits where revisions were viewed as necessary because of the high number of safety vents and automatic waste feed cutoffs. 3.    We revised the report to reflect how EPA is addressing the use of automatic waste feed cutoffs in permits, namely, that EPA is placing controls over the use of waste feed cutoffs. 4.    We revised the report to reflect this information. 5.    We revised the report to include this information. 6.    We continue to believe that EPA did not fully implement the recommended research because the recommendation was intended to result in a determination of why waste feed cutoffs and stack vents were used and their impact. We agree that EPA conducted limited tests, but we believe that these initial tests were not sufficient and that limited resources have not allowed the agency to conduct follow-up research to determine the cause and impact of using waste feed cutoffs and stack vents. 7.    We revised the report to include this information. 8.    The report recognizes EPA\u2019s efforts to designate and train combustion experts in each region under the caption entitled EPA\u2019s Education of Compliance Officials. 9.    We revised the report to limit our discussion to EPA\u2019s actions taken after the task force\u2019s inspections. 10.    We revised the report to include this information. 11.    We revised the report to include this information. 12.    We revised the report to include this information. 13.    We revised the report to include this information. 14.    We revised the report to reflect EPA\u2019s concerns regarding operating conditions for using automatic waste feed cutoffs and stack vents. 15.    We revised the report to clarify this information. 16.    The report recognizes that the task force\u2019s recommendation was that EPA reopen permits, as necessary, to address the use of automatic waste feed cutoffs and stack vents. 17.    We have revised the report to show that EPA\u2019s approach is not to impose numerical limits on using waste feed cutoffs or vent stacks but to write permit operating conditions so that the facility must comply with operating conditions as long as waste is present in the unit. 18.    We revised the report to reflect EPA\u2019s priorities in fiscal year 1992. 19.    We revised the report to include this information. 20.    We revised the report to clarify that the use of automatic waste feed cutoffs is not in itself a violation. 21.    We revised the report to include this information. 22.    We have revised the report to reflect the activities of both EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and OSHA under the memorandum. We continue to believe that the memorandum was not as successful as intended on the basis of information stated in our report. 23.    We revised the report to include this information. 24.

We continue to believe that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not implemented the task force\u2019s recommendation to improve its coverage of inspections by including hazardous waste incinerators on OSHA\u2019s lists of programmed inspections. The task force\u2019s recommendation was intended to make sure that hazardous waste incineration facilities were targeted for programmed inspections. However, because of the manner in which OSHA targets high-risk industries for programmed inspections, no incinerators are inspected unless OSHA responds to a complaint, a referral, or an accident. We did not assess or evaluate what impact OSHA\u2019s policy for targeting and inspecting high-risk industries has on workers\u2019 health and safety and, as such, do not have a position on this policy. Nevertheless, the fact remains that OSHA\u2019s choice of actions did not result in the implementation of the task force\u2019s recommendation. The only inspections that were performed were in reaction to complaints or referrals. Programmed inspections are broad in scope and are separate from and above OSHA\u2019s inspections in response to complaints, referrals, and fatalities/catastrophes, which are more narrow in scope. 2.    We continue to believe that OSHA has not implemented the task force\u2019s recommendation that OSHA improve its inspection expertise. We have revised the report to point out that we recognize that OSHA does have a training program for its enforcement officials that includes hazardous waste, and while improvements have been made to this training program, none of these improvements were made as a result of the task force\u2019s recommendation. Our discussions with officials in OSHA\u2019s Training Institute and OSHA\u2019s Directorate of Policy and Office of Field Programs reveal that improvements in the training program were not a result of the task force\u2019s recommendation. 3.    While the 1990 memorandum of understanding between OSHA and the EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement may have the potential for enhancing OSHA\u2019s inspection expertise, this memorandum did not result in any such improvement because no joint OSHA-EPA inspections were conducted at incinerators following the task force\u2019s inspections. As discussed in the report, EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement did not have oversight responsibilities for regional or state compliance activities at hazardous waste incineration facilities. Also, this office did not provide information to EPA\u2019s compliance staff who were responsible for directing EPA\u2019s regional and state compliance activities. Because EPA did not direct EPA regions, the regions did not suggest that states coordinate with OSHA when inspecting combustion facilities, and because no joint inspections occurred after 1990 the memorandum was not fully carried out. Thus, improvements in OSHA\u2019s inspection expertise have yet to be demonstrated as a result of the task force\u2019s recommendation or this memorandum. 4.    We continue to believe that OSHA has no means to ensure that all hazardous waste facilities will have accredited worker training programs. It is the intent of OSHA\u2019s new training program standard that all employees working on-site and exposed to hazardous substances will receive OSHA\u2019s accredited training. However, as we pointed out, OSHA has no means of ensuring compliance, since (1) OSHA and the states have conducted few inspections at hazardous waste incineration facilities, (2) OSHA considers these facilities a low risk in relation to other industries, and (3) OSHA and the states would inspect these facilities only if they are randomly selected or in response to complaints, referrals, or accidents. Our recommendation that OSHA work with EPA to develop a means of ensuring that all hazardous waste facility employers submit their training programs and receive accreditation could provide OSHA with a more comprehensive means of determining compliance with OSHA\u2019s new accreditation requirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To review the status of implementing the task force report\u2019s recommendations, we obtained documentation on EPA\u2019s follow-up actions, education provided to industry, education provided to compliance officials, inspection coverage, research about certain operating equipment, and review of permits from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Enforcement and Permits and State Programs Divisions, Office of Research and Development, EPA, and from industry combustion experts.
