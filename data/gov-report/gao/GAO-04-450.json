Most ESRD patients receive regular hemodialysis treatments, a process that removes toxins from the blood, at a dialysis facility. A small percentage dialyzes-at home. From 1991 through 2001, the ESRD patient population more than doubled, from about 201,000 to 406,000. As the need for services grows, so do concerns about beneficiary access to and Medicare payment for dialysis services. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 directed GAO to study beneficiaries' access to dialysis services. In this report, GAO (1) assessed the supply of dialysis facilities and the services they provide, overall and relative to beneficiary residence, and (2) assessed the extent to which Medicare payments for dialysis services are adequate and the methodology is appropriate. In order to assess the supply of dialysis facilities, GAO used Facility Surveys collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and outpatient claims, the bills submitted to Medicare by providers of certain outpatient services from 1998 through 2001. To assess the adequacy of Medicare payment and the appropriateness of the payment methodology, GAO used 2001 Medicare cost reports and outpatient claims submitted by freestanding dialysis facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that from December 31, 1998, through December 31, 2001, the total number of dialysis facilities nationwide increased at about the same rate as the Medicare dialysis population, 16 and 15 percent, respectively, and the total number of stations (that is, treatment areas and equipment, including dialysis machines, needed to dialyze the patient) increased by over 24 percent, a rate greater than the growth in the Medicare dialysis population. The dialysis industry opened facilities in more counties across the country, although facilities were more likely to be available to beneficiaries in urban counties than in rural counties. In addition, while almost all facilities provided in-facility hemodialysis, fewer facilities provided home dialysis. GAO estimates that total payments to freestanding dialysis facilities exceeded providers' allowable costs by 3 percent in 2001. Although payments were higher than costs overall, payments did not meet costs for small facilities. In addition, composite rate payments, intended to cover the costs of dialysis services associated with a treatment, including nursing, supplies, social services, and certain laboratory tests, were 11 percent less than the costs of providing those services, while payments for separately billed drugs, drugs not included in the composite rate, exceeded the costs of those services by 16 percent. Because of this imbalance, providers have an incentive to maximize the use of profitable separately billed drugs to compensate for inadequate payments under the composite rate. CMS generally agreed with GAO's findings. The agency noted that it has been working to redesign the payment system since 2000. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to develop a report by October 1, 2005 detailing the elements and features necessary in the design and implementation of a broader payment system that includes separately billed drugs. MMA also requires the Secretary to conduct a 3-year demonstration project, beginning January 1, 2006, that uses a broader payment system incorporating patient characteristics identified in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare covers approximately 90 percent of all individuals who have end- stage renal disease (ESRD), the permanent loss of kidney function, and  treatment of the disease results in substantial costs to the Medicare  program. In 2001, Medicare spent an average of approximately $46,600 on  services for each beneficiary with ESRD, while the average per-beneficiary  spending across the entire Medicare population was about $6,200. ESRD- related expenditures have increased rapidly and are expected to continue  to increase. From 1991 through 2001, the number of individuals with ESRD  more than doubled, increasing from about 201,000 to 406,000. During the  same time, while total Medicare expenditures increased by 108 percent,  ESRD program expenditures increased by 166 percent, to almost   $15.4 billion in 2001. The ESRD population is projected to reach  approximately 650,000 by 2010.", "Although some receive kidney transplants, most individuals with ESRD  depend on regular treatments of dialysis, a process in which excess fluids  and wastes are removed from the blood. In 2001, about 90 percent of all  dialysis patients underwent hemodialysis, typically three times per week,  at one of almost 4,000 outpatient renal dialysis facilities nationwide. In  that same year, less than 1 percent of hemodialysis patients dialyzed at  home, and nearly all peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients dialyzed at home.  Nationwide, about 200 hemodialysis patients dialyze five to seven times  per week, known as daily hemodialysis, which is thought by some  clinicians to improve patient outcomes.", "Dialysis facilities furnish services to patients through one of two methods:  they provide hemodialysis and supplies and other support services in the  facility, or they provide equipment, supplies, and support services to  beneficiaries who dialyze at home. Regardless of whether a beneficiary  dialyzes at home or in a facility, Medicare pays the facility a fixed,  prospectively determined amount per treatment, known as the composite  rate, generally for up to three dialysis treatments per week. The composite  rate covers many commonly used services and items; certain other items,  including some drugs and supplies, are paid for separately. Medicare  adjusts the composite rate to account for variation in area wages;  however, there is no adjustment for length of treatment, treatment  method, or beneficiary condition. By paying facilities a fixed amount,  Medicare seeks to encourage them to operate efficiently, as facilities  retain the difference if their payments exceed their costs of providing  necessary services.", "The composite rate has not been regularly updated, and is less than $4  higher today than when it was implemented in 1983. Despite the lack of a  regular update, the dialysis industry has remained profitable over the years  by increasing productivity and efficiency. In recent reports, the Medicare  Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has found that overall facility  profits have steadily declined even though Medicare payments for  separately billed drugs have exceeded facility costs. MedPAC has also  found that the composite rate is covering progressively less of the costs of  composite rate services. Representatives of the dialysis industry have  stated that Medicare payments are inadequate overall, and that these low  payments are resulting in facility closures in certain geographic areas and  may eventually lead to decreased access for beneficiaries nationwide. In  2000, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and  Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) required the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a payment system that  includes clinical laboratory tests and drugs that are routinely used but  billed separately. With the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), the Secretary of  HHS was required to continue development of a broader payment system.", "BIPA directed us to examine Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to dialysis  services. As agreed with the committees of jurisdiction, we (1) assessed  the supply of dialysis facilities and the services they provide, both overall  and relative to beneficiary residence; (2) assessed the extent to which  Medicare payments for dialysis services are adequate and the payment  methodology is appropriate; and (3) reviewed whether increased use of  daily hemodialysis can improve patient care.", "In order to measure the supply of dialysis facilities, we used the 1998  through 2002 Facility Survey files, which include information on the  number of hemodialysis stations and the services provided at each  facility. These surveys are administered to all dialysis facilities, hospital- based and freestanding, by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency responsible for managing Medicare. To identify  beneficiaries on dialysis and their residence, we analyzed the 1998 through  2001 Medicare outpatient claims, the bills submitted by providers of  certain outpatient services to receive Medicare payment. These claims  were the most recent data available at the time of our analysis. We  assessed the reliability of the facility survey and claims data and found  them suitable for our purposes.", "To assess the adequacy of Medicare payment and the appropriateness of  the payment methodology, we analyzed Medicare freestanding dialysis  facility cost reports from 1998 through 2001 and Medicare outpatient  claims data from 2000 and 2001. We performed this analysis in aggregate  for all freestanding facilities and for different sizes of facilities, with size  defined using the total number of treatments provided at a facility. The  Medicare payment methodology is the same for freestanding and hospital- based dialysis facilities, but we did not analyze cost reports or claims for  hospital-based facilities because their reported costs are affected by  decisions in allocating costs between the hospital and the dialysis facility.  In 2001, about 84 percent of all dialysis facilities nationwide were  freestanding. We assessed the reliability of the cost report and claims data.  We excluded cost reports that had questionable data or that did not cover  at least 300 days. We found the remaining cost reports and the claims data  suitable for our purposes. We interviewed patient advocate organizations,  clinicians, manufacturers of dialysis equipment, and representatives of the  dialysis industry, and made site visits to three dialysis facilities.", "In order to review daily hemodialysis, we surveyed the relevant scientific  literature, interviewed physicians who provide daily hemodialysis, and  visited a dialysis facility providing daily hemodialysis.

In 2001, Medicare covered about 90 percent of the 406,000  individuals with the disease. ESRD occurs when an individual\u2019s kidneys  have regressed to less than 10 percent of normal baseline function.  Without functioning kidneys, excess wastes and fluids in the body rise to  dangerous levels, and certain hormones are no longer produced. The lack  of one such hormone, erythropoietin, results in anemia, a condition in  which an insufficient number of red blood cells are available to carry  oxygen throughout the body. Diabetes and hypertension are the two  principal causes of ESRD."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ESRD Population Growth", "paragraphs": ["The ESRD population has grown steadily over the years and is expected to  continue to increase. From 1991 through 2001, the total number of  individuals with ESRD increased from about 201,000 to 406,000, with an  average annual growth rate of 7 percent. While the growth rate declined to  about 5 percent in the late 1990s as a result of better preventive  treatments, experts believe this decline to be temporary. Increases in the  African-American and Hispanic populations, which have particularly high  rates of diabetes, are expected to overwhelm this trend and lead to even  greater growth rates in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Renal Dialysis Treatment", "paragraphs": ["In order to survive, individuals with ESRD require kidney transplantation  or dialysis, a process in which excess fluids and wastes are removed from  the blood. In 2001, about 292,000, or 72 percent, of all individuals with  ESRD underwent dialysis, while the remaining 28 percent, or about  114,000 individuals, were transplant recipients. Transplantation is not a  practical option for most individuals with ESRD because suitable donated  organs are scarce. Also, many individuals are older and less healthy by the  time they develop irreversible kidney failure, making them medically  unsuitable for transplant. From 1991 through 2001, the total number of  dialysis patients increased at an average annual growth rate of about 7  percent, the same as the ESRD population overall.", "In 2001, most dialysis patients received services from one of almost 4,000  hospital-based or freestanding dialysis facilities located in the 50 states  and the District of Columbia. These facilities provide hemodialysis, as well  as drugs and related clinical and support services for patients who dialyze  at home or in a facility. In addition, some facilities provide training for  home dialysis and may furnish the equipment and supplies necessary for  home dialysis treatment. In 1973, when Medicare benefits were extended  to individuals with ESRD, the majority of dialysis facilities were owned  and operated by hospitals. By 2001, however, almost 84 percent of all  dialysis facilities nationwide were freestanding. In addition, for-profit  dialysis facility chains have represented an increasing share of the market.  By 2001, the four largest for-profit chains accounted for about two-thirds  of all freestanding facilities, and they provided treatment to about two- thirds of all dialysis patients.", "Dialysis can be administered using two methods: hemodialysis and PD.  During hemodialysis, a dialysis machine pumps blood through an artificial  kidney, called a hemodialyzer, and returns the cleansed blood to the body.  Hemodialysis is usually administered three times a week at a dialysis  facility, although patients may choose to undergo hemodialysis at home  with the assistance of a caregiver. In-facility hemodialysis has become the  dominant treatment method since the introduction of dialysis in the 1960s.  In 2001, about 90 percent of all dialysis patients underwent in-facility  hemodialysis, and less than 1 percent underwent hemodialysis at home.", "In PD, the peritoneal membrane, which surrounds a patient\u2019s abdomen,  acts as a natural blood filter, thus eliminating the need for blood to leave  the body and filter through a machine. Patients remove the wastes and  excess fluids from their abdomen manually throughout the day, or a  machine automates the process while they sleep at night. Unlike  hemodialysis, these patients generally dialyze at home. PD became an  alternative to hemodialysis in the 1970s, and utilization peaked in the early  1990s, when more than 15 percent of all dialysis patients used this  treatment method. By 2001, however, utilization had declined to about 8  percent of the dialysis population.", "Hemodialysis performed five to seven times per week, referred to as \u201cdaily  hemodialysis,\u201d more closely approximates the body\u2019s continuous cleansing  of the blood than the conventional regimen of three hemodialysis  treatments per week. Between dialysis treatments, excess wastes and  fluids build up in the patient\u2019s blood, and many dialysis patients  experience side effects such as hypertension, anemia, and low energy  levels, which may adversely affect their clinical outcomes and quality of  life. Because of these side effects, dialysis patients have high rates of  hospitalization and often take several medications. Daily hemodialysis can  take place either at home or in a facility, and proponents have asserted  that it leads to improved quality of life, fewer hospitalizations, reduced use  of medications, and overall cost savings to Medicare."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Payment", "paragraphs": ["Since 1983, Medicare has paid dialysis facilities a composite rate for each  dialysis treatment it administers, generally up to a maximum of three  treatments per beneficiary per week. The composite rate is a prospectively  determined payment amount designed to cover the cost of services  associated with a single dialysis treatment, including nursing and other  clinical services, social services, supplies, equipment, and certain  laboratory tests and drugs. Because the composite rate is prospectively  determined, providers receive a fixed payment regardless of how much the  services actually cost them to deliver. The initial fixed payment amount  was derived from the median costs of providing medical services to  beneficiaries across a sample of dialysis facilities. A prospective payment  methodology encourages providers to control the costs and utilization of  the services they provide, as they retain any difference between the  payment and their costs.", "In 1972, 40 percent of all dialysis patients underwent hemodialysis at  home. In 1981, the Congress passed legislation establishing a new system  for the payment of outpatient dialysis services for Medicare beneficiaries.  The changes were designed to reduce program costs by encouraging home  dialysis rather than in-facility dialysis. Under the system, a single  prospectively determined rate was implemented for home and in-facility  dialysis. However, the percentage of patients who undergo dialysis at  home has declined since 1983, the year the composite rate was  implemented. In 1983, the proportion of dialysis patients dialyzing at  home, whether with hemodialysis or PD, was 12 percent. By December 31,  2001, less than 9 percent of dialysis patients dialyzed at home.", "The composite rate has changed minimally since 1983, when the rate  averaged about $131 for hospital-based facilities and $127 for freestanding  facilities. The Congress passed legislation that decreased the rate by $2 in  1986 and increased it in 1991, 2000, and 2001 to about $135 for hospital- based facilities and $131 for freestanding facilities. From its  implementation in 1983 through the end of 2003, the real dollar value of  the composite rate declined by about 65 percent. The dialysis industry  remained profitable under this relatively flat payment by increasing  efficiency and productivity. However, industry representatives state that  efficiency or productivity improvements can no longer make up for the  lack of payment increases. They also state that although the number of  dialysis facilities has been increasing throughout the last decade, declining  profits may reverse that trend and eventually lead to decreased access for  Medicare beneficiaries.", "While the composite rate was intended to pay for all services associated  with dialysis treatment, Medicare pays separately for certain drugs and  laboratory tests that have become routine treatments since 1983. These  drugs include, but are not limited to, epoetin (EPO), vitamin D, and iron.  Medicare\u2019s payment for EPO, a bioengineered protein that substitutes for  erythropoietin and is used to treat anemia, is statutorily set at $10 for  every 1,000 units administered; all other separately billed drugs are paid  at 95 percent of their average wholesale price (AWP). The Medicare  composite rate includes payment for 16 laboratory tests deemed to be  routine for dialysis patients. For any of the approximately 1,350 other  laboratory tests that beneficiaries may receive, payment is made under a  fee schedule to the clinical laboratory that performs the test.", "Although facilities are paid under a prospective payment system, CMS  requires them to complete annual cost reports that are consistent with  Medicare cost principles. These reports include cost information for  separately billed drugs as well as items paid through the composite rate.  Medicare cost principles were designed to ensure that Medicare pays for  the expenses related to medical care for beneficiaries, and that those costs  are reasonable and allowable. The agency periodically audits cost reports  to remove unreasonable and nonallowable costs and, in the past, has  calculated the difference between facility costs as reported on the cost  reports and their allowable costs, referred to as an audit adjustment. The  Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required the agency to audit dialysis facility  cost reports, beginning in 1996, at least once every 3 years.", "In recent years, the Congress has moved toward a broader payment  bundle for dialysis services. In 2000, BIPA required the Secretary of HHS  to develop a payment system that includes clinical laboratory tests and  drugs that are routinely used, but are currently billed separately from  dialysis treatment. BIPA also required the Secretary to submit a report  and recommendations on this system to the Congress. CMS issued the  report in 2003, concluding that currently available data appear sufficient to  expand the payment bundle to include those services. In December 2003,  MMA mandated that effective January 1, 2005, a payment system be  implemented combining the composite rate payment with the amount by  which payments for separately billed drugs exceed their acquisition costs.  Drugs that are currently paid separately will continue to be paid outside  this system. This system must adjust for certain beneficiary characteristics  and geographic differences in cost. In addition, the Secretary is required  to submit a report to the Congress by October 1, 2005, that details the  elements and features for the design and implementation of a bundled  payment system including certain drugs that are currently billed  separately.

In addition, composite rate payments for home dialysis  treatments far exceeded the costs of those services, but payments for  home dialysis training were well below the costs of those services.", "We estimate that from 1998 through 2001, composite rate payments were  well below the costs of composite rate services. During these years, the  unadjusted payment-to-cost ratio for composite rate services was below  1.00 and steadily decreased every year, falling from 0.94 to 0.89 (see table  2).", "Furthermore, the composite rate does not pay for all services routinely  provided during a dialysis session. While the composite rate was designed  to pay for services associated with a single dialysis session, certain items  or services introduced since the creation of the rate are paid separately.  We determined that three separately billed drugs, EPO, vitamin D, and  iron, and drug-related supplies were provided to most dialysis  beneficiaries and frequently accompanied hemodialysis treatments (see  table 3). For example, 98 percent of beneficiaries received EPO in 2001  and, on average, at every dialysis treatment.", "The composite rate also does not adjust for factors that may affect the  cost of providing dialysis services. Providers we interviewed told us that  certain beneficiaries require more services than others because of the  presence of conditions including diabetes, hypertension, vascular access  problems, and other physical impairments. They stated that care for these  beneficiaries may be more costly due to additional staff time, additional  resources, or more frequent dialysis. There is currently no adjustment to  the composite rate to account for variation in the costs of providing  services to beneficiaries who consume more resources than average.", "While composite rate payments were well below costs, we estimate that  payments for separately billed drugs far exceeded the costs of those drugs  in 2001, with an unadjusted payment-to-cost ratio of 1.16. Because  utilization of separately billed drugs is largely unconstrained and because  payments for these items exceeded costs, providers have an incentive to  overutilize them. Representatives from one of the largest chain providers  and several nephrologists we interviewed reported that this incentive to  overutilize exists because separately billed drug payments compensate for  losses on composite rate services. However, several nephrologists and  researchers we interviewed also reported that beneficiaries who undergo  PD, or who otherwise dialyze more frequently than three times per week,  have a reduced need for separately billed drugs.", "In addition to the imbalance in payment between composite rate services  and separately billed drugs, an imbalance exists between payments for  home dialysis treatments and home dialysis training. Two industry  representatives and representatives of a patient advocacy organization we  interviewed stated that Medicare payments for home dialysis training do  not cover the costs of the service. We found that in 2001, the unadjusted  payment-to-cost ratio for composite rate payments for home dialysis  treatments was 1.11 and for home dialysis treatments and training  combined was 1.04. The unadjusted payment-to-cost ratio for composite  rate payments for home dialysis training alone was 0.38, indicating that  payments were well below costs. A perception that facilities are losing  money on the initial home dialysis training, even though payments are  above costs for the training and treatment combined, may serve as a  disincentive to offering the home dialysis treatment method."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Daily Hemodialysis Appears Promising, but Rigorous Data Are Lacking", "paragraphs": ["Daily hemodialysis, which is performed five to seven times per week, may  improve patients\u2019 clinical outcomes and quality of life because it more  closely approximates the body\u2019s continuous cleansing of the blood. The  literature indicates that daily hemodialysis patients have a greater amount  of toxin removed from their bodies, or a more adequate dialysis dosage,  than conventional hemodialysis patients. Dialysis dosage is important  because research suggests that inadequate dosage correlates with  increased mortality. In addition, studies report that anemia and  malnutrition, two serious conditions associated with increased morbidity  and mortality, improve with daily hemodialysis, as does patient quality of  life. For example, patients on daily hemodialysis experience less fatigue  and enjoy a wider range of dietary choices. Studies also report that  patients on daily hemodialysis have a reduced need for medication,  including EPO and drugs to control blood pressure, and a reduced  number of hospitalizations.", "Although studies on daily hemodialysis report improvements in patient  outcomes, these studies are limited in size and scope. The daily  hemodialysis patient base is extremely small, given that few dialysis  facilities provide the treatment, and those that do have few patients using  it. Although no national data exist on the utilization of daily hemodialysis,  nephrologists we spoke with who provide daily hemodialysis estimate that  approximately 200 patients are undergoing the treatment nationwide.  Published studies are principally nonrandomized and have small sample  sizes, typically fewer than 25 patients, and therefore do not provide  definitive evidence supporting the treatment. Specifically, studies do not  evaluate whether observed improvements in mortality can be attributed to  the treatment itself or to some other factor. To definitively assess the  treatment, more rigorous data are needed.", "Dialyzing more frequently has drawbacks. Although patients may  experience better outcomes, daily hemodialysis increases the number of  times a patient connects to the hemodialysis machine, and may increase  transportation costs if a patient chooses to dialyze at a facility rather than  at home. Such increased burdens may outweigh the benefits for a  significant number of patients. Even so, providers and nephrologists we  interviewed estimated that anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of the dialysis  population would choose to undergo daily hemodialysis.", "Several studies, each of which evaluated the costs of one to two facilities,  have found that facility costs increase upon implementation of daily  hemodialysis. Industry representatives reported that despite the possible  benefits of daily hemodialysis, it is not currently financially feasible to  offer it to a large number of Medicare beneficiaries because Medicare does  not routinely pay for more than three dialysis treatments per week.  However, if beneficiaries who undergo daily hemodialysis have a reduced  need for other Medicare services, such as drugs and inpatient stays, the  Medicare program may realize overall cost savings.", "Research currently being conducted by the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) may provide more rigorous data on daily hemodialysis, although it  will not determine whether there is an overall cost savings to Medicare.  With partial funding from CMS, NIH has funded four centers to test  whether it is feasible to randomize a representative sample of patients into  either conventional or daily hemodialysis. The trials will track a number of  patient outcomes for at least 6 months, including anemia, nutritional  status, blood pressure, medication use, and hospitalizations, but they are  not designed to enroll enough patients to conclusively determine whether  differences in mortality or hospitalizations are significant. Trial results,  which will not be available until 2007, will determine whether NIH should  continue with a large-scale trial that would measure the impact of more  frequent dialysis on mortality or cardiovascular outcomes or both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["From December 31, 1998, through December 31, 2001, beneficiary access  to dialysis facilities and services appeared stable.

Over the  same period of time, the number of counties with at least one facility  increased.", "On average, Medicare payments to freestanding dialysis facilities for  composite rate and separately billed services combined exceeded  providers\u2019 estimated allowable costs by 3 percent in 2001. However,  composite rate payments were well below the costs of composite rate  services, and separately billed drug payments far exceeded the costs of  separately billed drugs. The current payment methodology gives providers  an incentive to overutilize separately billed drugs in order to compensate  for losses on composite rate services and does not account for possible  cost differences in treating beneficiaries. A payment methodology that  bundled the services a facility provides into a prospective payment  amount would encourage providers to control the costs and utilization of  these items, as they retain the difference if their payments exceed their  costs of providing necessary services. A system that is based on allowable  costs and accounts for possible cost differences in treating beneficiaries  would ensure that Medicare pays appropriately for the efficient delivery of  services.", "As required by law, CMS is currently designing a bundled prospective  payment system.

RPA specifically was concerned that facilities may try  to maximize their numbers of private-pay patients and minimize their  numbers of Medicare beneficiaries in the future. Three external reviewers  asserted that access is currently decreasing due to staffing shortages at  available facilities, particularly with respect to nurses.

DCI stated that  facility costs have risen since 2001; therefore, our analysis does not reflect  current conditions.

Two industry representatives, DCI and RLC, acknowledged  that an incentive exists to overutilize separately billed drugs in order to  compensate for losses on composite rate services, and the physician  association, RPA, acknowledged that there is excessive use of these drugs.  However, another industry group, NRAA, stated that our assertion that an  incentive to overutilize exists was extreme. In addition, four external  reviewers were concerned that bundling costs would create an incentive  for facilities to either underserve beneficiaries or to accept only those  beneficiaries who use relatively few resources.

Although CMS is currently auditing the 2001 cost reports, the agency\u2019s last  completed audit was of the 1996 cost reports. Given the increase in health  care costs over time, we did not believe it was appropriate to assess the  adequacy of Medicare payment using only 1996 cost reports. In order to  satisfy the requirements of our mandate, we estimated the percentage of  costs on the unaudited 2001 cost reports that were Medicare allowable. To  do so, we relied on an audit adjustment calculated by MedPAC. MedPAC\u2019s  adjustment was based on the 1996 cost reports and was lower than the  previous two audit adjustments calculated by HCFA in 1988 and 1991. We  believe it is appropriate to apply MedPAC\u2019s 1996 audit adjustment to 2001  costs because it is the most recent of the last three audit adjustments.

We  conducted site visits at three dialysis facilities, one of which provides daily  hemodialysis, and interviewed officials at these facilities.", "To analyze the supply of freestanding and hospital-based dialysis facilities,  we used the Facility Survey files from 1998 through 2002, and to identify  ESRD beneficiaries on dialysis, we used Medicare outpatient claims from  1998 through 2001, the most recent years for which data were available at  the time of our analysis. From the Facility Survey files, we identified all  dialysis facilities operating the entire year, opening during the year, and  closing during the year, and the number of stations at each facility. We  identified a facility as offering a treatment method if it provided at least  one treatment or had at least one patient using that method. From the  Medicare outpatient claims, we identified Medicare ESRD beneficiaries  receiving dialysis each year, and their residence by ZIP code. We then  calculated the number of dialysis facilities operating the entire year and  the number of beneficiaries receiving dialysis for each county in the 50  states and in the District of Columbia, which we considered a county. We  determined the average number of facilities and stations in each county,  weighted by the number of beneficiaries in each county. We defined a  county as urban if it was in a metropolitan statistical area and as rural if it  was outside a metropolitan statistical area, as determined by the Office of  Management and Budget.

The Medicare payment  methodology is the same for freestanding and hospital-based dialysis  facilities, but we did not analyze cost reports or claims for hospital-based  facilities because their reported costs are affected by decisions in  allocating costs between the hospital and the dialysis facility. In 2001,  about 84 percent of all dialysis facilities nationwide were freestanding. We  first edited the cost reports to exclude those facilities located outside the  50 states or the District of Columbia, those with cost reporting periods less  than 300 days, and those that reported composite rates outside the range  of possible rates from the Medicare program. We excluded 577 of the 2,983  cost reports, or about 19 percent. From the remaining cost reports, we  calculated each provider\u2019s total Medicare payments and total reported  costs. We calculated the proportion of total cost attributable to Medicare  beneficiaries using the proportion of each facility\u2019s treatments that was  furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. We summed payments and costs  across all providers to obtain payment-to-cost ratios from 1998 through  2001 weighted by total Medicare payments received by each facility.  Additionally, we stratified ratios by dialysis treatment method, as reported  in the cost reports. We assessed the reliability of the cost report data by  comparing our payment-to-cost ratios to those published by the Medicare  Payment Advisory Commission. We determined that the data were reliable  for our purposes.", "In order to calculate 2001 payment-to-cost ratios for overall costs, that is,  composite rate services and separately billed drugs, we used 2001 cost  reports for freestanding renal dialysis facilities and 2000 and 2001  Medicare outpatient claims data. We first edited the cost reports to  exclude those facilities located outside the 50 states or the District of  Columbia, those with cost reporting periods fewer than 300 days, and  those that reported composite rates outside the range of possible rates  from the Medicare program. Payment information for individual drugs is  not available on Medicare outpatient claims prior to July 1, 2000, and  therefore we did not calculate these ratios for years prior to 2001. We  used the claims data to obtain payments for separately billed drugs, as  they are not available in the cost reports. We obtained the total costs of  separately billed drugs from the cost reports and calculated the proportion  attributable to Medicare beneficiaries using the proportion of each  facility\u2019s treatments that was furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. We then  added our previously calculated composite rate payments and costs and  summed total payments and total costs for all providers to obtain an  overall payment-to-cost ratio for 2001 weighted by total Medicare  payments received by each facility. We stratified the ratios by size. We  defined the size of the facility based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of  total dialysis treatments each facility reported in its cost report. Small  facilities are those reporting a number of dialysis treatments less than the  25th percentile, medium facilities are those reporting a number of dialysis  treatments greater than or equal to the 25th percentile and less than or  equal to the 75th percentile, and large facilities are those reporting a  number of treatments greater than the 75th percentile. We could not  calculate these ratios by treatment method, as separately billed drug costs  are not reported by treatment method on the cost report.", "In order to identify separately billed items or services frequently billed in  association with in-facility hemodialysis, we used 2001 Medicare  outpatient claims data. We limited our claims population to those that  reported only in-facility hemodialysis and no other treatment method. We  defined \u201cfrequently billed\u201d as those separately billed services that were  billed over 100,000 times annually. We excluded laboratory services  because these are typically billed directly to Medicare by the laboratory,  not by the dialysis facility. Medicare instructs providers to record each  drug administration on the claim separately, and accordingly, we defined  one administration of a drug as one record on the claim. It is possible,  however, that some providers aggregate the units of several  administrations. To the extent this is the case, the billing frequencies for  these specific drugs likely underestimate the actual administration  frequencies.", "To review cost and clinical data on daily hemodialysis, we examined 25  articles obtained through a MEDLINE literature search for studies on daily  hemodialysis published from 1998 through 2002.
