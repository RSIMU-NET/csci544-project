When a patient needs a transplant of donated stem cells  and no genetically compatible related (family) donor is available, the  National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (Registry) may help the patient  search for compatible stem cells from unrelated donors. Founded in 1986,  the Registry is the largest and most diverse list of potential donors in the  world. This list currently includes more than 4 million donors. The  Registry is operated by the nonprofit National Marrow Donor Program  (NMDP) under contract to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), with  additional support from the U.S. Navy. NMDP coordinates stem cell  transplants through its network of more than 400 participating  organizations, domestic and foreign, involved in transplantation, including  donor centers, which recruit and manage donors; laboratories; blood  sample repositories; bone marrow collection centers; and transplant  centers. NMDP has facilitated more than 14,000 transplants since 1987.", "Concerns about the Registry have been raised by the HHS Office of the  Inspector General (OIG) and in our own work. These include the extent to  which the Registry provides equality of opportunity for patients of all  racial and ethnic groups to find compatible (matched) unrelated donors,  the extent to which it is utilized by those in need of stem cell  transplantation, and the effectiveness of the management of the donor  centers. We reported in 1992 that the proportions of African American and  Hispanic donors on the Registry were less than their proportions in the  U.S. population. This imbalance results in a decreased likelihood of an  individual from a minority group finding a match and eventually receiving  a transplant because matches are more likely to be found from among  donors of one\u2019s own group. In an effort to address these concerns, a 1996  OIG report recommended that HRSA and NMDP reexamine the method  used to finance the donor centers that recruit volunteers to join the  Registry. It recommended a performance-based method to pay donor  centers for specific activities including monetary incentives tied to  performance indicators and emphasizing recruitment and retention of  donors, especially those from racial and ethnic minority groups.", "The National Bone Marrow Registry Reauthorization Act of 1998 required,  among other things, that the Registry carry out a donor recruitment  program giving priority to minority and underrepresented donor  populations, ensure efficiency of operations, and verify compliance with  standards by organizations that participate in the Registry. In addition, the  act required that we conduct a study of the Registry, including an  examination of the extent to which it has increased representation of  racial and ethnic minority groups so that a member of such a group has a  probability of finding a match comparable to that of a person who is not a  member of such a group. In conducting this study, we addressed the  following questions: (1) To what extent have the program\u2019s recruitment  efforts increased the enrollment of donors, including those from racial and  ethnic minority groups, since the 1998 act took effect, and has the chance  of finding a suitable match increased? (2) To what extent is the Registry  utilized to search for and obtain transplants? (3) Are the donor centers and  other organizations in the NMDP network complying with its standards  and procedures?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed NMDP data on racial and ethnic  representation on the Registry from 1998 through 2001 and, to provide a  broader context for examining these changes, also analyzed data on racial  and ethnic representation in relation to the patients who searched the  Registry from 1988 through 2001. In addition, we analyzed data provided  by the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) on  transplants from related donors from 1997 through 2000, which enabled us  to estimate the demand for unrelated donor transplants in the United  States and relate this estimate to Registry utilization by patients searching  for donors during this period; analyzed NMDP data on matches, canceled  searches, and transplants obtained for patients needing donors during this  period; reviewed NMDP\u2019s standards for participating in the Registry; and  reviewed evidence of compliance with the standards and procedures by  the organizations that participate. We also interviewed officials of NMDP;  HRSA; the Department of the Navy; the American Red Cross; and selected  donor, stem cell collection, and transplant centers. We did not  independently verify the accuracy of the data provided by NMDP.

These diseases  include several forms of cancer as well as certain nonmalignant diseases.  They strike all races, although one racial group or another may have a  higher incidence rate for a particular disease. Not all patients with  diseases that may be cured by stem cell transplants necessarily pursue  them. Depending on a number of donor and patient characteristics, from  about 10 to 50 percent of patients are alive 5 years after transplants. The  patients who do not survive may succumb either to their diseases or to the  consequences of transplantation. Because of these low survival rates,  some patients and physicians may be reluctant to select this stressful  treatment under most or all circumstances. For most of the diseases  involved, other therapies are available that may be less invasive, carry  lower risk, or be the medically preferred initial treatment. Nevertheless,  some of these diseases are best treated by stem cell transplantation, either  initially or after other treatments have failed.", "Prior to stem cell transplantation, the patient\u2019s bone marrow and,  consequently, immune system are destroyed with radiation or  chemotherapy. The patient\u2019s bloodstream is then infused with healthy  stem cells from a donor. Healthy stem cells can be therapeutic because  they can develop into all the components of blood, including those needed  to replace the patient\u2019s immune system. In an \u201cautologous\u201d transplant,  these cells come from the patient\u2019s own marrow. In a \u201csyngeneic\u201d  transplant, the cells come from an identical twin.

In 2001, 1,215 of the transplants facilitated by NMDP (70 percent) involved  marrow, 42 (2 percent) involved cord blood, and 491 (28 percent) involved  PBSC. Umbilical cord blood is collected from the placenta and umbilical  cord of a newborn and then preserved in a cord blood bank until needed  by a matched patient. The number of stem cells typically obtained from  cord blood is relatively small but is often adequate for pediatric patients.  For transplantation from cord blood, the blood is volunteered when the  blood is banked, not when it is used. The Registry began an umbilical cord  blood stem cell program in 1998. Stem cells from peripheral blood may be  obtained in numbers sufficient for transplantation when the donor is  treated with a drug that causes the cells to leave the marrow and enter the  bloodstream where they can be extracted using a process where the stems  cells are removed and the remaining components of the blood are returned  to the donor. A donor, matched to a patient, may be asked to donate either  bone marrow or PBSC, depending on the preference of the patient\u2019s  physician.

Each person has three  primary pairs (one set of three from each parent) of these antigens that  play a major role in the compatibility of a transplant. A matched donor is  defined as one for whom each of these six antigens has the same kind of  HLA. If a matched donor cannot be found, then a donor with certain types  of mismatch may be used, depending on the transplant center\u2019s  preferences, although usually with poorer results. In general, the more  closely related two people are, the more likely it is that their HLA will  match. At one extreme, identical twins always match, and, in fact, match  on all antigens, not just the six ordinarily focused upon. At the other  extreme, members of separate racial groups are relatively unlikely to  match one another. Full siblings can provide a six out of six match,  resulting in what is called an \u201cHLA-identical sibling transplant,\u201d but only  about 30 to 40 percent of patients can be expected to have a matched  sibling donor. As a result, unrelated donors with matched HLA are sought  from the registries in which their HLA type has been recorded.", "The definition of a match has been refined over time as scientific  understanding of HLA increases. HLA are being typed more precisely, so  more types of HLA can now be distinguished. Thus, some of today\u2019s  matches may be judged as mismatches in the future because better  matches are possible. This increasing refinement does not mean, however,  that finding a suitable match for transplantation is inevitably becoming  more difficult. Some kinds of mismatch may be less dangerous than  others. As a result, as research continues, there may be fewer matches by  today\u2019s standards, but relatively harmless mismatches will be recognized  as such and used. Further, there is evidence that cord blood may not  require as exact an HLA match as is usually sought."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The NMDP Network", "paragraphs": ["In support of the Registry, NMDP manages a worldwide network  consisting of more than 400 donor centers, recruitment groups, contract  laboratories where tissue is typed, apheresis centers, cord blood banks,  collection centers where marrow is harvested, blood sample repositories,  and transplant centers. More than half of these organizations are donor  (91) or transplant centers (149). The relationship of these network  components to NMDP varies. Some, such as the recruitment groups, were  designed to be parts of the network and work with NMDP, whereas others,  such as the transplant centers, exist separately from the network and  function independently of NMDP except where specified by contract.", "The NMDP network includes donor centers and other organizations in  foreign countries. The foreign donor centers merge their files with the  Registry, contributing more than one million donors. These centers are  required to comply with NMDP policies, program standards, and other  criteria, although fees for recruiting donors and other financial incentives  and payments that go to U.S. centers are not paid to foreign centers.  NMDP has also signed cooperative agreements with national registries in  13 foreign countries. Although certain data on donors recruited into these  registries are not entered into the Registry\u2019s computer system, these  foreign registries will search their donor files on behalf of a U.S. patient  searching the Registry. In addition, 6 foreign apheresis centers, 18 foreign  bone marrow collection centers, and 36 foreign transplant centers are  affiliated with the Registry. NMDP\u2019s affiliations with foreign donor and  transplant centers result in its facilitation of both foreign-to-U.S. and U.S.- to-foreign donations.", "The existence of these international affiliations with the Registry does not  prevent U.S. transplant centers from obtaining stem cells through foreign  registries directly, that is, without going through Registry channels. Even  domestically, the Registry is not a monopoly; other U.S. registries also  maintain lists of donors, conduct searches for stem cells, or perform both  of these functions.

The  Registry\u2019s donor centers and recruitment groups recruit donors, who are  then managed by the donor centers. The Registry pays these centers and  groups for signing up donors. In view of the past underrepresentation of  minorities in the Registry, NMDP has initiated several recruitment efforts  to increase its racial and ethnic diversity. For example, it provides free or  low-cost minority-specific educational materials to donor centers and  recruitment groups. Probably the most important aspects of managing  donors are to maintain their commitment to donation so that they are  locatable and willing to donate when their stem cells are requested, to  keep records of how to contact them, and to drop from the list any  individuals who are too old or no longer able or willing to donate.", "A patient\u2019s first contact with the Registry occurs when his or her physician  or a transplant center conducts a free, preliminary search of the Registry  for stem cell donors and cord blood units. The preliminary search, which  takes about 24 hours, produces a list of donors and cord blood units that  are potentially suitable for that patient. However, many patients for whom  such searches are conducted are not necessarily good candidates for stem  cell transplants. For example, some searches may be conducted for  patients who are too sick for transplantation or who are good candidates  for less invasive therapies.", "If the physician and patient decide to continue a search for an unrelated  donor (or unrelated cord blood) on the Registry, then more information  about the matching stem cells is required and a formal search is begun.  Only a physician affiliated with a transplant center in the NMDP network  may conduct a formal search of the Registry. The Registry bills the  transplant center a one-time activation fee of $600. It also bills the center  for the cost of the four or five testing components of the search process,  each of which costs more than $100. Since several donors may have to be  tested before one is selected for the patient, these component charges may  be made repeatedly, resulting in a search costing thousands of dollars to  the transplant center, and more to the patient when the center adds its  markups. Relatively few insurance plans pay for searches; however, plans  often pay for the actual transplantation including the procurement of stem  cells. The details of the formal search and the subsequent steps in the  process possibly leading to transplantation depend on the additional  information needed; the results of laboratory tests; and the kind of stem  cells sought, whether stored blood from an umbilical cord or blood or  marrow from a living donor.", "If a suitable donor or suitable cord blood unit is found, and if other  requirements in the process toward transplantation are fulfilled, then  either (1) the marrow is harvested from the donor at a collection center,  (2) PBSC are collected from the donor at an apheresis center, or (3) the  cord blood is shipped from a cord blood bank. The stem cells are  transported to the transplant center, often by courier. The final step is the  infusing of the patient\u2019s bloodstream with the selected marrow, PBSC, or  cord blood. The entire process\u2014from the initiation of the formal search to  the transplant (infusion)\u2014typically requires many months and sometimes  more than 1 year. However, some patients cannot wait this long for  transplants because their medical conditions are deteriorating.", "During the search process, NMDP offers patient advocacy services  through two channels. Its Office of Patient Advocacy (OPA) provides  several services, including education, support, case management  intervention, financial assistance, and special advocacy projects. For  example, OPA publishes the Transplant Center Access Directory, a  patient guide listing all transplant centers in the NMDP network. The  directory describes each center\u2019s HLA matching criteria and lists the  diseases each typically treats with unrelated donor marrow transplants.  The directory also provides information on comparable search charges  and risk-adjusted patient survival data. In addition to the services provided  through OPA, NMDP requires that each transplant center have a patient  advocate on staff.

Other donor centers received payments from NMDP  for specified activities, such as donor recruitment and donor search  activities.

It reflects inclusion in the Registry of the most common genetic  types over the period when the Registry was small and new, and  recruitment efforts were beginning.

Any patient is more likely to find a match in  his or her own racial and ethnic group than in another group, so patient  matching rates depend, to some extent, on the number of people in the  patient\u2019s group on the Registry. All minorities are at a disadvantage for this  reason. Further, some minority groups, such as African Americans, are  known to have more rare and more varied HLA combinations than do  Caucasians. The likelihood of finding a match from among a group of  racially or ethnically defined donors declines with the rarity and number  of possible genetic types found among the members of that group.", "In addition to these factors related to finding a match, there are other  factors that may contribute to differences in access to a transplant. Some  of these depend on the characteristics of those who volunteer for the  Registry. For example, donors from different groups may differ in their  tendency to be available (locatable, willing, and physically able) when  called upon to actually donate. Other possible factors involve the  attitudes, health, medical care, resources, and preferences of the patients.  Patients of different groups may differ in their tendency to engage the  health care system at all, to seek help early enough in their illnesses, or to  search the Registry as opposed to pursuing other options. It may be  possible to effect changes in these factors, thereby moving closer to the  goal of equal opportunity for all racial and ethnic groups.", "However, not only is the goal of equal access to transplants for all groups  difficult to attain, but it also may conflict with the statutory goal of  maximizing the number of patients who find a match and thereby  maximizing the number of transplants facilitated.

Large numbers of donors must be recruited and retained in the Registry in  order to identify and add each rare genetic type to the donor pool, so the  cost of recruiting such donors\uf8e7the incremental cost of adding these rare  genetic types to the donor pool\uf8e7is large.

Outside providers may need to be used when the physician sees  cord blood as a viable alternative source to bone marrow or PBSC because  some cord blood banks do not list their cord blood units with NMDP.", "Search and procurement costs can also be a factor. Administrators of  transplant centers that have done non-NMDP-affiliated transplants told us  that other registries charge less for searches than NMDP does. For  example, we were told that only a few other registries worldwide charge a  search activation fee in addition to their charges for the specific medical  procedures needed to confirm that a particular donor is healthy and  matched to the patient. In addition, the cost of stem cell procurement at  NMDP tends to be higher. One transplant center director told us that the  center pays about $13,000 for stem cells obtained directly from overseas  registries and about $21,000 for NMDP stem cells. However, even when  NMDP is not paid for a formal search or for stem cells, it may still have  been utilized. An official at NMDP informed us that it is possible for a  transplant center to determine the NMDP-affiliated registry at which a  foreign (but not domestic) potential match is registered on the basis of a  preliminary search and to contact the foreign registry directly to obtain the  stem cells. Moreover, that official stated that some transplant centers may  do this regularly. Thus, although NMDP may not be recorded as having  facilitated the transplants that result, its role in helping to locate donors in  such cases means that its utilization is somewhat greater than the record  suggests.", "Timeliness can be another factor. A few center administrators mentioned  that NMDP takes longer to provide stem cells than do other registries. For  example, one administrator told us that the time it takes to obtain a donor  sample for testing at the transplant center\u2014an important component of  the overall search process\u2014can be a week longer for NMDP than for a  foreign registry, depending on whether NMDP judges the search to be  urgent. Waiting this additional week can be frustrating for those at the  transplant center who are anxious to determine whether they have a  confirmed match or will have to continue searching. Another director told  us that stem cells from non-NMDP providers are more likely to be received  by the date the transplant center requests them than are stem cells from  NMDP. NMDP has attempted to shorten its time from formal search  initiation to transplant and reports that its median time has decreased  from 4.8 months from 1992 through 1993 to 3.7 months in 2000.

NMDP staff members  review the organization of the program (such as its support and staffing  structure), recruitment activities (such as performance against goals and  donor drive compliance), donor management activities (such as  management of patient-related donor search requests, confidentiality  procedures, and records management), and billing and reimbursement to  determine adherence to NMDP\u2019s standards and procedures.

During these visits, NMDP staff members may also review other activities,  such as the signing of patient consent forms. The site visits are scheduled  for each transplant center every 4 years. NMDP plans to issue its first  annual report on the results of the first cycle of site visits in September  2002.", "NMDP monitors the operations and performance of its centers through the  CPI program. The program includes nine goals to increase the efficiency of  key activities in the search and donation process and measures  performance against these goals. For example, at donor centers, NMDP  measures the timeliness of registering new donors, resolving search- related requests, and processing requests for HLA blood typing. At  transplant centers, NMDP measures the time it takes to resolve and report  confirmatory testing results. NMDP also monitors post-transplant data  submission through CPI. These outcome data are used in research studies  to analyze outcomes for donors and patients. NMDP also monitors the  accuracy and timeliness with which donor and transplant centers submit  donor and patient blood samples to NMDP\u2019s research repository. NMDP  provides regular feedback to donor and transplant centers concerning  their performance on CPI measures. For example, each center receives a  monthly report summarizing the results of its activities, along with those  of all other centers, in the previous month. The reports allow centers to  analyze how consistently they perform and to compare their results to  those of other centers in the network. NMDP also conducts a year-end  analysis to provide feedback to centers.", "Through its CPI program, NMDP monitors whether organizations in its  network meet goals for timeliness and may recommend corrective actions  for centers that do not meet these goals. A year-end analysis of the CPI  program shows that during 2001 almost half (44 of 91) of donor centers  met all nine CPI goals for the search process. In addition, 20 more donor  centers met eight of nine goals, and 9 others met seven of nine goals.  According to NMDP, the remaining 18 donor centers (20 percent) that met  six or fewer goals were the focus of technical assistance to improve their  performance. Our analysis shows that 5 of the 91 donor centers (5  percent) were placed on review or probation for failing to meet CPI goals  in 2001.", "Our analysis also shows that NMDP placed 18 of the 129 transplant centers  (14 percent) on probation. Eight of these were placed on probation for  failure to meet CPI goals for the search process, seven for failure to meet  CPI measures concerned with timely submission of recipient follow-up  information, and three for problems related to the accuracy and timeliness  of submissions of donor and patient research blood samples.", "NMDP supplements these activities with incident reports, which are  written accounts of deviations from policies and standards that are  categorized by the nature of a deviation and include, but are not limited to,  categories such as confidentiality concerns, customer service, and product  transport. NMDP uses incident reports to track deviations from its  standards by recording the specifics of incidents. NMDP staff members  follow up and investigate incidents. In addition, an NMDP committee  reviews a summary report of incidents twice a year to identify developing  trends that may affect an individual center or the entire network. Since  NMDP reviews center participation annually, the committee may follow up  on deviations from NMDP\u2019s standards or take action such as probation,  suspension, or termination during the reapplication process. We reviewed  a summary of incidents categorized by type of problem and the corrective  actions taken to resolve them. For example, one incident involved an  operating room staff member administering less appropriate blood, rather  than the donor\u2019s own blood, which was available for that purpose, during a  marrow harvest.

NMDP pays donor centers a fee for each activity to  recruit donors for the Registry, such as signing up donors, typing their  tissues, maintaining their files, and other activities related to confirming  that the donors identified as potential matches for a searching patient  actually match and are medically cleared for donation. NMDP pays each  donor center a recruitment fee of $28 and $10 for every minority and  Caucasian donor, respectively, recruited up to the number specified in its  recruitment goal. NMDP establishes annual recruitment goals for each  donor center based on the demographics of the local population. When  donors are recruited, the donor centers that do not register a specific  percentage of the new donors within a certain period incur financial  penalties. For example, the CPI goal for registering new donors is to  register at least 85 percent of them within 35 days of the date on which  they volunteer. NMDP would reduce the total recruitment fee it pays to  donor centers that register less than 85 percent of new donors within this  time frame.

However, HRSA noted that the Registry consists of two distinct groups of  donors, those who are fully HLA typed and those who are less than fully  typed. Since the vast majority of actual donors are selected from the fully  typed portion, minority racial and ethnic groups therefore make up a  larger proportion of the Registry than their representation in the U.S.  population. We have noted in the report that, because of this, access for  minorities may be somewhat better than might be assumed by looking at  the Registry as a whole.", "With regard to underutilization of the Registry, HRSA agreed that many  patients who could benefit from unrelated donor transplants never consult  the Registry or do so too late in the course of their illnesses.

Subtracting the  individual who is in need of a transplant gives n = 0.7925 as the number of  siblings available to be transplant donors. The likelihood of a match  between two siblings is 25 percent because each child inherits one-half of  each parent\u2019s HLA genes, resulting in a one out of four chance of having  the same HLA genes as a sibling has. Therefore, the probability that no  sibling HLA identically matches the one in need is P = (0.75) . For a  Caucasian patient, P = (0.75)0.7925 = 0.796134.", "The number of patients in need of unrelated stem cell transplants is equal  to the number of sibling donor transplants multiplied by P/(1 \u2212 P).", "Therefore, for every HLA-identical sibling transplant recorded for a  Caucasian patient, there will be 0.796134/(1 \u2212 0.796134) = 3.90518 patients  in need of unrelated donor transplants. Because there were 7,920 sibling  transplants performed for Caucasian patients from 1997 through 2000, we  estimate that 3.90518(7,920) = 30,929 Caucasian patients were in need of  stem cell transplants during that period. The estimates for other racial and  ethnic groups are presented in table 2. Because minorities generally have  less access to health care and may therefore have less access to sibling  transplants specifically, these estimates were obtained by assuming that  each minority group\u2019s need for unrelated donor transplants is proportional  to the Caucasian group\u2019s need. The estimates were obtained by multiplying  the number of persons in the minority group by the proportion of  Caucasians in need of unrelated donor transplants. This approach  implicitly assumes that differences across groups in fertility rates are of  negligible importance in computing the numbers of patients in need of  unrelated donor transplants.", "An alternative approach assumes that minorities and Caucasians have  equal access to HLA-identical sibling transplants. Based on this  assumption, this approach derives the needs of minorities for unrelated  donor transplants directly from their observed numbers of HLA-identical  sibling transplants. In doing so, it allows for the possibility that each group  has its own disease incidence rates and that the differences among groups  in their relative levels of sibling donations reflect these rates, not  differences in access.
