Mechanisms need to be tailored to specific situations since there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" solution. Collectively, five key strategies appear to facilitate the effective design and implementation of performance accountability mechanisms. They are as follows: 1. ensure mechanisms are of sufficient value to motivate desired behaviors, 2. periodically renegotiate and revise mechanisms and measures, 3. ensure appropriate measurement selection, 4. ensure grantor and grantee technical capacity, and 5. allow for phased implementation. In addition to these strategies, collaboration, oversight, and feedback also appear critical to the success of performance accountability mechanisms. Opportunities exist to improve the design and implementation of federal grants. A results-focused design can enable and facilitate the use of accountability provisions. National program evaluation studies and demonstration grants can provide valuable information to support oversight of and knowledge about accountability mechanisms. Finally, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agencies, and grantees can benefit from sharing good practices and lessons learned regarding performance accountability provisions.

A number of overarching trends\u2014including the nation\u2019s long- term fiscal imbalance\u2014drive the need to reexamine what the federal  government does, how it does it, who does it, and how it gets financed.  Because grants to state and local governments constituted nearly 20  percent of total federal outlays in fiscal year 2005, maximizing the extent  to which grants achieve their long-term performance goals and objectives  is critical to successfully addressing the challenges of the 21st century.", "In recent years, interest in federal grant performance accountability has  grown. For the purposes of this report, performance accountability is  defined as the mechanisms by which individuals or organizations are held  accountable for meeting specified performance-related expectations.  Consistent with the decade-long trend toward an increased results  orientation and expectation for performance accountability as evidenced  by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA),  performance accountability mechanisms in federal grants have become  more common. For example, performance assessment mechanisms are  present in grants authorized by both the Job Training Partnership Act and  its successor program, the Workforce Investment Act of 1988 (WIA) and  the No Child Left Behind Act. More recently, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) developed the Program Assessment Rating Tool  (PART), which, among other things, holds federal programs and their  partners accountable for performance. Simply monitoring and reporting  performance can also encourage performance accountability and  performance improvements. In this report, we have focused on specific  mechanisms that are meant to encourage performance incentives\u2014such  as rewards given or penalties imposed\u2014when performance exceeds or  fails to meet specified levels.", "While performance accountability mechanisms are fairly new to some  federal grants, they have been used in contracts and loans for some time.  Moreover, lessons learned from performance-based contracting have  begun to inform federal grant design, for example, in the case of WIA  grants requirements. In addition, some states award their federal pass- through grants to subgrantees as contracts with performance  accountability requirements.", "Given this growing body of experience, you asked us to examine ways to  infuse effective performance accountability mechanisms and practices  into the federal grant process. Specifically, our objectives were to identify  (1) What kinds of challenges to performance accountability exist in federal  grants? (2) What kinds of mechanisms are being used to improve grant  performance, and how? and (3) Given the findings of questions 1 and 2,  what strategies can the federal government use to encourage the use of  these mechanisms, as appropriate? For the purposes of this report, we  were interested specifically in the mechanisms by which individuals or  organizations are held accountable for meeting specified performance- related expectations that are directly tied to a grant.", "To address our objectives, we conducted a literature review that included  our prior reports, and interviewed experts in the area of federal grant and  contract performance accountability to identify the: (1) challenges to  performance accountability that exist in federal grants, (2) types of  performance accountability mechanisms\u2014defined as rewards and  penalties\u2014used, and (3) key strategies that appear to encourage the  successful implementation of performance accountability mechanisms.  Our identification of types of mechanisms and strategies was developed by  conducting a content analysis of selected literature from our review that  met our criteria for addressing the issue of accountability. Recognizing  that grants have increasingly assumed features traditionally associated  with contracts, we drew on experiences from both performance-based  contracting and grants to help identify valuable lessons learned that could  inform efforts to improve performance accountability in federal grants. To  illustrate these mechanisms and strategies, and to supplement our findings  and the many case examples identified by our content analysis, we use  relevant case examples found in the literature. We also selected four  additional cases for further in-depth illustrations. These four cases were  selected based on our literature review, interviews with experts, and  reviews of prior GAO work because they are good examples of where (1) a  performance mechanism was present and (2) there is reason to believe  that performance improved. We selected two federal grant programs and  two nonfederal contracts: (1) the federal vocational education grants  authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act  of 1998 (Perkins III), which are passed through states to secondary and  postsecondary schools for career and technical education; (2) the federal  Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, authorized by the Social  Security Act, Title IV, part D, which ensures that children are financially  supported by both parents; (3) the real property management contract  between the Ontario Provincial Government\u2019s Ontario Realty Corporation  (ORC) and SNC-Lavalin ProFac, Inc.

Diverse in structure and purpose, grants can  be generally classified as either categorical or block, with categorical  grants allowing less recipient discretion than block grants. For example,  the Community Services Block Grant provides funds to states and is  sometimes passed to local agencies to support a variety of efforts that  reduce poverty, revitalize low-income communities, and lead to self- sufficiency among low-income families and individuals, while giving the  agencies broad discretion in how the funds can be spent. In practice, the  \u201ccategorical\u201d and \u201cblock\u201d grant labels represent the ends of a continuum  and overlap considerably in its middle range.", "Grant funds may also be grouped by their method of allocating funds.  Formula grants allocate funds based on distribution formulas prescribed  by legislation or administrative regulation and often narrowly define the  eligible recipients as state agencies. On the other hand, categorical grants  are generally awarded on a competitive basis to applicants meeting  broader eligibility requirements.", "Despite substantial variation among grants, grants generally follow a  similar life cycle and include announcement, application, award,  postaward, and closeout phases. Once established through legislation,  which may specify particular objectives and eligibility and other  requirements, a grant program may be further defined by grantor agency  requirements. For competitive grant programs, the public is notified of the  grant opportunity announcement, and potential grantees must submit their  applications for agency review. In the awards stage, the agency identifies  successful applicants or legislatively defined grant recipients and awards  funding. The postaward stage includes payment processing, agency  monitoring, and grantee reporting, which may include financial and  performance information. The closeout phase includes preparation of final  reports, financial reconciliation, and any required accounting for property.", "Traditionally, grant accountability has referred to legal or financial  compliance. The Single Audit Act, for example, requires grantees to  conduct an overall financial compliance audit to promote accountability.  As such, at a minimum all grantees are held accountable for sound  financial management and use of federal funds to support allowable  activities. Beyond that, however, accountability for performance varies  from grant to grant. As discussed earlier, this historical focus on financial  accountability has expanded in response to increasing expectations of  demonstrable performance and performance accountability for all  government programs. For example, the Comptroller General\u2019s Domestic  Working Group issued its Guide to Opportunities for Improving Grant  Accountability, highlighting innovative approaches and promising  practices in grants management\u2014focused both on ensuring grant funds  are spent properly as well as achieving their desired results.", "While performance accountability in grants is a relatively new pursuit, it  has been used in contracts for a number of years.

As we have previously reported, performance  accountability tends to be greater (and grantee flexibility lower) in  programs with certain types of design features.

Even  in federal grants with designs that favor performance accountability, grant  implementation challenges related to developing performance goals and  measures as well as collecting and reporting performance data can  influence the extent of performance accountability achieved."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Grant Design Features Affect the Balance between Accountability and Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["Although there are various ways to design grants to encourage  performance accountability, in general, there are three factors that  particularly affect the degree of performance accountability that can be  achieved, including whether a grant (1) includes performance-oriented  objectives in addition to fiscally oriented objectives, (2) operates as a  distinct program or as a funding stream, and (3) supports a limited or  diverse array of objectives.", "As we discussed previously, federal grants have traditionally focused on  fiscal or legal accountability, such as holding states accountable for using  federal grant funds to supplement rather than to supplant their own  spending on a particular activity. However, federal grants that also include  performance-oriented objectives\u2014as well as the provisions that  implement them\u2014provide the basis for performance measurement and  accountability for results, and signal a federal role in managing  performance over the grant. Ideally, both types of objectives would be  present in federal grants. Performance-related objectives focus on service  or production activities and their results. For example, the central  objective of the grants for Special Programs for the Aging\u2014Nutrition  Services, is to provide nutritious meals to needy older Americans to  improve nutrition and reduce social isolation. In contrast, fiscal or  financial assistance objectives focus on providing dollars to support or  expand activities. Typical fiscal objectives include increasing support for  meritorious goods or underfunded services and targeting grant funding to  needy jurisdictions. For example, the objective of Title VI Innovative  Education grants is to provide funds to support local education reform  efforts. When objectives are purely fiscal, accountability to the federal  agency tends to focus on fiscal matters, such as holding states accountable  for using federal grant funds to supplement rather than to supplant their  own spending on a particular activity.", "Even when performance-oriented objectives are present, whether federal  grants operate as distinct programs or as part of a larger funding stream  directly affects who can be held accountable and for what. A grant that  operates as a program has performance requirements and objectives and  carries out specific programwide functions through a distinct delivery  system, such that grant-funded activities, clients, and products are clearly  identifiable. This type of grant gives the federal agency a role in managing  performance and makes it easier to obtain uniform information about  performance attributable to the grant funds. It is possible to identify which  activities were supported; the amount of federal funds allocated to each;  and to various extents, the results grantees achieved with federal funds.", "In contrast, funds from grants that operate as part of a funding stream are  merged with funds from state or local sources (and sometimes from other  federal sources) to support state or local activities allowable under the  flexible grant. These programs are managed at the state or local level, with  the federal role limited accordingly. When grants are part of a funding  stream, it is possible to identify which activities federal funds supported  and the amount allocated to each, but once the grant funds are combined  with the overall budget for a state or local activity, federal dollars lose  their identification and their specific results cannot be separated out. This  is particularly the case when the federal share is small, with most funding  coming from other sources. The program outcome measures available in  such programs are likely to be for outcomes of the state or local service  delivery program, not the federal program from which the funding  originated. Thus, grantees would generally be held accountable for overall  outcomes, regardless of the funding source. For example, projects such as  Oregon Option and the National Performance Review were designed to  promote accountability for federal and/or national priorities, regardless of  the funding source. They encourage grantors and grantees to work toward  collaboratively developed outcomes. These intergovernmental  partnerships can be particularly useful when funds come from a  combination of federal, state, local, and private sources, or when the  federal funding share is small.", "Federal grants vary along a continuum, at one end supporting a single  major activity common to all grantees (such as categorical grants), and at  the other end, allowing unrestricted choice by the recipient among a wide  variety of allowable activities, (such as block grants). Flexibility is  narrowest, but accountability to the federal level clearest, in programs that  focus on a single major activity. Flexibility is broadest in programs  designed to support diverse state or local activities, but finding a common  performance metric can be extremely challenging since these activities  can vary considerably from state to state. That said, we have previously  reported on options for building accountability provisions into block  grants that help balance states\u2019 flexibility to select a mix of activities and  services that will best allow them to achieve a particular national outcome  with accountability for achieving that outcome.

To ensure that grantees work toward national  priorities, they need to be involved in the development of performance  goals and measures.

We have previously reported that  agencies relying on third parties for performance data also have difficulty  ascertaining the accuracy and quality of the data. Further, programs often  rely on state administrative systems for performance information. For  some programs\u2014such as many of the Administration for Children and  Families\u2019 programs\u2014-since final reports are not due until 90 to 120 days  after the end of the federal fiscal year, there is a delay in available data.", "Onerous and inconsistent grant administration processes and  requirements: Multiple grants maybe available for the same or similar  purposes, meaning that federal grant recipients must navigate through a  myriad of federal grant programs in order to find the appropriate source of  funds to finance projects that meet local needs and address local issues.

Clearly, this limits the extent to  which federal agencies can oversee grantee performance.", "Nevertheless, even with these trade-offs and challenges, agencies have  been able to shift toward increased performance accountability in federal  grants and the use of accountability provisions to ensure that grantees  achieve real results through the programs, activities, and services financed  with federal funds.

This is significant because  many federal grants are ultimately passed through states to subgrantees.  Some accountability provisions, such as public award and recognition, can  even be employed by stakeholders or interested parties.

For example, in the health care field, for certain conditions  such as heart attack or stroke, delays in administering appropriate therapy  greatly increase the risk of mortality and disability.

In order to ensure that the financial  value of the Perkins III grants was large enough to motivate districts to  meet the Perkins III reporting and performance requirements, the Arizona  Career and Technical Division requires districts be in Perkins III  compliance in order to receive CTE-related state funds, thereby creating a  large incentive for local school districts to comply with the Perkins III  requirements.

Agencies can include renegotiation and revision  policies in regulations, guidance, and the terms and conditions of a grant  award. Providing for periodic revision may be particularly important  where performance measures are specified in legislation, because agency  flexibility to respond to changing needs is significantly reduced. For  example, as we have discussed, the Child Support Performance and  Incentive Act of 1998 specifies the five performance measures, the  performance targets, and the percentage of incentive payments that states  can earn for performance. Initially, states made changes and saw  improvement in these areas. Recently, both state and federal program  officials have expressed concern about the long-term sustainability of such  aggressive targets. For example, program officials said that even states  that have in the past met the 90 percent performance target for the  paternity measure are concerned because more recent annual rates have  dropped back down closer to 80 percent. According to officials, states  initially conducted an extensive caseload cleanup to improve performance  on the five incentive measures when the incentive program was enacted in  1998, and much of the backlog of cases that could be addressed relatively  easily has been.

Under a results-oriented  approach, federal policymakers would specify national goals and  objectives in statute, enact a process for establishing them, or adopt some  combination of the two. As a result, when designing or reauthorizing  grants, it is important to consider questions like the following:  Is there a need for national performance objectives in this policy area? If  so, grantees may be required to use uniform performance measures\u2014as in  the CSE program\u2014to gauge progress. This allows for comparisons across  grantees, and the supporting performance data collected from grantees  have the advantage of being program specific. However, uniform activities,  objectives, and measures may not exist or may not be desirable, especially  under flexible grant program designs. In these cases, Congress may  instead decide to allow grantees to establish their own program objectives.  For example, the Child Care and Development Block Grant requires states  to certify that they have requirements in effect to protect the health and  safety of children whose child care is subsidized by the block grant. These  requirements must cover the areas of preventing and controlling for  infectious diseases, physical premise safety, and health and safety training.  However, the specificity and stringency of these requirements and the  manner in which they are enforced is left to the states. The Perkins III  legislation outlines several performance areas and requires states to  determine the measures they will use to measures progress in these  statutorily defined areas. Performance targets for these measures are  negotiated with OVAE. In these cases, the federal role in monitoring the  grants is generally limited to collecting information on state and local  program efforts and accomplishments as well as evaluating and  disseminating information on best practices. Another option is to grant  temporary exemptions (waivers) from certain federal program  requirements to grantees that demonstrate that the flexibility granted can  lead to performance improvements. For example, Oregon Option is an  intergovernmental partnership that seeks to improve performance on  benchmarks for a broad variety of initiatives, including childhood  immunization, employment for the disabled, wild salmon recovery,  juvenile justice, welfare reform, and child nutrition, by waiving  administrative rules or seeking statutory change.

Is it possible to collect data at the project level? Will  the contribution of federal funds be distinguishable from state, local, and  private funds?

While congressional buy-in is  critical to sustain any major management initiative, it is especially  important for performance accountability given Congress\u2019s constitutional  role in setting national priorities and allocating the resources to achieve  them. Recognizing this, policymakers could use incentives to encourage  program partners to agree on performance measures and targets against  which performance will be judged."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Share Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["We and others have frequently reported on the benefits of sharing  promising practices and lessons learned to promote performance  accountability in general in federal programs and program partners. We  believe sharing good practices related to the effective design and  implementation of performance accountability mechanisms carries similar  benefits. As noted earlier, some state and local agencies\u2019 programs have  used this type of information sharing among themselves and their grantees  and contractors as a means of performance improvement.", "OMB, as the focal point for overall management in the executive branch,  plays a key role in promoting performance improvement in federal  programs and has developed or contributed to a number of tools to share  information and encourage improvements to federal grants and program  performance. For example, www.grants.gov includes information on grant  opportunities, resources to assist in writing grant proposals, and a  newsletter highlighting recent grant success stories, and www.results.gov  has information on best practices related to the President\u2019s Management  Agenda initiatives\u2014one of which is Budget and Performance Integration  (BPI). Successful implementation of BPI depends significantly on federal  agencies\u2019 ability to ensure federal program partners work toward program  goals and are held accountable for results. Expectmore.gov provides  information on PART assessments and improvement plans; these  assessments consider, among other things, whether the agency regularly  collects timely and credible performance information to manage its  programs, and whether the performance measurements are used to  increase accountability. OMB\u2019s own Web site also contains information on  and examples of what it considers to be high-quality PART performance  measures; discussion papers on measurement topics, such as how to  effectively measure what you are trying to prevent; and strategies to  address some of the challenges of measuring research and development  programs.", "OMB hosts a number of standing work groups and committees\u2014 comprising agency and OMB staff\u2014to address important grant-related  issues, all of which could accommodate a more specific focus on grants  accountability provisions. For example, OMB\u2019s Chief Financial Officer\u2019s  Council has a standing grants policy committee that focuses on grant  application and reporting streamlining. Agency BPI leads meet monthly  and recently developed a subgroup to share lessons learned related to  efficiency measures that balance effectiveness, quality, and cost. They also  discuss strategies to address the challenges of efficiency measures in the  grant context and to develop additional guidance for agencies in this area.", "In addition, OMB hosted a Block and Formula Grant workshop in October  2005 for federal officials aimed at identifying and sharing best practices in  grants management and performance measurement. OMB staff agreed that  the workshop was a valuable, efficient, and effective way to share  information and lessons learned and that collectively the participants  increased their knowledge and understanding of ways to enhance grant  performance. They also noted that the real difficulty comes in \u201cwhat to do  next,\u201d in other words, implementing the strategies gleaned from these  sessions.", "OMB staff told us that focusing specifically on performance accountability  provisions in grants is necessary and useful, but that to date, they have  focused their governmentwide efforts primarily on encouraging and  enhancing agency capacity to develop high-quality, results-based program  performance measures since improving the quality of measures and data  necessarily precedes tying them to accountability provisions. The Block  and Formula Grant workshop addressed issues of measurement and  accountability, and several block grant programs have been working to  strengthen grantee accountability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the challenges of the 21st century grow, it will become increasingly  important for Congress, OMB, and executive agencies to consider how the  federal government can maximize performance and results. This will be  particularly important for federal grant program managers, given the  significant amount of federal resources invested in these tools. Because  many national objectives can only be achieved through state, local, and  nongovernmental organizations, enhancing performance accountability  below the federal level is equally important. In this report, we identify a  variety of accountability mechanisms as well as key strategies to enhance  their use. Collectively, these can help enhance and sustain performance  accountability in grants at all levels of government.", "As the cases we described illustrate, rewards and penalties are  fundamental tools to help drive and motivate desired behaviors, but  performance accountability mechanisms are not one size fits all; there is  no universal transferable mechanism applicable to all programs. The  specific mechanisms used by agencies and programs and highlighted  throughout this report may not be universally adopted by other federal  agencies and programs seeking to improve their own programs.  Nevertheless, many can be tailored to specific grant programs, and the key  strategies can be adapted to address the specific accountability challenges  each agency faces.", "Like all successful change initiatives, the progress currently under way to  move from traditional fiscal accountability in grants to greater  accountability for performance will take time; accountability provisions\u2014 and the performance measures associated with them\u2014can take many  years to mature. Although some federal programs are well on their way to  collecting and reporting on reliable, credible, and valid data that support  high-quality outcome goals agreed to by all program partners, many others  are still struggling with how to define appropriate outcome measures. It  will be critical to proceed thoughtfully and implement performance  accountability in phases, building in enough opportunities to learn from  mistakes and revise measures and mechanisms to reap the benefits of  performance management while minimizing perverse incentives and  unintended consequences.", "As with all challenges, starting with small steps is often the best way  forward. Accountability provisions can be used to bring program partners  together to identify common ground. For example, programs that struggle  with defining appropriate outcome goals, measures, and targets may wish  to tie incentives to reaching agreement on them. Those that struggle with  poor data quality and data definitions could reward grantees for progress  in this area. Performance accountability\u2014especially in the early stages\u2014 must be constructive, not punitive. Even if penalties are employed to  promote performance accountability, there should be a constructive,  collaborative approach to performance improvement that precedes them.  Tying performance to lower risk, nonfinancial mechanisms may at first be  more acceptable until performance measures have been time tested and  revised as needed and grantees have had time to collect the necessary data  to support the measures. Above all, a collaborative process that includes  Congress, the executive branch, and grantees will be critical to developing  successful performance accountability systems.", "Accountability provisions assume that performance can be improved\u2014but  this requires information sharing and feedback. OMB has a central role in  overseeing the performance and accountability in the federal government,  and has used its role to promote general results-oriented performance  measurement and management practices in federal grants through Web  sites, guidance, work groups, and workshops. Each of these tools and  strategies could be expanded on to specifically promote and encourage  performance accountability in federal grants, both among related federal  grant programs\u2014programs that have a common purpose\u2014and federal  grant types\u2014such as categorical grants, block grants, and funding streams.  Sharing good practices and lessons learned and providing feedback on  performance are valuable practices that can leverage resources to enhance  knowledge and further performance accountability. Leading practices can  be shared within and among agencies, grant programs, grantees, and even  grant types. OMB recognized the value in sharing information on  performance accountability mechanisms, but has not yet focused on this  issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are therefore recommending that the Director of OMB encourage and  assist federal agencies in working with the Congress to expand the  effective use of performance accountability mechanisms, focusing on the  practices in this report, when federal grant programs are being created or  reauthorized. We further recommend that OMB offer opportunities for  knowledge transfer among federal agencies and encourage agencies to  share leading practices and lessons learned in implementing grant  accountability mechanisms.
