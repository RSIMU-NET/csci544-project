Software problem reports are increasing and Boeing could have difficulty completing all testing if more retests are needed than expected. Developmental flight testing activities are also a concern due to the need for extensive coordination among government agencies, the need for timely access to receiver aircraft (aircraft the KC-46 will refuel while in flight), and the aggressive test pace.

It enables military aircraft to fly farther, stay  airborne longer, and transport more weapons, equipment, and supplies  than unrefueled forces. KC-46 aircraft are expected to replace over forty  percent of the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet, currently the mainstay of the  U.S. tanker force. This force is now over 50 years old on average and  costs increasingly more to maintain and support, with additional concerns  that age-related problems could potentially ground the fleet. The Air Force  plans to develop, test, and field 18 KC-46 tankers by August 2017, and  eventually field a total of 179 aircraft.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 requires that  we annually review and report on the KC-46 program through 2017. This  is our third report reviewing the KC-46 development program. In our first  report, we recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) track  lessons learned, since the KC-46 is one of the few major programs to  award a fixed price incentive (firm target) development contract in recent  years. We also recommended fully implementing sound metrics so  planned key performance parameters could be measured appropriately.  Subsequently, the program office took steps to do so. In our second  report, we recommended that DOD analyze the root causes for the rapid  allocation of management reserves (funds set aside to address  development risks) and improve the KC-46 master schedule to comply  with best practices. DOD has since reviewed the use of management  reserves and is conducting schedule risk assessments. In this third  report, we (1) evaluate program progress toward cost, schedule, and  performance goals; (2) identify program development challenges, if any,  and steps to address these challenges; and (3) assess progress in  manufacturing aircraft. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2012 also requires that we analyze the results of developmental and  operational testing and any plans for correcting identified deficiencies. We  have not yet assessed testing results and plans to correct identified  deficiencies because flight testing has not officially begun.", "To conduct work for our current review, we analyzed financial  management documents; program budgets; risk assessments; technical  performance indicators; flight test and manufacturing plans; and software  development plan and metrics. We also analyzed program plans and  discussed results with the Air Force\u2019s KC-46 program office, other  defense offices, and the prime contractor, the Boeing Company (Boeing).

This program is  one of a few weapon system programs to use a fixed price incentive (firm  target) contract for development in recent years. Defense officials stated  that a fixed price incentive (firm target) contract was appropriate for the  program because KC-46 development is considered to be a relatively  low-risk effort to integrate mostly mature military technologies onto an  aircraft designed for commercial use. The KC-46 development contract is  designed to hold Boeing accountable for cost associated with the  development of four test aircraft and includes options to manufacture the  remaining production lots. The contract limits the government\u2019s financial  liability and provides the contractor incentives to reduce costs in order to  earn more profit. Barring any changes to KC-46 requirements by the Air  Force, the contract specifies a target price of $4.4 billion and a ceiling  price of $4.9 billion, at which point Boeing must assume responsibility for  all additional costs. We previously reported that both the program office  and Boeing have estimated that development costs would exceed the  contract ceiling price. As of March 2014, Boeing and the program office  estimated costs would be over the ceiling price by about $271 million and  $787 million, respectively. The program office estimate is higher because  it includes additional costs associated with performance as well as cost  and schedule risk.", "In all, 13 production lots are expected to be delivered. The contract  includes firm fixed price contract options for the first production lot in 2015  and the second production lot in 2016, and options with not-to-exceed  firm fixed prices for production lots 3 through 13. The contract also  requires Boeing to deliver 18 operational aircraft by August 2017. In  addition, all required training must be complete, and the required support  equipment and sustainment support in place by August 2017. Contract  provisions also specify that Boeing must correct any required deficiencies  and bring development and production aircraft to the final configuration at  no additional cost to the government. After the first two production lots,  the program plans to produce aircraft at a rate of 15 aircraft per year, with  the final 6 aircraft procured in fiscal year 2027. Separate competitions  may occur for later acquisitions, nominally called the KC-Y and KC-Z, to  replace the rest of the KC-135 fleet and the KC-10 fleet (the Air Force\u2019s  large tanker).", "Boeing plans to modify the 767 aircraft in two phases to produce a  militarized aerial refueling tanker:  In the first, Boeing is modifying the 767 with a cargo door and an  advanced flight deck display borrowed from its new 787 and calling  this modified version the 767-2C. The 767-2C will be built on Boeing\u2019s  existing production line.  In the second, the 767-2C will proceed to the finishing center to  become a KC-46. It will be militarized by adding air refueling  capabilities, an air refueling operator\u2019s station that includes panoramic  three-dimensional displays, and threat detection and avoidance  systems.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has previously certified  Boeing\u2019s 767 commercial passenger airplane and will certify the design  for both the 767-2C and the KC-46. Boeing established plans for the FAA  to accomplish the 767-2C and the KC-46 certifications concurrently rather  than consecutively, which is the typical procedure. The Air Force also has  to certify the KC-46 and will use the FAA\u2019s findings to make the overall  airworthiness determination. See Figure 1 for a depiction of the  conversion of the 767 aircraft into the KC-46 tanker.", "The new KC-46 tanker is expected to be more capable than the KC-135 it  replaces in several respects. Unlike the KC-135, it will allow for two types  of refueling to be employed in the same mission\u2014a refueling boom that is  integrated with a computer assisted control system, as well as a  permanent hose and drogue refueling system. The KC-135 has to land  and switch equipment to transition from one mode to another. Also, the  KC-46 is expected to be able to refuel in a variety of night-time and covert  mission settings and will have countermeasures to protect it against  infrared missile threats. The KC-135 is restricted in tactical missions and  does not have sufficient defensive systems relative to the KC-46.  Designed with more refueling capacity, improved efficiency, and  increased cargo and medical evacuation capabilities than its predecessor,  the KC-46 is intended to provide aerial refueling to Air Force, Navy,  Marine Corps, and allied aircraft.

Based on Boeing\u2019s monthly usage, we  calculate that the management reserves will be depleted about 3 months  before the KC-46\u2019s first flight and approximately 3 years before the  development contract is completed.

The largest change is in the program\u2019s  development cost estimate, which has decreased by about $345 million,  or about 5 percent. Development cost reductions can be attributed to  fiscal year 2013 sequestration cuts, support for DOD\u2019s Small Business  Innovative Research fund, and cuts to a fund dedicated to tanker  replacement. According to program officials, these reductions have not  affected the program because it had set aside funds to address  engineering changes, which have not occurred thus far. Overall, total  acquisition and unit costs have decreased less than 1 percent and  quantities have remained the same. Table 1 summarizes the initial and  current estimated quantities, costs, and milestone dates for the KC-46  program.", "The October 2013 development cost estimate of about $6.8 billion  includes several contracts for various activities. For example, the program  office awarded Boeing a contract for $4.9 billion to develop 4 test aircraft  and budgeted over $0.3 billion for the development of aircrew and  maintenance training systems. An estimated $1.6 billion is needed to  cover other government costs, such as program office support, test and  evaluation support, contract performance risk, and other development  risks associated with the aircraft and training systems. The procurement  cost estimate of $40.3 billion is to procure 175 production aircraft, initial  spares, and other support equipment. The military construction estimate  of $4.2 billion includes the projected costs to build aircraft hangars,  maintenance and supply shops, and other facilities to house and support  the KC-46 fleet at 10 main operating bases, 1 training base, and the  Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex depot.", "Boeing is also meeting the high level schedule milestones. Most recently,  it conducted the critical design review (CDR) in July 2013, on schedule.  However, there are indications that the start of initial operational test and  evaluation, which is scheduled for May 2016, may slip. DOD\u2019s Office of  the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, which is responsible for  approving operational and live fire test and evaluation within each major  defense acquisition program, recently issued its 2013 annual report and  continued to recommend that the Air Force plan for a 6- to 12-month  delay to the start of initial operational test and evaluation to allow more  time to train aircrew and maintenance personnel and verify maintenance  procedures. The KC-46 program office agrees that the test schedule is  aggressive, but does not believe the delays are certain.", "The program office projects that the KC-46 aircraft will meet the  requirements of all nine key performance parameters by the end of  development. Satisfying these key performance parameters will ensure  that the KC-46 will be able to accomplish its primary mission of providing  worldwide, day and night, adverse weather aerial refueling as well as its  secondary missions. See appendix III for a list of the KC-46 key  performance parameters. The program office has developed a set of  metrics to help gauge its progress towards meeting the performance  parameters. For example, one metric tracks operational empty weight  because in general, every pound of excess weight equates to a  corresponding reduction in the amount of fuel the aircraft can carry to  accomplish its primary mission. Boeing currently projects that the aircraft  will meet the weight target of 204,000 pounds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Set Aside to Alleviate Program Risk Is Almost Depleted", "paragraphs": ["At the outset of development, Boeing set aside $354 million from contract  funds in a management reserve account, about 7 percent of the contract  ceiling price, to address identified, yet unresolved, development risks.  Last year we reported that Boeing had accomplished approximately 28  percent of the development work and had allocated about 80 percent of  the contract\u2019s management reserves. We raised concerns about the high  rate at which the management reserves were being used because doing  so early in a program is often an indicator of future contract performance  problems.", "Since then, there have been two major actions related to management  reserves in 2013. First, in January 2013, Boeing returned $72 million to  the management reserves account because program officials determined  that the program would pay for fuel for test flights rather than Boeing, new  labor rates were lower than planned, and Boeing calculated costs  associated with some types of labor incorrectly. Second, in August 2013,  Boeing allocated about $42 million of its management reserves, with the  largest portion, $24 million, used for a wet fuels laboratory. Boeing initially  planned on using corporate funding for the wet fuels laboratory, which  was intended for general wet fuels research. However, since the  laboratory became more focused on meeting the specific needs of the  KC-46 program, Boeing determined it was more appropriate to use  management reserves. The other $18 million was used for a variety of  other efforts, including minor design and architectural changes. The  following figure illustrates management reserve allocation since program  start and projects when reserves will be depleted.", "As of December 2013, about $75 million in unallocated reserves remain.

According to GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide, significant use of management reserves early in  a program may indicate contract performance problems and decreases  the amount of reserves available for future risks, particularly during the  test and evaluation phase when demand may be the greatest. Barring  any changes to KC-46 requirements, schedule, or other relevant terms  and conditions of the contract by the Air Force, Boeing would be solely  responsible for the cost of future changes if it uses all of its management  reserves, so the government bears no financial risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Stabilized the KC-46 Design and Is Now Focused on Software Development and Testing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The program office and Boeing held the program\u2019s CDR in July 2013 and  released over 90 percent of the total engineering design drawings, a key  indicator that the design is stable.

Figure 6 below  depicts how the program office expects the aircraft\u2019s reliability to improve  over the program\u2019s initial 5,000 flight hours.", "The program expects to be above the idealized reliability growth curve at  the start of testing because initial testing will be on a 767-2C, a derivative  of a commercial aircraft that has been flying since the 1980s. Reliability is  projected to fall below expectations once the military sub-systems are  added to the aircraft. The program then expects the reliability to steadily  improve to the point where the aircraft could fly about 2 hours between  unscheduled maintenance events at the start of initial operational test and  evaluation. As shown in figure 6 above, the program will be on the  idealized reliability growth curve at that point.", "Boeing has also initiated a failure modes and effects analysis that covers  41 subsystems. Boeing and the program office rely on this analysis to  determine which subsystems on the aircraft are likely to fail, when and  why they fail, and whether those subsystems\u2019 failures might threaten the  aircraft\u2019s safety. Boeing is also using this information to develop a tool to  detect and log equipment failures. The program office plans to share the  analysis with aircraft maintenance staff.", "The program has not yet begun two critical manufacturing and reliability  assessment activities. First, the program is not currently tracking reliability  growth because the 767-2C first flight is not scheduled to take place until  June 2014 and no flight hours have been accrued yet. Second, the  program has not determined whether manufacturing processes are in  control and capable of producing parts consistently with few defects. The  program plans to review and verify that process controls are in place to  ensure the quality of the manufacturing process as part of its next  assessment of critical manufacturing processes prior to the low rate  production decision in August 2015. Program officials said their review  would be focused on whether these process controls are in place rather  than analyzing the data to determine if the processes are actually in  control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Key Military Subsystems", "paragraphs": ["Boeing is making progress manufacturing most of the military unique  subsystems, such as the aerial refueling operator station, but the test  refueling boom\u2019s schedule has slipped by almost a year due to parts  delays. Boeing\u2019s original design included parts that proved challenging to  fit within the boom\u2019s space constraints, and other parts were redesigned  to improve the boom\u2019s safety. Boom parts suppliers, however, have  experienced delays in delivering the redesigned parts to Boeing, which  has prompted Boeing to send staff to help one of the suppliers minimize  further schedule slips. Boeing officials told us they decided to build a test  boom as a risk reduction effort and plan to apply lessons learned from  producing the test boom to future boom production. However, program  officials currently estimate that boom parts delays have also led to an  approximately 1-month schedule slip in the first development aircraft\u2019s  boom. Boeing is facing some schedule pressure on this boom because it  is now scheduled to be completed only a few days before the start of  ground vibration testing. Boeing officials said they needed the boom for  this testing and would like to complete ground vibration testing before the  767-2C\u2019s first flight. The second development aircraft\u2019s boom is  scheduled to be built in only 5 months.

The next  12 months will be challenging as the program must accomplish a  significant amount of work and the margin for error is small. For example,  the program is scheduled to complete software integration and the first  test flights of the 767-2C and KC-46. The remaining software  development and integration work is mostly focused on military software  and systems and is expected to be more difficult relative to the prior work  completed. The program\u2019s test activities continue to be a concern due to  its aggressive test schedule. Detailed test plans must be completed and  the program must maintain an unusually high test pace to meet this  schedule. Perhaps more importantly, agencies will have to coordinate to  concurrently complete multiple air worthiness certifications. While  efficient, this approach presents significant risk to the program. The  program office must also finalize agreements now in progress to ensure  that receiver aircraft are available when and where they are needed to  support flight tests. Any discoveries made in testing that require design  changes may negatively affect program schedule and delivery to the  warfighter. Parts delays on the first development aircraft and a critical  aerial refueling subsystem are also causing increased schedule pressure.", "With these risks in its near future, the KC-46 program will continue to bear  watching.
