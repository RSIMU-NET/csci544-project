A key reason for this underreporting is well known. Unlike wage and some investment income, sole proprietors' income is not subject to withholding and only a portion is subject to information reporting to IRS by third parties. GAO was asked to (1) describe the nature and extent of sole proprietor noncompliance, (2) how IRS's enforcement programs address it, and (3) options for reducing it. GAO analyzed IRS's recent random sample study of reporting compliance by individual taxpayers, including sole proprietors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on what IRS examiners could find, most sole proprietors, at least an estimated 61 percent, underreported net business income, but a small proportion of them accounted for the bulk of understated taxes. Both gross income and expenses were misreported. Most of the resulting understated taxes were in relatively small amounts. Half the understatements that IRS examiners could find were less than $903. However, 10 percent of the tax understatements, made by over 1 million sole proprietors, were above $6,200. In this top group, the mean understatement of tax was $18,000. IRS's two main sole proprietor enforcement programs--the Automated Underreporter Program, which computer matches information on a tax return with information submitted to IRS by third parties, and examinations (audits)--have limited reach. The two programs each annually contact less than 3 percent of estimated noncompliant sole proprietors. The limited reach exists for a variety of reasons. In 2001, about 25 percent of sole proprietor gross income was reported on information returns by third parties; expenses generally are not subject to such reporting. Even when required, various barriers make information reporting inconvenient. Examinations of sole proprietors yield less in additional tax assessed and cost more to conduct than examinations for other taxpayers. However, because of the extent of sole proprietor noncompliance, any effect that examinations have on voluntary compliance by other sole proprietors could result in significant revenue. The Treasury Department's recently released tax gap strategy discusses neither sole proprietor noncompliance specifically nor the many options that could address it. GAO has reported on the need for such a detailed strategy for years. Specific options that address issues including sole proprietor recordkeeping, underreporting of gross income, overreporting of expenses, information reporting, and IRS's enforcement programs are listed in appendix II."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Voluntary compliance with federal tax laws is a critical component of the  federal tax system.

Key  reasons for sole proprietors\u2019 relatively high tax noncompliance are well  known. Sole proprietors are not subject to tax withholding, and only a  portion of their net business income is reported to IRS by third parties. By  comparison, misreporting rates for wage and interest income, which are  subject to withholding or information reporting by financial institutions,  are low (about 1 and 4 percent, respectively).", "Congress has been encouraging IRS to develop an overall tax gap  reduction plan or strategy that could include a mix of approaches, like  simplifying tax law, increasing enforcement tools, and reconsidering the  level of resources devoted to enforcement.

Our objectives were to (1) describe the nature and extent  of the noncompliance associated with sole proprietors, (2) describe the  extent to which IRS\u2019s enforcement programs address the types of sole  proprietor noncompliance found by IRS\u2019s most recent research, and   (3) identify options to close the tax gap related to sole proprietors that  could be included in the tax gap strategy being developed by Treasury. To  describe the nature and extent of sole proprietor noncompliance, we  analyzed IRS\u2019s National Research Program (NRP) results on the reporting  compliance of individual taxpayers in tax year 2001, IRS\u2019s tax gap  estimates, and IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income (SOI) data to develop a profile of  sole proprietors and related tax compliance issues. To determine the  extent to which IRS\u2019s compliance programs address sole proprietor  noncompliance, we reviewed filing guidance and compliance program  procedures and analyzed program results. We interviewed IRS staff on the  operations and results of the Automated Underreporter Program (AUR),  which tests for underreporting by computer matching information returns  reporting selected payments made to sole proprietors with income tax  returns. We also interviewed staff in IRS\u2019s correspondence, office, and  field examination (or audit) programs. In addition, we reviewed NRP  examination cases to identify examples of barriers when examining sole  proprietors.", "We used several approaches to identify options for closing the sole  proprietor tax gap that could fit into the tax gap strategy. We focused on  options that could address the types of sole proprietor noncompliance  profiled by IRS\u2019s research and the limitations of IRS\u2019s enforcement  programs that address sole proprietors. We also reviewed existing  recommendations from the President\u2019s Budget, President\u2019s Advisory Panel  on Federal Tax Reform, our previous recommendations and reports of the  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, IRS\u2019s Taxpayer  Advocate, and IRS advisory groups. We discussed the options with experts  on sole proprietor compliance, including persons who have experience  with IRS or other federal programs related to sole proprietors or who  published related research.

Sole proprietors constitute about 72 percent of all businesses in the United  States but are small; they have only 4.8 percent of all business receipts.  Sole proprietors include a wide range of businesses, including those that  provide services, such as doctors and accountants; produce goods, such as  manufacturers; or sell goods at fixed locations, such as car dealers and  grocers.

The Schedule C requires sole  proprietors to classify their type of business or profession, report gross  receipts and income, place expenses in 23 categories, and provide  additional data on vehicle expenses. Sole proprietors with expenses up to  $5,000 may qualify for simplified tax reporting on Schedule C-EZ, which  allows them to report all expenses on one line. Sole proprietors combine  their business profits or losses, reported on Schedule C, with income,  deductions, and credits from other sources that are reported elsewhere on  the Form 1040 to compute their overall individual tax liability.", "In addition to income tax obligations, sole proprietors have other tax  requirements. If they have employees, sole proprietors are responsible for  withholding and paying Social Security, Medicare, and federal income tax,  and paying federal unemployment tax under an employer identification  number (EIN) that is the tax identification number (TIN) for the business.

Generally, a Form 1099-MISC needs to be filed with  IRS and the recipient of the payment for    payments of $600 or more for services performed for a trade or business,  including a sole proprietor, by people who are not employees, such as  contractors;  rent payments of $600 or more, other than rents paid to real estate agents;  and    sales of $5,000 or more of consumer goods to persons for resale anywhere  other than in a permanent retail establishment.", "Payments for purchases of goods and service to corporations generally are  not required to be reported.", "Based on these rules, organizations (including sole proprietors) that make  NEC payments for services provided may be required to submit  information returns to IRS and the payee. For example, a store owner (a  sole proprietor) who hires a self-employed computer programmer  (another sole proprietor) to design the business Web site for $10,000 must  submit a Form 1099-MISC information return to report the $10,000  payment made to the computer programmer. However, if the programmer  is hired to design a personal, nonbusiness Web site for the store owner, no  information return is required.", "Completing a Form 1099-MISC requires the payer to determine whether  the payee is an independent contractor or an employee. To determine  independent contractor status, payers are to use 20 common law rules.  Numerous controversies over interpretation of the common law rules led  to the enactment of Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978, which stops  IRS and Treasury from issuing new interpretations of these rules. In 1996,  we characterized these rules as confusing and resulting in many  misclassifications. If the determination results in an employee-employer  relationship, the organization is required to prepare a Form W-2 and  withhold tax from each payment to the employee.", "Similarly, the payer must determine if the payee is a corporation, since  such payments generally are not subject to Form 1099-MISC reporting. To  determine if the service is provided by a corporation, service providers are  asked to declare their corporation status and, if not a corporation, provide  a TIN. To ensure that payees provide correct TINs on information returns  filed with IRS, NEC payments may be subject to backup withholding.

AUR may send a notice to the sole  proprietor if the AUR matching identifies a discrepancy between the NEC  reported. The notice proposes adjustments to the tax return filed and  requests payment of additional tax, interest, or penalties related to the  discrepancy. If the taxpayer disagrees with the notice, the taxpayer is  requested to explain the difference and provide any supporting  documents.

IRS estimates that a large portion of the gross tax gap, $197 billion,  is caused by the underreporting of income on individual tax returns. Of  this, IRS estimates that $68 billion is caused by sole proprietors  underreporting their net business income. This estimate does not include  other sole proprietor contributions to the tax gap, including not paying  because of failing to file a tax return, underpaying the tax due on income  that was correctly reported, and underpaying employment taxes.

The  individual reporting compliance study was a detailed review and  examination of a representative sample of 46,000 individual tax returns  from tax year 2001. IRS generalized from the NRP sample results to  compute estimates of underreporting of income and taxes for all  individual tax returns. Because even the detailed NRP reviews could not  detect all noncompliance, IRS adjusted the NRP estimates to develop final  estimates of income misreporting and the resulting tax gap. IRS did not  adjust all the NRP population estimates, only those necessary for  developing its final tax gap estimates.

The estimates in figure 3 are based on errors detected in the NRP reviews.  IRS knows that not all misreporting is detected during its examinations,  including NRP reviews. Unreported cash receipts, for example, are  difficult to detect. IRS uses various methodologies and other sources of  data (on cash transactions, for example) to adjust the aggregate NRP  results (but not individual line items) to estimate misreporting. The NRP  data limitations are more fully described in appendix I.", "After these adjustments, IRS estimates that sole proprietors misreported  57 percent of their net business income in 2001 and that the tax gap caused  by this misreporting of sole proprietor net business income in 2001 was  $68 billion.

Some  misreporting is intentional; some is unintentional. How much misreporting  is in each category is not known. IRS refers some misreporting for  criminal prosecution, but often it is impossible to tell from a tax return  whether errors are intentional. Beyond intentional misreporting, reasons  for errors include transcription mistakes, misunderstanding of the relevant  tax laws or regulations, and poor recordkeeping. Examples from our  review of NRP examination case files illustrate some of these types of  reporting errors:    The sole proprietor operated a cash-card business and reported about  $900,000 in gross receipts on the Schedule C. The business is largely done  with cash transactions. The examiner found evidence of more than $1  million in additional sales income, as well as additional expenses from  purchases, leading to an adjustment of about $30,000 for Schedule C net  income.

The examiner proposed adjustments of about  $9,000 to Schedule C expenses because the expenses were undocumented  or were personal living expenses not associated with the business.

On the other hand, using the  best available data on underreporting detected by NRP, we estimate that  72 percent of the underreported adjusted gross income (AGI) on income  tax returns filed by sole proprietors was caused by changes in Schedule C  income. As a result, it is likely that most of the NRP-estimated $36.9  billion (unadjusted) in understated taxes on these returns can be  attributed to underreported net business income on Schedule C.", "Although most sole proprietors had understated taxes, the amounts were  skewed.

FIRE requires payers to put return information in a  particular format that IRS can use, which requires appropriate software  that payers must purchase.

For  example, in our review of NRP files, we found a case in which an examiner  manually sorted through a taxpayer\u2019s records and organized them to  accurately calculate the taxes owed\u2014a task that could not occur through  correspondence. In any case, IRS\u2019s correspondence tax examiners, the  lowest-graded examiners, do not have the training to examine many  Schedule C issues, such as business depreciation or accounting methods.", "Schedule C tax issues typically must be addressed in field examinations.  Field examinations took 20 hours on average to complete in fiscal year  2006. Furthermore, field examinations of returns with Schedule C forms  took about 50 percent longer per return (7.2 hours more) to complete than  those not categorized as Schedule C returns in that year.", "Among field examinations, the recommended additional tax assessed for  examinations of returns with attached Schedule C forms tended to be  smaller than for other types of examinations. For example, the average  recommended assessment for revenue agents examining returns with  attached Schedule C forms (the employees most likely to do these  examinations) was $24,000 in fiscal year 2006. This was $3,800 less than  examinations of returns without Schedule C attachments and was less  than the average dollars per return for 18 other types of returns without  Schedule C attachments, such as tax-shelter program cases.", "The relatively higher costs and lower yields for Schedule C examinations  do not necessarily mean than Schedule C examinations are not cost- effective. The statistics reported above include only the additional taxes  expected from the taxpayer who was examined. Examinations may have a  deterrent effect on other taxpayers and increase the rate of voluntary  compliance. Because the rate of noncompliance is so high for sole  proprietors, any change in their voluntary compliance from doing more  examinations could result in significant revenue increases.", "IRS has been examining more tax returns with attached Schedule C forms,  resulting in billions of dollars in recommended tax assessments. From  fiscal years 2001 through 2006, the number of examinations of returns that  IRS categorized as Schedule C returns increased by 132 percent, from  128,062 to 297,626, as shown in figure 7. In fiscal year 2006, IRS examined  about 3 percent of the Schedule C categorized returns. Recommendations  of additional tax assessments also increased each year. The large increase  in these assessments in 2005 was primarily for returns reporting income  greater than $100,000. IRS officials also cited Son of Boss fraud cases from  fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and increased examination efficiency as causes  for the upward trends. Assessments do not reflect amounts actually  collected. Amounts ultimately collected are not yet known from the  examinations closed in 2005 and 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Did Not Always Apply Negligence Penalties during NRP", "paragraphs": ["IRS did not apply negligence penalties in a substantial portion of NRP  cases with a tax change.

In  August 1994, we reported on the lack of a comprehensive linkage between  IRS\u2019s compliance strategy and compliance efforts for sole proprietors and  on the need for better systems to identify the causes of noncompliance  and target enforcement resources.

The cons include the costs and burdens imposed on sole  proprietors, third parties, and IRS.", "We are not recommending particular options for a number of reasons:    Trade-offs. IRS has other compliance objectives in addition to sole  proprietor compliance. Devoting more IRS staff and other resources to  close the sole proprietor tax gap means that fewer resources are available  for combating other types of noncompliance, such as corporate,  individual, or tax-exempt entity noncompliance. Forgoing enforcement  revenue elsewhere is an opportunity cost of devoting more resources to  sole proprietor noncompliance. Also, the resources and management  capacity devoted to sole proprietor noncompliance may not be sufficient  to implement all the options. Priorities would need to be established.  Interaction between options. Some of the options may be substitutes for  each other. Others may be complements. Improving assistance to  taxpayers might reduce the need for some enforcement actions. Some of  the options may reinforce each other\u2014such as expanded information  reporting and more convenient filing options\u2014making it desirable to  package them together.", "Policy judgments. Some of the options involve policy judgments about  how the options would affect different groups of people.

The NRP  data are IRS estimates of individual tax reporting compliance based on  reviews and examinations of filed tax returns. IRS randomly selected the  returns for tax year 2001, which were filed with IRS during calendar year  2002. To compute the percentage of returns with an understatement or  overstatement on a Schedule C line and the net misreported amounts, IRS  used the following definitions, including related limitations:  Percentage of returns with an error: This ratio is the weighted number  of taxpayers that have a non-zero net misreported amount divided by the  weighted number of returns that should have reported the amount. For  some items, taxpayers may have errors that exactly offset each other  resulting in no net tax change. For example, a taxpayer may have reported  a transaction as an \u201coffice expense,\u201d but an examiner reclassified the same  amount as \u201crepairs and maintenance.\u201d NRP did not consider these  offsetting changes as errors for those line items.", "Net misreported amounts (NMA): The NMA is the sum of all amounts  underreported minus the sum of all amounts overreported for an item. The  NMA does not include adjustments between schedules of the return. For  example, the NRP examiner may disallow reported amounts for expense  deductions on Schedule C that should have been reported on Schedule A  and increase the deductions on Schedule A by the same amounts. Neither  adjustment would be in IRS\u2019s NMA. However, the adjustments would be  included in IRS\u2019s definition of the amounts that should have been  reported, which are reflected in the denominator of the net misreporting  percentage. The NMA does not include adjustments that were made  because the taxpayer used the wrong form or line item.", "Because the percentage of returns with an error and the NMA are derived  from samples, table 3 lists the confidence intervals for each amount. IRS  did not compute confidence intervals for its estimates. When we  calculated confidence intervals, we got slightly different point estimates  than IRS. The difference appears to arise from varying definitions of sole  proprietors. We are 95 percent confident that the percentages and  amounts reported are between the low estimate and the high estimate. In  the body of this report, we present IRS\u2019s point estimates.", "Estimated understated tax amounts, as shown in figure 4, were derived  from NRP sample data. Table 4 lists the estimated percentile amount and  confidence intervals for each percentile. We are 95 percent confident that  the percentages and amounts reported are between the low and high  estimates.", "Estimated cumulative understated tax amounts, as shown in figure 5, were  derived from NRP sample data. Table 5 lists the estimated percentile  amount and confidence intervals for each percentile. We are 95 percent  confident that the percentages and amounts reported are between the low  and high estimates.", "According to IRS Research officials, NRP results are not tax gap-related  estimates since they do not account for misreporting that the auditors did  not detect. Typically, the undetected misreporting of Schedule C net  income likely takes the form of understated gross receipts and overstated  expenses, for which IRS did not prepare separate tax gap estimates.  Overstated expenses tend to be detected since the burden of proof is on  the taxpayer to justify them. However, when taxpayers intentionally  understate gross receipts, they may also understate expenses to hide the  gross-receipt underreporting from IRS. Also, NRP includes estimates of  some net business income that is not reported on Schedule C. These  amounts are not added to the line-item detail and are not included in the  analyses for this report. We could not estimate the amount of tax change  that would result from NRP\u2019s examinations of Schedule C income because  it must be combined with the taxpayer\u2019s filing status, exemptions, other  types of income, deductions, credits, and other taxes.", "To analyze the extent to which IRS\u2019s enforcement programs address the  types of sole proprietor noncompliance found by IRS\u2019s most recent  research, we used several data sources. We reviewed instructions for tax  and information returns and filing guidance as well as program  procedures. We analyzed program results data collected from the  Automated Underreporter Program (AUR) and Examination officials, and  interviewed IRS staff on the operations and results of AUR and the  correspondence, office and field examination programs. We reviewed  examination plans and Internal Revenue Manual procedures and other  instructions to IRS staff describing program procedures. We analyzed data  on examination results and numbers of Schedule C forms filed from the  IRS Data Book, and data on paper Form 1099-MISC returns published by  IRS\u2019s Office of Research for 2006.

Then we divided the number of recommended assessments  made in each program by the number of noncompliant sole proprietors to  arrive at the percentage of noncompliant sole proprietors on which the  programs made recommended assessments.", "We reviewed a sample of completed NRP examination case files to  understand the types of sole proprietor noncompliance being detected. We  selected the sample using the NRP case results database to identify all  NRP cases with adjustments to Schedule C items for sole proprietor tax  returns. We then selected a nonestimation sample of NRP examination  cases with adjustments to gross receipts or sales, total expenses, net profit  or loss on the Schedule C, and the business income line on the Form 1040  return, because these lines summarize the sole proprietor\u2019s operations. We  also randomly selected some Schedule C adjustment cases.", "We also used NRP data and the NRP case file sample to analyze IRS\u2019s use  of penalties in NRP examinations. The analysis describes the proportion of  NRP cases closed with adjustments and the proportion closed with a  penalty recommended by the NRP examination. Because the cases with  adjustments and penalties were not drawn from the population of all  individual returns, they cannot be used to estimate a penalty assessment  rate and other characteristics for all individual taxpayers. Even with these  limitations, this analysis provides useful information on the outcome of  the NRP sample.", "To estimate the percentage of reported Schedule C receipts that were on a  Form 1099-MISC, we compared amounts reported on the Form 1099-MISC  and on Schedule C (line 1 total gross receipts or sales). This analysis used  SOI data on individual tax returns for tax year 2001, which included a  sample of information returns. We found that three Form 1099-MISC items  could be reported on a Schedule C, including nonemployee compensation  (NEC), medical payments, and fish sales. According to IRS, these Form  1099-MISC items could also be reported on two other IRS forms\u2014 Schedule F, Profit and Loss From Farming, and Form 4835, Farm Rental  Income and Expenses\u2014other than the Schedule C. We found that about 4  percent of the amounts reported on the Form 1099-MISC were reported on  Schedule F or Form 4835. This difference was not material to our  computation. Further, our analysis did not consider several sources of  noncompliance that could affect the computation, such as the nonfiling of  the required Schedule C or Form 1099-MISC or the underreporting of  Schedule C or Form 1099-MISC amounts.", "To estimate the percentage of Form 1099-MISC returns where the payer  and the payee have the same address, we used an SOI data file with tax  year 2001 individual income tax return information. We compared the  postal codes and the numeric portion of street addresses reported by the  payer and payee to identify whether they had the same address. For those  who did, we reviewed a sample to verify that the addresses were the same.  We also reviewed 55 Form 1099-MISC filings at the Ogden, Utah, campus,  which provided 8 examples in which a payer and payee had similar  addresses or names. We did not review other IRS records to determine  whether these Form 1099-MISC filers were related parties.", "To assess the likelihood of being assessed a penalty, controlling for other  factors, we used logistic regression analysis, an econometric method  appropriate for analyzing variables with dichotomous outcomes. We used  the deciles of the continuous variables as the independent variables in the  model. We did not weight the NRP returns or incorporate the NRP  stratification because penalties are a function of the audit and the NRP  returns are not representative of audited returns.", "Controlling for use of a paid preparer, adjusted gross income, Schedule C  amount, and total tax as reported by the taxpayer, a logistic regression  was used to predict a penalty based on the absolute value of the difference  between the total tax reported on the Form 1040 and the total tax after the  NRP audit and the percentage of tax change (the difference in total tax  divided by the total tax reported on the Form 1040). We found a significant  effect of the percentage change in tax owed and the absolute value of the  tax change on the likelihood of receiving a penalty. That is, individuals in  higher deciles (5th through 10th deciles) of the percentage increase in tax  were generally more likely than those in the lowest decile to be  recommended for a penalty. Additionally, taxpayers in higher deciles of  the absolute value of the tax change (4th through 10th deciles) were more  likely than those in the lowest decile to be recommended for a penalty  controlling for other factors. We also found that the odds of a penalty  decreased with each decile increase in the taxpayer\u2019s reported total tax  liability.", "Although we did not test for interactions that could mitigate this effect, we  found our results to be robust across a variety of model specifications. We  did not control for other potentially relevant variables, such as differences  among examiners, and did not test for whether the case was abated.", "We used several approaches to identify options to close the tax gap related  to sole proprietors that could be included in the tax gap strategy being  developed by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). First, we sought  ways to address the gaps between the nature of sole proprietor tax  noncompliance and existing IRS programs. Second, we reviewed various  research publications on sole proprietors and our recommendations, as  well as those from the President\u2019s Budget, President\u2019s Advisory Panel on  Federal Tax Reform, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration,  IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Advocate, and IRS advisory group reports.

All of the national  organizations representing sole proprietors had large memberships and we  contacted each organization\u2019s committee which focuses on small business  issues.

Since data did not  exist for analyzing the effect on the tax gap, taxpayers, or IRS for each  option, we could not independently validate or weigh the pros or cons  suggested by our experts and knowledgeable individuals. Because the  experts and knowledgeable individuals had competing interests on  questions of tax policy and administration, we did not seek consensus on  the \u201cbest\u201d options or on the pros and cons. Experts had limited time to  discuss all the options and pros and cons. Thus, we did not discuss each  option in detail in each interview, but overall, the interviews provided  enough details for the options in our report.

More detailed proposals could  raise other pros or cons not listed in our report.", "We used several approaches to assess data reliability. We assessed  whether the examination results and data contained in the NRP database  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. For this  assessment, we interviewed IRS officials about the data, collected and  reviewed documentation about the data and the system used to capture  the data, and completed testing of relevant data fields for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness. We completed analytic testing to ensure that  tax return items that should logically be equal were equal. For example,  the net profit and loss line on Schedule C should be accurately transferred  and equal to the similar line on the individual income tax return. We also  compared the information we collected through our case file review to  corresponding information in the NRP database to identify  inconsistencies. This testing found that the NRP results for Form 1040  returns with Schedule C forms were sufficiently reliable for our review.", "The tax gap, SOI, AUR, and Examination data are all from sources that we  used in previous reports.

The degree of importance  of each factor varies depending on the occupation and the factual context  in which the services are performed.", "Misclassification of workers can be either inadvertent or deliberate.  Because the determination of classification is factual, reasonable people  may differ as to the correct result given a certain set of facts. Thus, even  though a taxpayer in good faith determines that a worker is an  independent contractor, an IRS agent may reach a different conclusion by,  for example, weighing some of the 20 factors differently. The prohibition  on issuance of general guidance by IRS may make the likelihood of  classification errors greater; IRS is not permitted to publish guidance  stating which factors are more relevant than others. In the absence of such  guidance, not only may taxpayers and IRS differ, but different IRS agents  may also reach different conclusions, resulting in inconsistent  enforcement.", "A significant issue is the potential revenue loss to the federal government  when employees are misclassified as independent contractors. An IRS  survey of 1984 employment tax returns found that nearly 15 percent of  employers misclassified employees as independent contractors. When  employers classified workers as employees, more than 99 percent of wage  and salary income was reported. When workers were misclassified as  independent contractors, 77 percent of income was reported when a Form  1099-MISC was filed and only 29 percent was reported when no Form  1099-MISC was filed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Backup Withholding Rules", "paragraphs": ["Persons (payers) making certain types of payments must withhold and pay  to IRS a specified percentage of those payments under certain conditions.  Related to sole proprietors, for example, both (1) the commissions, fees,  or other payments for work as an independent contractor and (2)  payments by fishing boat operators, but only the part that is in money and  that represents a share of the proceeds of the catch, are reported on Form  1099-MISC. Other payments are not subject to backup withholding,  including wages, real estate transactions, foreclosures and abandonments,  and canceled debts. Also corporations, governmental entities, and foreign  governments generally are exempt from backup withholding.", "For backup withholding to be initiated on payments to sole proprietors, a  payment must be reportable and the payee must fail to furnish a correct  TIN. If an incorrect TIN is provided, IRS is to notify the payer regarding  the missing, incorrect, or not currently issued payee TIN. At that time the  payer is required to compare the listing with his or her records and send a  notice to the payee, asking for the correct TIN. Under tax rules, if the  payee refuses to provide a TIN, the payer is required to immediately begin  withholding 28 percent of the amount of the payment and remit that  amount to IRS. IRS procedures describe how the payer is to verify the TIN  and request that the payee provide a correct TIN. The payer must make up  to three solicitations for the TIN (initial, first annual, and second annual)  to avoid a penalty for failing to include a TIN on the information return. If  the payer files an information return with a missing TIN or with an  incorrect name and TIN combination, or does not follow the procedure to  correct the TIN, the payer may be subject to a $50 penalty for each  incorrect return filed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Tom Short, Assistant Director;  Evan Gilman; Eric Gorman; Leon Green; George Guttman; Shirley Jones;  Donna Miller; Karen O\u2019Conor; Anna Maria Ortiz; and Sam Scrutchins made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Tax Compliance: Multiple Approaches Are Needed to Reduce the Tax  Gap.
