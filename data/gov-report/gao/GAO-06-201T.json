Fully exploiting the potential of IT to improve performance is a challenging goal for VA, as it is throughout government. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 addressed this challenge by, among other things, establishing the position of chief information officer (CIO) to serve as the focal point for information and technology management within departments and agencies. As agreed with Congress, GAO will discuss the role of CIOs in the federal government and in the private sector, as well as provide a historical perspective on the roles and responsibilities of VA's CIO.

In most management areas, the federal and private-sector organizations reviewed showed little difference in the percentage of CIOs who had or shared a particular responsibility. The challenges cited by private-sector CIOs were also similar to those of federal CIOs: both groups cited improving IT management processes, developing IT leadership and skills, working with enterprise architectures, and ensuring the security of systems. Over time, VA has increased its attention to the CIO position and to information and technology management. After several years with CIOs whose primary duty was not information and technology management or who were serving in an acting capacity, the department appointed a full-time permanent CIO in August 2001. VA also recognized that its decentralized computing environment presented challenges, with a large proportion of the department's IT budget controlled by its administrations and staff offices. As a result, in 2002, the department proposed a realignment to strengthen the department-level CIO position and centralize IT management under this official. GAO has not reviewed the current status of this proposed realignment or VA's current organizational structure, but its view is that the realignment held promise for improving accountability and helping to accomplish VA's mission by increasing the CIO's oversight over IT management and spending."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting us to take part in your discussion of the  information technology organization at the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) and the role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO).

The \u201cOne VA\u201d vision is to  create versatile new ways for veterans to obtain services and  information by streamlining interactions with customers and  integrating IT resources to enable VA employees to help customers  more quickly and effectively. This vision will require modifying or  replacing separate information systems with integrated systems  using common standards to share information across VA programs  and with external partner organizations, such as the Department of  Defense.

One of the ways in which the  Congress has addressed this issue was to establish the CIO position;  an agency\u2019s CIO is to serve as the focal point for information and  technology management within an agency.", "In 1996, the Clinger-Cohen Act established the position of agency  CIO and specified responsibilities for this position.

In  July 2004, we reported on CIO roles, responsibilities, and challenges  (among other things) at 27 major agencies. For this work, we  identified major areas of CIO responsibilities that were either  statutory requirements or critical to effective information and  technology management. Altogether, we identified the 13 areas  shown in table 2.", "According to our report, CIOs were generally responsible for the key  information and technology management areas shown in the table,  although not all CIOs were completely responsible for all areas. For  example:   \u25cf  All the CIOs were responsible for the first five areas in the table  (capital planning and investment management, enterprise  architecture, information security, IT/IRM strategic planning, and  IT/IRM human capital).   \u25cf  More than half had responsibility for six additional areas (major e- government initiatives, systems acquisition, information  collection/paperwork reduction, records management, information  dissemination, and privacy).  \u25cf  Fewer than half were responsible for two areas (information  disclosure and statistics).", "It was common for CIOs to share responsibility for certain  functions, and in some cases responsibilities were assigned to other  offices. For example, systems acquisition responsibility could be  shared among the CIO and other officials, such as a procurement  executive or program executive; disclosure could be assigned to  general counsel and public affairs, while statistical policy could be  assigned to offices that deal with the agency\u2019s data analysis.  Nevertheless, even for areas of responsibility that were not assigned  to CIOs, agency CIOs generally reported that they contributed to the  successful execution of the agency\u2019s overall responsibilities in that  area.", "In carrying out their responsibilities, CIOs generally reported to  their agency heads. For 19 of the agencies in our review, the CIOs  stated that they had this reporting relationship. In the other 8  agencies, the CIOs stated that they reported instead to another  senior official, such as a deputy secretary, under secretary, or  assistant secretary. In addition, 8 of the 19 CIOs who said they had a  direct reporting relationship with the agency head noted that they  also reported to another senior executive, usually the deputy  secretary or under secretary for management, on an operational  basis.

At the major departments and  agencies included in our review, the median time in the position of  permanent CIOs whose time in office had been completed was  about 23 months. For career CIOs, the median was 32 months; the  median for political appointees was 19 months. To the question of  how long a CIO needed to stay in office to be effective, the most  common response of the CIOs (and former agency IT executives  whom we consulted) was 3 to 5 years. Between February 10, l996,  and March 1, 2004, only about 35 percent of the permanent CIOs  who had completed their time in office reportedly had stayed in  office for a minimum of 3 years. The gap between actual time in  office and the time needed to be effective is consistent with the view  of many agency CIOs that the turnover rate was high, and that this  rate was influenced by the political environment, the pay  differentials between the public and private sectors, and the  challenges that CIOs face.", "In contrast, the CIOs at the 27 agencies were generally helped in  carrying out their responsibilities by the background and experience  they brought to the job. The background of the CIOs varied in that  they had previously worked in the government, the private sector, or  academia, and they had a mix of technical and management  experience. However, virtually all had work experience or  educational backgrounds in IT or IT-related fields; 12 agency CIOs  had previously served in a CIO or deputy CIO capacity.

The CIOs, in turn, must meet the  challenges of building credible organizations and developing and  organizing information and technology management capabilities to  meet mission needs.", "In February 2001, we issued guidance on the effective use of CIOs,  which describes the following three factors as key contributors to  CIO success:  \u25cf  Supportive senior executives embrace the central role of technology  in accomplishing mission objectives and include the CIO as a full  participant in senior executive decision making.  \u25cf  Effective CIOs have legitimate and influential roles in leading top  managers to apply IT to business problems and needs. Placement of  the position at an executive management level in the organization is  important, but in addition, effective CIOs earn credibility and  produce results by establishing effective working relationships with  business unit heads.  \u25cf  Successful CIOs structure their organizations in ways that reflect a  clear understanding of business and mission needs. Along with  knowledge of business processes, market trends, internal legacy  structures, and available IT skills, this understanding is necessary to  ensure that the CIO\u2019s office is aligned to best serve agency needs.", "The CIO study that we reported on in July 2004 also provides  information on the major challenges that federal CIOs face in  fulfilling their duties. In particular, CIOs view IT governance  processes, funding, and human capital as critical to their success, as  indicated by two challenges that were cited by over 80 percent of  the CIOs: implementing effective information technology  management and obtaining sufficient and relevant resources.   \u25cf  Effective IT management.", "Leading organizations execute their information technology  management responsibilities reliably and efficiently. A little over 80  percent of the CIOs reported that they faced one or more challenges  related to implementing effective IT management practices at their  agencies. This is not surprising given that, as we have previously  reported, the government has not always successfully executed the  IT management areas that were most frequently cited as challenges  by the CIOs\u2014information security, enterprise architecture,  investment management, and e-gov.  \u25cf  Sufficient and relevant resources.", "One key element in ensuring an agency\u2019s information and  technology success is having adequate resources. Virtually all  agency CIOs cited resources, both in dollars and staff, as major  challenges. The funding issues cited generally concerned the  development and implementation of agency IT budgets and whether  certain IT projects, programs, or operations were being adequately  funded.", "We have previously reported that the way agency initiatives are  originated can create funding challenges that are not found in the  private sector. For example, certain information systems may be  mandated or legislated, so the agency does not have the flexibility to  decide whether to pursue them. Additionally, there is a great deal of  uncertainty about the funding levels that may be available from year  to year.", "The government also faces long-standing and widely recognized  challenges in maintaining a high-quality IT workforce. In 1994 and  2001, we reported on the importance that leading organizations  placed on making sure they had the right mix of skills in their IT  workforce. About 70 percent of the agency CIOs reported on a  number of substantial IT human capital challenges, including, in  some cases, the need for additional staff. Other challenges included  recruiting, retention, training and development, and succession  planning.", "In addition, two other commonly cited challenges were  communicating and collaborating (both internally and externally)  and managing change.   \u25cf  Communicating and collaborating.", "Our prior work has shown the importance of communication and  collaboration, both within an agency and with its external partners.  For example, one of the critical success factors we identified in our  guide focuses on the CIO\u2019s ability to establish his or her organization  as a central player in the enterprise. Ten agency CIOs reported that  communication and collaboration were challenges. Examples of  internal communication and collaboration challenges included  (1) cultivating, nurturing, and maintaining partnerships and alliances  while producing results in the best interest of the enterprise and  (2) establishing supporting governance structures that ensure two- way communication with the agency head and effective  communication with the business part of the organization and  component entities. Other CIOs cited activities associated with  communicating and collaborating with outside entities as  challenges, including sharing information with partners and  influencing the Congress and OMB.  \u25cf  Managing change.", "Top leadership involvement and clear lines of accountability for  making management improvements are critical to overcoming an  organization\u2019s natural resistance to change, marshaling the  resources needed to improve management, and building and  maintaining organizationwide commitment to new ways of doing  business. Some CIOs reported challenges associated with  implementing both changes originating from their own initiative and  changes from outside forces. Implementing major IT changes can  involve not only technical risks but also nontechnical risks, such as  those associated with people and the organization\u2019s culture. Six  CIOs cited dealing with the government\u2019s culture and bureaucracy  as challenges to implementing change. Former agency IT executives  also cited the need for cultural changes as a major challenge facing  CIOs. Accordingly, in order to effectively implement change, it is  important that CIOs build understanding, commitment, and support  among those who will be affected by the change.", "Effectively tackling these reported challenges can improve the  likelihood of a CIO\u2019s success. Until these challenges are overcome,  federal agencies are unlikely to optimize their use of information  and technology, which can affect an organization\u2019s ability to  effectively and efficiently implement its programs and missions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The CIO Position in the Private Sector Has Similarities to the Federal CIO Position", "paragraphs": ["In September 2005, we reported the results of our study of CIOs at  leading private-sector organizations, in which we described the  CIOs\u2019 responsibilities and major challenges, as well as private-sector  approaches to information and technology governance.", "The set of responsibilities assigned to CIOs in the private sector  were similar to those in the federal sector.

For example, in VA\u2019s information  technology budget for fiscal year 2002 of approximately $1.25  billion, VHA controlled about $1.02 billion (over 80 percent),  whereas the department level controlled about $60.2 million (less  than 5 percent).", "In addition, we noted that there was neither direct nor indirect  reporting to VA\u2019s cyber security officer\u2014the department\u2019s senior  security official\u2014thus raising questions about this person\u2019s ability to  enforce compliance with security policies and procedures and  ensure accountability for actions taken throughout the department.

Previously, these officials  served as component-level CIOs who reported only to their  respective administrations\u2019 under secretaries.  \u25cf  All administration-level cyber security functions were to be  consolidated under the department\u2019s cyber security office, and all  monies earmarked by VA for these functions were to be placed  under the authority of the cyber security officer. Information  security officers previously assigned to VHA\u2019s 21 veterans integrated  service networks would report directly to the cyber security  officer, thus extending the responsibilities of the cyber security  office to the field.  \u25cf  Beginning in fiscal year 2003, the department-level CIO would  assume executive authority over VA\u2019s IT funding.", "In September 2002, we testified that in pursuing these reforms, the  Secretary demonstrated the significance of establishing an effective  management structure for building credibility in the way IT is used,  and took a significant step toward achieving a \u201cOne VA\u201d vision. The  Secretary\u2019s initiative was also a bold and innovative step by the  department\u2014one that has been undertaken by few other federal  agencies. For example, of 17 agencies contacted in 2002, 8 reported  having component-level CIOs, none of which reported to the  department-level CIO. Only one agency with component-level CIOs  reported that its department-level CIO had authority over all IT  funding.", "We also noted that the CIO\u2019s success in managing IT operations  under the realignment would hinge on effective collaboration with  business counterparts to guide IT solutions that meet mission needs,  and we pointed out the importance of the three key contributors to  CIO success described in our 2001 guidance (discussed earlier).", "Although we have not reviewed the current status of this proposed  realignment or VA\u2019s current organizational structure, it remains our  view that the proposed realignment held promise for building a  more solid foundation for investing in and improving the  department\u2019s accountability over IT resources. Specifically, under  the realignment the CIO would assume budget authority over all IT  funding, including authority to veto proposals submitted from  subdepartment levels. This could have a significant effect on VA\u2019s  accountability for how components are spending money.", "To sum up, the CIO plays a vital role in ensuring that VA\u2019s funds are  well spent and in managing information technology to serve our  nation\u2019s veterans. In our view, the realignment of VA\u2019s IT  organization proposed in 2002 held promise for improving  accountability and enabling the department to accomplish its  mission.
