GAO was asked to examine EPA\u0092s efforts to address atmospheric deposition of pollutants that impair waterbodies. This report examines (1) the extent to which atmospheric deposition of NOx, SO2, and mercury contributes to the impairment of the nation\u0092s waters and identify the key sources of these pollutants; (2) the regulatory tools that EPA uses under the CWA to address the effects of atmospheric deposition, and the challenges, if any, that it faces in doing so; and (3) the regulatory tools that EPA uses under the CAA to address the effects of atmospheric deposition, and the challenges, if any, that it faces in doing so. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed EPA data, reports, and activities and interviewed agency officials and other experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and mercury contributes to the impairment of the nation's waters, but the full extent is not known. For example, states provide EPA with data on the extent to which their waterbodies do not meet water quality standards, and some states have reported that some of their waterbodies are polluted because of atmospheric deposition. However, the states have not assessed all of their waterbodies and are not required to report on the sources of pollution. Similarly, federal studies show that atmospheric deposition of NOx, SO2, and mercury is polluting waterbodies but have data for only some waters. The main sources of NOx and SO2 are cars and other forms of transportation and coal-burning power plants. Power plants are also the largest U.S. source of mercury emissions, but international sources also contribute to the mercury deposited in U.S. waters.", "EPA has sought to address atmospheric deposition through Clean Water Act (CWA) programs but faces challenges in doing so. Specifically, states typically establish water quality standards--considering EPA recommended criteria--for each waterbody. If a waterbody does not meet standards, CWA generally requires the state to set a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) that identifies the maximum amount of pollutant that can enter the waterbody and still meet standards. States are responsible for taking actions to ensure the TMDL is met. For point sources of pollution, such as a pipe from a sewer treatment plant, CWA requires new or renewed permits to be consistent with the TMDL. However, there is no similar statutory requirement for nonpoint sources of pollution, such as atmospheric deposition. States may take actions, such as providing technical or financial assistance to limit pollution from nonpoint sources, but face a challenge when atmospheric deposition pollution affecting their waters originates in emissions from a different state.", "EPA has also sought to address atmospheric deposition through Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations but faces challenges in doing so. EPA issued regulations that reduced emissions of NOx, SO2, and mercury and in turn the amount of pollution in waterbodies. Even with reduced emissions, NOx, SO2, and mercury continue to pollute the nation's waterbodies. EPA's recent attempt to address atmospheric deposition by establishing secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)--standards to protect public welfare--targeting the effects of acid rain caused by NOx and SO2 on water bodies was not successful. EPA stated that uncertainty regarding atmospheric modeling and limitations in available data prevented determination of secondary NAAQS adequate to protect against the effects of acid rain, and the agency has not identified alternative strategies. EPA has begun a 5-year pilot program to gather additional scientific data, but it is unclear whether or when the agency will be able to address scientific uncertainties to enable adoption of a protective secondary NAAQS. EPA also did not set secondary NAAQS to address nutrient over-enrichment in aquatic ecosystems caused by NOx because of the limited available scientific data. Many sources of nitrogen can contribute to nutrient over-enrichment in a waterbody, including sources of nitrogen unrelated to atmospheric deposition. EPA recently announced an effort that is to lead to the development of an integrated nitrogen research strategy that includes approaches to reducing atmospheric deposition of NOx into waters impaired because of nutrient over-enrichment by nitrogen."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that EPA determine whether EPA can obtain in a timely manner the data it needs to establish secondary NAAQS adequate to protect against the effects of acid rain and, if not, identify alternative strategies to do so.

In particular, airborne pollutants can fall to the  ground in precipitation or as a gas or particle and be deposited either  directly onto the surface of a waterbody or onto land and then transported  into a waterbody through runoff. Three airborne pollutants commonly  associated with atmospheric deposition are nitrogen oxides (NO), sulfur  dioxide (SO), and mercury. NO and SO contributes to nutrient over-enrichment  in estuaries, which can result in oxygen depleted areas known as \u201cdead  zones,\u201d where fish and other organisms cannot survive. Once in water,  mercury becomes concentrated in fish and can harm the health of  individuals who consume these fish, particularly children.", "Because these pollutants are transferred from air to water, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), whose mission is to protect  human health and the environment, can potentially address atmospheric  deposition through the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Clean Air Act  (CAA). The CWA provides EPA with responsibilities aimed at maintaining  and improving the quality of the nation\u2019s waters, including the  responsibility to establish recommended water quality criteria for specific  pollutants. Authorized states, territories, and tribes\u2014collectively referred  to as states in this report\u2014then use these recommended criteria along  with designated uses and antidegradation provisions to establish state- specific water quality standards. States then apply these standards to  individual waterbodies.

Once a TMDL is  established, states are generally responsible for implementation, while  EPA and states share responsibility to ensure that permitted discharges  to a waterbody do not exceed the level established by the TMDL.  Analogous to the CWA, the CAA provides EPA with tools for regulating  the emissions of pollutants into the air. Among the pollutants that EPA  regulates in certain emissions are NO, SO, and mercury  contributes to the impairment of the nation\u2019s waters and identify the key  sources of these pollutants; (2) the regulatory tools that EPA uses under  CWA to address the effects of atmospheric deposition, and the  challenges, if any, that it faces in doing so; and (3) the regulatory tools  that EPA uses under the CAA to address the effects of atmospheric  deposition, and the challenges, if any, that it faces in doing so.", "The water quality standard for a water body consists of three components: criteria,  designated uses, and antidegradation provisions.

We determined that although the  data have limitations, they were sufficiently reliable to present reported  atmospheric deposition impairment on assessed waters for selected  categories of water bodies. We also reviewed studies from EPA and  others to further examine the extent to which atmospheric deposition is  contributing to the impairment of the nation\u2019s waters. We assessed the  reliability and methodology of these studies, including limitations and  assumptions, and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of examining the extent to which atmospheric deposition is  contributing to the impairment of the nation\u2019s waters.

We selected each  TMDL to represent a different effect caused by the atmospheric  deposition of the three pollutants on which we are focusing.

NO is one of several sources of  nitrogen that can contribute to nutrient over-enrichment. Other sources of  nitrogen, such as runoff from agricultural and urban landscapes, do not  enter water bodies through atmospheric deposition. Bays and estuaries  are susceptible to the overabundance of nutrients, including an  overabundance of nitrogen, because the growth of algae and plankton in  these waters is generally limited by the availability of nitrogen. As nitrogen  levels in the water increase, the growth of algae and plankton increases.  When these organisms die, they are decomposed by bacteria that use the  dissolved oxygen in the water.

In mercury contaminated  waterbodies, bacteria in soils and sediments convert mercury into  methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury. It can then be taken up by  tiny aquatic plants and animals. Fish that eat these plants and animals  build up methylmercury in their tissue through a process known as  bioaccumulation.

According to the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP)\u2014a  public-private cooperative program that monitors atmospheric deposition  of mercury, among other pollutants\u2014atmospheric deposition is the  primary pathway by which mercury reaches waters in many parts of the  United States. Other studies report similar results. For example, a 2007  report to Congress by NOAA concludes that atmospheric deposition of  mercury is a significant source of mercury in the Great Lakes. However,  measuring mercury atmospheric deposition, especially dry deposition, is  scientifically challenging, and representatives from NADP told us that  there are significant data gaps on the amount of dry deposition across the  country. Additionally, there are factors other than the amount of mercury  in a waterbody that affect the amount of mercury in fish tissue. For  example, the amount of mercury that has been converted to  methylmercury\u2014the form of mercury that bioaccumulates in fish\u2014is  influenced by various factors such as the chemical composition of the  water. The amount of mercury in fish tissue also varies by the size and  species of fish present in the waterbody.

Other sources of NO emissions include fuel combustion, mainly  from power plants and industrial boilers, which accounted for an  estimated 28 percent of total estimated NO emissions. According to an  EPA official, the only international sources of NO emissions of any note  that reach the United States are in Canada and Mexico and, in general,  emissions from these sources do not impact U.S. waters.", "Ammonia emissions, like NO, can contribute to the atmospheric  deposition of nitrogen.

When states  identify waterbodies that are impaired\u2014that is, that do not meet CWA  water quality standards with existing controls\u2014the CWA requires states  to formally identify them as impaired, and generally to set a TMDL for  each pollutant that does not meet the standards. TMDLs are not self- implementing and CWA does not expressly require they be implemented;  states generally have the lead role for implementation. TMDL allocations  for permitted point sources are typically implemented via NPDES permits.  Relevant NPDES permits issued to facilities for point sources of that  pollutant must be consistent with the allocations established by the  TMDL, but there is no comparable permitting mechanism under the CWA  directly limiting pollutants from nonpoint sources. Nevertheless, states  must account for nonpoint sources of pollution in their TMDLs and may  include estimated reductions from those nonpoint sources. Where a state  provides EPA with \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that the reductions from  nonpoint sources of pollution identified in the TMDL will be achieved, EPA  often can allow NPDES permits for point sources of pollution identified in  the TMDL to be less stringent than they would have otherwise been.  EPA makes \u201creasonable assurance\u201d determinations based on factors  such as whether practices to reduce the nonpoint source pollutant are  technically feasible and likely to be implemented. While this creates an  incentive for a state to reduce pollution from nonpoint sources, the CWA  provides no direct requirement\u2014such as permitting\u2014that states  implement such reductions.", "A further challenge in using TMDLs to address atmospheric deposition is  that the pollution impairing a waterbody can originate outside of the state  responsible for implementing the TMDL. For example, pollutants travel in  the atmosphere and harm air quality and the environment in downwind  communities. To help address this challenge, EPA allows states some  flexibility in addressing these situations. Specifically, EPA allows states  with a waterbody impaired primarily from atmospheric sources of mercury  to defer developing a TMDL for that waterbody if the state is carrying out  a comprehensive mercury reduction program and demonstrates progress  in reducing in-state mercury sources. This approach provides a public  accounting of the status of mercury impaired waters and a way for states  to demonstrate progress in reducing in-state mercury sources. According  to an EPA document describing this approach, it may also be useful in  situations where other pollutants are primarily from atmospheric  deposition. However, according to EPA officials, this approach is intended  to encourage states to address in-state sources of mercury, and EPA has  not encouraged the use of this approach for other pollutants such as NO  or SO According to an EPA official, only a  small portion of projects that have been funded in this program have  addressed atmospheric deposition. According to the official, projects  typically involve source control\u2014slowing down stormwater flow to prevent  erosion or building fences to keep livestock out of streams\u2014but the  source of atmospheric deposition can be diffuse, as is the case with cars,  or originate in other countries, as is the case with mercury.

The purpose of the conference is to forge an  agreement to reduce the sources of nonpoint source pollution from the  states or regions contributing to the pollution.

The bay\u2019s watershed is contained within the boundaries  of the seven jurisdictions party to the TMDL, but the bay\u2019s NO airshed  extends beyond the seven jurisdictions\u2019 boundaries. According to EPA,  about 50 percent of the NO impacting the bay comes from sources  outside of the seven jurisdictions.

Figure 11 shows the  decline in NO and SOEPA has identified the following three key regulations or programs as  contributing to these reductions (1) CAA Title II emission standards for  moving sources (i.e., vehicle emission standards), (2) actions designed to  meet primary NAAQS, and (3) the Acid Rain Program. Neither the  vehicle emissions standards nor the actions to meet primary NAAQS are  designed to address the effect of NO and SO Vehicle  emission standards limit certain vehicles\u2019 emissions of pollutants,  including NO, to the greatest extent achievable through the application of  available technology, giving appropriate consideration to cost, energy,  and safety factors. Even with these reductions in pollutants, atmospheric  deposition continues to affect water quality and harm aquatic ecosystems.  EPA established primary NAAQS to provide public health protection,  including protecting the health of \u201csensitive\u201d populations such as  asthmatics, children, and the elderly, for six principal pollutants, which are  called \u201ccriteria\u201d pollutants to protect public health based on scientific  information on their effects. In contrast, the Acid Rain Program was  designed, in part, to address the effect of NO and SO on waterbodies.  The program implements CAA requirements for significant decreases in  the emissions of NO and SO  However, two broad trends\u2014recent environmental regulations and  changing market conditions\u2014could affect emissions from power plants.  Regarding environmental regulations, as we have previously reported,  beginning in June 2010, EPA proposed or finalized two key regulations  that would, among other things, reduce emissions of NO and SO from  coal-burning power plants, but the requirements and deadlines these  regulations may establish for power plants are uncertain. In particular,  both regulations have been challenged in federal court. For example,  EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in August 2011. The  regulation would have required reductions of certain emissions of air  pollutants, including NO and SO, in 28 states. The U.S. Court of  Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently issued an opinion that would strike  down the regulation, and EPA has asked the full court to rehear the case,  creating uncertainty as to what may be required from power plants in the  future to address such emissions. Regarding broader market conditions,  important market drivers have been weighing on the viability of coal- burning power plants. Key among these has been the recent decrease in  the price of natural gas, which has made it more attractive for power  companies to use natural gas instead of coal to generate electricity.  Power plants that use natural gas instead of coal to produce electricity  generally emit less NO and SO  Additionally, there have recently been key mobile source standards, like  the 2010 Emissions Control Area and the 2011 Heavy Duty Vehicle GHG  standards, which provide large reductions in both NOx and SOx from  ocean-going ships and heavy-duty trucks, respectively.  In addition,  according to EPA officials, the upcoming planned Tier 3 vehicle  standards, which are scheduled to be proposed in 2013, will provide  significant NOx reductions in the future.", "The reduced domestic emissions of NO and SO into the atmosphere are  having a beneficial impact on water quality and aquatic ecosystems,  according to EPA\u2019s 2011 report on the benefits and costs of the CAA.  The report analyzed how reductions in NO and SO According to the inventory, in 1990, these  two sources emitted about 108 tons of mercury; in 2008, they emitted less  than 2 tons of mercury. Mercury emissions from power plants also  declined from about 59 tons of mercury in 1990 to about 30 tons of  mercury in 2008. Figure 12 shows the decline in human-caused domestic  mercury emissions.", "EPA issued regulations in 1995 and 1997 under the CAA limiting mercury  emissions from municipal waste combustors and medical infectious waste  incinerators. They were not designed to address the effect of mercury  on waterbodies but were instead technology-based standards, as directed  by CAA. According to EPA, power plant emissions of mercury also  declined. Specifically, according to EPA, power plant emissions declined  primarily because of state rules targeting mercury emissions and CAA  regulations targeting emissions of other pollutants that incidentally also  reduced mercury emissions. Additionally, in February 2012, EPA  promulgated the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS),  establishing for the first time emission limitations on mercury and other  toxic pollutants from existing and new power plants. The rule was  challenged in federal court. Regarding the provisions for existing units at  power plants, the legal challenges are pending before the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Regarding the provisions applicable to  certain new units at power plants, EPA granted a petition for  reconsideration; the court proceedings are on hold, and the provisions will  not take effect before EPA completes that process, expected in March  2013. Similar to the regulations limiting mercury emissions from municipal  waste combustors and medical waste incinerators, MATS are technology- based standards, as directed by CAA, and thus are not designed or  established with the specific purpose of addressing the effect of mercury  emissions on waterbodies. EPA projects that MATS will reduce future  mercury emissions from power plants to about 9 tons by 2016, a 70  percent reduction from 2008. According to an EPA official, the reduced  emissions of mercury have lessened the amount of mercury deposition  into water because most mercury in water comes from atmospheric  deposition, but estimates of the amount of mercury that has been  prevented from depositing in water are difficult to determine. Even with  these reductions in mercury, atmospheric deposition continues to affect  water quality and harm aquatic ecosystems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA Faces Challenges in Addressing Atmospheric Deposition with Clean Air Act", "paragraphs": ["EPA faces challenges in using air regulations to further address the  effects of atmospheric deposition from NO, SO, and mercury.

Specifically, the CAA  requires that NAAQS be both national in scope and provide the requisite  degree of protection\u2014that is, that the standards are neither more nor less  stringent than necessary. Because many areas in the United States are  naturally resistant to the effects of acid rain due to underlying geological  conditions, EPA\u2019s approach was to establish a secondary NAAQS that  would apply nationwide but would account for differences in the sensitivity  to acid rain of ecosystems across the country. As part of this approach,  EPA identified 84 regions, referred to as ecoregions, based on ecological  factors relevant to acid rain in aquatic ecosystems. The 84 ecoregions  cover the contiguous United States. However, in the notice for its April  2012 final rule on secondary NAAQS, EPA concluded that it could not  determine with an acceptable degree of scientific certainty that the  secondary NAAQS under this approach would provide the requisite  degree of protection for each ecoregion because of uncertainties related  to ecological and atmospheric modeling and limitations in available field  data. An important piece of field data needed to determine the requisite  degree of protection is \u201ccritical load\u201d\u2014the amount of acid rain that an area  can experience before ecological damage occurs. The number of critical  load estimates for the 84 ecoregions ranged from about 700 estimates for  one ecoregion to less than five estimates for several ecoregions.", "To address the uncertainty related to modeling and field data, EPA has  begun a 5-year field pilot program to enhance its understanding of the  degree of protectiveness that would likely be afforded by a secondary  NAAQS using its new approach. EPA described the pilot program in its  April 2012 final rule notice, stating that the program would serve to inform  future reviews of NAAQS to address acid rain. However, according to an  EPA official, the pilot program is a \u201cproof of concept\u201d project and not  designed specifically to obtain sufficient scientific data to meet applicable  legal standards for establishing secondary NAAQS. The official said that  three sites have been chosen from which to gather additional data, but  that resource constraints prevent EPA from moving forward with two of  those areas. It is unclear if the agency will be able to address the  scientific uncertainties related to ecological and atmospheric modeling  and limitations in available field data in time for the next 5-year interval for  reviewing NAAQS and establishing a secondary NAAQS under its  innovative approach. According to agency officials, EPA has not identified  alternative strategies to address the acidification of aquatic ecosystems if  it cannot resolve the scientific uncertainties.", "EPA also faces challenges in addressing the contribution of NO to  nutrient over-enrichment under the CAA. EPA announced in its 2011  notice for its proposed rule on secondary NAAQS that it would not  consider establishing an additional secondary NAAQS to address other  effects from atmospheric deposition associated with NO and SO to nutrient over-enrichment in aquatic  ecosystems, because of the limited quantity and quality of available  scientific data relative to that available for acid rain. According to an EPA  official, establishing a secondary NAAQS for NOx to protect against  nutrient over-enrichment in a waterbody would be difficult because there  can be many sources of nitrogen unrelated to atmospheric deposition,  and these sources can be the dominant contributor of nitrogen to the  waterbody.", "Furthermore, in a 2011 report, the EPA Science Advisory Board made  recommendations regarding the adverse effects of nitrogen from all  sources on water quality and aquatic ecosystems, as well as the effects  of nitrogen on biodiversity, forests, and human health, among other  effects. In response, EPA announced in 2012 that it will develop a  \u201cNitrogen Roadmap\u201d that identifies how it will foster research, program  implementation, and policy integration for nitrogen and other pollutants  across the agency. According to EPA officials, the roadmap is a scoping  document that will precede more concrete steps to develop an integrated  nitrogen research strategy to address acidification and nutrient over- enrichment. The goals of the strategy are to ensure coordination among  research areas within EPA, and among EPA scientists and policy  analysts. An EPA official also noted that developing partnerships with  other federal agencies, state and local governments, and  nongovernmental organizations, will be an important step that will help  foster nonregulatory solutions to address nutrient over-enrichment.  According to the official, the roadmap is scheduled to be released in  2013, but the effort to address nutrient over-enrichment will likely be long- term. This effort may lead to more suitable approaches to address  nutrient over-enrichment than establishing secondary NAAQS by  themselves.", "EPA also faces challenges in addressing mercury contamination because  most mercury atmospheric deposition within the continental United States  comes from sources that are outside of the scope of EPA\u2019s authority.  According to a 2010 National Research Council report, studies suggest  that 10 percent to 80 percent of the mercury deposited in the contiguous  United States is from human-caused domestic emissions\u2014depending on  location\u2014with an average of about 30 percent for the country as a  whole. According to the report, the remainder comes from natural  sources, human-caused emissions from other countries, and the global  pool of mercury. The United States is responsible for a relative small  percentage of the global mercury emissions that contribute to the global  pool of mercury. According to the 2008 UNEP report, total global  emissions of mercury from human activity in 2005 ranged from 1,300 tons  to 3,200 tons. According to data EPA used for the MATS rule, domestic  mercury emissions from human activity totaled about 105 tons in 2005.  Thus, even without reductions in mercury emissions beyond the 2005  level, over 90 percent of human-caused mercury emissions originate  outside of the United States.", "EPA is involved in international negotiations to limit global mercury  releases into the environment. In February 2009, the Governing Council  of the UNEP agreed on the need to develop a global, legally binding  agreement on mercury to reduce risks to human health and the  environment, including reducing atmospheric emissions of mercury. The  council outlined a negotiating process to reach an agreement. The first  negotiation meeting was held in June 2010, and the fifth and final meeting  is scheduled to be held in 2013. The third negotiating session (held in  October and November 2011) produced a draft text of the agreement.  The draft text includes language for consideration that would call on  parties to the agreement that have significant aggregate mercury  emissions from listed source categories to adopt national or numeric  emission reduction goals that are, at a minimum, consistent with best  available practices for reducing and, where feasible, eliminating  atmospheric mercury emissions from sources such as coal-burning power  plants.

The ATTAINS data we analyzed  were the most recent available data from states and not the most current  reporting-cycle year, 2012, because these 2012 data are undergoing  review. Because some states are more current than others in reporting,  the state data we analyzed for a given state could be from any reporting  cycle year from 2002 to 2010, depending on the state. Our analysis also  included data from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,  Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth  of Northern Mariana Islands. ATTAINS also included data from the  Delaware River Basin Commission, but we excluded these data in our  analysis because EPA does not include it in its reports or queries related  to the quality of the nation\u2019s waters. In analyzing the data, we first  identified how many miles, acres, or square miles of waters in each  waterbody category in ATTAINS were assessed and classified as  impaired. The ATTAINS database contained 10 different categories of  waters. However, we did not report on coastal waters, ocean and near  coastal waters, wetlands, Great Lakes shoreline, inland lake shoreline,  and Great Lakes connecting channels because states have only  assessed a small percentage of these waters, and there was insufficient  data or, in the case of Great Lakes shoreline, because we were reporting  on Great Lakes open water.

Our analysis of ATTAINS data represents only those waters  that states have assessed and associated with atmospheric deposition as  an impairment source. It is possible that additional impairment due to  atmospheric deposition has occurred, but that states either did not report  atmospheric deposition as an impairment source in ATTAINS or reported  it as unknown or unspecified.
