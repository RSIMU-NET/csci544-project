Since 2014, CMS has not estimated improper payments due to erroneous eligibility determinations; it plans to report these estimates in November 2019. GAO found that for fiscal year 2017 Medicaid expansion enrollees accounted for nearly a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees and federal Medicaid expenditures. GAO's prior work has identified gaps in CMS oversight, which affects the federal match. An accurate determination of eligibility is critical to ensuring that only eligible individuals are enrolled, that they are enrolled in the correct eligibility group, and that states' expenditures are appropriately matched with federal funds for Medicaid enrollees. GAO recommended that CMS conduct reviews of federal Medicaid eligibility determinations to ascertain their accuracy and institute corrective actions where necessary, and revise the sampling methodology for reviewing expenditures for the expansion population. CMS concurred with these recommendations, though has since indicated that it will not revise the sampling methodology. We continue to believe that additional steps are needed to fully implement these recommendations.", "Better Medicaid data. Improvements in Medicaid data could aid program oversight to ensure that only eligible beneficiaries are enrolled. CMS officials acknowledged the need for improved data and cited the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) initiative as its primary effort\u2014conducted jointly with states\u2014to improve the collection of Medicaid expenditure and utilization data. According to CMS officials, aspects of T-MSIS are designed to broaden the scope and improve the quality of state-reported data, as well as the data's usefulness to states. GAO made a series of recommendations related to T-MSIS. CMS concurred with the recommendations, but some have not been fully implemented, including expediting the use of T-MSIS data for oversight, and outlining a plan and associated time frames for using the data for oversight.", "Further federal-state collaboration needed for oversight and appropriate enrollment. GAO has previously reported that collaborative activities between the federal government and the states are important to improving oversight of the Medicaid program. CMS has ongoing efforts to engage state agencies and others through a national Medicaid training program for state officials and partnerships to combat Medicaid fraud. Recently, steps were taken to better enable state auditors to audit states' eligibility determinations to ensure beneficiaries qualify for the Medicaid program and are enrolled in the correct eligibility group. GAO has previously suggested that CMS could leverage the unique qualifications of state auditors and help improve program integrity by further providing state auditors with a substantive and ongoing role in auditing state Medicaid programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the importance of ensuring that  only eligible individuals are enrolled in the Medicaid program.

With regard to eligibility, states are primarily  responsible for verifying eligibility and enrolling Medicaid beneficiaries.  These responsibilities include  verifying and validating individuals\u2019 eligibility at the time of application  and periodically thereafter, accurately assigning enrollees to the appropriate eligibility group, and promptly disenrolling individuals who are not eligible.", "PPACA requires states to use third-party sources of data to verify  eligibility to the extent practicable. Consequently, states have had to  make changes to their eligibility systems, including implementing  electronic systems for eligibility determination and coordinating systems  to share information. In addition, states have had to make changes to  reflect new sources of documentation and income used for verification.

These results, while illustrative of the challenges of assuring accurate  eligibility determinations, cannot be generalized.", "With respect to CMS\u2019s reviews of eligibility determinations, in 2015, we  also found that CMS did not review federal Medicaid eligibility  determinations in the states that delegated such authority to the federal  government. Based on our findings, we made the following  recommendations.", "CMS should use information obtained from state and federal eligibility  reviews to inform the agency\u2019s review of expenditures for different  eligibility groups in order to ensure that expenditures are reported  correctly and matched appropriately. In February 2019, we considered  this recommendation implemented, as CMS confirmed that it was  sharing information between its eligibility reviews and quarterly  expenditure reviews regarding Medicaid expansion enrollees.", "CMS should conduct reviews of federal Medicaid eligibility  determinations to ascertain their accuracy and institute corrective  action plans where necessary. CMS has taken some action to review  federal eligibility determinations; however, until the review results are  publicly reported, which CMS expects to occur in November 2019, this  recommendation is not fully implemented. We will continue to monitor  CMS\u2019s implementation of this recommendation.", "In August 2018, we reported that improvements in oversight of state  expenditures could help CMS ensure that individuals are enrolled in the  correct Medicaid eligibility group. CMS processes for reviewing  expenditures reported by states and FMAP rates collectively have had a  considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that  reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through  2017. However, we identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its  resources to address risks when reviewing whether states\u2019 expenditures  are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements.

Specifically, as we noted in a 2015 report, CMS\u2019s sampling review of  expansion expenditures was not linked to or informed by reviews of  eligibility determinations conducted by CMS, some of which identified  high levels of eligibility determination errors.", "To address these weaknesses, we made three recommendations,  including that the Administrator of CMS revise the sampling methodology  for reviewing expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population to  better target reviews to areas of high risk. CMS concurred with this  recommendation, but in November 2018, CMS officials indicated that  given the agency\u2019s resources, they believe the current sampling  methodology is sufficient and have no plans to revise it.
