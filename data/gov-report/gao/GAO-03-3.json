The Postal Service is intended to be self-supporting from postal operations  and is mandated to break even over time. With nearly 800,000 career  employees, the Postal Service is the second largest employer compared  with U.S. private sector organizations.

Stage three requires that an organization continually assess  proposed and ongoing projects as parts of a complete investment portfolio:  an integrated and competing set of investment options. This approach  enables the organization to consider the relative cost, benefit, and risk of  newly proposed investments along with those previously funded and to  identify the optimal mix of IT investments to meet its mission, strategies,  and goals.

In addition, without these policies and procedures, the Postal  Service lacks the transparency that is helpful in both communicating and  demonstrating how project oversight is performed.", "Second, the Postal Service\u2019s investment boards do not adequately oversee  project performance by comparing actual cost data to expectations.  Specifically, while the Establish Team and CTO Investment Review Board  each compare actual cost data to annual budget expectations, the Postal  Service could not demonstrate that these boards compared the data to  original expectations established in the DAR. In addition, while the  Investment Highlights used by executives to monitor project performance  contains schedule information, it does not contain complete information  on actual project costs because it does not report operating expenses.  Without comparisons of complete actual cost data to original expectations,  Postal Service executives may not be able to easily determine whether the  projects they have selected are progressing as planned or whether  corrective actions are needed.", "Table 4 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for project oversight at the stage two level of maturity and  summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IT Project and System Information Is Maintained to Support Project Management", "paragraphs": ["To make good management decisions, an organization must know how  funds are being expended toward acquiring, maintaining, and deploying its  IT investments.

According to officials from the CTO  organization, decisions on succession management are usually made  between business unit managers and CTO office staff (e.g., portfolio  managers), but no individual or group has been assigned responsibility for  managing the succession process from an enterprise perspective, which  would allow the Postal Service to better anticipate future resource  requirements. Finally, the Postal Service has neither defined the criteria for  identifying investments that may meet succession status nor taken steps to  regularly analyze IT investments for possible succession.", "According to CTO organization officials, the Postal Service has retired or  replaced roughly 250 systems since 1998. However, this was not done  within the structure of an institutionalized succession management  process. Postal Service officials have stated that IT investments are  reviewed, for example, during the annual budget formulation process to  analyze them for possible succession. However, without an  institutionalized process for succession management, the Postal Service  may not be able to identify those IT investments that are eligible for  succession in enough time to minimize the effect of the transition on their  successors.", "Table 18 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for managing the succession of systems and technology at  the stage four level of maturity and summarizes the evidence that supports  these ratings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Activities for Benchmarking the Investment Process Are Not Institutionalized", "paragraphs": ["In stages two through four, organizations ensure that sound investments  are selected, controlled, and evaluated within the context of the IT  investment management process and the enterprisewide portfolio.

First, the CTO has developed a plan for a  corporate database called the Corporate Data Mart, which could serve as a  repository of data from 35 separate Postal Service systems. According to  Postal Service officials, the CTO organization is working with each  functional unit to determine which legacy systems will transition to the  data mart and plans to incorporate future systems in the data mart. This  transition may eliminate costly legacy systems or avoid the investment cost  to replace them. The CTO organization is sponsoring the Advanced  Computing Environment initiative to transition to a less costly distributed  computing environment.

The plan should be developed  within 6 months. At a minimum, the plan should specify an approach to  develop comprehensive guidance that defines and describes the  complete investment management process, unifies existing processes  enterprisewide, and reflects changes in processes as they occur;  develop additional process guidance, as needed, to completely define  the operations and decision-making processes of investment boards and  other management entities involved in managing IT investments;  ensure that cost, benefit, schedule, and risk expectations are set and  approved in the original business case for each investment; that  accurate and complete actual cost, benefit, schedule, and risk data are  tracked against these expectations; and that status information on these  four criteria is periodically reported to executive-level investment  boards; and  establish a structured, transparent, and documented portfolio selection  process that assesses, prioritizes, selects, and funds investments  according to established portfolio selection criteria, including explicit  cost, benefit, schedule, and risk criteria.", "The Postmaster General should ensure that the plan specifies measurable  goals and time frames, prioritizes initiatives, designates a senior manager  responsible and accountable for directing and controlling the  improvements, and establishes review milestones.

While guidance for cost  studies does exist, the Service provided evidence of only three post- implementation cost studies having been conducted since 1990. The Postal  Service\u2019s budget process does not satisfactorily address this critical  process. Specifically, the budget process does not capture lessons learned  and disseminate them to other projects and work processes in order to  improve them, and this is a major objective of post-implementation  reviews.
