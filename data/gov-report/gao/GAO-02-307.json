The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) made progress in referring eligible delinquent debts for collection during fiscal year 2001. Much of the referral volume was late in the year, however, and substantial unreferred balances remained at the end of the fiscal year. Inadequate procedures and controls hampered prompt identification and referral of both eligible non-Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) and MSP debts. The delayed referral of non-MSP debts resulted from problems with the CMS debt-referral system and insufficient CMS monitoring of contractor referrals.

Toward this  end, DCIA requires that agencies refer eligible debts delinquent more than  180 days that they have been unable to collect to the Department of the  Treasury for payment offset and to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt  collection center for cross-servicing.  Treasury performs payment offset  through its Treasury Offset Program (TOP), which includes the offset of  certain benefit payments, vendor payments, and tax refunds. Cross- servicing involves such actions as locating debtors, issuing demand letters,  and referring debts to private collection agencies.", "As you know, we testified on (1) problems we identified in selected federal  agencies\u2019 processes and controls for identifying and referring eligible debts  to Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) for collection action,  (2) obstacles that hampered agencies from promptly referring eligible  debts, and (3) problems we identified related to the appropriateness of  exclusions from referral requirements.", "This report provides additional detail on the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) progress in implementing the debt-referral  requirements of DCIA to collect delinquent Medicare debts and includes  several recommendations.

The agency had implemented pilot referral  projects for its two major types of Medicare debt:  (1) Medicare Secondary  Payer (MSP) debts, for which insurance or other entities are primarily  financially responsible and CMS is seeking reimbursement, and (2) other  debts, referred to as non-MSP debts.  CMS was referring delinquent  Medicare debts to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  Program Support Center (PSC), a Treasury-designated debt collection  center for certain HHS debts.  However, we reported that under the pilot  projects, contractors referred only older, large-dollar-value Medicare debts,  thereby excluding from referral a significant amount of debt and, in  particular, more recent, lower-dollar-value claims.  Collection industry  statistics indicate that low-dollar-value and current debts are typically  easier to collect than large-dollar-value and older debts.  In the September  2000 report, we recommended that CMS (1) immediately refer all Medicare  debts to PSC as soon as they become more than 180 days delinquent and  are determined to be eligible for referral and (2) refer the backlog of  eligible debts as quickly as possible.", "For this report, we were to follow up to determine whether (1) CMS was  promptly referring eligible Medicare debts for collection action, (2) any  obstacles were hampering CMS from referring eligible Medicare debts, and  (3) CMS was appropriately using exclusions from referral requirements.At the time of our review, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) was  conducting detailed testing of CMS\u2019s implementation of DCIA and the  effectiveness of CMS\u2019s debt collection and debt management activities.  According to an OIG official, the OIG\u2019s report on its findings is scheduled  for release in March 2002.  As part of its work, the OIG tested selected  debts to determine whether CMS appropriately categorized their status,  including their exclusion status (e.g., in bankruptcy, under appeal).  Therefore, as agreed with your office, we did not test whether selected  CMS debts had been reasonably excluded from referral, and we reached no  overall conclusion about the appropriateness of CMS exclusions.

MSP debts arise when  Medicare pays for a service that is subsequently determined to be the  financial responsibility of another payer.  Cases that result in MSP debts  include those in which beneficiaries have (1) other health insurance  furnished by their employer or their spouse\u2019s employer (or, in certain  instances, another family member) that covers the medical services  provided, (2) occupational injuries, illnesses, and conditions covered by  workers\u2019 compensation, and (3) injuries, illnesses, and conditions  related to a liability or no-fault insurance settlement, judgment, or  award.", "Non-MSP debts.  Although Medicare is phasing out this payment  method, Medicare has paid certain institutional providers interim  amounts based on their historical service to beneficiaries.  Medicare  contractors retrospectively adjust these payments based on their review  of provider costs. When a provider's cost-reporting year is over, the  provider files a report specifying its costs of serving Medicare  beneficiaries. Cost report debts arise when the cost report settlement  process, which includes audits and reviews by Medicare contractors,  determines that the amount an institution was paid based on its cost  report exceeds the final settlement amount.  Another type of non-MSP  debt related to cost reporting is unfiled cost report debt.  If an  institutional provider fails to submit a timely cost report, CMS  establishes an unfiled cost report debt.  The amount of the debt equals  the full amount disbursed for the year in which the provider failed to  submit a timely report. Most providers have an ongoing business  relationship with the Medicare program; therefore, contractors are able  to collect most non-MSP debts by offsetting subsequent Medicare  payments to providers.  However, if offsetting subsequent payments  does not fully liquidate the debt (e.g., because the provider has left the  Medicare program), unpaid balances more than 180 days delinquent are  subject to DCIA\u2019s debt-referral requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collection Services for CMS Medicare Debts", "paragraphs": ["CMS refers its eligible MSP and non-MSP debts to PSC, which provides  debt management services for certain HHS operating divisions.

In addition, we identified $21 million of debts that 1  of the 2 non-MSP pilot contractors had misclassified on the CMS debt- tracking system as bankruptcy debt and ineligible for referral.  These debts  had actually been dismissed from the bankruptcy proceedings and  therefore should have been reported in the debt-tracking system as eligible  for referral.  In this case, the contractor had not updated its own internal  system for $8 million of the debts and was therefore not pursuing  postdismissal collection actions on them.

Inadequate contractor monitoring, resulting  partly from CMS\u2019s debt system limitations, has contributed to the slow pace  of MSP debt referrals.  In addition, CMS has not begun referring certain  types of eligible Medicare debts, such as MSP liability debts, and those  debts will continue to age until CMS completes and implements a  comprehensive referral plan.  Since recovery rates decrease dramatically  as debts age, CMS cannot accomplish DCIA\u2019s purpose of maximizing  collection of federal nontax debt unless it refers eligible debts promptly.", "CMS\u2019s policy of closing out eligible MSP debts solely on the basis of their  age, without performing a quantitative study to determine whether  collection action would be cost-effective, has also reduced referrals and  eliminated opportunities for potential collections on those debts.

According to CMS, medical services at issue in these  MSP debts are typically from the early 1990s and often involve Medicare  services from the mid- to late 1980s.  CMS indicated that the costs of  validating the debts and the costs and fees associated with DCIA cross- servicing and TOP were too great to justify additional collection efforts.  However, as we stated in the report, CMS could not provide any  documentation to support its position that it is not cost-effective to attempt  to collect older MSP debts, and CMS did not test this assumption in its MSP  pilot project.", "CMS\u2019s efforts to collect this debt prior to close-out were not adequate.  The  Federal Claims Collection Standards require that before terminating  collection activity, agencies are to pursue all appropriate means of  collection and determine, based on the results of the collection activity,  that the debt is uncollectible.  According to discussions with Medicare  contractor officials, the collection activity for many of these MSP debts  was limited to issuance of demand letters, which does not satisfy the  requirement that all appropriate means of collection action be pursued on  debts.  In addition, most of the closed-out MSP debts at the Medicare  contractors we visited were less than 10 years delinquent and therefore  could have been referred to PSC for collection action, including reporting  to TOP.
