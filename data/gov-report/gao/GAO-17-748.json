VHA is reviewing about 800 existing national policy documents to eliminate those that no longer meet its new definitions, and to rescind or recertify those that are outdated. At this time, VHA is not planning to review guidance documents, such as program office memos and standard operating procedures, to assess whether they align with its updated directive, because there is no central repository for these documents and it would be too resource intensive to locate all of them. Further, GAO's review found\u2014contrary to VHA's updated directive\u2014that program offices are continuing to use memos to issue policy. The continued use of program office memos to establish national policy undermines VHA's efforts to improve its policy management.", "VHA has a standard process for making national policy documents accessible to VA medical centers (VAMC) and the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) to which the medical centers report, but lacks a process for making guidance documents accessible. VHA makes national policy documents accessible to all organizational levels through a publications website and e-mail distribution list as outlined in its June 2016 directive. However, GAO found that VHA has not established a similar process for program offices to make guidance documents accessible at the local level. Specifically, there is no central repository, such as a publications website, for guidance documents, and the program offices do not track or consistently disseminate the guidance documents they issue. Without a standard process for consistently maintaining and disseminating guidance, VHA lacks assurance that staff receive and follow the same guidance, as intended.", "VHA does not routinely collect information on local challenges with national policy implementation or on exemption waivers. The four VISNs and eight VAMCs in GAO's review reported various challenges they face when implementing national policy, such as resource constraints and undefined time frames. In instances where VAMCs cannot meet policy requirements, program offices may approve policy exemption waivers on an ad hoc basis. However, GAO found that VHA lacks complete information on approved policy exemption waivers because it does not have a standard process for approving, tracking, and reassessing them. In recognition of this issue, VHA established a committee to develop a waiver process in June 2017.", "VISNs and VAMCs in GAO's review develop and maintain various local policies, but VHA does not ensure that they align with national policies.

As part of this  effort, ORAA plans to move any relevant content to other policy and  guidance documents as appropriate. For example, ORAA is incorporating  handbooks into their related directives. VHA noted that this  consolidation should help reduce any redundancy and inconsistency  when multiple documents articulate different aspects of a single policy.  This will also help VHA ensure that when national policy is updated, the  update will also include a review of relevant information currently found in  other policy documents.

ORAA officials noted that the definitions for what  constitutes national policy and guidance documents are still evolving.", "According to our review of ORAA information, almost 60 percent of the  788 policy documents identified for transition under the new definitions  were outdated in October 2015. As part of its transition, ORAA is taking  outdated documents and either rescinding them or recertifying the ones  that are still relevant. VHA\u2019s recertification process involves assessing  whether a national policy document still serves a purpose and should be  updated accordingly, or is no longer needed and should be rescinded or  combined with another policy. Officials from most VISNs and VAMCs in  our review told us that unless a policy has been rescinded, they continue  to follow it, even if past its recertification date.

(See  figure 3.) Much of the reduction has been driven by rescinding manuals  and information letters. The number of directives and handbooks has not  changed substantially; this is due, in part, to the continuation of policies  reaching their recertification dates and the publication of new or changed  policies.

ORAA officials stated this may be due to the lengthy  national policy review process, which they said took an average of 317  days in fiscal year 2016. Program offices use memos for a variety of  purposes, including clarifications or updates to issued directives, data  collection requests, information about policies or procedures while a  directive is under development, and the provision of training information.

Specifically, VHA Directive 6330 states that a  notice should be used to establish interim policy until a directive can be  developed. However, VHA has mostly used notices to issue rescissions  of previous policy documents, and memos continue to be used to  establish policy. For example, we identified a 10N memo that instructed  VAMCs to immediately implement changes to ongoing professional  practice evaluations and peer review requirements for VAMC chiefs of  staff. In another instance, officials at one VAMC noted that, at the time of  our visit, they had already received 32 changes to the Veterans Choice  Program since 2014 through non-policy documents, including memos.  Using program office memos\u2014instead of the appropriate policy vehicle\u2014 to issue policy is problematic in light of VHA\u2019s new policy and guidance  document definitions. Additionally, unlike national policy, program office  memos are not internally vetted and are not subject to recertification, as  described below.", "Lack of internal vetting. Memos are not subject to a formal review  process and can be issued quickly once signed. VHA noted in its high-risk  action plan that 10N memos are the predominant source of guidance  documents, and have been used to create policy without being vetted by  other agency offices or VA\u2019s labor management relations group. Without  such a vetting process, VHA leadership and other officials in the  organization do not always have input on or even awareness of the  potential impact of policy issued through these memos.

Unlike national policy documents, memos  are not subject to recertification and are therefore typically not rescinded.  Officials from some of the VISNs and VAMCs in our review described  challenges when outdated memos are not rescinded, including questions  about whether the memo should still be applied to local practices. For  example, one VAMC wanted to use a certain non-VA care option for  radiation oncology services, but a memo that was over a year old  instructed local facilities to use a different non-VA care option. Since that  memo had not been rescinded, VAMC officials said that they could not  use their preferred non-VA care option to avoid delays in care.", "ORAA is taking steps to address program offices\u2019 use of memos to issue  policy, but it is only focusing on 10N memos at this time. ORAA officials  told us they have agreed with the Deputy USH for Operations and  Management to have a 5-year recertification date for 10N memos,  although this has yet to go into effect. They are also reviewing and  assessing guidance documents submitted by program offices to see  whether the content should be in a different document type, such as a  directive. However, ORAA officials noted that they are not sure whether  they have sufficient staff to sustain these reviews. Without further steps to  clarify how and when program office memos should be used, the  continued use of these memos by program offices may undermine VHA\u2019s  efforts to implement new policy and guidance definitions, as intended.

Officials from  the four VISNs and eight VAMCs in our review outlined a variety of  challenges they face when implementing national policy, including  insufficient or undefined time frames and conflicting policies on the same  topic.", "Insufficient or undefined time frames. Officials from most of the VISNs  and VAMCs in our review told us that it is difficult to implement policies  with insufficient or undefined time frames. For example, officials from one  VAMC told us that a national policy sometimes does not specify required  implementation time frames, and as a result, the expectations for when  VAMCs should complete implementation are not clear. VHA officials told  us that there is no VHA-wide standard for specifying time frames for  completing implementation of national policy.", "Resource constraints. Officials from most of the VISNs and VAMCs in  our review identified resource constraints as an implementation challenge  for certain policies, such as those with stringent staffing and building  space requirements. For example, officials from one VISN told us that its  facilities were required to have a certain type of surgeon available, which  proved challenging to recruit and retain for smaller, more rural VAMCs.  Additionally, officials from another VAMC said that one national policy  required mental health patients to have access to a safe outdoor space,  which would be difficult to implement without major construction and at  least 5 years to plan. Officials said that to comply with this policy, they  plan to have staff walk patients outside. However, this reduces the  available staff on the mental health unit during this time. Because local  situations may vary, VHA program office officials told us that it is difficult  to specify resource needs in national policy that applies across all VISNs  and VAMCs.", "Not specific to VAMC complexity level. Officials from most of the  VISNs and VAMCs in our review noted that the lack of tailoring for a  facility\u2019s complexity level makes national policy implementation difficult.  As a result, officials stated that level 2 (medium complexity) and 3 (low  complexity) VAMCs are often expected to adhere to the same policy  requirements as level 1 (high complexity) VAMCs. For example, officials  noted that policies requiring 24-hour physician coverage for specialties  such as emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, and suicide prevention  are challenging for complexity level 2 and 3 VAMCs, which may not have  sufficient patient volume or staffing resources. Officials from one program  office explained that complexity level is not addressed in national policy,  but may be addressed in a standard operating procedure or local policy.  Officials from VHA\u2019s Office of Organizational Excellence told us that  national policies are intended to be written broadly for VAMCs of all  complexity levels. However, other VHA officials acknowledged that  policies are written for facilities that fully operate a service or program,  and have the capability to implement all of its accompanying policy  requirements, which are usually level 1 (high complexity) facilities.", "Conflicting policies on the same topic. A few VISNs and VAMCs in our  review noted implementation challenges when more than one program  office has responsibility for the same policy area, and they do not  collaborate when issuing policies on the same topic. For example,  officials from one VAMC told us that they were unsure what humidity  levels they should follow for sterile processing services when the national  policy from one program office stated that the humidity level must be at  60 percent, which was contradictory to a national policy from another  program office that stated humidity levels must be at 55 percent.", "Officials from some of the VISNs and VAMCs in our review told us that  obtaining input on national policy prior to issuance\u2014particularly from  those responsible for policy implementation\u2014could help VHA to identify  and mitigate many of the challenges that impede local policy  implementation. For example, officials from three VISNs and two VAMCs  told us that the terminology changes to VHA\u2019s updated scheduling policy  issued in July 2016 caused confusion for staff. Additionally, officials from  one VISN and one VAMC told us that terminology changes led to different  interpretations and variation in implementation across VAMCs, which may  have been mitigated through prior feedback discussions.", "In December 2016, ORAA instituted a new process to obtain comments  on draft national policy that includes posting policy documents for a 2- week period on a SharePoint site. All VHA officials, including those in  VISNs and VAMCs, have access to the site and are able to comment. In  addition, ORAA has plans to develop a pre-policy form that would require  program offices to provide information on the policy\u2019s purpose, whether it  conflicts with other VHA policy, metrics to measure implementation,  identification of any new resources needed, a cost analysis, and a  communications plan for VISNs and VAMCs. VHA officials told us that  the pre-policy form could be another mechanism to collect information on  potential implementation challenges. However, VHA officials have yet to  finalize it.", "Officials from several VISNs and VAMCs in our review said it also would  be helpful for VHA to collect feedback from them after policy  implementation to identify and address any unanticipated difficulties.  Some program offices in our review already collect feedback on their own  policies after implementation; however, this is not done systematically.  According to standards for internal control in the federal government,  management should internally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s operational objectives. In doing so,  management can obtain relevant information from reliable internal  sources.

Furthermore, program offices are not required to reassess  approved waivers to determine whether they are still warranted.", "No standard submission or approval process. VHA does not have an  established waiver exemption process that would standardize how  program offices manage the submission and approval of waivers. As a  result, program offices managed waiver submission and approval on an  ad hoc basis, although certain national policies may specify a process for  how VAMCs should submit a waiver. If a process for submitting waivers  is not specified for a policy, it is up to a VAMC to create and submit one  for its facility\u2019s needs. For example, one VAMC had a waiver approved  through e-mail and a conference call, and another VAMC had a waiver  approved after a site visit.", "No central tracking. VHA does not centrally track approved policy  exemption waivers, and as a result, it does not know how many local  facilities are not implementing national policy as intended.

In addition, appropriately allocating the necessary resources will be  critical to VHA\u2019s ability to continue making improvements in this area as  resource constraints continue to be an overarching impediment.", "A number of systemic problems have contributed to the inconsistent  implementation of national policy at the local level. Most notably, despite  its newly revised directive on policy management, VHA\u2019s program offices  continue to issue policy through mechanisms such as memos that are not  defined as policy vehicles. Policy issued in such a manner can also be  contradictory or outdated because it is not subject to a formal review  process or periodically recertified. Additionally, VISNs and VAMCs may  not be receiving or following the same memos and other issued guidance  because VHA lacks a standard dissemination process or central  repository for these documents. Furthermore, VHA does not have the  ability to identify concerns associated with local implementation of  national policies because it does not systematically collect information  about challenges, before or after implementation. It also has not  established a standard process for issuing and managing policy  exemption waivers that may be granted to VAMCs. Compounding these  problems is the lack of a process, including designated oversight roles, to  ensure that the myriad of local policies established by VISNs and VAMCs  are appropriately aligned with national policies.
