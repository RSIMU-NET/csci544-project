The Stafford Act is an expansion of the first permanent authority (P.L. 81-875) enacted in 1950 to provide disaster assistance on a continuing basis without the need for congressional action. Over the years, the Congress has generally increased eligibility for public assistance through legislation that expanded the categories of assistance and/or specified persons or organizations eligible to receive assistance.

For fiscal years 1989 through 1994, USDA received about $494 million in appropriations for this program. Also, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers funds 80 percent of the costs to repair qualifying flood-damaged nonfederal levees.

We selected these field locations because of their responsibility for administering the public assistance program for the Northridge earthquake and other significant disasters. At the field locations, we documented the steps involved in approving projects and reviewed files pertaining to specific public assistance projects. We also interviewed officials of FEMA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) and reviewed OIG reports pertaining to public assistance generally and to specific disasters.

We also examined the relevant financial standards and requirements posed by the Office of Management and Budget. Because FEMA\u2019s process involves audits, we interviewed OIG officials, including the Deputy Inspector General, and obtained OIG and contractors\u2019 audit reports of public assistance projects. We also obtained from the OIG information about the extent of its audit coverage. We also interviewed and obtained documents from the Price-Waterhouse auditors contracted by FEMA.", "To identify the changes in eligibility criteria that could potentially reduce the costs of public assistance in the future, we examined published literature and reports, including reports by FEMA\u2019s Inspector General.

(Because of limitations on the availability of FEMA\u2019s financial data, we were generally unable to estimate the potential impacts on public assistance expenditures.) We specifically surveyed these officials because they work closely with the program on a day-to-day basis and are knowledgeable about the application of FEMA\u2019s public assistance criteria. To balance their perspectives, we also asked the National Emergency Management Association\u2014an organization of state emergency management officials\u2014and the Association of State Floodplain Managers to comment on the proposals cited by the FEMA regional officials.

Among the more problematic issues is determining the standards (building codes) that are applicable to repair/restoration work, which in turn affect decisions on whether facilities should be repaired or replaced.", "Generally, FEMA\u2019s criteria define eligible work as that needed to restore the facility on the basis of the design of the facility as it existed immediately before the disaster and in accordance with certain other conditions; in some instances, grant funds may be used to replace a facility entirely or for an alternative facility. One condition is that permanent restoration work must comply with the applicable standards. Such standards must apply to the type of repair or restoration being performed (for example, there may be different standards for repair and for new construction); be appropriate to the pre-disaster use of the facility; be in writing and formally adopted by the applicant before the project is apply uniformly to all similar types of facilities within the jurisdiction of the owner of the facility; and if in effect at the time of the disaster, have been enforced during the time they were in effect.", "Furthermore, to be considered \u201capplicable,\u201d the standards must be in a formally adopted written ordinance of the jurisdiction in which the facility is located, or be a state or federal requirement. The standards do not necessarily have to be in effect at the time of the disaster; if the applicant adopts new standards before FEMA has approved the damage survey report for the permanent restoration of a facility in the jurisdiction, the work done to meet these standards may be eligible for public assistance. As discussed in chapter 4, FEMA regional officials cited a need to better define the authority with the ability to adopt and approve standards. They suggested that clarifying the language in the regulations to define who has the authority to adopt and approve standards might reduce the costs and the confusion that surrounds this issue.", "Also, to be applicable to the eligible facility, FEMA requires that the standards must be applied to all similar types of facilities. However, there are no criteria that (1) specify a time period during which the newly adopted standards must be in place after the eligible facility is funded or (2) define \u201csimilar\u201d facilities.", "According to a public assistance official at FEMA headquarters, FEMA can determine whether or not post-disaster standards proposed for the restoration of a facility are \u201creasonable\u201d before making a funding decision. However, he said that there are no written criteria to determine reasonableness. He added that FEMA assumed that public scrutiny during the adoption process would discourage unreasonable standards, because the standards have to be applicable to all similar facilities whether owned by the public or private sector. However, this approach is not without problems. For example, the official noted that a standard adopted for hospitals after the Northridge earthquake, although not necessarily unreasonable, provided for extensive upgrading for relatively little damage, and there was not the self-policing effect that FEMA had expected.", "FEMA inspectors involved in assessing the damages following the Northridge earthquake said that determining the applicability of standards appears especially problematic in the case of earthquakes. FEMA and its applicants have had significant disagreements about the applicability of standards to eligible facilities following both the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes. A source of contention between FEMA and some applicants surrounds the applicability of triggers\u2014integral parts of the building codes signaling the point at which various upgrades, or the replacement of an entire facility, must be undertaken. Further complicating this problem is the fact that in the case of earthquakes, some structural damage may not be apparent upon first inspection.", "Determining what standards are applicable to permanent restoration affects whether or not facilities will be replaced entirely. FEMA provides that if repairing a facility (in accordance with standards applicable to repairs) would cost 50 percent or more of the cost of replacing the facility to its pre-disaster design (in accordance with the standards applicable to new construction), then the facility is eligible for replacement in accordance with the new construction standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Criteria for Determining Eligibility of Certain Private Nonprofit Applicants Are Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Before 1970, private nonprofits were not eligible for public assistance. As detailed in appendix I, the Congress enacted legislation over the next few years that expanded the number and types of private nonprofit organizations eligible for assistance. Public assistance for private nonprofits has averaged about $60 million annually during the 1990s. In addition to making specific facilities, such as schools and hospitals, eligible, Public Law 100-707 (enacted in 1988) established a category of \u201cother\u201d eligible private nonprofit organizations, defined as \u201cother private nonprofit facilities which provide essential services of a governmental nature to the general public\u201d (42 U.S.C. 5122).", "When developing regulations to implement the legislation, FEMA relied on an accompanying report to define the \u201cother\u201d category.

FEMA\u2019s regulations incorporated the list of examples from the House report but recognized that other, similar facilities could be included.", "FEMA experienced problems in applying this regulation because, among other things, the wide range of services provided by state and local governments made it difficult to determine whether the services of a private nonprofit facility were of a governmental nature. In 1993, FEMA amended its regulations to limit eligible \u201cother\u201d private nonprofit facilities to those specifically included in the House report and those facilities whose primary purpose is the provision of health and safety services.", "It can be difficult to determine the eligibility of these other private nonprofit facilities. The Federal Coordinating Officer (the person in charge of FEMA\u2019s recovery efforts) for the Northridge earthquake said that clearer eligibility criteria are needed to determine whether private nonprofit facilities may qualify as \u201ccommunity centers.\u201d Specifically, there has been much debate over the extent to which a facility must be open to the public in order to be eligible. In the past, FEMA gave many facilities the benefit of the doubt and funded them, even though it appeared that these facilities were not really open to the public.", "FEMA\u2019s Inspector General has cited examples of private nonprofits that do not appear to provide essential government services, yet received FEMA public assistance.

Originally, FEMA determined that one hospital damaged in the Northridge earthquake was eligible for $3.9 million for repairs and an additional $2.9 million for cost-effective seismic upgrading. California, as the grantee, argued that the hospital was eligible for $64 million because an alternate set of standards was applicable. (Ultimately, as described in ch. 4, FEMA and the state reached an agreement whereby FEMA will provide $29 million.) The Inspector General noted that the total costs of some Northridge projects far exceeded the actual repair costs because of the upgrades and other items \u201ctriggered\u201d by the standards found to be applicable.", "Furthermore, to the extent that the lack of clear criteria contributes to the number of appeals, FEMA\u2019s administrative costs are increased. Any decision on eligibility for assistance may be appealed by a potential recipient. If necessary, the applicant can formally appeal to three levels: the FEMA Regional Director, the Associate Director of the Response and Recovery Directorate, and the Director of FEMA. Each appeal is processed through the state for review and comment before being forwarded to FEMA. The Inspector General\u2019s report pointed out that it is not unusual for the appeals process to take more than 2 years to complete and concluded that the federal government could save considerable staff time and money if the appeals process were shortened.", "According to FEMA officials, between fiscal year 1990 and the end of fiscal year 1995, there were 882 first-level appeals of public assistance eligibility determinations. FEMA headquarters had begun logging in second- and third-level appeals in January 1993 and could not quantify the number of such appeals before then. Between January 1993 and the end of March 1996, there have been 104 second-level appeals and 30 third-level appeals. Although FEMA may always expect some appeals, clearer guidance on applying eligibility criteria could help reduce their number.", "In the case of the Northridge earthquake recovery effort, disagreements over applicable standards have caused additional expenses for both FEMA and some applicants. For example:", "FEMA has funded applicants\u2019 costs for architectural and engineering evaluations to help ascertain the degree of structural damage. In cases in which FEMA officials disagreed with the evaluations, FEMA has incurred additional expense by conducting its own architect and engineering studies.", "Applicants have pointed out that they have found an increasing need to hire contractors who specialize in interpreting the FEMA public assistance program. A lack of clarity in the eligibility criteria was cited as the reason for disagreements still outstanding between FEMA and the state of California nearly 6 years after the Loma Prieta earthquake.", "Finally, in part because of the large dollar implications, the lack of clarity in FEMA\u2019s criteria may encourage potential applicants to make the most of opportunities for assistance. In our 1992 report on the recovery from the Loma Prieta earthquake, we discussed a lack of criteria on hazard mitigation, historic buildings, and private nonprofit applicants. At the time, FEMA regional officials told us that, lacking specific guidelines to implement the criteria, they sought to \u201cmoderate the drain on federal disaster funds, while local applicants sought to maximize assistance.\u201d Similarly, in the course of preparing our June 1994 report on the potential impediments to rebuilding after the Northridge earthquake, federal officials said that state and local governments often try to maximize federal contributions.", "Ambiguities in the existing criteria for public assistance echo a lack of clear criteria for determining that disaster damage warrants federal assistance\u2014i.e., a presidential disaster declaration\u2014which we have reported on previously.

In many cases, the total eligible costs far exceed the actual repair costs because of triggers that require upgrades to major systems throughout the structure as well as costly items such as asbestos removal.", "The FEMA respondents suggested that code upgrades should be limited to the parts of the structure damaged by the disaster. The expense of upgrading undamaged parts would be borne by the applicants. Upgrading significantly raises the cost of public assistance in large disasters: In the Northridge earthquake, seismic standards, in some instances, required upgrading undamaged portions of disaster-damaged structures.", "NEMA did not support the implementation of this option, pointing out that limiting repairs to the damaged portions of facilities would not be a cost-effective approach to spending federal tax dollars. NEMA stated that the federal government must comply with codes and standards and cannot pick and choose what parts to recognize. For example, the undamaged portions of a structure are generally part of the force-resisting system. If that system is not upgraded to the same standards as the rest of the system, there is a likelihood of a weak link that would fail in future disasters.", "One FEMA respondent generally agreed with the NEMA perspective.

The codes and standards do not necessarily have to be in effect at the time of the disaster.", "Following the Northridge earthquake, a decision on assistance for restoring damaged hospitals was delayed for 2 years because of a dispute over which standards were applicable: those promulgated by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (the Health Office) or the standards in the California Building Code. FEMA officials stated that the Health Office did not have the authority to amend the state code. FEMA determined that one hospital was eligible for $3.9 million, the amount required to repair the building in a manner consistent with the state code. As the grantee, California argued that the hospital was eligible for $64 million; FEMA, after reviewing the request for additional funding, offered $6.8 million for repairs and upgrades. The Health Office\u2019s standards would have required demolishing and replacing the hospital. On December 6, 1995, the FEMA Director announced that the agency would provide funding for the hospitals using discretionary authority to fund mitigation measures. On March 12, 1996, FEMA announced that it would provide nearly $1 billion in federal funds to repair or replace four hospitals damaged by the Northridge earthquake.

The respondents had varying views on what the time limit should be, but they generally agreed that some limit would be useful. The suggestions ranged from about 1 month to about 1 year after a disaster occurs. The respondents generally agreed that the limit should give sufficient time to allow the codes in place at the time of the disaster to be evaluated and strengthened to mitigate against future damage but should not provide an opportunistic window for applicants to gain the maximum amount of federal funding.", "According to one respondent, providing more than a few months for the applicant to enforce new codes provides too long a period of opportunism. In his opinion, the costs of FEMA\u2019s public assistance for the Northridge earthquake and the 1993 Midwest flood were higher because the applicants adopted new standards after the events, but before FEMA approved specific projects. The respondent explained that because FEMA lacks a clear and consistent internal policy on codes and standards, its interpretation of eligibility is subjective and not completely accountable.", "Another respondent suggested limiting the time because codes are always changing, which makes it difficult to determine which codes are applicable. The codes may change as a result of a number of factors, including changes in technology and the identification of new degrees or kinds of hazards.", "NEMA endorsed this option for further consideration. However, one FEMA respondent did not completely concur. He stated that although he was not opposed to a time limit, that limit would have to allow communities sufficient time to fully explore and adopt the most appropriate codes for their highest risks. Furthermore, he stated that FEMA should develop acceptable minimum codes for each type of peril. As in the flood insurance program, public entities should be expected to build to those codes and carry sufficient insurance. If the public entities did not comply, they would be penalized, e.g., the amount of the award would be reduced by the amount of insurance coverage that should have been provided, or no DSRs would be signed until new codes were adopted.", "Several respondents recommended revising FEMA\u2019s regulations to disallow the adoption of codes after the disaster occurs.

In some instances, FEMA has waived the insurance requirement and has provided funding as a result of damage from a recurring similar disaster. The responding officials recommended adherence to the regulations, which require that applicants purchase and maintain insurance after FEMA provides initial funds. One respondent recommended that in those cases where insurance has not been purchased after FEMA has provided funds and similar disaster-related damage recurs, FEMA should subtract the limit of available insurance from its grant.

The Stafford Act requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of receiving public assistance in flood-prone areas. If a facility is located in a flood-prone area, is damaged by flooding, and is not covered by flood insurance, the amount of assistance that would be available from FEMA is reduced. However, the Stafford Act does not require insurance against damage by disasters other than floods until after FEMA has already provided funding under a prior disaster declaration.

They suggested that revenue-producing properties and investment properties could be insured by their owners. One issue raised was that the Congress did not contemplate eligibility for redevelopment properties because they are speculative properties, serve no public purpose at the time of the disaster, and are generally unoccupiable or abandoned.", "The respondents provided this example:", "The Williams Building had been owned by the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency since the mid-1980s when it was damaged by the Loma Prieta earthquake. At the time of the earthquake, more than half of the building was vacant. The portion that was not rented would have required considerable repair to lure prospective tenants.

Currently, the building is unusable. The Redevelopment Agency has requested, and FEMA has approved, the option of using eligible funds for an alternate project.", "NEMA stated that eliminating eligibility for facilities owned by redevelopment agencies may be reasonable, especially if the facilities were abandoned at the time of the disaster.", "The respondents generally agreed that public facilities that are leased to the private sector, which in turn generates income that may not be returned to the government, should be ineligible for public assistance. Examples of such facilities include warehouses, restaurants, and stadiums. According to the OIG\u2019s July 1995 report, such facilities have the ability to generate funds, independent of tax revenues, for the repair of disaster damage.", "The respondents recommended eliminating eligibility for public facilities that are leased to concessionaires who generate income because they, like redevelopment properties, do not provide a critical government service. In addition, they stated that the concessionaires often generate sufficient income to carry insurance against disaster losses or to repair damages.", "Several examples follow of public facilities that were leased to the private sector but received public assistance from FEMA:", "The Port of Oakland operates 30 ship berths that are leased to private operating companies. It also has authority for the Oakland International Airport. Total disaster funding following the Loma Prieta earthquake was over $35 million.", "Pier 45 was owned by the Port of San Francisco and leased out to private fish-processing companies. It was also leased out for occasional activities, such as the Italian Festival, attended by thousands of people. Although no essential public services were provided on Pier 45, FEMA funded about $9 million to repair the facility, which was leased to private vendors who generated income.", "The Gilroy Old City Hall is owned by the City of Gilroy but was not used as the city hall. It had been converted to a restaurant and meeting facility. At the time of the earthquake, the restaurant was not being used because of ongoing renovations. The total funding from FEMA for Gilroy\u2019s Old City Hall as a result of the Loma Prieta earthquake was more than $2 million.", "The Los Angeles Coliseum serves as a major source of entertainment for the greater Los Angeles community. The facility hosts revenue-generating events, such as professional sports events. It suffered extensive structural and cosmetic damage as a result of the Northridge earthquake, and damage survey reports have been written for about $91 million.", "One respondent strongly disagreed with this option.

These facilities may be more likely to be damaged as a result of a disaster. The issue raised is whether taxpayers should pay for repairs to facilities that are structurally deficient before the disaster.", "One respondent said that there is a nationwide trend for local governments to insufficiently maintain facilities. As a result, when disaster occurs, the damage sustained to those facilities is more serious and therefore more costly to repair had the facilities been maintained. For example, one respondent noted that during a hurricane of moderate intensity, an entire roof of a facility blew off because it had been improperly attached.

For example, one stated that experience has shown that the volunteer credit allowance has proven to be a very time-consuming process and relies almost exclusively upon the subgrantees\u2019 estimates of the number of volunteers involved, hours worked, and material utilized. As the subgrantees incur no out-of-pocket cost, they do not accurately track volunteer labor and donated material and equipment. Therefore, they are often unable to provide with accuracy the required documentation to support their claims.

Floods, because of their longer-term nature in flat areas, lend themselves to volunteer labor, such as sandbagging, which occurred extensively during the Midwest floods. FEMA\u2019s records indicate that nearly $1.4 million was obligated for volunteer credits in Iowa in response to the Midwest floods.", "FEMA officials explained that this allowance is not unique to FEMA.

For instance, the undamaged portions of bridges may be replaced. Bridges have two abutments\u2014one at each end. If one abutment needs to be replaced as a result of disaster damage, the costs will likely border on the 50-percent threshold. In that case, the entire bridge will be replaced. However, if the threshold was higher, only the damaged abutment would be replaced\u2014not both abutments.", "Other organizations have higher replacement thresholds\u2014for example, insurance companies, according to one respondent. FEMA\u2019s Inspector General noted that when insurance companies calculate the costs of repair versus replacement, they determine that if repair is less expensive than replacement, the facility is repaired. Other federal agencies also have higher thresholds. For example, the Department of Transportation and HUD require that replacement be more cost-effective than repair. The Inspector General identified, as an option for reducing the costs of public assistance, revising FEMA\u2019s regulations to raise the threshold repair cost that triggers the replacement of a public facility.", "One respondent offered a different perspective. He stated that FEMA had already taken steps to control replacement costs when the agency clarified this policy in June 1995. The revised policy states that the 50 percent should be calculated on the actual costs of the disaster damage\u2014exclusive of the cost of, for example, seismic upgrading, plumbing, heating, asbestos removal, mitigating against future damage, and other nonstructural repairs. Before the policy was clarified, these types of costs had been considered in repair cost calculations. According to this respondent, the clarified policy does not require additional revision because, although it does not address the 50-percent threshold, it will likely save substantial federal outlays.", "The Association of State Floodplain Managers saw merit in raising the percentage provided it does not apply to buildings insurable under the National Flood Insurance Program. In commenting on a draft of this report, FEMA noted that revising the damage threshold for public assistance eligibility would have no effect on the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program or local floodplain regulations. NEMA did not completely concur with revising the 50-percent replacement rule, stating that the rule is a cost-effectiveness test for deciding if federal money is better spent in repairing or replacing a damaged facility.
