Documents indicate that DOD provided notice to Congress before designating 78 of 104 countries eligible for an ACSA. However, DOD did not have records for the remaining 26, in part because it lacks documented recordkeeping procedures. While State generally notified Congress about ACSAs' entry into force, it transmitted 41 percent of them after the statutory deadline, largely because DOD did not provide required information to State. These gaps and issues have reduced the accuracy and timeliness of information provided to Congress about ACSAs.", "DOD has not maintained quality data to track ACSA orders and has not received reimbursement for thousands of orders. First, DOD does not have complete and accurate ACSA data. For example, for an estimated 12 percent of ACSA orders authorized from October 2013 through March 2018 in DOD's system of record, DOD could not determine whether it had received reimbursement for support provided to partners. According to DOD officials, such inaccuracies occur in part because DOD does not have a process to validate data in its system. Second, GAO estimates that DOD received full reimbursement for 64 percent of ACSA orders authorized from October 2013 through March 2018 (about 6,000 orders), but did not receive full reimbursement for 24 percent. Orders remain unpaid in part because DOD has not requested timely repayment or monitored reimbursement. These management weaknesses limit DOD's ability to obtain reimbursement for overdue ACSA orders, which, according to DOD, were valued at more than $1 billion as of November 2019.", "Note: These estimates are based on a generalizable sample of orders in which the United States provided support to foreign partners; have a margin of error of up to plus or minus 5.1 percentage points at the 95-percent confidence level; and represent the percentage of the number of orders, not the dollar value of orders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to DOD to improve ACSA recordkeeping and reimbursement, through steps such as better monitoring, periodic data reconciliation, and timely invoicing.

In this report, we examine the extent to which (1)  agencies have provided information to Congress about ACSAs, and (2)  DOD has tracked and received reimbursement for ACSA orders.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed DOD and Department of State  (State) reporting to Congress, guidance and policy on establishing  ACSAs, and ACSA management and implementation. We also reviewed  DOD\u2019s Report to Congress Concerning Acquisition and Cross-Servicing  Activities for Fiscal Year 2018 and DOD Inspector General reporting on  DOD\u2019s management of ACSAs.", "To examine the extent to which agencies have provided information to  Congress about ACSAs, we analyzed DOD and State activities to  respond to two different congressional notification requirements  pertaining to ACSAs. First, we reviewed DOD\u2019s notifications to Congress  about its intent to designate governments of countries that are not part of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as eligible for an ACSA.  To do so, we conducted a content analysis of relevant documents to  identify the dates on which DOD made notifications to Congress and the  dates it signed agreements with those countries. We then calculated the  number of days between these dates for each ACSA and compared our  results to DOD\u2019s requirement to notify Congress of its intent to make a  designation not less than 30 days before the date on which a country is  designated. Second, in reviewing State notifications to Congress  reporting entry into force of ACSAs, we conducted a content analysis of  DOD ACSA documents and State notification records to identify dates  when ACSAs entered into force and when State notified Congress. We  then calculated the number of days between these dates and compared  our results to State\u2019s statutory notification requirements. We also  interviewed DOD officials from the Office of the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff (OCJCS) and the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense  (OUSD) for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S), and State officials from  the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and the Office of the Legal Adviser\u2019s  Office of Treaty Affairs to discuss DOD\u2019s and State\u2019s notification  processes.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has tracked and received  reimbursement for support provided through ACSAs, we analyzed a  generalizable sample of ACSA orders that DOD authorized and recorded  in its ACSA Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS)  from October 2013 through March 2018. AGATRS is DOD\u2019s system of  record for management of ACSA transactions and designates orders as  overdue if reimbursement is not completed within 12 months of the order  authorization date. We selected March 31, 2018, as the latest  authorization date for orders in our sample, and conducted our review of  the sample from May through June 2019. As a result, at least 14 months  had elapsed since the authorization date of orders in our sample. Thus,  all orders that were not recorded in AGATRS as completed by June 2019  were designated in the system as overdue.", "We reviewed supporting documentation stored in AGATRS for each  ACSA order in our sample to determine the accuracy of the \u201corder status\u201d  field recorded in the system, which designates whether an order is  complete or incomplete based on whether DOD has received  reimbursement. Additionally, we verified with DOD the status of orders in  our sample that DOD recorded as (1) reimbursed, but for which AGATRS  lacked sufficient supporting documentation to confirm reimbursement, or  (2) not reimbursed. We requested that DOD provide documentation for  orders that it recorded as complete, but for which we could not find  sufficient supporting documentation in AGATRS. DOD could not validate  the reimbursement status for some orders in our sample. We describe  these information gaps in this report. Additionally, DOD identified whether  orders recorded as overdue in AGATRS had been partially reimbursed,  which we incorporated into our calculation of unreimbursed dollar  amounts for the orders in our sample. On the basis of this validation  process, we report on whether ACSA orders authorized from October  2013 through March 2018 in AGATRS had been reimbursed or not fully  reimbursed as of July 10, 2019, or if DOD did not know the  reimbursement status as of October 2019.", "Additionally, we discussed ACSA management and transactions,  including information about support provided to the Saudi-led Coalition for  activities in Yemen, with DOD officials from the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), OCJCS,  OUSD (A&S), U.S. Air Force, U.S. Air Forces Central Command  (AFCENT), U.S. Army, U.S. Central Command, and U.S. Marine Corps,  and conducted field work at AFCENT Headquarters at Shaw Air Force  Base in Sumter, South Carolina.

For  example, ACSAs can give a commander increased flexibility to address  logistical shortfalls in a contingency environment. DOD officials noted that  the agreements provide DOD with flexibility, enhanced readiness at  minimal cost, and increased military effectiveness by allowing partners  and allies to access U.S. logistics capabilities and practice mutual support  procedures, which is particularly valuable in planning international  exercises and coalition operations. For example, DOD established  ACSAs with 70 new partners during Operations Enduring Freedom and  Iraqi Freedom, which together covered the 14 years from 2001 through  2014.

Within DOD, the OUSD (A&S) is the focal point for establishing ACSAs,  as of December 2019, and officials from that office request State\u2019s  authority to negotiate an ACSA and coordinate designees with DOD\u2014 typically Combatant Command staff\u2014to negotiate and sign ACSAs.  DOD officials told us that the amount of time it takes to negotiate and sign  an ACSA varies because of a number of factors. For example, a lack of  urgency or the complicated legal context of a potential partner can extend  negotiations. As a result, the amount of time it takes to negotiate and sign  an ACSA has varied greatly, from less than 1 year to more than 25  years.", "After an agreement is signed, State is required to notify Congress about  international agreements that enter into force, including ACSAs.  Although, according to agency documentation, most ACSAs enter into  force at the time they are signed, an ACSA may enter into force on a later  date, depending on the conditions outlined in each agreement.

For example, CJCSI 2120.01D calls for military departments and defense  agencies to appoint primary ACSA program managers charged with  maintaining financial and program records of all ACSA transactions.", "In addition to the primary guidance documents, DOD policy and  legislation have modified ACSA implementation over time. For example,  DOD issued memorandums in 2017, 2018, and 2019 to update or clarify  requirements for managing ACSAs, and in October 2018, officials noted  that DOD had begun a process to update each of the three primary  guidance documents listed above. In addition, the NDAA for Fiscal Year  2020 was enacted on December 20, 2019, and Section 1203 modified the  authorities related to ACSAs. The law includes a number of new  requirements, including a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to  designate an official who will have primary responsibility for overseeing  and monitoring the implementation of ACSAs in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Further, the law requires that,  among other things, the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations  to ensure that adequate processes and controls are in place to provide for  the accurate accounting of logistic support, supplies, and services  received or provided under ACSAs.

DOD included  estimated Congressional notification transmittal dates for the agreements  for which it could not locate supporting documentation. Moreover, DOD  included incorrect ACSA signature dates in the report for 16 other  agreements. DOD officials responsible for compiling the report told us  that they made some of these errors because they used the inaccurate  data available at the time. In November 2019, DOD officials told us that  they intended to create a consolidated list of ACSA partners including the  date of eligibility designations and agreement signatures for each partner  to be kept updated through a joint effort by OUSD (A&S) and the Joint  Staff.

With regard to the reimbursement  status of these orders, a DOD official noted that DOD could not determine  the status based on available information. As a result, DOD does not  know if the orders have been reimbursed, were processed for  reimbursement, or even took place.", "According to DOD officials, data quality lapses occur because DOD does  not have a process in place to reconcile reimbursement information with  data recorded in AGATRS. Although AGATRS is DOD\u2019s system of record  for ACSA transactions, DOD officials told us that the database does not  have financial processing capabilities and is not integrated with DOD\u2019s  financial processing systems. As a result, ACSA personnel must manually  update information in AGATRS as orders are processed in other financial  systems, but do not always do so, according to DOD officials. A DOD official told us that the military services vary greatly in the extent to which  they regularly populate AGATRS, and even within a service, some  personnel are better than others at including complete information.", "DOD officials explained that personnel may delay or fail to update  information in AGATRS for multiple reasons. First, personnel may be on  temporary duty in an operational environment where they do not have a  secure internet connection and thus cannot upload information into  AGATRS. Second, short-term rotations of personnel in the field can result  in delays as new personnel learn how to use AGATRS and process  transactions. Third, after negotiating the transfer of support, drafting the  order, and receiving a unique order number assignment in AGATRS,  ACSA orders change frequently. These changes can include price  adjustments that result in DOD or the partner deciding not to move  forward with the transaction, or significantly revising it. In such situations,  DOD officials told us that DOD should cancel orders in AGATRS, but  does not always do so.", "Further, DOD does not have quality data to track the extent to which DOD  processes ACSA transactions in accordance with statutory requirements.

However, DOD  officials told us that they did not have the information necessary to track  such compliance because AGATRS lacks a mechanism to track these  data. DOD officials explained that AGATRS has a field to record the  \u201cdelivery time\u201d for an order, but that field does not require users to enter  data in a standard format. Our review of AGATRS data found instances in  which users left the field blank, entered date ranges as opposed to a  single date, or entered text information about the delivery, such as how  quickly it should occur. DOD officials noted that they could not use the  information in this field to determine the extent to which orders were  reimbursed within 12 months of delivery, as outlined in the statute.  Instead of using the date of delivery, DOD officials stated, and our  analysis confirmed, that DOD used an order\u2019s date of authorization as an  alternate metric to indicate whether an order was reimbursed within 12  months. However, DOD has transactions in which it delivers the support  weeks or months after the order is authorized, according to DOD officials.  When asked about such transactions, DOD officials acknowledged that  the authorization date was not an appropriate alternate date to use to  determine if ACSA orders were completed within 12 months of delivery.", "DOD has taken some steps\u2014including several since we began our  review\u2014to improve tracking of ACSA orders in AGATRS, such as issuing  memos reiterating requirements for personnel to use AGATRS, improving  the system\u2019s functionality, and updating relevant training. For example, in  October 2018, DOD introduced additional categories of order status in  AGATRS to track an order\u2019s progress through the transaction process  and in June 2019, DOD updated the AGATRS training course to reflect  this and other updates to the system. Additionally, in October 2019, DOD  updated AGATRS to help ensure that orders are assigned to appropriate  DOD organizations and personnel in the system. According to DOD  officials, as of October 2019, three military services were discussing  processes that could improve record keeping and tracking for ACSA  orders. For instance, U.S. Army officials told us that the Army had  begun reconciling data from the service\u2019s financial accounting system  with information recorded in AGATRS to address data quality issues.  However, DOD has not finalized or fully implemented most of these steps,  which, even if implemented, would not address historical inaccuracies in  DOD\u2019s recorded data, according to DOD officials.", "According to DOD, from fiscal years 2014 through 2019, DOD used  ACSAs to provide support valued at about $5 billion to foreign partners.  Without a process to ensure that ACSA order data are accurate and  without data to track the timeliness of transactions, DOD does not have  sufficient information to oversee ACSA reimbursement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Received Reimbursement for an Estimated 64 Percent of Recorded ACSA Orders from October 2013 through March 2018, but Thousands of Orders Identified as Overdue Remain Unreimbursed", "paragraphs": ["Section 2344(a) of Title 10 of the United States Code provides that the  United States can use ACSAs to transfer logistic support, supplies, and  services to partners in return for cash reimbursement or by replacement- in-kind or exchange of supplies or services of an equal value. DOD  guidance and financial management regulations outline procedures for  DOD to carry out these transactions and seek timely reimbursement.  Additionally, federal standards for internal control state that management  should perform ongoing monitoring as part of the normal course of  operations to obtain reasonable assurance about the effectiveness of its  internal controls.", "On the basis of a generalizable sample of ACSA orders recorded in  AGATRS, we estimate that DOD received reimbursement for  approximately 64 percent of ACSA orders recorded in AGATRS that it  authorized from October 2013 through March 2018 (about 6,000), but did  not receive full reimbursement for approximately 24 percent (about  2,300), as shown in figure 6. Some orders for which DOD did not  receive full reimbursement included basic life support such as food,  water, housing, and fuel, authorized in 2017. Further, DOD could not  verify the accuracy of the reimbursement status for an estimated 12.2  percent of orders (about 1,100) recorded in AGATRS during this time  period\u2014meaning that for these orders, DOD could not verify whether it  had requested or received reimbursement, or whether the transaction had  occurred. The orders in this category included, for example, helicopter  transportation authorized for a partner in 2015 and valued by DOD at  almost $150,000.", "DOD officials identified several factors that contributed to unreimbursed  ACSA orders, including:", "Lack of invoicing. DOD officials said that DOD had not received  reimbursement for 39 of the 221 ACSA orders in our sample, valued  by DOD at more than $700,000, because it had not sent invoices to  request reimbursement from partners. According to the officials, DOD  had not processed these orders for invoicing in part because it had  not assigned the orders to the appropriate officials who manage  financial processing. Officials from two military services told us that  while they aim to have strong communication between the personnel  who manage logistics and finance processes for ACSA orders, factors  such as staff rotations, contingency environments, and delayed  training may affect the efficiency of order processing. DOD officials  also noted that missing or incorrect order information, such as an  incorrect billing address for a partner nation, may delay invoicing.", "Delays from partner countries. For some unreimbursed orders in  our sample, DOD officials explained that DOD had sent invoices to  partner countries but, as of August 2019, had not received  reimbursement. The average time from the date of invoice to the  date of reimbursement was 208 days for reimbursed cash  transactions in our sample of 221 orders authorized from October  2013 through March 2018, and the longest amount of time was 751  days.", "Lack of a monitoring process. According to DOD officials, DOD did  not appropriately monitor the reimbursement status of some orders in  our sample and does not have a process to monitor delinquent debt.  For example, DOD officials explained that they could not verify  reimbursement for some orders recorded as overdue in our sample  because personnel had not closely monitored the status of these  orders. Additionally, in response to our inquiries, DOD acknowledged  that it would need to reassign certain overdue orders to appropriate  officials for processing. Although AGATRS produces reports that  identify overdue orders, DOD does not have an agency-wide process  to monitor and take action on unreimbursed orders that become  delinquent. DOD officials told us that the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS), responsible for some ACSA billing, sends  letters to partners for delinquent ACSA bills 30, 60, and 90 days after  the end of the billing period outlined under the terms of the ACSA.  However, after 90 days, DOD does not have a standardized approach  to continue seeking delinquent ACSA debt according to DOD officials.  In 2018, DOD updated the section of its Financial Management  Regulation that addresses the collection of debt owed by foreign  entities, but according to DOD officials, DOD had not implemented the  updated policy as of October 2019. Officials from DFAS explained  that the policy had not been implemented because they were working  with officials from the military services to evaluate possible debt  collection procedures.", "Unless it takes steps to ensure that it processes and invoices ACSA  orders as required, and seeks unpaid debt, DOD may not receive  reimbursement for thousands of orders for which it has provided  support. As of November 2019, DOD indicated that the department had  authorized more than $1 billion in ACSA sale orders for which  reimbursement is now overdue.

However, weaknesses in recordkeeping and management  processes limit the extent to which agencies can (1) provide Congress  with information requested for oversight and (2) monitor and secure  reimbursement.", "First, DOD could not locate records related to required congressional  notifications about designating 26 countries for an ACSA. Further, State  transmitted almost half of its congressional notifications on ACSA entry  into force after required deadlines, largely because DOD did not provide  State with information about new agreements. Without full and timely  information about new partners that DOD intends to designate for an ACSA or agreements that have entered into force, Congress will not be  sufficiently informed to effectively oversee DOD\u2019s use of ACSAs as an  element of security cooperation.", "Second, DOD lacks quality data necessary for tracking ACSA orders and  has not received reimbursement for thousands of orders. Our review of  227 transactions confirmed at least $26 million of unreimbursed overdue  transactions, but, as of November 2019, DOD records include additional  overdue ACSA transactions for support provided to partners dating back  to 2011, which DOD values at more than $1 billion.

In this report, we examine the extent to which (1)  agencies have provided information to Congress about ACSAs, and (2)  DOD has tracked and received reimbursement for ACSA orders.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed legal authorities related to  ACSAs in sections 2341-2350 of Title 10 of the United States Code,  DOD policy and guidance on ACSA management and implementation,  and DOD Inspector General (IG) reporting on DOD\u2019s management of  ACSAs. We analyzed DOD and Department of State (State)  documentation related to congressional notifications and the  establishment of ACSAs, DOD ACSA transaction data, and DOD\u2019s Report  to Congress Concerning Acquisition and Cross-servicing Activities for  Fiscal Year 2018. We also discussed ACSA management, order tracking,  and transactions, including for the Saudi-led Coalition, with DOD officials  from the Air Force Central Command (AFCENT); Defense Finance and  Accounting Services; Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), including DLA  Energy; Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (OCJCS);  Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment  (OUSD (A&S)); U.S. Air Force; U.S. Marine Corps; U.S. Army; and U.S.  Central Command. With State officials from the Bureau of Political-Military  Affairs and the Office of the Legal Adviser\u2019s Office of Treaty Affairs, we  discussed the process to establish international agreements, State\u2019s  notifications to Congress on ACSA entry into force, and recordkeeping for  those notifications. We conducted fieldwork at AFCENT Headquarters at  Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina, to discuss ACSA  transactions related to support provided to the Saudi-led Coalition.", "To determine the extent to which agencies have provided information to  Congress about ACSAs, we analyzed agency activities related to (1)  DOD\u2019s requirement to notify Congress of its intent to designate a country  eligible for an ACSA and (2) State\u2019s requirement to notify Congress no  later than 60 days after the entry into force of international agreements,  which includes ACSAs.", "First we reviewed DOD\u2019s congressional notification requirements under  10 U.S.C. \u00a72342. The law authorizes the Secretary of Defense to sign  ACSAs with the governments of North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) countries, subsidiary bodies of NATO, and the United Nations  Organization or any regional international organizations without an official  designation of eligibility. However, for countries that are not members of  NATO, DOD must notify Congress of its intent to designate the  government of a country eligible for an ACSA at least 30 days before  making the designation. Agency records indicate that DOD had signed  125 ACSAs as of February 2020. We included these 125 agreements in  our analysis because, according to DOD, each agreement is considered  to be an ACSA although some are named as other types of mutual  logistics support agreements.", "To determine the extent to which DOD addressed requirements for  notifying Congress of its intent to designate a non-NATO country for the  purposes of entering into an ACSA, we conducted a content review of  ACSA documents to identify signature and notification dates for each relevant ACSA, calculated the number of days between them, and  compared our results to DOD\u2019s requirement to notify Congress of its  intent to make a designation not less than 30 days before a country is  designated. Although DOD is required to notify Congress at least 30 days  before designating non-NATO countries for the purposes of entering into  an ACSA, DOD officials told us that ACSA records do not include a  precise designation date for each country. Therefore, we used ACSA  signature dates as a proxy for designation dates. In addition, because  some ACSAs are revised and re-signed over time, we planned to  compare the date on which DOD transmitted notifications to Congress  with the signature date of the first ACSA signed with each partner.  However, DOD officials explained that they could not readily provide the  signature dates of the first ACSA signed with each partner because they  purposefully expunged electronic records related to expired or replaced  agreements\u2014which would have noted signature dates\u2014to help ensure  that officials planning ACSA transactions referenced the current version  of the agreement.", "Although DOD did not systematically track the signature dates for  agreements that had been revised and re-signed, we reviewed  documents related to each ACSA partner, historical treaty records, and  other agency documents and found the signature date for the first  agreement DOD signed with each ACSA partner. We compared NATO  accession dates with these first ACSA signature dates and determined  that 19 ACSA partners were members or elements of NATO at the time  the relevant ACSA was signed. An additional two ACSA partners were  elements of other international organizations. Therefore, we determined  that DOD had signed 21 of its 125 ACSAs with governments of NATO  countries, subsidiary bodies of NATO, and other international  organizations, which do not require an official designation of eligibility.", "Under the law, DOD was required to notify Congress at least 30 days  prior to designating the remaining 104 countries for an ACSA. The  Secretary of Defense typically submits these notifications to the Senate  Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations and the House  Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Affairs. We included in our analysis the 78 of these 104 countries for which DOD records included a  copy of a dated notification letter addressed to at least one of these four  committees. For these 78 countries, we compared DOD notification  dates with the signature date of the initial agreement with each partner.  DOD could not provide documentation of congressional notifications for  the remaining 26 partners, which we excluded from our analysis. We also  interviewed DOD officials from the OCJCS and the OUSD (A&S) to  discuss DOD\u2019s congressional notification process.", "Second, we analyzed State\u2019s requirement under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7112b to notify  Congress no later than 60 days after the entry into force of international  agreements, which includes ACSAs. Under the law, often referred to as  \u201cthe Case-Zablocki Act,\u201d State is required to notify Congress of any  international agreement to which the United States is a party, other than a  treaty, as soon as practicable after the agreement has entered into force,  but in no event later than 60 days thereafter. To determine the extent to  which State had transmitted notifications about ACSA entry into force on  or before the statutory 60-day deadline, we conducted a content analysis  of DOD ACSA documents and State notification records to identify  relevant entry into force and State notification dates. We then calculated  the number of days between them and compared our results to State\u2019s  reporting requirement under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7112b. Of the 125 ACSAs that DOD  had signed, State officials confirmed that, as of February 2020, 118 had  entered into force and, as such, required notification to Congress of entry  into force under the Case-Zablocki Act.", "We excluded the remaining seven signed ACSAs from our analysis as  follows. First, we excluded three agreements DOD signed with Benin,  Iraq, and Uruguay that, according to State and DOD officials, had not  entered into force as of February 2020, and therefore did not yet require  notification under the Case-Zablocki Act. Second, we excluded two  ACSAs signed with Canada and the United Kingdom, for which State  officials explained that the legal arrangements governing acquisition and  cross-servicing transactions are contained in government-to government  \u201cchapeau agreements\u201d regarding defense cooperation rather than in  agency-level ACSA agreements more commonly used with other  partners. According to officials, these chapeau agreements are  supplemented by nonbinding, agency-level implementing procedures that  are not separately subject to Case-Zablocki Act reporting to Congress.  Third, we excluded two agreement for which, as of February 2020, State  officials were reviewing agreement documentation to confirm potential  entry into force prior to notifying Congress. For one of these two  agreements, if State determines the agreement to be entered into force,  the date of entry into force will be retroactively dated to the date of  signature, per the terms of the agreement. The retroactive entry into force  date for the agreement is more than 60 days before February 2020, so if  the entry into force date is confirmed, the related notification to Congress  under the Case-Zablocki Act would be late as compared to the 60-day  deadline. The second of these two agreements was signed on January  31, 2020.", "For the 118 ACSAs that had entered into force and thus required State\u2019s  notification to Congress, we compared entry into force dates with  notification dates to determine the extent to which State had provided  notifications on or before its 60-day deadline. State provided  documentation on entry into force notifications for all but two of the 118  relevant ACSAs. For these two agreements, signed in 1983 and 2002,  State had no record of related notifications, so we were unable to  conclude whether or not they had occurred. For the remaining 116  agreements, State provided copies of dated congressional notifications  for 113 and notification dates from its Treaty Information Management  System for three notifications for which copies of the letters were  unavailable. We included in our analysis notifications that were  transmitted to either the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the  House, or both. We compared the date of these notifications with ACSA  entry into force dates we verified using ACSA agreement documentation  and State notification documents. We also analyzed information in State\u2019s  notification documents to determine the causes for late transmittals. We  interviewed DOD officials from the OCJCS and the OUSD (A&S), and  State officials from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and the Office of  the Legal Adviser\u2019s Office of Treaty Affairs to discuss State\u2019s  congressional notification process.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has tracked and received  reimbursement for support provided through ACSA orders, we analyzed  a generalizable sample of ACSA orders that DOD had authorized from  October 2013 through March 2018 in the ACSA Global Automated  Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS). AGATRS is DOD\u2019s system  of record for management of ACSA transactions and designates orders  as overdue if reimbursement is not completed within 12 months of the  order authorization date.", "We selected a stratified random sample of 227 orders, which were  sampled from a population of 9,761 orders within the population groups in  table 3. Strata in table 3 are based on a combination of four features:  order total (dollar amount); order status (completed versus incomplete);  document upload requirement (required versus not required); and military  service. With this probability sample, each order of the study population  had a nonzero probability of being included, and that probability could be  computed for any order. Because we followed a probability procedure  based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of  samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision  of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95-percent confidence interval  (e.g., the margin of error is plus or minus 7 percentage points). This  interval would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. We calculated our sample analysis with  survey software that accounts for the sample design (stratification and  weights) and appropriate subpopulation reporting group statements.", "We designed stratification and sample sizes based on order status and  document upload requirements to ensure that the 95-percent confidence  intervals of attribute estimates (e.g., percentage of orders that have  proper support) had margins of error within around +/- 10 percentage  points for each of the following four reporting groups, which collapse over  the following strata: complete orders, incomplete orders, document  upload required, and document upload not required. We also designed  stratification based on military service to ensure proportionate  representation of each military service in our sample within each  combination of order status and document upload requirement.", "All of the orders in our population had been authorized for 14 months, and  thus should have been repaid according to DOD\u2019s 12-month system  requirement, at the time we conducted our review of the sample from May  2019 through June 2019. For this sample, we analyzed order information  and coordinated with DOD to validate the reimbursement status recorded  in AGATRS. On the basis of (1) reporting from the DOD Inspector  General, (2) interviews with DOD officials, (3) DOD\u2019s use of manual entry  to populate the system, and (4) our review of DOD\u2019s use of ACSA orders  to process reimbursement for unpaid transactions with members of the  Saudi-led Coalition, we determined that DOD\u2019s data in AGATRS may not  be fully reliable. DOD officials explained that although AGATRS was the  single repository for global ACSA transaction data, the system was not  integrated with any other DOD systems and thus relied on manual entry  from personnel to populate ACSA order information. As a result, we took  additional steps to determine the reliability of information reported in the  system. Specifically, we requested a data report from DOD of all ACSA  transactions recorded in AGATRS as of May 8, 2019. We reviewed  supporting documentation and information recorded in AGATRS for each  ACSA order in our sample to determine whether the data in the \u201corder  status\u201d field were accurate. For the order status \u201ccompleted,\u201d which  indicates that the ACSA order has been fully reimbursed, we reviewed  available information to determine whether financial collection  documentation had been recorded and compared the information in these  documents to the information in AGATRS.", "We then took steps to verify with DOD the status of orders that (1) were  recorded as \u201ccompleted,\u201d but for which we had not identified any financial  documentation or the documentation did not contain sufficient information  to verify reimbursement, and (2) were not recorded as \u201ccompleted\u201d as of  the time of our review. Of the 227 orders in our sample, 138 fit into one  of these two categories. For orders that were recorded as completed but  did not have sufficient supporting documentation, we requested that DOD  provide additional support. For orders that were recorded as incomplete,  we requested that DOD verify whether the orders had been reimbursed,  given that they had been in the system longer than 12 months and were  categorized as overdue in the data report provided by DOD. DOD provided feedback on and validated the reimbursement status for 101 of  the 138 orders sent for follow-up. DOD did not provide a response for the  remaining 37 orders. DOD identified whether orders recorded as overdue  in AGATRS had been partially reimbursed, which we incorporated into  our calculation of unreimbursed dollar amounts for the orders in our  sample. On the basis of this validation process, we report on whether  ACSA orders authorized from October 2013 through March 2018 in  AGATRS had been reimbursed or not fully reimbursed as of July 10,  2019, or whether DOD did not know the reimbursement status as of  October 2019.", "We found that approximately 7 percent of the order status information  recorded in AGATRS was inaccurate. For example, three of the 227  orders in our sample that DOD had recorded as \u201ccompleted\u201d were not  fully reimbursed. Five of the 227 orders in our sample that DOD had  recorded as incomplete were actually reimbursed; DOD uploaded  supporting documents and closed these orders in AGATRS in response  to our inquiry. Additionally, as described above, six of the 227 orders  should not have been included in our scope but were misclassified in  DOD\u2019s system. We also found orders under the purview of DLA Energy  that were partially or fully settled (i.e., reimbursed or reconciled by netting  sales and purchases between the United States and the partner nation),  but whose status had not been updated in AGATRS. DLA Energy officials  told us that AGATRS does not have sufficient functions to capture DLA  Energy\u2019s fuel reconciliation process, in which sales and purchases with  partners may be offset through specific implementing arrangements with  the partners. In some cases DLA Energy provided us with the actual  amounts, including unpaid amounts, but we were unable to verify this  information further.", "In response to our verification questions, DOD took steps to correct some  of the AGATRS data inaccuracies we identified. For instance, DOD  reopened (i.e., redesignated as incomplete) some orders it had recorded  as completed in AGATRS but for which it had not received full  reimbursement. Similarly, DOD uploaded reimbursement information for  orders that it had recorded in the system as incomplete, but for which it  had received reimbursement. DOD also uploaded reimbursement  information in AGATRS for ACSA orders from our sample that it had  recorded as completed, but for which it lacked documentation to support  that it had received reimbursement. Finally, DOD settled or requested and  received reimbursement for five of the ACSA orders in our sample.", "We found that DOD data on ACSA transactions contained weaknesses  that we describe in this report. Because of these weaknesses, we only  used data from our sample in developing estimates on data quality and  reimbursement. We checked all of the orders in our sample, and either  verified or corrected them as needed, and report any data that could not  be verified. Since our probability sample with verified and corrected  information is generalizable to all in-scope orders, we were able to  estimate population values based on the corrected sample information.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to March  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Further, according to DOD officials, there was no  FMS case through which DOD might have provided aerial refueling to  Saudi Arabia in March 2015.", "Aerial refueling support includes flying hours to conduct refueling and the  fuel exchanged. According to DOD officials, air crews recorded aerial  refueling flight hours for members of the SLC at the time they occurred,  but did not record them as related to SLC activities in Yemen or process  them as reimbursable FMS or ACSA transactions. For fuel provided to  SLC members during aerial refueling flights at this time, DOD  documented and processed some, but not all, as ACSA transactions.  DOD officials identified multiple factors, including inadequate planning  and insufficient understanding of guidance in the Joint Staff order, that led  to a process breakdown in which DOD did not invoice and request  reimbursement.", "Following the congressional inquiry, DOD began a review of air tanker  flight hours, Air Force fuel purchases, and data from Saudi Arabia to  determine aerial refueling reimbursement charges for flying hours and  fuel. Based on this review, DOD identified reimbursable amounts of more  than $261 million for flying hours and $37 million for fuel provided to  coalition members. Using this information, DOD requested retroactive  reimbursement through the ACSA authority from the United Arab  Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia for the flight hours and fuel not  previously reimbursed. According to DOD officials, DOD is treating these  transactions as third-party transfers. According to DOD documents and  officials, because Saudi Arabia did not have a signed ACSA prior to June  2016, UAE agreed to reimburse the United States for transactions  supporting the SLC before this date. Saudi Arabia agreed to reimburse  the United States for transactions after this date. As of February 28, 2019,  UAE had submitted $103.7 million in retroactive reimbursement for air  tanker flight hours and $15 million for fuel. In May 2019, DOD signed an  agreement with Saudi Arabia for repayment of $151 million for aerial  refueling support provided from June 2016 through September 2018.  DOD and Saudi Arabia agreed that Saudi Arabia would submit payments  in increments over the course of 12 months, after receiving approval from  the crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and additional leadership in  Saudi Arabia. As of February 2020, Saudi Arabia had submitted payment  of approximately $114 million, according to DOD documents. A balance  of about $37 million for flight hours remains unreimbursed as well as $22  million for fuel.", "In addition to aerial refueling support, in 2015 DOD provided about $2  million of general purpose bombs to UAE for which UAE had received  U.S. approval for an ACSA retransfer to Saudi Arabia for operations in  Yemen. However, DOD did not record this order in the ACSA system of  record as required until August 2019 and, as of September 2019, had  received reimbursement in the form of reciprocal support for only two- thirds of the value of the bombs initially provided. DOD officials told us  that UAE planned to provide the remaining in-kind reimbursement in  September 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Biza Repko (Assistant Director),  Kathryn Bolduc and Jasmine Senior (Analysts-in-Charge), Joe Carney,  Debbie Chung, Martin de Alteriis, Neil Doherty, Adrian Good, Sally  Newman, Cary Russell, Sonya Vartivarian, and Nicole Willems made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Weaknesses in the Department of Defense\u2019s oversight of the support it has provided to foreign partners have resulted in thousands of overdue reimbursements.", "Through its Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements, DOD provides foreign partners with reimbursable support such as meals, aerial refueling, munitions (for example some used in Saudi-led Coalition activities in Yemen), and more.
