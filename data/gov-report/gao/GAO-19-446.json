DMPs are overseen by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and voluntarily implemented by Medicare Part D prescription drug plan sponsors (private health plans). CMS established a two-step framework for identifying at-risk beneficiaries under DMPs. First, CMS identifies potentially at-risk beneficiaries based on key factors, such as beneficiaries' daily dosage of opioids and the number of prescribers and pharmacies from which they receive opioids, with higher numbers possibly putting the beneficiary at more risk. Second, Medicare Part D prescription drug plan sponsors' clinicians coordinate the provision of care among prescribers and pharmacists (referred to as case management) to determine if those potentially at-risk beneficiaries are actually at risk. If a patient is deemed to be at risk, coverage limitation tools\u2014such as limiting a beneficiary to a selected prescriber or pharmacy, and implementing point-of-sale restrictions on certain drugs or amounts\u2014can be used to limit the at-risk beneficiary's access to opioids. Beneficiaries have an opportunity to appeal an at-risk designation. None of the five plan sponsors GAO interviewed expressed concerns about beneficiaries not receiving clinically appropriate doses of opioids under the Medicare DMPs.", "Medicare Part D prescription drug plan sponsors and other stakeholders GAO interviewed reported several factors beyond the case management process that could contribute to the success of DMPs. These factors included communication among sponsors, opioid prescribers, and pharmacies dispensing opioids to reduce potential resistance to participating in DMPs by opioid prescribers or beneficiaries.", "According to plan sponsors and stakeholders, plan sponsors could communicate with stakeholders to ensure that DMPs are not viewed as a punitive tool by beneficiaries, but rather as tools for keeping them safe.", "Plan sponsors and stakeholders noted that it is important for plan sponsors to have flexibility in varying coverage limitation features to fit regional and other differences in population groups. They noted that CMS should periodically reassess and adjust the elements of the DMP program where appropriate, to incorporate evidence from the outcomes of the DMP\u2014such as how at-risk beneficiaries are identified, or which drugs are selected as frequently abused drugs.", "Finally, CMS officials told GAO that they are taking steps to assess the DMPs and gather the information required to make periodic changes to the DMP program. For example, CMS officials plan to analyze data for at-risk beneficiaries that DMPs are required to report to CMS, update their Medicare Part D audit protocol, and obtain feedback from plan sponsors about how the DMPs are working.", "The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Misuse and abuse of prescription opioids (such as oxycodone), which are  used to treat both acute and chronic pain, has become a serious public  health problem in the United States, including among Medicare  beneficiaries.

States have broad discretion in how and whether to implement lock-ins,  including how to identify at-risk beneficiaries. Medicaid lock-in programs  have been associated with advantages including declines in inappropriate  prescribing, decreases in abuse of controlled substances, and increased  treatment options for beneficiaries.

CMS established a framework for  plan sponsors that volunteer to establish Medicare DMPs. CMS\u2019s  framework includes two steps for identifying at-risk beneficiaries: 1) CMS  identifies potentially at-risk beneficiaries based on key clinical factors and  2) plan sponsors use case management to identify the subset of  potentially at-risk beneficiaries who are actually at risk.", "Step One: Identifying potentially at-risk beneficiaries. CMS identifies  potentially at-risk beneficiaries based on the minimum Overutilization  Monitoring System\u2019s criteria and develops a quarterly list of these  beneficiaries, which it sends to plan sponsors. The Overutilization Monitoring System was originally designed and implemented by CMS in  July 2013 to oversee plan sponsors\u2019 compliance with CMS\u2019s opioid  overutilization policy and is based on beneficiary claims data. It was  enhanced in 2019 to support the implementation of DMPs. The system  encompasses a medication safety approach with the goal of reducing  beneficiary overutilization of opioids while maintaining beneficiary access  to needed medication. The Overutilization Monitoring System creates  and sends a list of beneficiaries meeting minimum criteria quarterly to  plan sponsors with DMPs. These patients are considered potentially at- risk beneficiaries. Additional supplemental criteria can also be used by  plan sponsors to identify other potential at-risk beneficiaries, such as  those who use seven or more pharmacies for opioid prescriptions. Use of  higher numbers of prescribers and pharmacies may put the beneficiary at  more risk. (See table 1.)", "Step Two: Using case management to identify actually at-risk  beneficiaries and mitigate risk of misuse or abuse. After identification  of potentially at-risk beneficiaries by CMS, the second step in the  framework is for plan sponsors to coordinate the provision of care,  referred to as case management. Plan sponsors use case management  to determine which potentially at-risk beneficiaries are deemed to be  actually at risk. Plan sponsors\u2019 clinicians must begin case management  for each potentially at-risk beneficiary with the beneficiary\u2019s prescribers of  frequently abused drugs, with the purpose of determining if current  treatment is appropriate, examining specifically if the beneficiary is being  appropriately treated with frequently abused drugs. This step allows for  health-care providers to bring the beneficiary\u2019s clinical information into the  discussion.", "Two groups of beneficiaries identified as potentially at risk are excluded  from Medicare DMPs during the case management process: First, CMS  will automatically exempt from Medicare DMP consideration any  beneficiary who (a) has elected to receive hospice, palliative, or end-of- life care; (b) is a resident of a long-term-care facility or of another facility  for which frequently abused drugs are dispensed for residents through a  contract with a single pharmacy; or (c) has active cancer-related pain.  Second, through a discussion of beneficiary-level clinical information as  part of case management, beneficiaries found to be receiving appropriate  treatment, or who have had cases resolved with adjustments to their  treatment will also be excluded from Medicare DMP consideration. CMS  officials told us that the beneficiaries\u2019 health-care providers often adjust  their prescribing after talking with the health plans\u2019 clinicians and learning  information about other health-care providers also treating the  beneficiary.", "After eliminating the excluded beneficiaries, the plan sponsor sends an  initial notification letter to the remaining beneficiaries who continue to be  identified as potentially at risk, and thus, may require limiting the  coverage of a prescription drug in some manner (coverage limitation).  The notification letter notifies each beneficiary that he or she has been  identified as potentially at risk; details which coverage limitations the  sponsor intends to implement and for how long; explains how the  beneficiary can submit preferences for the selected frequently abused  drugs prescriber(s) and the selected dispensing pharmacy or pharmacies  for frequently abused drugs in case a lock-in tool is used; provides  information about resources and plan benefits that address prescription  abuse; explains how additional information can be provided to the plan  sponsor; and informs the beneficiary of the right to appeal, among other  things. Medicare plan sponsors have three coverage limitation tools that  can be used either concurrently or sequentially:", "Frequently abused drugs prescriber lock-in. The at-risk beneficiary  will receive prescriptions from only one or more selected prescriber.  Prescribers in a group practice will count as a single prescriber.", "Frequently abused drugs-dispensing pharmacy lock-in. The at- risk beneficiary will receive all prescriptions from one or more selected  dispensing pharmacy. The pharmacy must be in their plan sponsor\u2019s  network. When a pharmacy has different locations that share real-time  electronic data, such as chain pharmacies, all locations of the  pharmacy will be treated as one pharmacy.", "Beneficiary specific point-of-sale claim edit. The at-risk beneficiary  will be restricted to certain frequently abused drugs and amounts  through the point-of-sale claim edit. This means that a plan sponsor  must not cover a prescription for the frequently abused drug for an at- risk beneficiary that is in excess of the limit in the edit. Pharmacists  will receive a message when a beneficiary attempts to fill a  prescription if the prescription exceeds the limit in place for that  beneficiary.", "After a 30-day period from the date of the initial notification letter, there  are two possible outcomes: either the plan sponsor will determine that the  beneficiary is at risk for misuse or abuse of frequently abused drugs and  will proceed with the coverage limitation under its DMP, or the sponsor  will determine that the beneficiary is not at risk. If the potentially at-risk  beneficiary is found to be at risk, a second notification letter is sent to the  beneficiary as soon as possible after the 30-day period but no later than  60 days from the date of the initial notification letter. The second letter  includes the beneficiary\u2019s identification as at risk for misuse or abuse of  frequently abused drugs, the right to appeal the decision, coverage  limitations to be employed, and the expiration date of the coverage  limitations, among other things. The second notification letter also  explains how the beneficiary can submit preferences for the selected  frequently abused drugs prescriber(s) and the selected dispensing  pharmacy or pharmacies for frequently abused drugs in case a lock-in  tool is used. The selected frequently abused drugs prescriber(s) must  agree to serve as the beneficiary\u2019s only frequently abused drugs  prescriber(s) and must be determined by the plan sponsor as not  contributing to the beneficiary\u2019s opioid misuse. The at-risk beneficiary  generally has 60 days from the date of the second notification letter to  request an appeal of an at-risk determination. A new at-risk determination  is made by the plan sponsor as a result of continued case management  (that is, continued coordination of care and clinical discussions) within a  standard time frame of 7 days for redetermination, or an expedited time  frame of 72 hours for redetermination.", "Alternatively, if it is determined that the potentially at-risk beneficiary is  being treated appropriately for their medical condition and is therefore not  at risk, an alternate second notification letter is sent to the beneficiary  stating that the beneficiary was deemed not to be at risk and that access  to frequently abused drugs will not be limited under a DMP. This alternate  second notification letter must be sent no later than 60 days after the date  on the initial notification letter.", "If a beneficiary switches to a different plan sponsor after being identified  as potentially at risk or actually at risk, the determination does not  automatically transfer to the new plan sponsor. The new plan sponsor will  be able to see the previous plan sponsor\u2019s determination, but the new  plan sponsor may have to make its own determination through case  management unless the prior plan\u2019s case management information is up  to date.", "According to CMS\u2019s framework, the termination date of an at-risk  determination is the earlier of two possible dates: 12 months from the  effective date of the coverage limitation, unless the limitation is extended,  or when the beneficiary demonstrates that he or she is no longer likely to  be at risk before the end of the 12 months. At the end of the 12-month  period, a clinical assessment of the at-risk beneficiary will determine if the  DMP should continue for another year or be ended. The maximum  coverage limitation period in a DMP is 24 months. After 24 months, the  coverage limitation is halted, but according to the framework, CMS  continues to monitor the beneficiary quarterly through the Overutilization  Monitoring System and can re-identify the beneficiary as potentially at risk  again if he or she meets the minimum Overutilization Monitoring System  criteria.", "Reporting requirements for Medicare DMPs. Although the Medicare  DMPs are currently voluntary, the framework places reporting  requirements on plan sponsors that choose to establish DMPs. Medicare  DMPs are integrated with the Opioid Drug Utilization Review Policy and  Overutilization Monitoring System to improve medication safety. Plan  sponsors must report to CMS, through the Overutilization Monitoring  System, the results of case management for each potential at-risk  beneficiary identified. For each beneficiary deemed to be at risk, the  coverage limitation tools \u2013 frequently abused drugs prescriber lock-in,  frequently abused drugs-dispensing pharmacy lock-in, and beneficiary  specific point-of-sale claims edit \u2013 that will be used to limit the  beneficiary\u2019s access to frequently abused drugs must also be reported.  Other required information to be reported to CMS includes dates of the  initial and second notification letters, and the date that the plan sponsor  decides to terminate a potential at-risk or at-risk status. This data allows  CMS to track beneficiary-level data for those beneficiaries placed in  DMPs.", "Input about Medicare DMP framework from plan sponsors and  experts. Although the at-risk determination is the responsibility of the  plan sponsor, four of the five plan sponsors we interviewed stated they  would rely on results from case management, including the beneficiary\u2019s  primary health-care provider\u2019s input, to make the determination. One plan  sponsor told us it has a panel of physicians and pharmacists that makes  the at-risk determination for beneficiaries. The panel takes into  consideration the input of the beneficiary\u2019s prescribers of frequently  abused drugs, but the panel makes the final decision.", "None of the five plan sponsors we interviewed expressed concerns about  beneficiaries not receiving clinically appropriate doses of opioids under  the Medicare DMPs, given that the case management process includes  clinician input, including the beneficiary\u2019s primary health-care provider  and plan sponsors\u2019 clinicians. According to one medical expert, case  management is beneficial because it allows for input from the  beneficiary\u2019s prescriber rather than relying solely on the Overutilization  Monitoring System metric criteria to determine who is at risk.", "Three of the five plan sponsors we interviewed expressed prior positive  experiences with lock-ins. All plan sponsors had experience with the lock- in tools from their experience participating in Medicaid programs or  offering private insurance plans. Three of the five plan sponsors reported  better coordinated oversight and management of patients and their  conditions in those experiences. One sponsor stated that lock-in  programs are perceived as an additional safety mechanism for at-risk  beneficiaries by helping with the coordination of the beneficiaries\u2019 care  because the plan sponsor\u2019s clinicians, prescribers, and pharmacies are  aware of the lock-in programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Sponsors and Stakeholders Believe Coordination, Communication, and Flexibility to Incorporate Best Practices Are Keys to Success of Drug Management Programs", "paragraphs": ["Officials with five plan sponsors and six stakeholder organizations  representing physicians, pharmacy benefit managers, and patients we  interviewed told us that several factors beyond the clinical input  incorporated in the case management process could contribute to the  success of DMPs. These factors include communication, collaboration,  and flexibility for plan sponsors to manage and incorporate best practices.", "Communication among plan sponsors, opioid prescribers, and  pharmacies dispensing opioids could reduce any potential resistance to  DMPs by stakeholders, and contribute to DMP success, officials told us.  Specifically, several officials with plan sponsors and stakeholders noted  that sponsors should communicate with, and educate stakeholders to  ensure that DMPs, especially their coverage limitation tools, are not  viewed as punitive tools by beneficiaries, but rather as tools for keeping  them safe. Some of these officials stated that through education and  other means, plan sponsors should also encourage health-care providers  and their enrollees to view opioid addiction by at-risk beneficiaries as a  disease rather than a choice.", "Effective collaboration among prescribers and patients in making  individualized treatment decisions for pain management is another key to  successful DMPs, according to some stakeholders we interviewed.  Specifically, some plan sponsors and a stakeholder noted that during and  after case management plan sponsors should support collaboration  between prescribers and patients to ensure access to the clinically  appropriate level of opioids for each beneficiary.", "Flexibility to incorporate best practices from DMPs and flexibility in  varying coverage limitation features to fit regional differences are other  keys to success, some plan sponsors and a stakeholder told us, due to  regional and other differences in population groups. Data from CDC show  that there is some variation in death rates from opioids in the overall  population by state, and a CDC study also shows that opioid prescribing  patterns also vary by location\u2014the average per capita prescribed  amounts varied widely by county, and demographic and other factors are  sometimes associated with higher prescribing patterns. In addition, some  officials with plan sponsors and stakeholders stated that the criteria for  DMPs such as how at-risk beneficiaries are identified, and other  parameters of the DMP (such as which drugs are designated as  frequently abused drugs) should be periodically reassessed by CMS with  feedback by plan sponsors and adjusted, where appropriate, to  incorporate evidence from the outcomes of the DMP.", "Officials with plan sponsors and stakeholders we interviewed also  discussed several factors that could limit the success of the DMPs:", "An official with a plan sponsor and a stakeholder told us that  purchases of opioids made by beneficiaries using cash are not  captured in the available prescription drug claims data maintained by  plan sponsors. These officials suggested therefore that sponsors  should encourage the selected prescribers to review this information  by using state PDMPs, which track controlled substance prescriptions  in a state and include cash sales of opioids.", "One plan sponsor commented that coverage limitations could have a  negative effect on beneficiary health satisfaction survey scores and  therefore could affect how a physician prescribes opioids.  Beneficiaries who are placed in a DMP or subject to one of the DMP  tools may report decreased satisfaction in the \u201cConsumer Assessment  of Healthcare Providers and Systems\u201d surveys. Under Medicare  Advantage, patient experience about the ease of receiving care is one  measure of quality and is a factor in plan sponsor reimbursement.  Finally, some officials with plan sponsors and stakeholders told us  that in localities where prescribers feel a stigma associated with  dispensing opioids, the coverage limitation feature could have the  unintended consequence of creating a disincentive for prescribers to  take care of patients who require opioid treatment. According to an  official, to combat the opioid crisis, some states send letters to the top  opioid prescribers in their state as a way to create awareness about  trends in opioid prescribing. Officials with a plan sponsor and a  stakeholder said that providers who want to avoid being on the list of  top prescribers refer patients to pain specialists for management of  pain. Officials told us that the demand for these pain specialists is  increasing and there are long waiting lists to access care by these  pain specialists.", "CMS is taking several steps to assess the DMPs and gather information  to make periodic changes to the program. For example, CMS officials told  us they plan to monitor and analyze beneficiary complaints, appeals,  prescription drug event data, and other data submitted by plan sponsors  related to DMPs. According to CMS officials, the agency also will obtain  feedback from plan sponsors about how the DMPs are working, and this  feedback will be the basis for making periodic changes to the DMPs.  CMS is also updating its Medicare Part C and D audit protocol so it can  audit DMP related beneficiary notices. Finally, CMS tracks the utilization  of opioids by Medicare Part D enrollees using Part D data and the  Overutilization Monitoring System. For example in the 2020 Medicare  Advantage and Part D draft call letter, CMS reported that between 2012  and 2017, there was a 33 percent decrease in the number of Part D  enrollees meeting or exceeding 90 MME for at least one day, with the  largest decrease (14 percent) in 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review.
