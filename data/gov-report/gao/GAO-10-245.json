To do this, Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM), among other things, requires oil and gas operators to reclaim the land they disturb and post a bond to help ensure they do so. Despite these requirements, not all operators perform reclamation. If the bond is not sufficient to cover well plugging and surface reclamation and there are no responsible or liable parties, the well is considered \"orphaned,\" and BLM uses federal dollars to fund reclamation. The 12 western states where most oil and gas production occurs and other Interior agencies also require bonds to ensure reclamation. GAO was asked to (1) determine the number, value, and coverage of bonds held by BLM for oil and gas operations; (2) determine the amount that BLM has paid to reclaim orphaned wells over the past 20 years and the number of orphaned wells BLM has identified but has not yet reclaimed; and (3) compare BLM's bonding requirements for oil and gas operations with those the 12 western states use for oil and gas operations on state and private lands and other Interior agencies' bonding requirements for other resources. Among other things, GAO analyzed BLM data on wells and BLM-held bonds, and interviewed BLM officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to GAO's analysis of BLM data, as of December 2008, oil and gas operators had provided 3,879 bonds, valued at $162 million, to ensure compliance with lease terms and conditions for 88,357 wells. BLM regulations establish minimum bond amounts: $10,000 for an individual lease, $25,000 to cover all leases of a single operator in a state, and $150,000 to cover all leases of a single operator nationwide. The bond amount for individual leases was set in 1960, while the statewide and nationwide bond amounts were set in 1951. For fiscal years 1988 through 2009, BLM spent about $3.8 million to reclaim 295 orphaned wells in 10 states and has identified an additional 144 orphaned wells in 7 states that need to be reclaimed, according to BLM. The amount spent per reclamation project varied greatly, from a high of $582,829 for a single well in Wyoming in fiscal year 2008 to a low of $300 for 3 wells in Wyoming in fiscal year 1994. BLM reclamation cost estimates were not available for all of the wells it has yet to reclaim, but BLM field office officials have completed reclamation cost estimates of approximately $1.7 million for 102 of the 144 orphaned wells. The 12 western states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) and other Interior agencies and offices have bonding approaches that differ from BLM's oil and gas bonding requirements. The states generally require higher bond amounts than the minimum amounts established by BLM regulations for individual and statewide oil and gas leases. Regulations governing the extraction or use of other federally owned resources generally require bond amounts based on the cost of reclamation or use minimum amounts that were established more recently than the bond amounts for oil and gas. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Interior for review and comment. The Department provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as  amended, directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage federal lands for  multiple uses, including recreation and mineral extraction, while also  taking any action required to prevent the \u201cunnecessary or undue  degradation\u201d of public land, including federal land that has been leased for  oil and gas operations. Over the past decade, the total number of new  wells drilled more than doubled, which has raised concerns about the  impact of these operations on federal land. Operators are required to  reclaim the leased land in the interest of conservation of surface  resources. Reclamation is intended to return land disturbed by oil and gas  operations to as close to its original condition as is reasonably practical,  including reshaping and revegetating, removing structures, and plugging  wells.", "The Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) Bureau of Land Management  (BLM) is responsible for implementing FLPMA on BLM land. To carry out  this responsibility, BLM, among other things, requires oil and gas  operators to provide a bond to the agency before beginning certain drilling  operations under an oil and gas lease. These bonds are intended to ensure  that operators perform the required reclamation, as well as the lease\u2019s  other terms and conditions, such as the payment of federal royalties.  These bonds may be surety bonds, a third-party guarantee that an operator  purchases from a private insurance company; or personal bonds  accompanied by a financial instrument, such as a cashier\u2019s check or  negotiable Treasury security. Having operators post bonds to help ensure  reclamation after mineral production has ceased is a common practice.  The 12 western states where most oil and gas production occurs also  require bonds for oil and gas wells on their lands. In addition, BLM and  other Interior agencies require bonds for the extraction of other resources,  such as gold and coal, which are located on federal land or owned by the  federal government.", "Although all operators are required to complete reclamation, they do not  always do so. In these circumstances, BLM may use the bond to help  defray some of the cost of completing reclamation. If the bond is not  sufficient to cover well plugging and surface reclamation and there are no  responsible or liable parties, the well is considered \u201corphaned.\u201d In these  cases, BLM uses appropriated funds to complete the reclamation.", "In this context, you asked us to study a range of issues concerning BLM\u2019s  bonding requirements and efforts to ensure that operators reclaim their oil  and gas operations. This report provides the results of the first phase of  our work. For this phase, we (1) determined the number, value, and  coverage of bonds held by BLM for oil and gas operations; (2) determined  the amount that BLM has paid to reclaim orphaned wells over the past 20  years and the number of orphaned wells BLM has identified but has not  yet reclaimed; and (3) compared BLM\u2019s bonding requirements for oil and  gas operations with the bonding requirements the 12 western states use  for oil and gas operations on state and private lands and other Interior  agencies\u2019 bonding requirements for other resources.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed federal regulations and BLM  guidance on bonding for oil and gas leases. We discussed this guidance  and a broad range of issues related to how BLM oversees bonding for oil  and gas leases with bonding officials at BLM state offices and field offices  in Colorado and Wyoming, which have a large number of oil and gas wells  and administer bonds that account for a significant amount of the value of  BLM-held bonds. To determine the number of bonds, their value, and  coverage as of December 2008, we analyzed data from BLM\u2019s Bonding and  Surety System\u2014an electronic system containing bond information for oil  and gas operations, as well as for other BLM resource extraction  programs. We also analyzed data from BLM\u2019s Automated Fluid Minerals  Support System (AFMSS)\u2014a database that BLM uses to track oil and gas  information on public and Indian land. It contains data on, among other  things, lease ownership, and well identification, location, and production.  To assess the reliability of the data we used from these systems, among  other things, we electronically tested all fields related to our analysis and  met with agency officials who administer the systems. We found that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report. For orphaned  wells, we obtained information from BLM for fiscal years 1998 through  2009 on the federal dollars paid to reclaim orphaned wells, and the number  of orphaned wells and estimated reclamation costs by state. We also  analyzed state oil and gas bonding regulations, as well as federal bonding  regulations for the extraction of other resources, such as gold and coal, to  compare these bonding regulations with BLM\u2019s bonding regulations for  onshore oil and gas operations. Appendix I describes our scope and  methodology in more detail.", "We performed our work from January 2009 to January 2010 in accordance  with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant  to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the  engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our  stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe  that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted,  provide a reasonable basis for our findings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["BLM is responsible for managing, as of July 2008, approximately 700  million acres of subsurface mineral resources: 655.5 million of these acres  are not affected by oil and gas production and 44.5 million acres are leased  for oil and gas operations. Of these 44.5 million acres, 11.7 million acres  are in oil and gas producing status and 472,000 acres have surface  disturbance related to oil and gas production. To manage BLM programs  and land, the agency maintains a network of state offices, which generally  conforms to the boundary of one or more states. The state offices are  Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New  Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, and Eastern States. BLM has little land in  the eastern half of the United States, consequently, the Eastern States  state office, in Springfield, Virginia, is responsible for managing land in 31  states. Figure 1 shows the boundaries of the 12 BLM state offices.", "When operators drill oil and gas wells, they typically remove topsoil from  the well site and lay a well pad, where the drilling rig is located. Other  equipment on site can include generators and fuel tanks. In addition,  reserve pits are often constructed to store or dispose of water, mud, and  other materials that are generated during drilling operations, and roads  and access ways are often built to move equipment to and from the wells.  Generally, these activities can degrade the environment in three ways:    Air quality. Newly graded roads can produce dust, impairing air quality  and visibility in the immediate area and downwind. Nitrogen oxides from  diesel engines and compressors used at drilling sites can also degrade air  quality.", "Water quality. Water draining off newly graded surfaces and roads or oil  or water accidentally discharged during oil and gas production can  increase the amount of sediment, salt, and pollutants discharged into  rivers and streams, thereby degrading them. In addition, shallow aquifers  can be polluted if required protective measures are not in place, and the  production of methane gas from coal beds can deplete shallow aquifers  that serve as domestic water sources.", "Habitat. A high density of drilling and production equipment can, in  extreme situations, change the appearance of the landscape from a natural  setting to an industrial zone. In addition, the noises, smells, and lights from  trucks, drilling and construction equipment, and production facilities can  disturb wildlife and people living nearby.", "Under FLPMA, BLM must manage federal lands for multiple uses,  including recreation and mineral extraction, as well as for sustained yield.  To that end, FLPMA requires BLM to develop resource management plans,  known as land use plans. In developing its land use plans, BLM  determines, among other things, which parcels of land will be available for  oil and gas development. According to BLM officials, parties interested in  leasing federal minerals submit an Expression of Interest or pre-sale offer  on those lands they are interested in leasing. These are then reviewed and  if the lands are eligible to be leased, are placed up for competitive oil and  gas lease sale. Leases can vary in size reaching 2,560 acres for lands in the  lower 48 states and 5,760 acres for lands in Alaska.", "Operators that have obtained a lease must submit an application for a  permit to drill to BLM before beginning to prepare land or drilling any new  oil or gas wells. The complete permit application package is a lengthy and  detailed set of forms and documents, which, among other things, must  include proof of bond coverage and a surface use plan of operations; this  surface use plan must include a reclamation plan that details the steps  operators propose to take to reclaim the site. However, operators  generally do not have to submit cost estimates for completing the  reclamation.", "The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, requires that federal  regulations ensure that an adequate bond or surety is established before  operators begin to prepare land for drilling. The bond is intended to ensure  complete and timely reclamation. Accordingly, federal regulations require  the operator to submit a surety or personal bond to BLM, which is  intended to ensure compliance with all of the lease\u2019s terms and conditions,  including reclamation requirements. Surety bonds are a third-party  guarantee that an operator purchases from a private insurance company  approved by the Department of the Treasury, and personal bonds must be  accompanied by one of the following five financial instruments:    certificates of deposit issued by a financial institution whose deposits are    cashier\u2019s checks;    negotiable Treasury securities, including U.S. Treasury notes or bonds,  with conveyance to the Secretary of the Interior to sell the security in case  of default in the performance of the lease\u2019s terms and conditions; and  irrevocable letters of credit that are issued for a specific term by a  financial institution whose deposits are federally insured, and meet certain  conditions.", "In reviewing the application for a permit to drill, BLM (1) evaluates the  operator\u2019s proposal to ensure that the proposed drilling plan conforms to  the land use plan and applicable laws and regulations and (2) inspects the  proposed drilling site to determine if additional site-specific conditions  must be addressed before the operator can begin drilling. After BLM  approves a drilling permit, the operator can drill the well and commence  production.", "After drilling the well, the operator may perform interim reclamation\u2014the  practice of reclaiming surfaces that were disturbed to prepare a well for  drilling but that are no longer needed. For example, operators may need a  10-acre drill pad to safely drill a series of wells. However, once the wells  are drilled, operators may only need 4 acres to safely service the wells  over their lifetime. In this case, the operator could reseed and regrade the  6 acres of the initial pad that are no longer needed. While BLM does not  generally require interim reclamation in all permits it issues, it may decide  to add interim reclamation as a requirement in drilling permits for specific  oil and gas developments.", "Final reclamation occurs when an operator determines, and BLM agrees,  that a well has no economic value. The terms of final reclamation are  included in the lease and the drilling permit. The operator must follow the  agreed-upon final reclamation plan, including plugging the wells, removing  all visual evidence of the well and drill pad, recontouring the affected land,  and revegetating the site with native plant species. In general, the goal is to  reclaim the well site so that it matches the surrounding natural  environment to the extent possible. BLM then inspects the site to monitor  the success of the reclamation, a process that typically takes several years.  Once BLM determines that reclamation efforts have been successful, it  approves a Final Abandonment Notice.", "However, in some circumstances, the operator may delay performing  reclamation and instead allow the well to remain idle for various reasons.  For example, expected higher oil and gas prices may once again make the  well economically viable to operate, or the operator may decide to use the  well for enhanced recovery operations, for example using the well to  inject water into the oil reservoir and push any remaining oil to operating  wells.", "Under BLM policy, the agency must periodically review the status of these  idle wells to ensure that the operator has legitimate reasons for allowing  the wells to remain idle. According to BLM officials, the primary purpose  of idle-well reviews is to ensure that these wells do not become  orphaned\u2014that is, they lack a bond sufficient to cover reclamation costs  and there are no responsible or liable parties to perform reclamation.", "States have adopted laws and regulations governing oil and gas  development on state and private lands, including bond and reclamation  requirements. In addition, other Interior programs and offices that are  responsible for managing the extraction of other federally owned  resources have bond and reclamation requirements.

Second, BLM officials may require an  increase in the amount of any bond when the operator poses a risk due to  factors that include, but are not limited to, a history of previous violations,  a notice from MMS that there are uncollected royalties due, or the fact that  the total cost of plugging existing wells and reclaiming lands exceeds the  present bond amount based on BLM estimates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "BLM Spent Nearly $4 Million to Reclaim 295 Orphaned Wells since Fiscal Year 1988 and Has Identified Another 144 Orphaned Wells to Be Reclaimed", "paragraphs": ["According to BLM data, the agency spent about $3.8 million to reclaim 295  orphaned wells in 10 states from fiscal years 1988 through 2009.

Some of these states, such as Ohio and West  Virginia, do not currently produce high volumes of oil and gas compared  with other states in the West, although they did in the late 1800s and early  1900s. Although reclamation costs averaged $12,788 per well, the amount  spent to reclaim wells varied by reclamation project, state, and fiscal year.  For example:    Cost per project. The amount spent per reclamation project varied from a  high of $582,829 for a single well in Wyoming in fiscal year 2008, to a low  of $300 for three wells in Wyoming in fiscal year 1994.

BLM had no expenditures  to reclaim orphaned wells in fiscal years 1989 through 1991, 1996 through  1998, or in 2005. BLM officials explained that orphaned wells were not  reclaimed in those years because the decision to do so is left to the  discretion of BLM state office officials. Further, there is no dedicated  budget line item to fund orphaned well reclamation; instead, it is  dependent on whatever funds are available from BLM state offices and the  BLM Washington office.", "Table 2 provides a summary of the number of wells reclaimed, the  expenditures per year, and the states where reclamation occurred by year;  table 3 shows the number of wells reclaimed and expenditures by state.", "BLM has identified an additional 144 orphaned wells on BLM and other  federal land that need to be reclaimed in seven states.

More than half of these  wells for which BLM has estimated costs are in Oklahoma\u2014the state with  the highest concentration of orphaned wells. The estimated reclamation  costs in each state differ substantially\u2014from an average cost per well in  Wyoming of $93,641 to a low of $9,100 in Arizona. These differences are  due to such factors as well age, well depth, the amount of surface  disturbance, and costs for materials and labor. Table 4 shows the  orphaned wells and the estimated reclamation costs by state; table 5  shows the wells by surface management agency.", "In addition, BLM is responsible for reclaiming 67 wells in Alaska that are  commonly referred to as legacy wells. Unlike orphaned wells, which were  drilled by private-sector operators, legacy wells were drilled by the U.S.  Navy and the U.S. Geological Survey from the early 1900s to 1981 on what  was then the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4\u2014a 23-million-acre roadless  area 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The wells were drilled to evaluate  the mineral potential of the area and to test arctic oil and gas exploration  and engineering practices. In 1976, the reserve was renamed the National  Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and its administration was transferred  to BLM\u2014including responsibility for reclaiming those wells drilled prior to  the transfer. Because of the remote location and difficult weather conditions  in the NPR-A, mobilizing equipment and personnel to perform reclamation  can be unusually expensive. For example, BLM estimates that reclaiming  one well\u2014known as Drew Point #1\u2014will cost $23.6 million, owing in part to  the well\u2019s close proximity\u2014less than 500 feet\u2014to the Arctic Ocean, which is  eroding the shore nearby. Although estimates are not available for  reclaiming all 67 of these legacy wells, BLM estimated in 2004 that  reclaiming 37 high-priority legacy wells would exceed $40 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM Oil and Gas Bonding Requirements Differ from States\u2019 Requirements and from Federal Bonding Requirements for Other Resources", "paragraphs": ["Like BLM, states have bonding requirements for oil and gas operations.

The states use bonds that cover either all wells in  the state (similar to BLM\u2019s statewide bond but referred to as statewide  blanket bonds), multiple wells in the states (referred to as blanket bonds),  or an individual well. Regarding the amount of bond required, the 12  western states generally either use a minimum bond amount established  by regulation regardless of the well\u2019s characteristics or determine bond  amounts based either on the depth of the well(s) or on the total number of  wells covered by the bond. The latter approach is often more complex  than the regulatory minimum requirements and triggers increases in bond  amounts when certain additional factors come into play. For example:    For individual wells, Wyoming determines bond amounts based on well  depth. If the well is less than 2,000 feet deep, the state requires a bond of  at least $10,000, and if the well is 2,000 feet or deeper, the state requires a  bond of at least $20,000. For statewide bonds, the minimum bond amount  is $75,000. However, Wyoming may require an additional bond, currently  in the amount of $10 per foot of well depth, when a well is not producing,  injecting, or disposing after an operator\u2019s total footage of idle wells  reaches a certain threshold. Finally, the amount of this additional bond  will increase every 3 years in accordance with the percentage change in  Wyoming consumer price index.", "For statewide bonds, California uses an approach that considers the  number of wells and imposes an additional requirement on operators with  idle wells. If an operator has 50 or fewer wells, then the bond amount is  set at $100,000; if an operator has more than 50 wells exclusive of properly  abandoned wells, the bond amount is set at $250,000. In addition to these  bond amounts, operators must either (1) pay an annual fee for each idle  well, (2) establish an escrow account of $5,000 for each idle well, (3)  provide a $5,000 bond per idle well, or (4) have filed a management and  elimination plan for all long-term idle wells. In lieu of complying with this  requirement for idle wells, operators can post a $1 million statewide bond.", "In contrast, BLM\u2019s method for deciding when and how much to increase  the minimum bond amount is not automatic, unless the operator has  previously failed to plug a well or reclaim lands; rather, it is based on the  judgment of field and state office officials.", "Table 6 shows the 12 western states\u2019 bonding requirements.", "The 12 western states generally require bond amounts that are at least  equal to or higher than the minimum amount BLM requires for its  individual lease and statewide bonds, or determine the bond amount based  on well depth or number of wells covered by the bond. For example:    The 4 states that require minimum bond amounts for individual wells  regardless of well depth\u2014Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, and Washington\u2014set  minimum bond amounts at $100,000, $10,000, $10,000, and $50,000 per  well, respectively. Because these bond amounts are required for each well,  in most circumstances they are generally higher than BLM\u2019s minimum  amount of $10,000 for individual lease bonds since most BLM leases have  more than one well.", "The 7 states whose regulations establish a bond amount or minimum bond  amount for statewide or blanket bonds regardless of a well\u2019s  characteristics\u2014Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,  Washington, and Wyoming\u2014have amounts that range from a high of  $250,000 in Washington to low of $25,000 in Idaho.", "All states except Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, and Washington determine the  amount of individual well bonds based, at least in part, on well depth.  Three of the 9 states whose regulations provide for statewide bonds\u2014 California, Colorado, Utah\u2014also determine the amount based on well  depth or the number of wells covered by the bond. Because of the nature  of these approaches, it is difficult to compare them with BLM\u2019s bonding  requirements to determine which would result in the higher bond amount.  However, these approaches are generally more sophisticated than  minimum requirements in that they associate the bond amount with the  amount of drilling, which may reduce the potential liability to the states in  cases where the operator fails to perform the necessary reclamation.", "See appendix III for detailed information on the bonding requirements in  each of the 12 western states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Regulations for Other Resources Generally Require Bond Amounts That Cover Reclamation Costs or the Minimum Bond Amounts Have Been More Recently Set", "paragraphs": ["Regulations governing the extraction of other resources owned by the  federal government generally require (1) bond amounts that consider the  cost of reclamation, which reduces the government\u2019s potential liability for  reclamation costs; or (2) use minimum amounts that were established  more recently than the amounts for BLM oil and gas bonds.", "First, bonding requirements for the extraction of coal and hardrock  minerals\u2014such as gold, silver, and copper\u2014require operators to post  bonds that cover the full estimated cost of reclamation. These  requirements reduce the potential reclamation liability to the federal  government should the operations fail to perform the necessary  reclamation.", "Second, for the remaining types of federally owned resources, minimum  bond amounts are established by regulation. These regulations are similar to  BLM\u2019s regulations; however, these regulatory minimum amounts generally  have all been established or updated since BLM established its current  regulatory minimums for oil and gas leases in 1951 for statewide and  nationwide bonds, and in 1960 for individual lease bonds.

Specifically, we were asked to (1) determine the types,  value, and coverage of bonds held by BLM for oil and gas operations; (2)  determine the amount that BLM has paid to reclaim orphaned wells over  the past 20 years, and the number of orphaned wells BLM has identified  but has not yet reclaimed; and (3) compare BLM\u2019s bonding requirements  for oil and gas operations with the bonding requirements the 12 western  states use for oil and gas operations on state and private lands and other  Interior agencies\u2019 bonding requirements for other resources.", "Overall, we reviewed federal regulations and BLM guidance on bonding for  oil and gas leases, and discussed this guidance and a broad range of issues  related to how BLM oversees bonding for oil and gas leases during  interviews with bonding officials at BLM state offices and field offices in  Colorado and Wyoming\u2014two states that have a large number of oil and  gas wells and administer bonds that account for a significant amount of  the value of BLM-held bonds.", "For objective one\u2014to determine the number, value, and coverage of  bonds, as of December 2008\u2014we analyzed data from BLM\u2019s bond and  surety system, and Automated Fluid Minerals Support System (AFMSS),  and met with agency officials who administer the systems. From the bond  and surety system, we received 13 tables from BLM containing 747,926  records on bonds from June 19, 1925, to December 17, 2008. We also  received 9 tables containing 106,705 records on wells from January 7, 1930,  to August 20, 2009 from BLM\u2019s AFMSS. Because the bond and surety  system contains records on bonds that have been terminated and do not  have any well liability attached, we first determined which records  contained active bonds. Because bond data were limited to records before  December 17, 2008, we selected the first day of the final month for which  we had data, December 1, 2008. We corroborated the number of active  bonds using a range of different methodologies that uses other data in the  bond and surety system and confirmed that the list of active bonds was  sufficiently complete for the purposes of our analysis.", "To determine the number of bonds, we selected all active bonds as of  December 1, 2008, in the bond and surety system and grouped them by  bond type into surety or personal bonds. BLM\u2019s data further identified  personal bonds as letter of credit, time deposit, Treasury security, and  guaranteed remittance. We analyzed 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3104.1, which addresses  bond types, and spoke to BLM officials, before deciding to group the  various types of personal bonds into a single personal bond category.", "To determine the value of bonds, we selected all active bonds as of  December 1, 2008, in the bond and surety system and grouped them by  unique bond file number. To calculate the total value of all active bonds,  we summed the bond amount for all unique bonds. We also grouped bonds  by bond type and bond coverage type to calculate the value for each  group. Finally, we grouped all bonds by BLM state office using the  administrative state field in the bond and surety system and summed the  amount of all bonds for each BLM state office, as well as categorizing  bonds by bond type and bond coverage type.", "For bond coverage, we selected active bonds as of December 1, 2008, from  the bond and surety system and grouped them by the following categories:  individual, statewide, nationwide, and other. The other category included  collective (unit), blanket bonds, and bonds for the National Petroleum  Reserve in Alaska. We analyzed 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3104.2-3104.4 and spoke with  BLM officials to determine the appropriate bond coverage type categories,  creating the other category for the 6 percent of bonds not typically used  for current wells.", "To determine the number of wells, we received and analyzed data BLM  generated from the AFMSS database that included records current as of  August 20, 2009. The set of data received from BLM excluded all wells that  had been reclaimed prior to this date and whose bonds had been released,  helping to ensure that our data only included wells that required a bond.  To have the well data match the bonding data, we selected all well records  in AFMSS that were drilled before December 1, 2008. We identified wells  using the well\u2019s unique American Petroleum Institute number, which is  assigned when the well is drilled. In addition to information on producing  wells, the data also included information on wells that were shut in (i.e.,  could return to production) and temporarily abandoned (i.e., could be  used for a purpose other than producing oil or gas). We also grouped these  wells by their BLM state office using a location field in AFMSS. To  determine the number of leases, we grouped the number of wells listed  before December 1, 2008, by unique lease number, and analyzed these  leases by state using the location field of the lease within AFMSS. Because  the AFMSS system can generate current data only, our analysis excludes  those wells that were reclaimed between December 1, 2008, and August  20, 2009. Although these wells were not included in our totals, we  concluded the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  analysis, as data published in BLM\u2019s Public Land Statistics show that only  231 wells were plugged and abandoned in all of fiscal year 2008. We also  compared our total number of wells with the total number of wells in the  fiscal year 2008 BLM Public Land Statistics. We determined that the  difference between our total for December 1, 2008, and BLM\u2019s total for  September 30, 2008\u2014a difference of about 3 percent\u2014did not significantly  affect our analysis.", "For figure 2 in the report\u2014the number of wells and value of bonds, from  September 30, 1988, to September 30, 2008 (the most current date for  which BLM data were available)\u2014we selected five dates at 5-year intervals  for the past 20 years, and calculated the total value of all bonds using data  in the bond and surety system and the number of wells from BLM Public  Land Statistics. We used the following dates to assess coverage:  September 30, 2008; September 30, 2003; September 30, 1998; September  30, 1993; and September 30, 1988. For each of these dates, we selected all  active bonds, providing us with those bonds that were accepted, but not  terminated, before each of the five dates. To calculate the total value of  these bonds, we grouped unique bonds for each of the five dates, and  summed the bond amount field in the bond and surety system. To  calculate well totals, we were limited by the dynamic nature of AFMSS,  which restricted us from calculating the number of active wells for  specific dates in the past. Due to this limitation, we relied on BLM\u2019s Public  Land Statistics for the well totals for our specified dates.", "For figure 3 in the report\u2014individual, statewide, and nationwide current  bond minimums adjusted to 2009 dollars\u2014we used the bond minimums  established in 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3104.2, 3104.3 and searched the Federal  Register to determine the dates the bond minimums were established. We  then calculated the amount of each bond minimum in 2009 dollars.", "We reviewed the reliability of the data we used from the bond and surety  system and AFMSS and found these data sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our review, including: total number of bonds, total number of  wells, number and value of bonds by bond type, number and value of  bonds by coverage type, number of wells by state, number of leases by  state, number and value of bonds by state, average value of bonds by state  office, number and value of bond types by state office, and number and  value of coverage types by state office. To test the sufficiency of the bond  and surety system and AFMSS data used to calculate the number, types,  values, and coverage of bonds, we electronically tested the database and  conducted interviews with BLM staff responsible for the integrity of the  data. We also electronically tested all fields related to our analysis,  including tests for null values, duplicate records, accurate relationships  between code and text fields, and outliers. We also conducted 20  interviews with BLM staff between December 12, 2008, and November 13,  2009, on the following topics: data entry, use of data, completeness of  data, accuracy of data, edit checks, supervisory oversight, internal  reviews, different data fields, and data limitations. We determined that  there were no significant issues with the bond and surety system and  AFMSS data we used to calculate the number, types, value, and coverage  of bonds.", "To address our second objective\u2014determine how much BLM has paid to  reclaim orphaned wells over the past 20 years, and how many wells BLM  has yet to reclaim\u2014we obtained data collected by BLM officials from BLM  field and state offices. To determine the expenditures for reclaiming  orphaned wells, we obtained data for fiscal years 1988 through November  30, 1994, from a 1995 BLM report. We obtained data through fiscal year  2009 from BLM officials. These data included federal dollars paid to  reclaim orphaned wells, the number of wells reclaimed, and their location.  To determine the number of orphaned wells yet to be reclaimed, we  reviewed BLM\u2019s Instructional Memorandum No. 2007-192, which directs  BLM field office staff to report data on orphaned wells to BLM\u2019s  Washington Office. The Instructional Memorandum directs field office  staff to complete an \u201cOrphaned Well Scoring Checklist\u201d for each orphaned  well identified. This checklist asks for such information as the well\u2019s  location; well name; and other factors relating to reclamation, such as the  well depth or estimated reclamation cost. We reviewed these checklists  and analyzed all available estimated reclamation amounts. We then  calculated and summarized estimated reclamation cost data by state and  surface management agency.", "To address our third objective\u2014compare BLM\u2019s bonding methods with  those used by the 12 western states and other Interior agencies\u2014we  analyzed state oil and gas bonding laws and regulations, as well as federal  bonding regulations for the extraction or use of other federally owned  resources.
