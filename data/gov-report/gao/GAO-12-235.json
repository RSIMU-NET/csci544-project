The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) oversees the regulation, supervision, and examination of foreign and U.S. bank and thrift holding companies. As of the end of 2010, four qualifying foreign-owned intermediate holding companies (exempt holding companies) were relying on a capital exemption, which allowed them to operate with significantly lower capital than U.S. peers. Federal Reserve officials noted that allowing capital to be held at the foreign parent bank (consolidated) level was consistent with its supervision for U.S. bank holding companies and met international standards for home-host supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the capital exemption in order to enhance equal treatment of U.S.- and foreign-owned holding companies by requiring both types of companies to hold similar capital levels in the United States. As a result, these exempt holding companies must meet minimum capital standards that are not less than those applicable to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured depository institutions by July 2015.", "The four exempt holding companies have been considering various actions to comply with new capital requirements, and the effects of eliminating the capital exemption on competition and credit cost and availability likely would be small. Specifically, these companies are considering raising capital, decreasing their holdings of risky assets, restructuring, or adopting a combination of these actions. GAO\u0092s analysis of loan markets suggests that the elimination of the capital exemption likely would have a limited effect on the price and quantity of credit available because the affected banks have relatively small shares of U.S. loan markets, which are competitive. These four companies accounted for about 3.1 percent of the loans on the balance sheets of all bank holding companies in the United States as of year end 2010. In addition, GAO\u0092s review of the academic literature and econometric analysis both suggest that changes in capital rules that affect the exempt companies would have a limited effect on loan volumes and the cost of credit and add minimally to the cumulative cost of new financial regulations. Although the impact on the price and quantity of credit available may vary across regions, modeling limitations restricted GAO\u0092s ability to identify regional differences.", "Market participants expressed uncertainty about how changes in capital requirements might affect the competitiveness of U.S. banks operating abroad, partly because international regulatory capital requirements have yet to be implemented. The largest internationally active U.S. banks derived about one-third of their 2010 revenues from operations abroad. They face a variety of domestic and foreign competitors and are subject to multiple regulatory regimes. Bank officials expressed uncertainty about how changes in capital requirements will affect their cost of capital, lending ability, and competitiveness. Furthermore, they were concerned that fragmented or conflicting regulations across national jurisdictions might restrict banks\u0092 ability to use capital efficiently. Many U.S. banks GAO interviewed expressed concerns about the added costs of compliance with multiple regulatory regimes and the impact of the Act on the global competitiveness of U.S. banks, but these concerns would need to be considered against the potential benefits of a safer and sounder financial system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2007-2009 financial crisis revealed that many U.S. and international  financial institutions lacked capital of sufficient quality and quantity to  absorb substantial losses.

Holding companies are  legally separate entities from their subsidiary banks, are subject to  separate capital requirements, and are supervised and regulated by the  Federal Reserve. In the United States, bank holding companies are  common and function as the top-tier entity in the corporate structure. In  many foreign countries, notably in Europe, the deposit-taking bank is the  top-tier entity in the corporate structure and bank holding companies are  less common.

There are many forms  of capital, the strongest of which do not have to be repaid to investors, do  not require periodic dividend payments, and are among the last claims to  be paid in the event of bankruptcy. Common equity, which meets all of  these qualifications, is considered the strongest form of capital. Weaker  forms of capital have some but not all of the features of common equity.  National banking regulators classify capital as either tier 1\u2014currently the  highest-quality form of capital and includes common equity\u2014or tier 2,  which is weaker in absorbing losses. Different entities within a banking  organization may have different capital requirements. For example, a  subsidiary bank and a broker-dealer in the same corporate structure may  be required to hold different levels of capital, and those capital  requirements are established and supervised by different regulators."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Efforts to Enhance Bank Supervision and Stability of the Financial System", "paragraphs": ["In the 1980s, U.S. and international regulators recognized that common  borrowers and complex products and funding sources had made the world\u2019s  financial markets increasingly interconnected. Regulators also acknowledged  that bank regulatory capital standards generally were not sensitive to the risks  inherent in a bank\u2019s activities and that distressed or failing large, internationally  active banks posed a significant global risk to the financial system. These  concerns underscored the need for international regulatory coordination and  harmonization of capital standards. As a result, in 1988 the Basel Committee  on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) adopted a risk-based capital  framework known as the Basel Capital Accord (Basel I). Basel I aimed to  measure capital adequacy (that is, whether a bank\u2019s capital is sufficient to  support its activities) and establish minimum capital standards for  internationally active banks. It consisted of three basic elements: (1) a target  minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent and tier 1 risk-based capital  ratio of 4 percent, (2) a definition of capital instruments to constitute the  numerator of the capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio, and (3) a system of risk  weights for calculating the denominator of the ratio. While the framework was  designed to help improve the soundness and stability of the international  banking system, reduce some competitive inequalities among countries, and  allow national discretion in implementing the standards, it did not explicitly  address all types of risks that banks faced. Rather, it addressed credit risk,  which the Basel Committee viewed as the major risk banks faced at the time.  Over time it became apparent to bank regulators that Basel I was not providing  a sufficiently accurate measure of capital adequacy because of the lack of risk  sensitivity in its credit risk weightings, financial market innovations such as  securitization and credit derivatives, and advancements in banks\u2019 risk  measurement and risk management techniques. The accord was revised and  enhanced multiple times after 1988 because of its shortcomings. For example,  in 1996, Basel I was amended to take explicit account of market risk in trading  accounts. The market risk amendment allowed banks to use internal models  of risks to determine regulatory capital levels. Table 2 identifies some key  features of capital regime enhancements to the Basel accords.", "Basel II, adopted in June 2004, aims to better align minimum capital  requirements with enhanced risk measurement techniques and  encourage banks to develop a more disciplined approach to risk  management. It consists of three \u201cpillars\u201d: (1) minimum capital  requirements, (2) a supervisory review of an institution\u2019s internal  assessment process and capital adequacy, and (3) effective use of  disclosure to strengthen market discipline as a complement to  supervisory efforts. Basel II established several approaches (of increasing  complexity) to measuring credit and operational risks. The \u201cadvanced  approaches\u201d for credit risk and operational risk use parameters  determined by a bank\u2019s internal systems as inputs into a formula  supervisors developed for calculating minimum regulatory capital. In  addition, banks with significant trading assets, which banks use to hedge  risks or speculate on price changes in markets for themselves or their  customers, must calculate capital for market risk using internal models.  The advanced approaches allow some bank holding companies to reduce  capital from the levels required under Basel I. Large internationally active  U.S. holding companies are implementing the first qualification phase\u2014 known as the parallel run\u2014of the Basel II advanced approaches.  Although some of these large companies have begun to report Basel II  capital ratios to their bank regulators, they still are subject to Basel I  capital requirements, as are other U.S. banks. Financial institutions in  most other industrialized countries are subject to the Basel II capital  standards. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Basel II was  amended in 2009 by Basel II.5 to enhance the measurements of risks  related to securitization and trading book exposures.", "Also in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, in 2010, the Basel  Committee developed reforms, known as Basel III, which aim to improve  the banking sector\u2019s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and  economic stress, whatever the source; improve risk management and  governance; and strengthen banks\u2019 transparency and disclosures. The  reforms target (1) bank-level, or microprudential, regulation to enhance  the resilience of individual banking institutions to periods of stress and (2)  systemwide risks that can build up across the banking sector as well as  the amplification of these risks over time. These two approaches to  supervision are complementary, as greater resilience at the individual  bank level reduces the risk of systemwide shocks. Specifically, Basel III  significantly changes the risk-based capital standards for banks and bank  holding companies and introduces new leverage and liquidity  requirements. equity capital requirement of 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets (the  capital needed to be regarded as a viable concern); a new capital  conservation buffer of 2.5 percent to provide a cushion during financial  shocks to help companies remain above the 4.5 percent minimum; and  more stringent risk-weights on certain types of risky assets, particularly  securities and derivatives. Basel III also defines capital more narrowly  than the previous accords. The new common equity tier 1 capital  measure is limited mainly to common equity because common equity is  generally the most loss-absorbing instrument during a crisis.", "Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Bank and Banking  Systems, December 2010."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Regulation of Foreign-Owned Holding Companies Intended to Achieve Equivalency with Domestic Counterparts", "paragraphs": ["U.S regulation of foreign-owned intermediate holding companies is  intended to be equivalent to regulation of domestic counterparts to help  ensure that foreign bank operations have the opportunity to compete on a  level playing field in the U.S. market.

Prior to restructuring, the exempt  holding company had a bank subsidiary, a broker-dealer subsidiary, and  several other subsidiaries. The bank accounted for a small percentage of  the exempt holding company\u2019s consolidated assets and revenues, but the  holding company would be subject to the new capital requirement  because it was supervised as a bank holding company by the Federal  Reserve. After the restructuring, the small bank became a subsidiary of  one bank holding company, while the broker-dealer and the other  nonbank entities became subsidiaries of a different holding company that  is not a bank holding company and therefore not subject to bank holding  capital requirements. The foreign bank stated that restructuring would  better align both foreign parent bank and U.S. bank holding company with  new capital requirements.", "How the four foreign parent banks with exempt holding companies  choose to comply will vary. For example, officials from one exempt  holding company told us that the foreign parent bank might inject several  billions of dollars in common equity into the intermediate U.S. holding  company. Officials from a second exempt holding company told us they  were considering a combination of actions, including recapitalizing its  holding company by retaining earnings, reducing the risky assets against  which it must hold capital, and potentially restructuring the holding  company. Officials from another exempt holding company said that it  would review business activities under the holding company to reduce  risky assets that would require holding higher amounts of capital.

As of December 31, 2010, four exempt  holding companies relied on the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital exemption.  These exempt holding companies accounted for about 3.1 percent of the  loans on the balance sheets of all bank holding companies in the United  States (see table 3). Therefore, any actions they may take to respond to  the elimination of the capital exemption likely will have a small effect on  the overall credit market.", "Exempt holding companies accounted for varying amounts of different  types of loans. In 2010, they accounted for less than 5 percent each of  the construction and land loans, residential real estate loans, commercial  real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans, and  leases on the balance sheets of bank holding companies in the United  States. However, they accounted for more than 10 percent each of  agricultural real estate loans and agricultural production loans. Although  exempt holding companies and their foreign parent banks can take a  variety of approaches to comply with the new capital rules, the effects of  those approaches on credit markets\u2014overall or in specific segments\u2014 likely will be small because of the relatively small share of the market that  exempt holding companies hold.", "U.S. credit markets likely would remain unconcentrated even if exempt  holding companies exited the market and sold their loans to other bank  holding companies. To assess the impact of eliminating the Federal  Reserve\u2019s capital exemption on competition among bank holding  companies, we calculated the HHI, a key statistical indicator used to  assess the market concentration and the potential for firms to exercise  market power. As figure 2 shows, the HHI for the overall loan market for  2010 is well below 1,500\u2014the threshold for moderate concentration\u2014as  are the HHIs for the 13 specific loan markets we analyzed. Because  these loan markets appear to be unconcentrated, bank holding  companies in these markets likely have little ability to exercise market  power by raising prices, reducing the quantity of credit available,  diminishing innovation, or otherwise harming customers as a result of  diminished competitive constraints or incentives at least at the national  level. As we discuss later, to the extent that markets are segmented by  regions, or small businesses are limited in their ability to access credit,  these results may not hold for all customers.", "Faced with the elimination of the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital exemption  and new minimum capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act,  foreign banks with exempt holding companies could choose to divest their  banks and exit the U.S. banking market. To estimate the effect of this  particular response on loan market concentration, we estimated the  change in loan market concentration on loan markets in two alternative  scenarios in which all four of the exempt holding companies cease  making loans and sell their portfolios to other bank holding companies. In  the first scenario, the assets of exempt holding companies are acquired  by remaining bank holding companies in proportion to their market share.  In the second scenario, the assets of exempt holding companies are  acquired by the largest bank holding company remaining in the loan  market. Since not all exempt holding companies are likely to exit the U.S.  market, these scenarios provide estimates of the effect of the elimination  of the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital exemption on market concentration in the  most extreme cases.", "Estimated changes in the HHIs for the overall loan market in these  alternative scenarios indicate that the overall loan market is unlikely to  become concentrated even if all exempt holding companies exited the  U.S. market. As figure 2 shows, the overall loan market remains  unconcentrated in both scenarios, suggesting that the remaining bank  holding companies still would not have sufficient potential to use market  power to increase loan prices above competitive levels or reduce the  quantity of loans available to borrowers. Similar results were obtained  when we applied the alternative scenarios to various segments of the  credit market.", "The total capital that the four exempt holding companies would need to  raise to meet the same capital standards as their domestic counterparts is  small relative to the total capital in the U.S. banking sector, thus limiting  the effect on the cost and availability of credit. Of the four exempt holding  companies remaining at the end of 2010, three have indicated they might  undertake actions to comply with the minimum capital standards. As table  4 shows, to be considered as meeting the minimum capital requirements  under the Dodd-Frank Act, the three exempt holding companies  collectively would need $3.2 billion in additional capital, only $530 million  of which would need to be in the form of tier 1 common equity to meet the  leverage ratio requirement. This amount is less than 0.21 percent of the  approximate $1.5 trillion in total equity outstanding for the U.S. banking  sector. Two of the exempt holding companies have sufficient tier 1 capital  and would be able to meet the total capital requirement by raising  cheaper supplementary capital. If the exempt holding companies  decided to exceed the minimum requirements and meet the equivalent of  the well-capitalized requirements for banks and thrifts, the difference,  $6.6 billion, would be less than 0.44 percent of the total equity  outstanding. Although this is a sizable capital deficit at the individual  holding company level, it would represent a small shock to the aggregate  U.S. banking sector.", "The remaining exempt holding company (company 4, in table 4) would be  significantly below the new minimum capital requirements, with a capital  shortfall of over $21.5 billion. However, domestic loans make up 11  percent of its total assets, while its broker-dealer operations are much  larger. Therefore, maintaining a holding company designation, which  creates a significant capital requirement on its entire asset pool, appears  unlikely. As discussed earlier, the company has stated that it has been  considering a variety of options, including restructuring.

We evaluated the impact of the new  requirements using two scenarios\u2014exempt holding companies  experienced a capital deficit when compared with the (1) minimum capital  requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act or (2) the well-capitalized  standard that applies to banks and thrifts. Specifically, our model  suggests the elimination of the capital exemption would lead aggregate  loan volumes to decline by roughly 0.2 percent even if the affected  exempt holding companies desired to meet the equivalent of the well- capitalized standard (see table 5). If the affected banks desired to meet  the minimum capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, loan  volumes would decline by less than 0.1 percent. Because the exempt  holding companies would face capital deficits, the impact on the affected  banks could be significant and would vary with the degree of  undercapitalization. For example, loan growth would decline by 5.0  percentage points at company 1, 6.6 percentage points at company 2,  and 7.9 percentage points at company 3 if the targeted total capital ratio  was 10 percent under the well-capitalized standard, and total loan  volumes would fall by $14.2 billion, or 0.2 percent of total loans for the  banking sector. If the affected banks\u2019 targeted total capital ratio was 8  percent (that is, the minimum capital requirement), our model suggests  total loan growth at the three banks would decline by $6.8 billion, or 0.09   However, these estimates  percent of total loans for the banking sector.may overstate the impact on aggregate loan volumes because we  assume no transition period for adjusting to the higher capital  requirements and that other banks do not immediately replace the decline  in loan volumes at the affected institutions.", "Because the capital exemption affects only a few institutions operating in  highly competitive loan markets, the impact on the cost of credit, although  uncertain, is likely to be small. Our model suggests that a capital shock  equivalent to that implied by the elimination of the capital exemption  (small at the aggregate level) would lead to an industrywide increase in  lending spreads of a little over 1 basis point (0.01 percentage points). If the exempt companies were measured against the minimum capital  requirements, the impact on lending spreads would be less than 1 basis  point. However, because the elimination would not result in a general  shock across all banks, whether any impact on lending rates would be felt  at the aggregate level is unclear. The competitive nature of loan markets  makes passing on the higher cost of holding more capital to borrowers in  the form of higher loan rates difficult for a bank experiencing a firm- specific capital shock. Because the loan markets are not highly  concentrated and are competitive (as discussed earlier), the affected  exempt holding companies likely would lose business to other banks if  they chose to increase loan rates significantly. Some studies have found  evidence of a relationship between higher capital holdings and market  share during and following banking crises. To avoid losing business to  well-capitalized institutions, the affected holding companies likely would  reduce the amount of risky assets to some extent or undertake other  actions rather than attempting to pass the full cost of holding additional  capital to select customers. Appendix II contains more information on our  analysis of these types of scenarios.", "In general, our results for loan volumes and cost and availability of credit  should be interpreted with caution because of the methodological and  other limitations associated with our approach. For example, our  estimates have wide confidence intervals suggesting considerable  uncertainty in the results (see app. I for limitations). As such, considering  our results in the context of a wider body of empirical literature is useful.  Table 5 also includes the average impact on loan volumes and lending  rates based on other studies combined with our calculation of the capital  deficit stemming from the elimination of the capital exemption. The results from our model, although larger for both loan growth and lending  spreads, are consistent with the average we calculated from a number of  empirical studies examining the relationship between bank capital and  lending activity. These studies represent a variety of methodologies, each  with its own limitations. Nevertheless, even the largest estimate we  identified in the literature still would imply a relatively small impact of the  exemption on credit markets.", "Particular segments of the market may be affected more than others. For  example, customers in agricultural real estate and agricultural production  loan markets may experience impacts larger than those suggested by the  aggregate analysis. Similarly, two of the exempt holding companies have  a significant presence in the western states, while another has a  significant presence on the East Coast. While the impact on the price and  quantity of credit available may vary across regions, modeling limitations  restrict our ability to estimate potential regional differences. Such regional  impacts should be mitigated to a significant extent by the national nature  of many loan markets. This analysis becomes much more complicated  and uncertain once consideration is given to the impact of the various  provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, which may result in a  large number of institutions looking to replace and raise capital if banks  seek to exceed the new regulatory minimums by the same margin they  exceed them now.

Other, foreign  regulators also stated that international differences in the calculation of  risk-weighted assets could result from assigning inconsistent risk weights  on the same types of assets and could undermine Basel III. Some foreign  banks we interviewed told us that comparing risk-weighted assets across  banks was challenging because of differing reporting, legal, and  accounting frameworks. For example, comparisons of institutions from the  United States with those from the European Union are difficult because  U.S. banks still are transitioning from Basel I to Basel II and do not  publicly report Basel II risk-based capital requirements.

For example, a U.S. bank operating in multiple countries would be  subject to the cumulative effect of each country\u2019s additional requirements  in times of excess aggregate credit growth, and U.S. banking regulators  would have no say over these declarations.", "The Basel Committee has expressed concern that the financial regulatory framework did  not provide adequate incentives for firms to mitigate their procyclical use of leverage  (debt). That is, firms tended to increase leverage in strong markets and decrease it when  market conditions deteriorated, amplifying business cycle fluctuations and exacerbating  financial instability. According to regulators, many financial institutions did not increase  regulatory capital and other loss-absorbing buffers during the market upswing, when it  would have been easier and less costly to do so. The Basel III countercyclical buffers are  intended to help address concerns about procyclicality.", "However, other factors may help ease concerns about inconsistent  implementation of financial regulations. U.S. regulatory officials have  observed that a high level of coordination among international regulators  would help ensure that banks hold significantly more capital, that the  capital will truly be able to absorb losses of a magnitude associated with  the crisis without recourse to taxpayer support, and that the level and  definition of capital will be uniform across borders. In addition, the  quantity and quality of capital held by the largest internationally active  U.S. and foreign banks has increased significantly in the past few years.  Specifically, among the 50 largest global banks, tier 1 capital adequacy  ratios have climbed from 8.1 percent in 2007 to 11.3 percent at the end of  2010. Since the end of 2008, the 19 largest bank holding companies in  the United States that were subjected to stress tests increased common  equity by more than $300 billion.

According to U.S. and foreign bank officials, inconsistent  capital requirements among multiple regulatory regimes may restrict  banks\u2019 ability to move capital across jurisdictions. For example, according  to regulators and U.S. banks we interviewed, since the 2007-2009  financial crisis, foreign regulators have become more sensitive to how  much capital foreign entities in their jurisdiction hold. Some foreign bank  regulators have required banks to \u201cring fence\u201d capital on the balance  sheet as a way to protect and hold dedicated capital for that bank  subsidiary in their legal jurisdiction in case of financial difficulties or  bankruptcy. Foreign bank regulators were concerned that the parent  company would reallocate capital in their jurisdiction to fund the parent  company located outside of their jurisdiction, potentially resulting in the  subsidiary being undercapitalized. According to some banks we  interviewed ring fencing would be costly for banks operating abroad as it  restricts capital and requires systems for keeping operations segregated  across countries.", "In another example, U.S. bank officials noted that recent reforms have  changed what types of capital instruments can be counted as tier 1  capital. As a result, U.S. banks may not have access to tax-efficient tier 1  instruments that foreign bank competitors can issue because of  differences in national tax policies. Specifically, prior to the recent  changes under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, U.S. bank holding  companies could issue tier 1 trust-preferred securities with dividend  payments that were tax-deductible. With the exclusion of trust-preferred  securities from tier 1, large internationally active banks likely will not have  any tax-efficient alternative in the United States, while foreign banks in  certain jurisdictions will continue to have access to certain capital  instruments, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred shares, that  confer some tax benefits because of local tax laws.", "As major regulatory changes stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel  III, and country-specific reforms are finalized and implemented, many  U.S. and foreign bank officials we interviewed expressed concerns about  the added costs of compliance with multiple regulatory regimes.

A group\u2019s market share is  the total dollar value of loans on the balance sheets of all bank holding  companies in the group as a percentage of the total dollar value of loans  on the balance sheets of all bank holding companies in the market.", "To assess the extent to which the price of credit and the quantity of credit  available are likely to be affected because of the removal of the capital  exemption, we used the used the HHI to measure market concentration.  The HHI is a key statistical indicator used to assess the market  concentration and the potential for firms to exercise market power. The  HHI reflects the number of firms in the market and each firm\u2019s market  share, and it is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares  of each firm in the market. For example, a market consisting of four firms  with market shares of 30 percent, 30 percent, 20 percent, and 20 percent  has an HHI of 2,600 (900 + 900 + 400 + 400 = 2,600). The HHI ranges  from 10,000 (if there is a single firm in the market) to a number  approaching 0 (in the case of a perfectly competitive market). That is,  higher values of the HHI indicate a more concentrated market.  Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission guidelines as of  August 19, 2010, suggest that an HHI between 0 and 1,500 indicates that  a market is not concentrated, an HHI between 1,500 and 2,500 indicates  that a market is moderately concentrated, and an HHI greater than 2,500  indicates that a market is highly concentrated, although other factors also  play a role in determining market concentration.", "We calculated the HHI for 2010 for each of the loan markets listed above.  Each bank holding company is a separate firm in the market, and its  market share is equal to the dollar value of loans on its balance sheet as  a percentage of the total dollar value of loans on the balance sheets of all  the bank holding companies in the market.", "We also calculated the HHI for 2010 for each loan market in alternative  scenarios in which exempt holding companies cease making loans and  transfer the loans on their balance sheets to bank holding companies that  remain in the market. In the first scenario, exempt foreign-owned  intermediate holding companies\u2019 loans are distributed proportionally  among remaining bank holding companies. In the second scenario,  exempt foreign-owned intermediate holding companies\u2019 loans are  acquired by the largest remaining bank holding company in the market.", "A limitation of defining the market as the collection of top-tier bank holding  companies that filed FR Y-9Cs with the Federal Reserve is that we  exclude organizations that provide credit. For example, small bank  holding companies\u2014those with consolidated assets of less than $500  million\u2014generally are not required to file form FR Y-9C. However, they do  make loans. Other credit market participants include savings and loan  holding companies, stand alone banks, savings and loan associations,  credit unions, and finance companies not owned by bank holding  companies. Capital markets are another source of funds for some  borrowers. As a result, our estimates of market shares are likely  overstated. Furthermore, our estimates of market concentration may be  either understated or overstated, depending on the number and market  shares of other credit providers.", "Another limitation of our analysis is that we implicitly assume that all loan  markets are national in scope; that is, that credit provided by a bank  holding company is available to any potential borrower, regardless of his  or her respective geographic location. If loan markets are not national in  scope, then our market share and market concentration estimates are  unlikely to represent those that we would estimate for a specific  subnational region, such as a state or metropolitan area. The market  share and market concentration estimates for some regions likely would  be greater than our national estimates, while others likely would be lower.", "For this analysis, we relied on the Federal Reserve\u2019s FY-9C data that we  obtained through SNL Financial and on information from the Federal  Reserve on foreign banking organizations\u2019 top-tier intermediate holding  companies in the United States. We conducted reliability assessment on  these data by reviewing factors such as timeliness, accuracy, and  completeness. We also conducted electronic testing to identify missing and  out-of-range data. Where applicable, we contacted officials from the Federal  Reserve to address questions about the reliability of the information. We  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To estimate the effect of capital ratios on the cost and availability of  credit, we estimated a modified version of a vector autoregression (VAR)  model commonly used in the macroeconomics and monetary literature.  Our model closely follows Berrospide and Edge (2010) and Lown and  Morgan (2006). The VAR consists of eight variables. The core variables  that represent the macroeconomy are (1) real gross domestic product  (GDP) growth, (2) GDP price inflation, (3) federal funds rate, and (4)  commodity price index growth. As is pointed out in Lown and Morgan  (2006), these four variables potentially make up a complete economy,  with output, price, demand, and supply all represented. We capture the  banking sector with four variables: (1) loan volume growth, (2) changes in  lending spreads\u2014commercial and industrial loan rates relative to a  benchmark, (3) lending standards as measured by the net fraction of loan  officers at commercial banks reporting a tightening of credit standards for  commercial and industrial loans in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Senior Loan  Officer Opinion Survey, and (4) the aggregate capital-to-assets ratio for  the commercial bank sector. The addition of the latter four variables  allows us to investigate the dynamic interaction between banks and the  macroeconomy. The data were assembled from Thomson-Reuters  Datastream and the Federal Reserve. We have relied on these data in  our past reports and consider them to be reliable for our purposes here.", "Using the estimated VAR system for the third quarter of 1990 to the  second quarter of 2010, we trace the dynamic responses of loan  volumes, lending spreads, and other macroeconomic variables to shocks  to the bank capital ratio. As a result, we can obtain quantitative estimates  of how bank \u201cinnovations\u201d or \u201cshocks\u201d affect the cost and availability of  credit. Our base results rely on impulse response functions using the  following causal ordering of the variables: GDP, inflation, federal funds  rate, commodity spot prices, loan volumes, capital ratio, loan spreads,  and lending standards. However, our final estimates use the average of  the outcomes for the two different orderings of the variables: (1) where  the macro variables are given causal priority and (2) where the bank  variables are given causal priority. The VAR model, and the innovation  accounting framework, is laid out in greater detail in another GAO report.", "The VAR methodology, while containing some advantages over other  modeling techniques, has particular limitations, and therefore the results  should be interpreted with caution. First, the methodology potentially  overstates the quantitative effects of shocks on the economy and can be  difficult to interpret. Second, because the technique relies on past data, it  is subject to the criticism that past information may not be useful for  gauging future response due to policy changes. Third, to conduct  meaningful assessments of the impacts of shocks to the system, causal  priority is given to some variables over others. However, our results are  not particularly sensitive to this ordering, although we do obtain smaller  impacts of bank capital on lending activity with some alternative  orderings. To minimize this limitation, our estimates are an average of a  model where causal priority is given to the macroeconomic variables and  a model where causal priority is given to the bank variables. Last, in our  particular case the impulse response functions have wide confidence  intervals, suggesting considerable uncertainty in the results. Despite  these limitations, the VAR approach is considered to be a reasonable  alternative to other types of models. However, it is prudent to evaluate our  results in the context of the wider body of research on the effects of bank  capital on lending activity.", "The studies we relied on for comparison are useful in that they represent  a variety of different modeling techniques ranging from VAR and cross- sectional regression methodologies to more sophisticated dynamic  stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) modeling. None of these  approaches are without limitations. For example DSGE models, although  among the best for conducting counterfactual experiments and easy to  interpret, are difficult to estimate and the techniques used to facilitate  estimation can result in questionable results that are at odds with  empirical observations. Nevertheless, by considering the body of  evidence from different studies, we are able to provide some assessment  of the reliability of our findings. However, the studies discussed in the  report are included solely for research purposes and our reference to  them does not imply we find them definitive.", "To describe U.S. banks operating abroad and their services, major  customers, and competitors, we used information obtained from interviews  with some of the largest internationally active U.S. banks. We also  analyzed audited financial statements in the annual reports for relevant  companies. We selected the six largest internationally active U.S. banks  based on their level of foreign business activity. To identify banks\u2019 views  on the potential risks from changes in capital requirements on U.S. banks  operating abroad, we interviewed officials from the three U.S. bank holding  companies that engaged in significant international operations. We also  interviewed officials from the European Commission\u2014a European Union  entity that, among other things, through capital directives sets out general  capital rules to be transferred into national law by each of the 27 European  Union countries as they deem appropriate. We summarized relevant  academic literature and regulatory studies and congressional testimonies  on the potential effects on U.S. banks\u2019 funding costs, product pricing, and  lending activity abroad. We also obtained the views of federal banking  officials from the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, and OTS, and officials from  the Department of the Treasury.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2010 to January  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Impact of Reducing the Risk-Weighted Assets of Exempt Holding Companies to Comply with New Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Bank holding companies can take different approaches to comply with the  new capital requirement in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act. From 2001 to 2010, the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System granted capital requirement exemptions to  six foreign-owned intermediate holding companies provided that the  companies satisfied certain conditions, including having well-capitalized  foreign parent banks. As of the end of 2010, four foreign-owned  intermediate holding companies continued to rely on a capital exemption  from the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated this  exemption, and these exempt holding companies must now meet new  capital requirements. Some of these exempt holding companies may  choose to raise capital, while others may choose to deleverage by  decreasing the risk-weighted assets on their balance sheets (or a  combination thereof). Although predicting the responses of the exempt  holding companies to the higher U.S. bank capital requirements is a  complex proposition, this appendix illustrates the potential effect on the  availability of credit if the three exempt holding companies respond by  reducing their balance sheets.", "If the exempt holding companies chose to reduce their balance sheets to  meet new capital regulations, we estimate that the decrease would be  small relative to the aggregate assets for the U.S. banking sector. As  table 6 illustrates, the three exempt holding companies would need to  decrease their risk-weighted assets by amounts ranging from $12.2 billion  to as much as $15.3 billion to meet the minimum capital requirements  under the Dodd-Frank Act.at the individual holding company level, it is small as a percentage of the  total risk-weighted assets of the U.S. banking sector (see table 6). For  example, although the exempt holding companies would have to reduce  their balance sheets by 20 percent on average, the total decline in assets  amounts to 0.44 percent of the $9.1 trillion in total risk-weighted assets for  the aggregate U.S. banking sector. To meet the equivalent of the well- capitalized standards that apply to banks and thrifts, the exempt holding  companies would need to reduce their risk-weighted assets by $65.8  billion, or roughly 0.7 percent of the total risk-weighted assets for the  aggregate U.S. banking sector. This would require two of the exempt  holding companies to decrease risk-weighted assets by roughly 38  percent and 34 percent, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact listed above, Daniel Garcia-Diaz (Acting  Director), Rachel DeMarcus, M\u2019Baye Diagne, Lawrance Evans Jr., Colin  Gray, Joe Hunter, Elizabeth Jimenez, Courtney LaFountain, Akiko  Ohnuma, Marc Molino, Timothy Mooney, Patricia Moye, Michael Pahr,  and Barbara Roesmann made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
