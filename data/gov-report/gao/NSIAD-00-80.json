However, because of public concern about the  potential effects of these methods of disposal on public health and the  environment, they were discontinued during the 1970s. In 1985, the  Congress required the Department of Defense (DOD) to carry out the  destruction of the U.S. stockpile of chemical agents and munitions and  establish an organization within the Army to be responsible for the disposal  program. Over time, the Congress also directed DOD to dispose of  chemical warfare materiel not included in the stockpile and to research and  develop technological alternatives for disposing of chemical agents and  munitions. In April 1997, the U.S. Senate ratified the U.N.-sponsored  Chemical Weapons Convention, effectively agreeing to dispose of the  chemical stockpile weapons and chemical warfare materiel by April 29,  2007.

DOD and Army officials were assessing  these three conditions and identifying the criteria for making the  certification. At the same time, the Congress directed that DOD make  available, and DOD actually committed, funds in fiscal year 2000 to award  contracts to evaluate and demonstrate three additional technologies for the  Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment Program.

According to the Army\u2019s 1998 annual  report on the program, to meet the destruction schedule required by the  convention, authority to proceed with the baseline incineration process in  Colorado and Kentucky was required before June 30, 1999. Even so, DOD  and Army officials were discussing whether to grant such authority for  both Colorado and Kentucky. These officials were preparing two notices of  intent announcing the preparation of separate environmental impact  statements for the disposal of the stockpile in Colorado. One  environmental impact statement will focus on whether to pilot test  alternative technologies in Colorado or at two other sites. The other  environmental impact statement is to be specific to Colorado and will focus  on which disposal method\u2014the baseline incineration process, a modified  incineration process, or an alternative technology\u2014should be used in  Colorado.

No systematic  approach exists across all program elements to help ensure the consistent,  effective execution and expenditure of funds appropriated for the program,  and a relatively small amount of unliquidated obligations remain  unexplained. Some unliquidated obligations exist because of the lack of  management attention and decentralized structure for tracking  liquidations. Other unliquidated obligations exist because of procedural  delays in reporting financial transactions in the defense financial system, in  auditing and liquidating obligated balances on completed contracts, and in  deobligating excess funds, and delays in executing the program schedule.  Several recent factors, including the recently approved environmental  permits and congressional actions to reduce funding for the program, have  decreased and will likely reduce the future buildup of unliquidated  obligations. However, because the improvements in its financial  management have not been consistently and systematically implemented,  the Army cannot ensure that its unliquidated obligations will receive  consistent attention to bring about a better alignment of funds with the  execution of the program on an ongoing basis.

For example, the  Congress wanted greater emphasis on the management of efforts to  research and develop alternative technologies for destroying assembled  chemical weapons. To achieve that goal, it directed that these research and  development efforts be conducted separately from the baseline  incineration activities. DOD, as part of its downsizing theOffice of the  Secretary of Defense, devolved management responsibilities to the Army.  In addition, to improve the management of the Chemical Stockpile  Emergency Preparedness Project, the Army and FEMA changed the  management structure for the project.", "The current organization has created a complex management structure and  separated responsibilities.

In response  to the act, DOD established the office of the Program Manager for  Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment, independent of the Program  Manager for Chemical Demilitarization, to implement the pilot program.  The purpose of this legislation was to separate this pilot program from  the baseline incineration activities. Achievement of that goal also meant  that two program offices would share responsibilities associated with  disposal activities in Kentucky and Colorado. As discussed later,  ineffective coordination between these offices has hindered the  program management.", "A 1998 Defense Reform Initiative downsized the Office of the Secretary  of Defense and resulted in the devolvement of the DOD office  overseeing the Chemical Demilitarization Program from DOD to the  Army. Consequently, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the  Army (Chemical Demilitarization) was formed in February 1998 from a  consolidation of the existing DOD oversight office and the Army staff  office that assisted the Army Assistant Secretary in performing his  chemical weapons demilitarization functions. While this devolvement  resulted in a consolidation of staff offices in the Army Secretariat, it still  did not clear up the existing ambiguity in responsibilities, lines of  authority, and accountability. For example, the responsibility of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Chemical Demilitarization) is  limited to oversight of the stockpile, nonstockpile, and alternative  technologies and approaches projects. While this office reports directly  to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and  Technology), it has no direct management control of the Program  Manager for Chemical Demilitarization, who also reports directly to the  Assistant Secretary. During our review, we received conflicting  descriptions and inconsistent organizational charts concerning the  relationship and responsibilities of the offices of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Army (Chemical Demilitarization) and the Program  Manager for Chemical Demilitarization. This indicates some amount of  confusion among those involved in the program regarding who is  accountable. DOD, as part of the devolvement, planned to consolidate within the  Army Secretariat management responsibility for the Assembled  Chemical Weapons Assessment Program. For example, as noted in the  transition plan for the reform initiative, program oversight for the  Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment Program was to be  delegated to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics  and Technology) and the Program Manager for Assembled Chemical  Weapons Assessment was to report directly to the Assistant Secretary.  The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) was to  evaluate and certify the effectiveness of the alternative technologies as  required by legislation. However, in the Conference Report  accompanying the 1999 Defense Authorization Act, the conferees  agreed that the Program Manager for Assembled Chemical Weapons  Assessment should continue to report directly to the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition and Technology) rather than the Assistant  Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).", "In 1997, the Secretary of the Army and the Director of FEMA entered  into a memorandum of agreement that revised the management  structure of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Project in  an effort to streamline and improve the management of the program.
