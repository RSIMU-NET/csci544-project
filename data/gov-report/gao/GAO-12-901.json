Not all of the agencies with which GAO spoke used all of the practices, and the application of the practices varied among agencies. For example, to collect information about an incident\u0097the first step of the process\u0097the Bureau of Diplomatic Security within the Department of State collects incident reports, footage from security cameras, and interviews witnesses. To disseminate lessons learned\u0097the fifth step\u0097the Los Angeles Police Department produces a formal document after a critical incident that captures the lessons learned and disseminates the document to its units for use in planning, preparation, and coordination exercises.", "The Interagency Security Committee (ISC), which is led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), currently does not have a systematic, comprehensive lessons-learned process for physical security, but the ISC does have a number of current initiatives that could support a more comprehensive lessons-learned effort. For example, ISC collects and analyzes information to update its physical security standards, captures and disseminates best practices to its members through its quarterly meetings, and archives information in the Homeland Security Information Network. ISC has initiated a working group to explore the idea of creating a systematic, governmentwide lessons-learned process. But the working group is at an early stage, and it is not clear if the new effort will include all of the lessons-learned practices that GAO identified. Not incorporating all eight practices could result in a less effective effort and fail to maximize the value of the lessons learned to ISC\u0092s membership. ISC derives its authority from an executive order. However, it depends on its member agencies to take the initiative to share information and it is unclear that ISC\u0092s current authority over its members is sufficient to implement a governmentwide lessons-learned process, which will rely on members to openly share information\u0097including mistakes.", "Law enforcement officials cited various challenges to establishing a governmentwide lessons-learned process, including the need to create a culture that encourages information sharing, address the concerns about safeguarding sensitive security information, disseminate information in a timely manner, and overcome resource constraints.

Our review examined:  1.  if practices used to identify and apply lessons learned are applicable  to the physical security of nonmilitary federal facilities and how, if at  all, selected agencies have used such practices;  2.  the actions that ISC has taken to identify and apply lessons learned  from attacks on federal facilities since 2002; and  3.  what challenges law enforcement agencies cite to developing a  systematic, governmentwide process for identifying and applying  lessons learned for real property security and what strategies  agencies have used to mitigate those challenges internally.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed documents and interviewed  officials from 35 federal, local, and international agencies, including ISC.  We selected the agencies based on advice from law enforcement officials  and on the types of attacks experienced by the agencies. The 35  agencies included 29 law enforcement, security, or safety-related  agencies (9 federal, 8 local, and 12 foreign); 4 federal agencies with  responsibilities for developing physical security standards and guidelines;  and 2 federal agencies that were specifically established to develop and  employ lessons-learned practices. We conducted site visits in  Washington, D.C.; New York, New York; Rome, Italy; Vatican City;  Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece; and Jerusalem, Israel. At these site  visits, we toured facilities and met with various security and law  enforcement officials. In addition, we interviewed security and law  enforcement officials by telephone in Las Vegas, Nevada; Los Angeles,  California; and St. Louis, Missouri. For our site visits and telephone  interviews, we selected locations known for drawing large groups of  tourists, whether to government facilities and public spaces or to private  attractions. The information obtained during the site visits and telephone  interviews is not generalizable and cannot be used to represent the  opinions of all law enforcement and security officials. We use the  information from these site visits and interviews to provide illustrative  examples throughout our report. We also met with officials from  organizations experienced in applying lessons-learned practices,  including officials at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the  U.S. Army\u2019s Center for Army Lessons Learned, and the Department of  State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

ISC is housed  within DHS\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection and has a staff of six full- time employees. The office\u2019s budget is not a dedicated line item in DHS\u2019s  budget but, rather, is subsumed within the budget of the Office of  Infrastructure Protection. ISC conducts much of its business through  subcommittees and working groups populated by volunteers from the  various member agencies.

We took  the information from these two process descriptions, combined it with  information from our reviews of lessons-learned literature and early  interviews with agencies, and identified eight individual practices for  identifying and applying lessons learned. We combined and ordered  these practices to develop an overall, eight-step, lessons-learned  process\u2014that is, a systematic means for agencies to learn from an event  and make decisions about when and how to use that knowledge to  change behavior. Our lessons-learned process is shown in figure 1. We  then discussed with the agencies we interviewed which practices they  used in their lessons-learned efforts and how they used them.

Of the 29 federal, local, and  international law enforcement, security, and safety-related agencies we  reviewed, we found that only one\u2014the State Department\u2019s Bureau of  Diplomatic Security\u2014had in place a formal physical security lessons- learned effort , called \u201cKnowledge from the Field.\u201d Knowledge from the  Field analyzes information from attacks on U.S. consulates, embassies,  and personnel around the world, and then produces and distributes  videos explaining the lessons learned from those attacks to the regional  security officers of all the U.S. embassies and consulates. The other  agencies did not have such formal lessons-learned efforts, but did  conduct some of the practices related to the lesson-learned process. We  thus found numerous examples of how the lessons-learned practices are  currently being applied by law enforcement and security agencies\u2014which  we discuss below\u2014that support the conclusion that the lessons-learned  process as a whole is applicable to the issue of the physical security of  nonmilitary federal facilities.", "The practice of information collection involves capturing data through  such activities as accident or incident reporting, project critiques, written  forms, interviews of witnesses and participants, and direct observation.  Information collected can be related to positive experiences that  prevented accidents or saved money, or to negative experiences that  resulted in undesirable outcomes. Examples of agencies collecting  information as a step toward deriving lessons from incidents include the  following:  In the Knowledge from the Field initiative, the Bureau of Diplomatic  Security collects incident reports submitted by regional security  officers and footage from security cameras, and also interviews  witnesses directly.", "Within a week of a 2010 fatal shooting at a factory, the St. Louis  Metropolitan Police Department convened a meeting of the personnel  involved in responding to the shooting to collect information from  various perspectives about how the response had been handled.", "The next step in the process is to analyze the information collected to  determine root causes and identify appropriate actions. Examples of  agencies using information analysis as a step toward deriving lessons  from incidents include the following:", "Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officials said that they will  analyze the motives of attackers and the resulting after-action reports  from a tactical operations point of view. Based on these analyses,  they will adjust training and protocols.", "The Israeli National Police analyzed surveillance tape of a 2007  incident in Jerusalem involving a criminal attack on a police officer.  They concluded that the officer did not show good awareness of his  surroundings and that his partner was not in position to provide  backup. As a result of this analysis, Israeli officials said that training  was used to reinforce how officers should maintain their positions and  awareness of their environments.", "Law enforcement officials in Rome conducted an after-action analysis  of a 2010 riot that suggested the overwhelming presence of riot police  in full protective gear may have appeared aggressive and provoked  the demonstrators into violence. Since the riot, the Rome law  enforcement officials have staged riot police away from the public  buildings and spaces where the protests are held and the protest we  observed remained peaceful.", "Although not a security agency, NTSB investigators analyze such  information as aircraft wreckage, crew performance, weather data,  and other pertinent information to determine the probable cause of an  accident and needed corrective actions.", "Once the analysis has identified the lessons, the next practice that some  agencies engaged in was to validate that the right lessons had been  identified and to determine the breadth of their applicability. Subject  matter experts or other stakeholders may be involved in this step of the  process. Examples of agencies using validation as a step for deriving  lessons from incidents include the following:", "The U.S. Marshals convened a group of officials from related law  enforcement agencies to study and validate the lessons from the  January 2010 fatal shooting at the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse  in Las Vegas, Nevada, and to determine the extent to which the  lessons might apply more broadly to physical security in the U.S.  courts and other agencies.", "NTSB uses the \u201cparty system\u201d of designating other involved  organizations or companies as participants in its investigations to  ensure that all of the necessary subject experts are involved to help  validate the extent that the investigation\u2019s findings apply to a broader  population. For example, an aircraft manufacturer can, as a party to  the investigation, validate the extent to which a design flaw may apply  beyond a specific aircraft under investigation.", "The storage of lessons usually involves entering lessons into an  electronic database to disseminate and share information. As appropriate,  repositories should have the capability to store data and to guard  classified, sensitive, or proprietary data. The Center for Army Lessons  Learned handbook indicates that the archival process should remain an  ongoing process or risk becoming cumbersome and irrelevant.of agencies storing and archiving lessons learned include the following:", "Federal and local law enforcement agencies we interviewed stated  that they use a variety of online databases and networks for storing  and sharing their experiences, including DHS\u2019s Homeland Security  Information Network (HSIN) and Technical Resource for Incident  Prevention (\u201cTRIPwire\u201d), FBI\u2019s Law Enforcement Online, FEMA\u2019s  Lessons Learned Information System, and the Department of  Justice\u2019s Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative.", "NTSB archives its safety recommendations in a publicly available  database, including details of the implementation status of each  recommendation it has made.", "A critical step in any lessons-learned process is the sharing and  disseminating of the knowledge gained. Agencies can disseminate  lessons through many venues, such as briefings, bulletins, reports,  emails, websites, database entries, the revision of work processes or  procedures, and training. Lessons can be \u201cpushed,\u201d or automatically  delivered to a user, or \u201cpulled,\u201d where a user searches for them. Lessons  can also be disseminated with an assigned priority descriptor, which  denotes the risk, immediacy, and urgency of the lessons-learned content.  Examples of agencies using the dissemination and sharing practice  include the following:", "As mentioned, Knowledge from the Field disseminates lessons by  sending videos to all regional security officers. The videos summarize  attacks and lessons learned using actual video, on-site reenactments,  and interviews with witnesses.", "The Israeli Security Agency conducts debriefings with domestic  security personnel across the government after incidents and relays  the results of those debriefings to all overseas embassies and  consulates.", "The Los Angeles Police Department produces a formal document  after a critical incident that captures lessons learned and best  practices that the department would like to sustain or improve. The  department disseminates this document to its units for use in  planning, preparing, and coordinating exercises.", "As part of the lessons-learned process, management must decide  whether to invest resources to apply particular lessons. Under a benefit- cost analysis, some recommendations coming out of the lessons-learned  process may simply be too costly to implement. Or it may be that the  lesson learned was very specific to the particular circumstances of the  incident and does not have wide applicability or a likelihood of future  incidence. Examples of this step of a lessons-learned process include the  following:", "Bureau of Diplomatic Services officials said that senior management  is often engaged to determine where resources should be directed, in  addition to considering the relevance of long-term training changes.", "For example, the officials consider whether the circumstances around  an incident are applicable not only today, but likely in the future as  well.", "According to District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department  officials, after deriving lessons from incidents, management decides if,  and the extent to which, changes in policy or procedures are needed.  For example, the Police Department can implement lessons through  general orders that support a change in policy or through changes in  training that all units must apply to their operations.", "The seventh practice that agencies used will not necessarily be a step  resulting from every lesson identified. As was shown in figure 1, this step  is dependent on the prior step concerning management decisions about  whether to take corrective action. If a decision is made to take action,  then some agencies undertook subsequent action to observe that the  change in behavior actually did occur and verify that the change had the  desired effect. Observing changes in behavior after applying lessons  requires additional information to validate the change resulted from the  lesson. The following examples illustrate how law enforcement agencies  use lessons to change the way they approach security incidents.", "To evaluate how lessons learned are applied, the Israeli Security  Agency conducts drills to determine which changes work and which  do not, communicate that information to its offices, and make  necessary adjustments to physical security standards or procedures.", "The Greek police have learned from observing past demonstrations  that it is important to provide an open route for people who want to  leave. This has allowed demonstrators to more quickly and easily  disperse.", "As was shown in figure 1, the practice evaluating effectiveness is an  ongoing part of the lessons-learned process. It involves assessing or  measuring the performance of all steps in the process to seek continual  improvement of the process as a whole. Overall, evaluating the  effectiveness of a lessons-learned process involves weighing the use of  resources against the desired results. Examples of agencies that  evaluated the effectiveness of their physical security efforts include the  following:  Israel installed a system of 320 networked cameras to monitor activity  in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. The Israeli Police Department evaluated the  effectiveness of the cameras through changes in the crime rate in the  Old City, which dropped by 80 percent after the cameras were  installed, according to Israeli authorities.", "The Bureau of Diplomatic Services is currently responding to  recommendations we made in our June 2011 reportperformance of its Knowledge from the Field effort, according to  Bureau officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ISC Employs Some Practices and Is Beginning to Develop a Lessons-Learned Process", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ISC Uses Some Lessons- Learned Practices", "paragraphs": ["ISC currently does not have a systematic, comprehensive lessons- learned process for physical security.

In recent years, ISC  officials said that ISC has produced several guidelines for its  members in an effort to capture and disseminate best practices on  various topics that include physical security. For example, ISC  produced a best practices guide for agencies to understand and  mitigate risks posed by package bombs and other mail-based threats.", "Quarterly Meetings and Classified Briefings . ISC provides forums for  its members to collect and disseminate physical security information  and best practices through its quarterly meetings and annual  classified briefings. ISC officials stated that regular contact with  member agencies has promoted interagency coordination. During  these meetings, participants often share physical security best  practices and discuss emerging technologies. For example, at a  recent briefing that we attended, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security  provided physical security lessons learned from major incidents and  threats occurring overseas.", "Homeland Security Information Network. ISC uses the Homeland  Security Information Network (HSIN)information. ISC has directed agencies to use HSIN to identify and  share information, including physical security lessons. In general,  federal officials said that HSIN was helpful in providing lessons  learned from past incidents and other information. For example, one  agency official stated that when an incident occurs, HSIN is used to  identify after-action reports of the incident and any available physical  security lessons learned.", "Although these efforts by ISC relate to lessons learned, they are  fragmented and uncoordinated.

ISC supports this effort because lessons from specific events or  projects are not being shared to the fullest extent possible among the  membership. In implementing a structured lessons-learned process,  agency officials believe that the information collected would provide  physical security information to federal facilities that would assist them in  protecting against, responding to, and recovering from terrorist attacks,  natural disasters, criminal activities, and other emergencies at federal  facilities. The Lessons Learned and Best Practices Working Group, which  consists of volunteer representatives from a number of federal agencies,  had its first planning meeting in April 2012. The working group has  established the following objectives: develop a charter accepted by all working group members and  approved by the ISC Steering Committee, establish an information sharing forum for the ISC membership, develop a process to deliver lessons learned and shared information  to the full ISC membership, and develop a methodology to analyze potential items as a security \u201cbest  practice\u201d for approval by the Steering Committee.", "The working group is a first step toward establishing a more deliberate  lessons-learned process, but it remains at its early stages. It is not clear if  the new program will include all of the practices that we have identified  within a lessons-learned process. Developing a lessons-learned process  for the security of federal facilities that does not incorporate all eight  practices, as appropriate, could result in a less effective ISC lessons- learned effort and fail to maximize the value of the lessons learned to the  ISC\u2019s membership.", "In developing a process to disseminate lessons learned governmentwide  through its membership, an important issue for ISC is the unique,  interagency makeup of its organization. The value of a lessons-learned  effort led by ISC is the ability to take the lessons from an incident that  affected one agency and share that knowledge broadly among many  agencies so that all may benefit and federal facilities across the  government may become more secure. Therefore, the authority of ISC to  require their participation in sharing lessons is important to the  effectiveness of ISC\u2019s effort. The Executive Order establishing ISC states  that \u201ceach executive agency and department shall cooperate and comply  with the policies and recommendations of the Committee.\u201d Agencies,  however, are not sharing information with each other and ISC to the  fullest extent possible. According to ISC officials, the committee serves at  the will of the various agencies on which it relies for resources and  support to accomplish its mission. ISC officials stated that they cannot  force members to comply with its policies and recommendations. One  possible option for clarifying ISC\u2019s authority is that the President could  make clear that agencies are required to comply with ISC\u2019s policies and  recommendations under the existing Executive Order. Another possible  option would be for the Congress to provide ISC with statutory authority to  carry out its policies and recommendations. A bill pending in the  Congress, the Supporting Employee Competency and Updating  Readiness Enhancements for Facilities (SECURE Facilities) Act of 2011,  would enact into law that \u201ceach agency shall cooperate and comply with   polices, standards, and determinations.\u201d The bill would also  require ISC to propose regulations to \u201cestablish risk-based performance  standards for the security of Federal facilities,\u201d among other things.

Senior management can promote  openness and the strategic value in using knowledge, and communicate  to their employees that sharing knowledge is critical to their success.  Specifically, the Italian officials noted that an effective lessons-learned  effort should also collect information on what is working well and best  practices. The Center for Army Lessons Learned also pointed out that  agency managers can reinforce their commitment to open communication  by integrating effective information sharing into staff performance  expectations and appraisals.", "Some law enforcement officials with whom we spoke said that there is a  lack of time for sharing lessons learned. Consequently, they said that  knowledge-sharing activities can be seen as an additional burden on top  of an already heavy workload. A General Services Administration official  stated that department and agency representatives to ISC already have  ISC responsibilities in addition to their own agency responsibilities, so  forming yet another working group would be taxing to many agency  representatives. Greek law enforcement officials noted that they were  dealing with an increasing pace of demonstrations outside government  buildings, which has placed time constraints on the ability to do other  tasks including identifying lessons learned from the last demonstration.", "Officials from the Center for Army Lessons Learned and the Israeli  Security Agency said that benefits of an effective lessons-learned process  can convince people to prioritize it. The Center for Army Lessons Learned  officials said that agencies should not view lessons learned as different  from normal activities and that lessons-learned practices should be  embedded into the agency programs that they are meant to improve. For  example, Bureau of Diplomatic Security officials said that the bureau tries  to increase involvement in the Knowledge from the Field program and use  resources efficiently by using existing networks and procedures in  developing its lessons-learned videos. For example, the program relies  on State Department officials in the field to nominate lessons, uses the  existing after-action reports and event videos, and integrates the lessons  into the existing training classes for security officers.", "Some law enforcement officials we interviewed stated that there are not  enough physical security incidents to warrant the creation of a  governmentwide lessons-learned process. A Smithsonian Institution  Office of Protection Services official stated that given the limited number  of major security incidents compared to the large number of buildings  throughout the federal government, there does not appear to be a  problem with the current practices that federal agencies use to learn from  those incidents. Officials from the U.S. Marshals Service stated that  establishing a governmentwide lessons-learned process would be  problematic because every building has unique security requirements  which limit the benefits of sharing information.", "Conversely, Bureau of Diplomatic Security officials said that the low  number of incidents increases the need to share lessons from the  incidents that occur. The officials said that people learn through  experience and, due to the low number of incidents, the lessons learned  by others may be the closest many federal security officials come to direct  experience. For example, State Department officials said that Knowledge  from the Field is supported by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security\u2019s  institutional willingness and responsibility to learn from mistakes. State  Department officials said that they take efforts to use actual incident  video, recordings, and interviews to make the lessons more compelling  and as real as possible for those not actually involved.

Several  agency officials expressed concerns about broadly sharing sensitive  information out of fear the information would be compromised.

Officials from the Center for Army Lessons Learned said that the Army  faces this same challenge but indicated that placing excessive security  restrictions on lessons-learned information reduces dissemination,  defeating the purpose of a lessons-learned process.

As a result,  officials from several international and domestic law enforcement  agencies said that they prefer informal networks for capturing information  quickly. However, one Justice Protective Service official acknowledged  that while informal mechanisms are quicker than structured mechanisms,  the information is often anecdotal and the recipients of the information  must be careful that the information is reliable.", "Setting expectations and staggering the release of lessons-learned  information can mitigate this challenge. According to Center for Army  Lessons Learned officials, the risk in rapidly sharing information is that  you fail to conduct a thorough analysis and validate that you are drawing  the correct lessons. The Army officials recommended creating timelines  for sharing information that are tied to the urgency of the information, so  that the most critical information gets out first. For example, according to  the Center for Army Lessons Learned, an \u201cimmediate\u201d requirement to  share a particular lesson, that if not shared, could result in the injury or  death of a soldier. However, once rapidly shared, information should  continue to be analyzed and eventually be formally vetted, archived, and  become a part of the issues-resolution process. For example, NTSB  officials said that NTSB may issue a safety recommendation fairly quickly  and well before it completes and issues its final accident-investigation  report. As for sharing information via informal networks, interacting  informally with other agency officials is a valid method of sharing  information, but it is not necessarily the most effective way. Relying solely  on informal networks for capturing lessons is problematic because  personal networks can dissolve, e.g., through attrition or retirement, and  informal information sharing does not ensure everyone is benefiting from  the lessons that are gleaned. In addition, informal exchanges do not  generally allow the information to be validated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Human and Financial Resources", "paragraphs": ["Some agencies we interviewed\u2014such as the Justice Protective Service,  U.S. Marshals Service, and the General Services Administration\u2014cited  the lack of human and financial resources as a barrier to establishing a  structured lessons-learned process for real property security. Officials  from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Smithsonian  Institution noted that ISC could be the appropriate federal body to run  such a governmentwide lessons-learned effort. However, the Smithsonian  official also said that implementing a formal, governmentwide lessons- learned process would require ISC to allocate sufficient resources. The  Holocaust Museum official suggested that if such a process were  established, federal funds should be appropriated to support it.", "Because establishing a structured lessons-learned process can take  several years, Center for Army Lessons Learned officials stated that  organizations should start small, do what is possible with the resources  they have, build gradually, and leverage existing structures and practices  instead of creating an entirely new, separate process. Also, previous  GAO work and the work of the Center for Army Lessons Learned  emphasize that senior leadership need to be actively engaged in lessons- learned efforts and prioritize resources to ensure that changes happen  and lessons are actually learned and disseminated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although attacks on federal buildings and public spaces remain rare,  recent attacks show the continuing potential for violent acts. ISC has  some of the practices in place to identify and apply lessons learned for  physical security, but it does not have in place a systematic, structured  lessons-learned process. Without a more structured, governmentwide  effort, attackers could continue to exploit the same weaknesses in  government security. Recognizing this, ISC has taken the important step  of initiating a structured lessons-learned process for physical security,  starting with its working group, but that effort is just beginning. It is  unclear the extent to which ISC\u2019s new effort will apply each of the  practices of a lessons-learned process identified in our report. Without  implementing each of the eight practices of a lessons-learned process, as  appropriate, ISC\u2019s effort might not reach its full potential and will run the  risk of lacking relevance within the law enforcement community it seeks to  assist. In addition, because of ISC\u2019s limited resources, it will be important  to build its lessons-learned process gradually and leverage its existing  practices.", "Once ISC establishes its lesson-learned process, it will be important for  all of its member agencies to participate. However, ISC currently relies on  agencies to take the initiative to promote their lessons to others\u2014 something that does not always happen due to the guarded culture of the  physical security community. As a result, ISC officials have questioned if  ISC has sufficient authority to implement an effective lessons-learned  process since it currently operates under an Executive Order, as opposed  to pursuant to a statutory requirement. If ISC cannot encourage or compel  all relevant agencies to learn and share lessons, its effort could miss  important lessons that could help protect federal buildings and save lives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the federal government\u2019s ability to learn from and disseminate  physical security lessons, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct ISC to:", "Develop a lessons-learned process for physical security that will (1)  leverage the lessons-learned practices it already employs and (2)  incorporate the full range of lessons-learned practices identified in our  report.", "Determine, as it develops a lessons-learned process, whether  Executive Order 12977 provides sufficient authority to effectively  support a systematic, governmentwide lessons-learned effort.
