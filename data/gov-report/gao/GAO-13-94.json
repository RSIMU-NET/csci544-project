The committee that was established to promote the coordination of geospatial data nationwide--the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)--has developed and endorsed key standards-- including a metadata standard that includes descriptive information about a particular set of geospatial data--and established a clearinghouse of metadata; however, the clearinghouse is not being used by agencies to identify planned geospatial investments to promote coordination and reduce duplication. The FGDC has not yet planned or implemented an approach to manage geospatial data as related groups of investments to allow agencies to more effectively plan geospatial data collection efforts and minimize duplicative investments; and its strategic plan is missing key elements, such as performance measures for many of its defined objectives. Further, none of the three federal departments in GAO's review have fully implemented important activities for coordinating geospatial data, such as preparing and implementing a strategy for advancing geospatial activities within their respective departments.", "Further, the three agencies in GAO's review responsible for governmentwide management of specific geospatial data have implemented some but not all important activities for coordinating the national coverage of specific geospatial data. For example, only one agency has developed a plan for the nationwide population of the datasets under its responsibility, and none of the agencies have developed a plan to develop standards that facilitate the collection and sharing of geospatial data. Finally, while OMB has oversight responsibilities for geospatial data, OMB staff members acknowledged that OMB does not have complete and reliable information to identify potentially duplicative geospatial investments.", "FGDC, federal departments and agencies, and OMB have not yet fully implemented policies and procedures for coordinating geospatial investments because these efforts have not been a priority. As a result, efforts to acquire data are uncoordinated and the federal government is acquiring duplicative geospatial data. For example, three agencies are independently acquiring road data, which is reported to have resulted in millions of wasted taxpayers' dollars.

The primary function of a GIS is to link multiple  sets of geospatial data and display the combined information as maps  with different layers of information. Assuming that all of the information is  at the same scale and has been formatted according to the same  geospatial standards, users can potentially overlay geospatial information  about any number of specific topics to examine how the data in the  various layers interrelate. Each layer of a GIS map typically represents a  single theme comprised of one or more sets of data, each of which could  be derived from a source completely different from the others.

In  1953, the Bureau of the Budget first issued Circular A-16, encouraging  expeditious surveying and mapping activities across all levels of  government and avoidance of duplicative efforts. In 1990, OMB revised  Circular A-16 to, among other things, establish the FGDC within Interior to  promote the coordinated use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial  data nationwide. Building on that guidance, in 1994 the President issued  Executive Order 12906 for the purpose of addressing wasteful duplication  and incompatibility of geospatial information, and assigned the FGDC the  responsibility to coordinate the development of the NSDI. In 2002, OMB  again revised Circular A-16 to further describe the components of the  NSDI; clearly define agency responsibilities for acquiring, maintaining,  distributing, using, and preserving geospatial data; and to reaffirm the  FGDC\u2019s role as the interagency coordinating body for NSDI-related  activities. The circular established the following five components of the  NSDI and described how these components were to be implemented.", "Data themes. Data themes are topics of national significance, such  as transportation, which includes all modes of travel (e.g., road and  rail data). OMB Circular A-16 currently identifies 34 data themes and  identifies the \u201clead\u201d agency or agencies for each theme. Each data  theme is to be comprised of one or more electronic data records,  known as datasets. Of the 34 themes, 9 are identified as \u201cframework\u201d  themes\u2014that is, themes identified in Circular A-16 as critical for many geospatial applications.", "Standards. Geospatial standards provide common and repeatable  rules or guidelines for the development, documentation, and  exchange of geospatial datasets.", "Metadata. Metadata are information about datasets, such as content,  source, accuracy, method of collection, and point-of-contact.

The clearinghouse is intended  to be a centralized geospatial metadata repository that contains  geospatial metadata records from federal agencies, state and local  governments, and academic and private sector organizations that can  be searched to determine whether needed geospatial data exist and  can be shared. Federal agencies are required to identify their existing  and planned geospatial investments in the clearinghouse, and search  the clearinghouse for cost-saving opportunities before acquiring  geospatial data. In 2003, the FGDC created the Geospatial One-Stop  to provide \u201cone-stop\u201d access to geospatial metadata from a  centralized database and search function. In October 2011, the  Geospatial One-Stop was retired, and the FGDC initiated a pilot  project, known as the Geospatial Platform, which is envisioned to  provide shared and trusted geospatial data, services, and applications  for use by government agencies, their partners, and the public.  According to Interior officials, Interior is the managing partner of the  Geospatial Platform. As of August 2012, there were approximately  835,000 geospatial metadata records in the central repository, of  which about 373,000 were from federal sources.
