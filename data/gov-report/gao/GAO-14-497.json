The TRDP contract is separate from the TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP) and the TDP contracts because the government does not contribute any funds for the TRDP, but does contribute funds for the ADDP and TDP. To provide assurance that government funds are not expended for the TRDP, contractors said they would have to operate the programs separately. As a result, DHA officials determined that there would be minimal cost savings from combining contracts. Differences in how the ADDP and TDP programs are funded also influenced DHA's decision to use separate contracts for these programs. DOD pays all costs for necessary care provided to active duty servicemembers through the ADDP. In contrast, the TDP is an insurance program: DOD and TDP beneficiaries share in the costs of premiums, which are paid to the contractor; the contractor is at risk for payment to providers. DHA officials concluded that the disadvantages of combining these two contracts outweighed the potential advantages. Other factors that contributed to DHA's decision to use separate contracts for different beneficiary groups included differences in program purposes, dental services, and network access standards.", "In comments on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with its findings and provided a technical comment, which was incorporated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2012, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) military health  system offered comprehensive health care coverage to nearly 9.7 million  eligible beneficiaries through its TRICARE programs, with more than   4.6 million beneficiaries enrolled for TRICARE dental services.

As part of its development of contract requirements,  DHA officials gathered information through market research and analyzed  it to determine the capabilities within the dental services market to satisfy  the agency\u2019s needs. DHA\u2019s market research included soliciting  information from current and potential dental services contractors. To do  this, DHA officials issued RFIs and draft RFPs for comment. These documents included questions related to potential benefit changes\u2014such  as how the offeror would implement a specific benefit\u2014and potential data  requirements\u2014such as how the offeror would submit required data to  DHA. In addition to RFIs and draft RFPs, DHA\u2019s market research  activities included one-on-one meetings with dental services  contractors.", "DHA officials used information from these market research activities to  revise contract requirements. For example, according to DHA officials,  feedback from contractors indicated that DOD\u2019s contract requirements  related to information security were costing dental contractors (and DOD)  a substantial amount of money. Partly as a result of contractors\u2019  feedback, DHA determined that it would be more economical for  contractors to comply with the information security standards used in the  commercial sector, according to these officials. In all three new contracts,  DHA officials therefore required contractors to comply with commercial  information security requirements instead of those developed by DOD.", "DHA officials also used market research to determine the technical  feasibility of potential contract requirements. For example, after  encountering delays in treatment preauthorization decisions due to poor  quality radiographs (commonly known as x-rays), the RFI that DHA  issued for the ADDP contract included questions to determine the  feasibility of the electronic submission of radiographs. According to DHA  officials, dental technology has progressed to allow for easy electronic  submission of this data, resulting in better radiograph quality. Partly as a  result of information collected through the RFI, DHA officials incorporated  a requirement into the new ADDP contract for the contractor to submit  radiographs electronically when requesting pretreatment authorization  from DHA. This requirement was intended to increase the quality of the  diagnostic information and thus DHA\u2019s efficiency in making  preauthorization decisions.", "Performance Monitoring. DHA officials analyzed information about  contractors\u2019 past performance, including contractors\u2019 monthly reports and  claims payment data, to assess and revise contract requirements for  future contractors. DHA uses a variety of methods to monitor  performance, primarily relying on their review of monthly reports  submitted by each contractor to DHA, which reflect how well the  contractor is performing against the performance standards. They use  this information to assess and revise requirements for each future dental  services contract. For example, according to DHA officials, before issuing  the RFP for the current TRDP contract, DHA officials\u2019 review of the then  current TRDP contractor\u2019s performance against the existing contract\u2019s  network access standard indicated that the contractor consistently  exceeded the standard. As a result, DHA raised the network access  standard in the new TRDP contract from 90 to 99 percent, thus requiring  that 99 percent of enrollees living within the United States, District of  Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have access to  a network general dentist within a specified distance of their primary  residence.", "DHA officials also used other performance monitoring information, such  as claims payment data submitted by contractors, when developing  contract requirements. For example, DHA officials\u2019 review of the ADDP  contractor\u2019s claims payment data confirmed reports they received from  DTFs that some servicemembers were being treated twice (and DHA paid  more than they would have otherwise) for the same dental problem  because they were treated by general dentists, not dental specialists, and  the initial treatment was not successful, according to DHA officials. Partly  as a result of their review of this information, DHA officials incorporated a  new requirement in the new ADDP contract that requires that 90 percent  of all DTF-referred endodontic procedures (such as root canals) or oral  surgeries be completed by an endodontist or oral surgeon, respectively.", "Legal requirements. DHA officials reviewed laws relevant to each dental  services contract to identify changes required by statute. DHA officials  used the information to determine whether any changes to the benefit or  eligibility structures of the contracts would be required. For example, DHA  added a survivor benefit to the TDP contract as a result of a legislative  change. In addition, the Transition Assistance Management Program,  which provides 180 days of premium-free transitional health care benefits  after regular TRICARE benefits end, was added to the ADDP contract as  a result of a legislative change.", "Independent Cost Estimates. DHA officials reviewed independent cost  estimates for new benefit requirements they were considering to assess  cost efficiency. Specifically, prior to incorporating new benefit  requirements into the TRDP and TDP contracts, DHA obtained and  reviewed cost estimates from a private consulting firm to determine the  impact of these benefits on enrollees\u2019 monthly premiums. For example,  DHA requested cost estimates for increasing the TDP contract\u2019s  maximum lifetime orthodontic benefit requirement from $1,500 to $1,750  and from $1,500 to $2,000. The estimates indicated that monthly  premiums would increase 65 cents and $1.30, respectively. Based in part  on the cost estimate, DHA increased the benefit requirement in the final  TDP contract so that the contractor must provide coverage for benefits up  to $1,750. According to DHA officials, they do not incorporate benefits if  doing so would result in large increases in monthly premiums.", "Other Sources of Information. Other sources of information DHA  officials reviewed prior to determining whether to add, change, or  eliminate requirements from their dental service contracts included", "Lessons learned from previous procurements for other health  services. We previously reported that DHA incorporated lessons  learned into the RFP for the dental services contracts as a result of  challenges to DHA\u2019s contract award decisions for certain managed  care support contracts. Specifically, in drafting the RFP for the TDP  contract, officials more clearly defined how DHA officials planned to  assess the evaluation factors when awarding the contract.", "Current dental services contract requirements. DHA officials told us  that they review current contract requirements and solicit feedback on  them from stakeholders, including officials from various branches of  the military and organizations representing beneficiaries, before each  new solicitation. For example, DHA officials conducted a forum with  military services officials through which they identified potential new  requirements for the ADDP contract, including a referral tracking  system that would indicate authorized care that was not completed  and thereby allow military commanders ready access to information  about servicemembers\u2019 dental readiness. As a result of this and other  information they reviewed, the new ADDP contract required the  contractor to develop a referral tracking system and train DHA staff on  its use.", "Dental best practices and changes in the professional practice of  dentistry. DHA officials review industry best practices and changes in  the practice of dentistry to determine new contract requirements. For  example, when developing new benefits for the current TDP contract,  DHA officials researched common dental insurance benefits and best  practices and solicited feedback from the American Dental  Association\u2019s Council on Government Affairs. In addition, DHA  officials told us that they used their knowledge of changes in the field  of dentistry, including dentistry\u2019s increased use of digital technology,  to help them identify the electronic submission of radiographs as a  potential solution to the previously discussed problem of poor  radiograph quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHA Uses Separate Contracts Because of Funding Differences and Other Factors", "paragraphs": ["DHA uses separate contracts for different beneficiary groups, in part,  because the programs that serve them are funded differently.

DHA officials determined that there would be  minimal cost savings or efficiencies from combining contracts under these  circumstances.", "Because the TRDP is not directly supported by DOD funds, DHA is  exploring the possibility of shifting the option for military retirees to  purchase dental insurance, which is currently provided through the TRDP,  to the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP),  which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).Unlike the TRDP, the FEDVIP allows enrollees to select from among  several plan options. DHA and OPM are in the preliminary process of  determining the viability of this plan. DHA officials said that this option has  both advantages and disadvantages. The primary advantages would  include:  lowering the workload of staff within the TRICARE Dental Care Office,  thereby allowing them to devote more of their time to administering  and overseeing the remaining two programs; and allowing retirees greater flexibility to choose among insurance plans  that differ in their premiums and coverage options.", "The primary disadvantages of shifting the option to purchase dental  insurance to the FEDVIP would include:  the loss, for retirees, of the increased ease in use that results from  similarities that have been built into the various TRICARE programs,  such as similarities across programs in educational materials; potentially higher premiums if the enrollee selects a plan with more  extensive dental benefits; and potential resistance to the change among military retirees.", "DHA officials told us that it is too soon to determine whether it would be  possible to shift the TRDP to the FEDVIP. If it is found to be a viable  option, legislative action would be necessary for OPM to open the  FEDVIP to military retirees and for DOD to terminate the TRDP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ADDP and TDP Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Among other factors, differences in how the ADDP and TDP programs  are funded also influenced DHA\u2019s decision to use separate contracts for  these programs. For example, DOD pays all costs for necessary care  provided to active duty servicemembers through the ADDP upon receipt  of invoices for individually priced services. In contrast, the TDP is an  insurance program: DOD and TDP beneficiaries share in the costs of  premiums, which are paid to the contractor; and the contractor is at risk  for payment to providers. Thus, unlike the ADDP contractor, the TDP  contractor bears the risk of loss if total costs through the program are  greater than predicted. (If total costs are lower than predicted, the  contractor would earn a larger profit than expected.)", "DHA officials told us that they consulted with potential contractors to  identify advantages and disadvantages of merging the ADDP and TDP  contracts and they concluded that the disadvantages of combining these  two contracts, which are largely due to the differences in funding,  outweighed the potential advantages. The potential advantages of  combining the contracts that DHA officials and contractors identified  included: enhanced continuity of care when individuals switch from reserve to  fewer instances in which two contractors would need to work together  to reconcile payments when an error has been made about whether  someone is on active or reserve duty because a single contractor  would be responsible for both programs; greater leverage in fee negotiations because the pool of potential  enrollees would be larger; and  slight gains in the efficiency of contract administration, particularly for  monitoring contractors\u2019 performance, thereby allowing TRICARE  Dental Care Office staff more time to devote to their other  responsibilities.", "The potential disadvantages of combining the contracts that DHA officials  and contractors identified included: a reduction in competition if carriers do not want to participate in one  or the other program, do not want to manage two different programs  simultaneously under the same contract, or do not want to undertake  a contract of the resultant size; greater difficulty in selecting the best contractor to award the contract,  as one offer may be a better match for the ADDP requirements and  another offer a better match for the TDP requirements;  the potential for confusion among beneficiaries, dentists, and  contractor staff because of differences between the programs (such  as different benefits and payment requirements); and  the potential for a compromise on quality if the contractor is not able  to meet the requirements of both programs simultaneously and well.  In the past, there was an interval during which a single contractor held  both the ADDP and TDP contracts, and DHA officials told us that  there were problems with this arrangement, including obstacles to  care; operational challenges; and confusion among beneficiaries, the  contractor, and the military DTFs. They said that these problems  negatively affected both the delivery of dental care and the reputation  of the military health system.", "Having just awarded the ADDP contract, DHA officials stated that they  are not exploring options for combining these contracts.
