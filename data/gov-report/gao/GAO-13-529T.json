This testimony is based on several previously published GAO reports and includes updates on actions taken in response to these reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2010, 13 federal agencies invested over $3 billion in 209 programs designed to increase knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and attainment of STEM degrees. The number of programs within agencies ranged from 3 to 46, with the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation administering more than half of the 209 programs. Almost a third of all programs had obligations of $1 million or less, while some had obligations of over $100 million. Beyond programs specifically focused on STEM education, agencies funded other broad efforts that contributed to enhancing STEM education.", "Eighty-three percent of the programs GAO identified overlapped to some degree with at least 1 other program in that they offered similar services to similar target groups in similar STEM fields to achieve similar objectives. Many programs have a broad scope--serving multiple target groups with multiple services. However, even when programs overlap, the services they provide and the populations they serve may differ in meaningful ways and would therefore not necessarily be duplicative. Nonetheless, the programs are similar enough that they need to be well coordinated and guided by a robust strategic plan.", "Agencies' limited use of performance measures and evaluations may hamper their ability to assess the effectiveness of their individual programs as well as the overall STEM education effort. Specifically, program officials varied in their ability to provide reliable output measures--for example, the number of students, teachers, or institutions directly served by their program. Further, most agencies did not use outcomes measures in a way that is clearly reflected in their performance planning documents. In addition, a majority of programs did not conduct comprehensive evaluations since our prior review in 2005 and the time of our survey in 2011 to assess effectiveness, and the evaluations GAO reviewed did not always align with program objectives. Finally, GAO found that completed STEM education evaluation results had not always been disseminated in a fashion that facilitated knowledge sharing between both practitioners and researchers. In naming STEM education as a crosscutting goal, the administration is taking the first step towards better governmentwide coordinated planning; however, it will be important to finalize a governmentwide strategic plan so agencies can better align their performance plans and reports to new governmentwide goals. GAO previously recommended that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should direct the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) to work with agencies to better align their activities with a governmentwide strategy, develop a plan for sustained monitoring of coordination, identify programs for consolidation or potential elimination, and assist agencies in determining how to better evaluate their programs. Since GAO's report, OSTP released a progress report that identified some programs for elimination, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) named STEM education one of its interim cross-cutting priority goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO previously recommended that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should direct the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) to work with agencies to better align their activities with a governmentwide strategy, develop a plan for sustained monitoring of coordination, identify programs for consolidation or potential elimination, and assist agencies in determining how to better evaluate their programs.

In addition to the federal effort, state and  local governments, universities and colleges, and the private sector have  also developed programs that provide opportunities for students to pursue  STEM education and occupations. However, research shows that despite  this investment, the United States lacks a strong pipeline of future  workers in STEM fields and that U.S. students continue to lag behind  students in other highly technological nations in mathematics and science  achievement. Over the decades, Congress and the executive branch  have continued to create new STEM education programs, even though,  as we previously reported, there has been a general lack of assessment  of how well STEM programs are working. Governmentwide strategic  planning could help better align federal efforts in an efficient and effective  manner.", "My testimony is based on several previously published GAO reports on  STEM education, including our January 2012 report entitled Science,  Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education: Strategic Planning  Needed to Better Manage Overlapping Programs across Multiple  Agencies and also addresses actions taken by the administration to better  plan and coordinate federal STEM education programs since our 2012  report was issued.agencies and programs that provided funding for STEM education  programs in fiscal year 2010; (2) the extent to which these STEM  programs overlap; and (3) the extent to which federal STEM education  programs have measured their effectiveness and were aligned to a  governmentwide strategy. To conduct this work, we reviewed relevant  federal laws and regulations as well as previous GAO work on overlap,  duplication, and fragmentation. We interviewed officials from the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and OSTP, and officials from other  federal agencies that administer STEM education programs. We reviewed  relevant literature and past reports that catalog and assess the federal  investment in STEM education. To gather information on federal STEM  education programs and to assess the level of fragmentation, overlap,  and potential duplication, we reviewed past GAO work on assessing the  level of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication among other groups of  federal programs and we surveyed over 200 programs across 13  agencies that met our definition of a STEM education program, asking  questions about program objectives, target populations, services  provided, interagency coordination, outcome measures and evaluations,  and funding. Our survey was administered between May 2011 and  August 2011 to federal agency program officials and achieved a 100  percent response rate.

In 2005, for example, GAO  identified a multitude of agencies that administer such programs. The  primary missions of these agencies vary, but most often, they are to  promote and enhance an area that is related to a STEM field or enhance  general education. In addition, the National Science and Technology  Council (NSTC) was established in 1993 and is the principal means for  the administration to coordinate science and technology with the federal  government\u2019s larger research and development effort. The America  COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 sought to address coordination  and oversight issues, including those associated with the coordination  and potential duplication of federal STEM education efforts.the law required the Director of the Office for Science and Technology  Policy (OSTP) to establish a committee under the NSTC to inventory,  review, and coordinate federal STEM education programs. The law also  directed this NSTC committee to develop a 5-year governmentwide  STEM education strategic plan, which must specify and prioritize annual  and long-term objectives for STEM education. Moreover, the Director of  OSTP is required to send a report to Congress annually on this strategic  plan, which must include, among other things, an evaluation of the levels  of duplication and fragmentation of STEM programs and activities.", "In our January 2012 report on STEM education, we defined a federally  funded STEM education program as a program funded in fiscal year 2010  by congressional appropriation or allocation that included one or more of  the following as a primary objective: attract or prepare students to pursue classes or coursework in STEM  areas through formal or informal education activities, attract students to pursue degrees (2-year, 4-year, graduate, or  doctoral degrees) in STEM fields through formal or informal education  activities, provide training opportunities for undergraduate or graduate students attract graduates to pursue careers in STEM fields, improve teacher (preservice or in-service) education in STEM areas,  improve or expand the capacity of K-12 schools or postsecondary  institutions to promote or foster education in STEM fields, or  conduct research to enhance the quality of STEM education programs  provided to students.", "In addition, a program was defined as an organized set of activities  supported by a congressional appropriation or allocation. Further, we  defined a program as a single program even when its funds were  allocated to other programs as well. We asked agency officials to provide  a list of programs that received funds in fiscal year 2010.", "In our January 2012 report, we examined the extent to which federal  STEM education programs were fragmented, overlapping, and  duplicative. overlap, and duplication work, key terms were defined as follows:   Using our framework established in previous fragmentation,", "Fragmentation occurs when more than one federal agency (or more  than one organization within an agency) is involved in the same broad  area of national need.", "Overlap occurs when multiple programs offer similar services to  similar target groups in similar STEM fields to achieve similar  objectives.", "Duplication occurs when multiple programs offer the same services to  the same target beneficiaries in the same STEM fields.", "GAO-12-108."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Thirteen Federal Agencies Administered over 200 Programs with Over $3 Billion in Obligated Funds", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in 2012, 13 agencies administered 209 STEM education  programs in fiscal year 2010. Agencies reported that they developed the  majority (130) of these programs through their general statutory authority  and that Congress specifically directed agencies to create 59 of these  programs. The number of programs each agency administered ranged  from 3 to 46 with three agencies\u2014the Department of Health and Human  Services, the Department of Energy, and the National Science  Foundation (NSF)\u2014administering more than half of all programs\u2014112 of  209. (See fig. 1) Agencies obligated over $3 billion to STEM education  programs in fiscal year 2010, ranging from $15,000 to hundreds of  millions of dollars per program. NSF and the Department of Education  programs accounted for over half of this funding. Almost a third of the  programs had obligations of $1 million or less, with five programs having  obligations of more than $100 million each.", "Beyond the 209 programs identified in our review, federal agencies  carried out other activities that contribute to the overall federal STEM  education effort. Having multiple agencies, with varying expertise,  involved in delivering STEM education has both advantages and  disadvantages. On the one hand, it could allow agencies to tailor  programs to suit their specific missions and needs to attract new  employees to their workforce. On the other hand, it could make it  challenging to develop a coherent federal approach to educating STEM  students and creating a workforce with STEM skills. Further, it could  make it difficult to identify gaps and allocate resources across the federal  government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most STEM Programs Overlapped to Some Degree", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in 2012, and as figure 2 illustrates, in fiscal year 2010, 83  percent of STEM education programs overlapped to some degree with  another program in that they offered at least one similar service to at least  one similar target group in at least one similar STEM field to achieve at  least one similar objective. These programs ranged from being narrowly  focused on a specific group or field of study to offering a range of services  to students and teachers across STEM fields. This complicated  patchwork of overlapping programs has largely resulted from federal  efforts to both create and expand programs across many agencies in an  effort to improve STEM education and increase the number of students  going into STEM fields. Program officials reported that approximately  one-third of STEM education programs funded in fiscal year 2010 were  first funded between 2005 and 2010. We believe the creation of new  programs during that time frame may have contributed to overlap and,  ultimately, to inefficiencies in how STEM programs across the federal  government are focused and delivered. Overlap among STEM education  programs is not new. In 2007, the Academic Competitiveness Council  (ACC) identified extensive overlap among STEM education programs,  and, in 2009, we identified overlap among teacher quality programs,  which include several programs focused on STEM education.  Overlapping programs can lead to individuals and institutions being  eligible for similar services in similar STEM fields offered through multiple  programs and, without information sharing, could lead to the same  service being provided to the same individual or institution.", "Our analysis found that many programs provided services to similar target  groups, such as K-12 students, postsecondary students, K-12 teachers,  and college faculty and staff. The vast majority of programs (170) served  postsecondary students. Ninety-five programs served college faculty and  staff, 75 programs served K-12 students, and 70 programs served K-12  teachers. In addition, many programs served multiple target groups. In  fact, 177 programs primarily served two or more target groups.", "We also found many STEM programs providing similar services.", "To support students, 167 different programs provided research  opportunities, internships, mentorships, or career guidance. In  addition, 144 programs provided short-term experiential learning  opportunities and 127 long-term experiential learning opportunities.  Short-term experiential learning activities included field trips, guest  speakers, workshops, and summer camps. Long-term experiential  learning activities last a semester in length or longer. Furthermore,  137 programs provided outreach and recognition to generate student  interest, 124 provided classroom instruction, and 75 provided student  scholarships or fellowships.", "To support teachers, 115 programs provided curriculum development,  83 programs provided teacher in-service, professional development,  or retention activities, and 52 programs provided preservice or  recruitment activities.", "To support STEM research, 68 programs reported conducting  research to enhance the quality of STEM education.", "To support institutions, 65 programs provided institutional support to  management and administrative activities, and 46 programs provided  support for expanding the facilities, classrooms, and other physical  infrastructure of institutions.", "In addition to serving multiple target groups, our analysis found that most  programs also provided services in multiple STEM fields. Twenty-three  programs targeted one specific STEM field, while 121 programs targeted  four or more specific STEM fields. In addition, 26 programs indicated not  focusing on any specific STEM field, and instead provided services  eligible for use in any STEM field. Five different STEM fields had over 100  programs that provided services. Biological sciences and technology  were the most selected STEM fields that programs focused on.  Agricultural sciences, which was the least commonly selected, still had 27  programs that provided services specifically to that STEM field.", "While our 2011 survey data also show that many programs overlapped, it  is important to compare programs\u2019 target groups and STEM fields of  focus to get a better picture of the potential target beneficiaries that could  be served within a given STEM discipline. For example, both the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Environmental  Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Education program and  the Department of Energy\u2019s Graduate Automotive Technology Education  program provided scholarships or fellowships to postsecondary students,  but NEDSIS focused on students in earth sciences programs, and the  other on engineering; therefore, the target beneficiaries served by these  two similar programs are quite different. Nevertheless, we found that 76  programs served postsecondary students in physics. As table 1  illustrates, many programs offered services to similar target groups in  similar STEM fields of focus.", "We also found that many STEM education programs had similar  objectives. In response to our 2011 survey, the vast majority (87 percent)  of STEM education program officials indicated that attracting and  preparing students throughout their academic careers in STEM areas was  a primary objective. In addition to attracting and preparing students  throughout their academic careers in STEM areas, officials also indicated  the following primary program objectives:  improving teacher education in STEM areas (teacher development)\u2014  26 percent,  improving or expanding the capacity of K-12 schools or  postsecondary institutions to promote or foster education in STEM  fields (institution capacity building)\u201424 percent, and  conducting research to enhance the quality of STEM education  provided to students (STEM education research)\u201418 percent.", "Many programs also reported having multiple primary objectives. While  107 programs focused solely on student education, 82 others indicated  having multiple primary objectives, and 9 programs reported having 4 or  more primary objectives. Few programs reported focusing solely on  teacher development, institution capacity building, or STEM education  research. Most of these objectives were part of a larger program that also  focused on attracting and preparing students in STEM education.", "However, even when programs overlapped, we found that the services  they provided and the populations they served may differ in meaningful  ways and would therefore not necessarily be duplicative. There may be  important differences between the specific field(s) of focus and a  program\u2019s stated goals. For example, both Commerce\u2019s National  Estuarine Research Reserve System Education Program and the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission\u2019s Integrated University Program provided  scholarships or fellowships to doctoral students in the field of physics;  however, the Commerce program focuses on increasing environmental  literacy related to estuaries and coastal watersheds, while the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission program focuses on supporting education in  nuclear science, engineering, and related fields with the goal of  developing a workforce capable of designing, constructing, operating, and  regulating nuclear facilities and capable of handling nuclear materials  safely. In addition, programs may be primarily intended to serve different  specific populations within a given target group. For example, of the 34  programs that we surveyed in 2011 that provided services to K-12  students in the field of technology, 10 were primarily intended to serve  specific underrepresented, minority, or disadvantaged groups, and 2 were  limited geographically to individual cities or universities. Furthermore,  individuals may receive assistance from different programs at different  points throughout their academic careers that provide services that  complement or build upon each other, simultaneously supporting a  common goal rather than serving cross purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Use of Performance Measures and Evaluations Hamper Ability to Assess Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, we reported that in addition to the fragmented and overlapping  nature of federal STEM education programs, agencies\u2019 limited use of  performance measures and evaluations may hamper their ability to  assess the effectiveness of their individual programs as well as the  overall STEM education effort. Understanding program performance and  effectiveness is key in determining where to strategically invest limited  federal funds to achieve the greatest impact in developing a pipeline of  future workers in STEM fields. Program officials varied in their ability to  provide reliable output measures\u2014for example, the number of students,  teachers, or institutions directly served by their program. In some cases,  the program\u2019s agency did not maintain databases or contracts that would  track the number of students served by the program. In other cases,  programs may not have been able to provide information on the numbers  of institutions they served because they provided grants to secondary  recipients. In 2012, we reported that the inconsistent collection of output  measures across programs makes it challenging to aggregate the number  of students, teachers, and institutions served and to assess the  effectiveness of the overall federal effort.", "In addition, most agencies did not use outcome measures in a way that is  clearly reflected in their performance plans and reports\u2014publicly  available documents they use for performance planning. These  documents typically lay out agency performance goals that establish the  level of performance to be achieved by program activities during a given  fiscal year, the measures developed to track progress, and what progress  has been made toward meeting those performance goals. The lack of  performance outcome measures may hinder decision makers\u2019 ability to  assess how agencies\u2019 STEM education efforts contribute to agencywide  performance goals and the overall federal STEM effort. For our 2012  report, we reviewed fiscal year 2010 annual performance plans and  reports of the 13 agencies with STEM programs and found that most  agencies did not connect STEM education activities to agency goals or  measure and report on the progress of those activities.", "We define \u201cevaluation\u201d as an individual systematic study conducted periodically or on  an ad hoc basis to assess how well a program is working, typically relative to its program  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Our Recommendations Would Better Align Federal Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In our January 2012 report, we made four recommendations to the  Director of OSTP to direct the NSTC to:  1.  Work with agencies, through its strategic-planning process, to identify  programs that might be candidates for consolidation or elimination,  which could be identified through an analysis that includes information  on program overlap and program effectiveness. As part of this effort,  OSTP should work with agency officials to identify and report any  changes in statutory authority necessary to execute each specific  program consolidation identified by NSTC\u2019s strategic plan.  2.  Develop guidance to help agencies determine the types of evaluations  that may be feasible and appropriate for different types of STEM  education programs and develop a mechanism for sharing this  information across agencies. This step could include guidance and  sharing of information that outlines practices for evaluating similar  types of programs.  3.  Develop guidance for how agencies can better incorporate each  agency\u2019s STEM education efforts and the goals from NSTC\u2019s 5-year  STEM education strategic plan into each agency\u2019s own performance  plans and reports.  4.  Develop a framework for how agencies will be monitored to ensure  that they are collecting and reporting on NSTC strategic plan goals.  This framework should include alternatives for a sustained focus on  monitoring coordination of STEM programs if the NSTC Committee on  STEM terminates in 2015 as called for in its charter.", "OSTP agreed with our conclusions and, as figure 4 shows, NSTC has  made some progress in addressing recommendations from our January  2012 report.", "Subsequently, OSTP has stated that NSTC\u2019s 5-Year Federal STEM  Education Strategic Plan, originally scheduled to be released in spring  2012, would address our recommendations; however, the release of  NSTC\u2019s Strategic Plan has been delayed. In February 2012, NSTC  published Coordinating Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Mathematics (STEM) Education Investments: Progress Report, which  identified a number of programs that could be eliminated in fiscal year  2013. By identifying programs for consolidation, elimination, and other  actions, the administration could increase the efficient use of scarce  government resources to achieve the greatest impact in developing a  pipeline of future workers in STEM fields. Although NSTC said it planned  to create a small working group to develop guidance on the  appropriateness of different types of evaluations for different types of  STEM education programs, OSTP has not released the findings of this  working group. Agency and program officials would benefit from guidance  and information sharing within and across agencies about what is working  and how to best evaluate programs. This could help improve individual  program performance and also inform agency and governmentwide  decisions about which programs should continue to be funded. We  continue to believe that without an understanding of what is working in  some programs, it will be difficult to develop a clear strategy for how to  spend limited federal funds. In addition, STEM education was named as  an interim crosscutting priority goal in the President\u2019s 2013 budget  submission; however, it will be important for NSTC to finalize its strategic  plan, which should include guidance for how agencies can better align  their performance plans and reports to new governmentwide goals.  Although OSTP agreed to develop milestones and metrics to track the  implementation of NSTC strategic goals by each agency, it has not taken  action to develop a framework for how agencies will be monitored to  ensure that they are collecting and reporting on NSTC strategic plan  goals. A framework for monitoring agency progress towards NSTC\u2019s  strategic plan is necessary to improve transparency and strengthen  accountability of NSTC\u2019s strategic planning and coordination efforts. In  conclusion, if NSTC\u2019s 5-year strategic plan is not developed in a way that  aligns agencies\u2019 efforts to achieve governmentwide goals, enhances the  federal government\u2019s ability to assess what works, and concentrates  resources on those programs that advance the strategy, the federal  government may spend limited funds in an inefficient and ineffective  manner that does not best help to improve the nation\u2019s global  competitiveness.", "Chairman Rokita, Ranking Member McCarthy, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
