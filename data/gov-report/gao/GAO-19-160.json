However, in 7 of the last 8 fiscal years, the Air Force had staffing gaps of experienced maintainers\u2014those who are most qualified to meet mission needs and are needed to train new maintainers. Maintainers complete technical school as 3-levels and initially lack the experience and proficiency needed to meet mission needs. Following years of on-the-job training, among other things, maintainers upgrade to the 5- and 7-levels. In fiscal year 2017, the Air Force had gaps of more than 2,000 5-level and 400 7-level maintainers, and a surplus of over 1,700 3-levels. Air Force officials anticipate that staffing gaps will continue off and on through fiscal year 2023.", "Over the past 8 fiscal years, the Air Force has increasingly lost experienced aircraft maintainers, and it does not have goals and a strategy to help retain maintainers. While overall maintainer loss rates have remained generally stable, loss rates of 5-levels increased from 9 percent in fiscal year 2010 to 12 percent in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 (see figure). Air Force officials expect 7-level loss rates to also increase. Air Force officials stated that they need to retain more maintainers to help address experience gaps, but the Air Force has not developed annual retention goals for maintainers. In addition, while the Air Force has increased its use of retention bonuses since fiscal year 2015, according to Air Force officials, it does not have a strategy to improve retention. Without goals to measure progress and a retention strategy to guide efforts, the Air Force could face further challenges in managing its maintenance workforce, including ensuring there are enough experienced maintainers to meet mission needs.", "The Air Force consistently met technical school completion rate goals for aircraft maintainers from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. In fiscal year 2017, about 9,600 active component maintainers completed technical school, an increase from about 5,700 in fiscal year 2015.

Specifically, we previously found that according to  economic literature, if a job shortage were to exist, one would expect (1) a  low unemployment rate signaling limited availability of workers in that  profession, (2) increases in employment due to increases in demand for  that occupation, and (3) increases in wages offered to draw people into  that profession. Table 4 shows these specific indicators from 2012 to  2017, since we last reported, measured using the Bureau of Labor  Statistics\u2019 Current Population Survey.", "As table 4 indicates, the direction of all three of these indicators is  consistent with difficulty in hiring of both aircraft mechanics and  aerospace engineers.

First, from 2012 to 2017, median wages for  aerospace engineers and aircraft mechanics increased at a greater  percentage than wages for all occupations, approximately 1.5 and 2.0  percent per year, respectively, compared to about 1 percent for all  occupations. However, while median wages increased for aerospace  engineers and aircraft mechanics during this entire period, it did not  increase in every year, and it exhibited swings by as much as 13 percent.  Second, from 2012 to 2017, employment for aerospace engineers and  aircraft mechanics increased by approximately 1.3 and 1.2 percent per  year, respectively. In comparison, for all occupations, employment  increased by about 2 percent per year over this period.

Air Force officials stated  that the Air Force has not assessed the effects, and that while some  maintainers will leave the Air Force to work for the commercial aviation  industry, they do not believe it is an overarching issue. However, Air  National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command officials noted that a  base\u2019s location, in particular its proximity to commercial aviation industry  opportunities, may affect its ability to recruit and retain maintainers. While  the industry stakeholders we spoke with noted that military maintainers  are attractive to the commercial aviation industry because of their  previous training, work ethic, and discipline, they also noted challenges in  recruiting military maintainers. Specifically, one stakeholder stated that  many military maintainers require similar training for private sector  positions as their non-military peers, citing to the specificity of training  military maintainers receive compared to the broader approach taken by  the commercial aviation sector.", "Only one study we identified through our literature search examined the  potential effects of the commercial aviation industry\u2014specifically the  commercial airlines\u2014on Air Force aircraft maintainer staffing levels. This  study, published in 2016 by RAND and reviewing data from fiscal years  2004 through 2013, did not estimate the effect of any specific  development in the commercial aviation industry on the Air Force.  However, it identified several factors that suggest that the effects, if any,  are likely to be limited. It found this based on four indicators: (1) the Air  Force kept steady maintainer retention rates while the airline maintainer  population fluctuated over the same period of time; (2) the Air Force  offered competitive maintainer salaries compared with several airlines,  making it unlikely that maintainers would separate or retire for better  earnings potential alone; (3) few Air Force maintainers seemed to be  pursuing airframe and power plant certification, which is often a  prerequisite to employment in the airline industry; and (4) on average,  there were considerably more qualified Air Force maintainers separating  or retiring than projected airline maintenance jobs available. However, the  report focused only on the commercial airlines. Air Force officials stated  that they are more likely to experience outside recruitment of maintainers  from defense contractors than from commercial airlines.", "Participants in four of our five discussion groups with maintainers cited  better pay as a reason to transition from the Air Force to the commercial  aviation industry. They also noted consistent schedules, 8-hour work  days, and overtime pay as additional benefits.

Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management  should establish and operate monitoring activities and evaluate the  results. In addition, the Standards provide that, in reviewing actual  performance, management tracks achievements and compares them to  plans, goals, and objectives. While the Air Force has mechanisms to  monitor the health of the maintenance career field, such as through loss  and reenlistment rates, it has not developed annual retention goals for  maintainers. As a result, the Air Force cannot identify how many 5-level  and 7-level maintainers it needs to retain to support new 3-level  maintainers in training and certification of flight line work. Given increases  in losses of experienced maintainers and decreasing reenlistment rates,  the Air Force faces challenges in managing the overall maintenance  workforce, including ensuring that there are enough experienced  maintainers to fulfill mission and training needs. Without annual retention  goals\u2014for both loss and reenlistment rates\u2014the Air Force cannot assess  how many maintainers it needs to retain each year, by skill level, to  sustain recent staffing level improvements and, ultimately, to ensure the  health of its maintenance workforce.", "The Air Force also lacks a retention strategy to focus its efforts in  retaining maintainers. As previously discussed, the Air Force has  conducted aircraft maintenance retention surveys to gauge the health of  the workforce and identify opportunities to improve the career field, but Air  Force officials have stated that these surveys are currently used only for  informational purposes. In addition, while the Air Force offers retention  bonuses for certain maintenance specialties\u2014and has extended the  maximum number of years maintainers in certain specialties can remain  on active duty through the High Year of Tenure Extension Program\u2014 according to Air Force officials, it does not have a maintainer specific  strategy or other initiatives (either monetary or non-monetary) that  address the factors the Air Force has identified through its biennial  surveys as negatively influencing maintainer retention.

These officials stated that  this is a result of issues with the formula that determines instructor  staffing needs, the instructor staffing process for military personnel, and  civilian hiring delays, among other things. According to AETC officials,  they have been able to consistently meet completion rate goals despite  these challenges by waiving some course requirements for multiple  instructors (except when there are safety concerns), contracting some  instruction, and assigning temporary duty personnel to serve as  instructors. These officials noted that while those actions have allowed  them to continue to meet their mission, they have also masked the  severity of the instructor staffing challenges and increased existing  instructors\u2019 stress and workloads.

We  excluded studies that did not specifically focus on our objective, military  maintainers, or the U.S. commercial aviation industry. We retained 1  study after screening and reviewed its methodology, findings, and  limitations. Three GAO staff (two analysts and an economist) were  involved in the screening and a systematic review of the study, which was  determined to be sufficiently relevant and methodologically rigorous.", "We also analyzed data on the number of Air Force personnel completing  the Joint Services Aviation Maintenance Technician Certification Council  (Joint Services Council) airframe and power plant certificate program from  fiscal years 2010 through 2017, and the number of Air Force personnel  receiving airframe and power plant certificate funding from the  Community College of the Air Force\u2019s Air Force Credentialing  Opportunities On-line program from fiscal years 2015 through 2017. We  selected this timeframe because the Air Force\u2019s airframe and power plant  funding program began in fiscal year 2015, and fiscal year 2017 was the  most recent data available at the time of our review. To assess the  reliability of the Air Force\u2019s airframe and power plant certificate program  data, we interviewed officials. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to describe the number of Air Force personnel  completing the Joint Services Council\u2019s airframe and power plant  certificate program from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 and the number  of personnel receiving funding from fiscal years 2015 through 2017.", "To assess the extent to which the Air Force has taken steps to help retain  maintainers, we analyzed the number and total costs of selective  retention bonuses (retention bonuses) that the Air Force awarded, by  maintenance specialty and skill level, from fiscal years 2010 through 2017  for the active and reserve components. We normalized the cost data to  constant fiscal year 2017 data. To assess the reliability of the Air Force\u2019s  retention bonus data, we reviewed related documentation; assessed the  data for errors, omissions, and inconsistencies; and interviewed officials.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to describe the  number and total costs of the Air Force\u2019s aircraft maintainer retention  bonuses from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. In addition, we conducted  interviews with relevant Air Force officials regarding retention goals and  monetary and non-monetary incentives to improve maintainer retention,  and Department of Defense officials regarding retention bonuses. We  compared this information to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government related to monitoring activities and key principles of strategic  workforce planning that we have identified in our prior work, such as  developing strategies that are tailored to address gaps in numbers of  people, skills, and competencies.", "To assess the extent to which the Air Force met its annual technical  school completion rate goals for aircraft maintainers, we calculated  technical school completion rates\u2014the number of aircraft maintainers  completing technical school compared to the number of programmed or  expected completions\u2014for the overall maintainer population and each  maintenance specialty for the active component, for fiscal years 2010  through 2017. We compared those completion rates to the Air Education  and Training Command (AETC) established active component completion  rate goal. For the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command,  we compared programmed completions to actual completions to  determine the extent to which they met their technical school training  needs. To assess the reliability of the technical school completion data  (for both the active and reserve components), we assessed the data for  errors, omissions, and inconsistencies, and interviewed officials. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to describe the Air  Force\u2019s aircraft maintainer technical school completion rates from fiscal  years 2010 through 2017, rounded to the nearest hundreds up to fiscal  year 2013, and more-precisely from fiscal years 2014 and beyond.", "In addition, we observed maintainer technical school training\u2014both  classroom-based and hands-on\u2014as well as training equipment at  Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas and Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.  We selected these locations because they are two of the primary  locations where aircraft maintainer technical school training occurs.  Specifically, according to Air Force officials, the majority of aircraft  maintainers receive at least a portion of their technical school training at  Sheppard Air Force Base, and all F-35-specific maintainer training occurs  at Eglin Air Force Base. Additionally, as part of our previously discussed  non-generalizable sample of discussion groups with aircraft maintainers,  we obtained maintainers\u2019 perspectives on technical school and on-the-job  training. We also reviewed training policies as well as other  documentation, such as Career Field Education and Training Plans and  training evaluations. Finally, we conducted interviews with technical  school instructors and supervisors about the maintainer training process  as well as AETC, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command  officials about training challenges and programmed training needs.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to February 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Air Force Reserve Component Aircraft Maintainer Retention from Fiscal Years 2010-2017", "paragraphs": ["According to Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command  officials, they monitor retention of aircraft maintainers through loss rates\u2014 the number of maintainers who leave the career field or the Air Force  within the fiscal year, over the number of maintainers at the start of the  fiscal year\u2014and have used selective retention bonuses (retention  bonuses) and taken other actions to improve retention.", "According to our analysis of Air National Guard data, aircraft maintainer  loss rates have fluctuated over the past 8 fiscal years. For example, loss  rates increased significantly for all maintenance specialties and skill levels  combined, from 12 percent in fiscal year 2010, to 36 percent and 30  percent in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, respectively. While Air National  Guard maintainer loss rates decreased from fiscal years 2014 through  2017, they remained higher than fiscal year 2010 rates. Table 7 provides  loss rates for Air National Guard aircraft maintainers over the past 8 fiscal  years.", "Air National Guard officials stated that maintainer loss rates are often  location dependent, and that retention bonuses are the primary tool used  to improve retention. According to these officials, while the Air National  Guard looks at nationwide staffing when determining which occupational  specialties are eligible for bonuses, some locations may have more  critical needs than others. The number of retention bonuses that the Air  National Guard has awarded to aircraft maintainers has decreased over  the past 8 fiscal years, while the total cost has increased. Specifically, in  fiscal year 2010, the Air National Guard awarded 1,587 retention bonuses  at a total cost of $4,580,295. However, in fiscal year 2017, the Air  National Guard awarded 653 retention bonuses at a total cost of  $5,373,000. Over the past 8 fiscal years, the majority of its retention  bonuses were awarded to 7-level maintainers.", "The Air Force Reserve Command\u2019s aircraft maintainer loss rates over the  past 8 fiscal years have ranged from 10 to 13 percent. In addition, the  loss rates of 5- and 7-level maintainers have been similar to the loss rates  of all skill levels combined over this period. Similar to the Air National  Guard, Air Force Reserve Command officials stated that maintainer  staffing challenges and loss rates are partly location dependent, though  they also cited opportunities and higher pay in the civilian labor market;  high operations tempo; lack of career growth, opportunities, and flexibility;  and pay disparities with the active component as factors affecting  retention. Table 8 provides loss rates for Air Force Reserve Command  aircraft maintainers over the past 8 fiscal years.", "The Air Force Reserve Command has also used retention bonuses to  help improve retention. Specifically, over the past 8 fiscal years, the Air  Force Reserve Command has increased the number of retention bonuses  awarded and their total costs. For example, in fiscal year 2012, the Air  Force Reserve Command awarded 15 retention bonuses totaling  $242,593. In fiscal year 2015, it increased to 572 bonuses awarded  totaling $8,913,229. In fiscal year 2017, the Air Force Reserve Command  awarded 317 retention bonuses at a total cost of $4,550,000. According  to Air Force Reserve Command officials, the Air Force Reserve  Command has taken a number of steps to help improve technician  retention, such as paid permanent change of station and student loan  repayment. These officials stated that they are also currently working to  improve career path options and medical benefits for technicians. Further,  Air Force Reserve Command officials highlighted Human Capital  Management 2.0 as an effort focused on balancing the human capital  supply and demand across the Air Force Reserve Command, including  improving recruitment and retention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Lori Atkinson (Assistant  Director), Benjamin Bolitzer, Molly Callaghan, Timothy Carr, Christopher  Curran, Matthew Dobratz, Amie Lesser, Grant Mallie, Mike Silver, Carter  Stevens, and Lillian M.
