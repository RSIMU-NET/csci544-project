According to facility officials, these jobs included unskilled, trade, technical, administrative, and professional positions with salaries ranging from $15,000 to $80,000 per year. Most of the facilities identified other contributions that they had made or planned to make in the local communities. These included volunteer work such as organizing cleanups; infrastructure improvements such as installing a new water drainage system; and financial assistance to schools, universities, community groups, and other organizations. Property values in a community are affected by many factors, including the condition of the land and houses, the proximity of the property to natural or man-made structures--such as the facilities covered by this study--that might be viewed as desirable or undesirable, and economic conditions in the surrounding or adjacent communities. Information on property values was unavailable for most of the communities and facilities studied. In these locations, community groups voiced concerns that the facilities would cause property values to decline. Officials at 6 of the 15 facilities GAO studied said they had used available incentives or subsidies. The incentives varied, depending on the type of facility and its location, but included tax exemptions, a local bond initiative, reductions in regulatory fees, and reduced utility rates."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For many years, the location of industrial facilities that are subject to  federal air emissions and water discharge requirements has created  controversy for the surrounding communities.  On the one hand, the  community is striving to bring commerce, jobs, and prosperity to the  community.  On the other hand, the community wants to maintain for its  residents a quality of life that is not further degraded by industrial  emissions and waste.  Some of these facilities, which operate under permits  that regulate certain types of emissions and discharges, have been the  subject of complaints from community groups and environmental activists.   The complaints charge that the facilities expose the surrounding  communities\u2014generally low-income Hispanic and African-American  communities\u2014to greater environmental risk than the general population.   In response, the facilities point out that they contribute to the economic  growth of the surrounding communities by employing residents and  supporting other community needs, such as schools and infrastructure.", "To better understand the economic impact of these facilities, you asked us  to study selected facilities and the nearby communities.  Specifically, for  selected facilities you asked us to (1) determine the number and types of  jobs provided, (2) identify contributions the facilities made to their  communities, (3) determine the facilities\u2019 effect, if any, on property values  in their communities, and (4) determine the amount and type of  government subsidies or incentive packages the facilities received.", "To address these objectives, we contacted 15 facilities\u20149 nonhazardous  waste-related facilities, 3 hazardous waste disposal facilities, 2 chemical  plants, and 1 concrete plant\u2014in 9 locations and asked them to provide  information on jobs as well as on other contributions they had made to the  surrounding communities.  In all cases that we selected for our review,  communities had filed complaints about the facilities.  We also contacted  government officials in each of these locations to determine the changes in  property values and to identify any incentives used by the facilities.  In  addition, we interviewed representatives from community and  environmental action groups.  We did not attempt to verify facilities\u2019  contributions to the different communities.  Also, we did not attempt to  estimate the value of incentives.  Finally, results of our work cannot be  projected beyond facilities and the communities we reviewed.

EPA shares  responsibility for administering and enforcing these requirements with the  states that have been authorized to administer the permit programs. EPA\u2019s  implementing regulations cover activities such as setting levels and  standards for air emissions, establishing effluent limitation guidelines for  water discharges, evaluating the environmental impacts of air emissions,  monitoring compliance with discharge limits for water permits, ensuring  adequate public participation, and issuing permits or ensuring that state  processes meet federal requirements for the issuance of permits.", "While EPA has retained oversight responsibility for these activities, it has  authorized state, tribal, and local authorities to perform most activities  related to issuing permits to industrial facilities.  These authorities\u2014 referred to as permitting authorities\u2014receive federal funding from EPA to  carry out these activities and must adopt standards that are equivalent to or  more stringent than the federal standards.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act  and EPA\u2019s Title VI implementing regulations prohibit permitting authorities  from taking actions that are intentionally discriminatory or that have a  discriminatory effect based on race, color, or national origin.  EPA\u2019s Title VI  regulations allow citizens to file administrative complaints with EPA that  allege discrimination by programs or activities receiving EPA funding [40  C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a77.120(1998)].", "Title VI complaints must be filed in response to a specific action, such as  the issuance of a permit. Because they must be linked to the actions of the  recipients of federal funds, complaints alleging discrimination in the  permitting process are filed against the permitting authority, rather than the  facility receiving the permit. Complaints may be based on one permitting  action or may relate to several actions or facilities that together have  allegedly had an adverse disparate impact.  Neither the filing of a Title VI  complaint nor the acceptance of one for investigation by EPA stays the  permit at issue.", "As of February 7, 2002, EPA\u2019s complaint system showed 44 pending  complaints alleging that state agencies had taken actions resulting in  adverse environmental impacts that disproportionately affected protected  groups.  Of these complaints, 30 involved complaints that were accepted by  EPA and were related to permits allowing proposed facilities to operate at a  specified level of emissions. Other complaints involved issues such as  cleanup enforcement and compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on Number and Types of Jobs", "paragraphs": ["The 15 facilities covered in our study included waste treatment plants,  recycling operations, landfills, chemical plants, and packaging facilities.   These facilities were in nine locations, and some were in rural areas, while  others were in urban areas. (See app. II for additional information on the  location and description of the facilities).  All of the facilities that we  studied reported that they had provided jobs as a result of the creation or  expansion of their facility. As shown in table 1, the number of full-time  jobs ranged from 4 to 103 per facility, with 9 of the facilities having 25 jobs  or less.  Most of the facilities involved waste-related operations, which  generally employ small numbers of employees.", "For four of the facilities, information was available from documents  prepared before the facilities began operating on the number of jobs the  facilities had estimated they would provide.  In each of these cases, the  number of jobs estimated was greater than the number of jobs provided.   Specifically, Genesee Power Station estimated it would provide 30 jobs and  provided 25; ExxonMobil estimated it would provide 50 jobs and provided  40; Natural Resources Recovery estimated it would provide between 15 and  40 jobs and provided 6; and Safety-Kleen, Inc., estimated it would provide  50 jobs in Westmoreland and provided 22.", "Officials from a few facilities told us that their facilities, in addition to  providing jobs directly, generated additional jobs outside of the facility.   For example, a document from ExxonMobil indicated that for every job  provided at the plant, 4.6 jobs resulted elsewhere in the East Baton Rouge  Parish economy.  Also, Chemical Waste Management officials told us that  their landfill increased business in the area and that this enhanced business  could result in more jobs.  We did not verify the facilities\u2019 estimates of jobs  generated outside of the facility.", "In some cases, the number of jobs at these facilities decreased over time.   For example, jobs at the chemical waste facility in Kettleman City,  California, decreased from 200 in 1990 to 103 in 2002; and jobs at a similar  facility in Buttonwillow, California, decreased from 110 in 1987 to 23 in  2002.  In addition, jobs at a fertilizer plant in New York decreased from 80 in  1993 to 39 in 2002.  Officials from the two facilities in California told us that  the changes resulted from a decreased demand for the facilities due to a  reduction in the amount of waste generated by a more environmentally  conscious public.", "We obtained information on the salary ranges and types of jobs provided  for 14 of the 15 facilities. According to officials at these facilities, the  salaries for the jobs provided varied from about $15,000 to $80,000 per year,  depending on factors such as the type of work and the location of the  facility.  However, the information that the facilities provided was not  detailed enough to allow us to determine the numbers for each job type, the  salaries for individual jobs, or the number of jobs filled by people from the  surrounding communities.  The information indicates a wide range of  salaries; however, community organizations in some locations told us that,  in their view, the majority of the jobs filled by community residents were  low paying.", "The facilities provided the following information:  The ExxonMobil Corporation told us that their facility in Louisiana had  both hourly and salaried jobs.  According to ExxonMobil, its hourly jobs  included mechanics, electricians, and laboratory technicians; and its  average wage was about $23 an hour, which is equivalent to $47,840 per  year. Salaried jobs included engineers, a chemist, accountants, and  administrative assistants, and the average salary was just under $70,000  annually.", "The Texas Industries Package Plant, located in Texas, told us that its  jobs included plant manager, sales representative, dispatcher, packaging  coordinator, maintenance mechanic, plant operator, crew operators,  crew members, and administrative positions. The salaries ranged from  about $10 to $15 per hour, which is equivalent to $20,800 and $31,200 per  year, respectively.", "The three hazardous waste treatment facilities in California reported  that the jobs at their facilities\u2014facility manager, manager, heavy  equipment operators, plant operators, truck receiving operators,  customer service representatives, and waste acceptance specialists\u2014 had salaries ranging from $28,000 to $82,000 annually.", "The nine nonhazardous waste-related facilities located in Connecticut,  Louisiana, Michigan, and New York reported having jobs that included  facility site managers, site supervisors, scale and machine operators,  technical assistants, mechanics, and laborers. Salaries for these jobs  ranged from $7.50 to $33.50 per hour, which is equivalent to $15,600 and  $69,680 per year, respectively.", "About half of the facilities provided some information on whether their  jobs were filled by people from the communities.  Specifically, according to  information provided by the Hunts Point, South Bronx, New York facilities,  a large number of employees in the waste-related facilities resided in the  Bronx.  The Hunts Point Water Pollution Control Plant had 67 employees  from the Bronx, with 1 living in the immediate Hunts Point neighborhood.   Safety-Kleen, Inc., told us that the majority of the employees in its two  facilities lived in the county where the facilities were located.", "Over the years of the Genesee Power Station\u2019s operation, about half of the  68 employees resided in Flint or Genesee County, Michigan; however, the  facility did not indicate how many employees, if any, lived in Genesee  Township\u2014the home of the power station\u2014or the Flint community that is  close to the plant.  Similarly, information provided by the Texas Industries  Package Plant in Austin, Texas, indicated that its 10 employees all resided  in a nearby community, town, or city but did not identify the number from  the community immediately surrounding the plant.  And in a 1998  document submitted to EPA, Natural Resources Recovery, Inc., indicated  that four of its five employees lived in the town where the plant was  located.

Specifically,  they performed volunteer work that included offering firefighting  assistance and organizing cleanups in the area.  They also made  infrastructure improvements, such as installing a new water drainage  system.  In addition, some of the facilities made or were planning to make  financial contributions in the communities where they were located.  These  financial contributions would assist schools and universities as well as  community groups and other organizations.  For example, the Genesee  Power Station awarded eight $1,000 scholarships to high school students.", "In three communities, the facilities established foundations or funds to  manage and disburse the financial contributions.  One foundation was set  up following legal action taken by community groups.  In another case, the  foundation was not linked to legal action.  The fund resulted from  collaboration among the state environmental agency, the facility, and the  community that ultimately resulted in the community dropping its  complaint with EPA.  The facilities and community groups in these three  locations provided the following information:  The Kettleman City Foundation, a California nonprofit public benefit  corporation, was set up after legal action was taken by the community  against Chemical Waste Management.  The foundation was organized to  improve the quality of life of the residents of Kettleman City and nearby  areas of Kings County, California, by developing capacity, leveraging  additional resources, and protecting the environment and residents\u2019  health and welfare.  The board of this foundation consisted of the legal  representative for the Center on Race, Poverty, and the Environment;  three community residents; and the manager of the Chemical Waste  Management facility.  Chemical Waste Management provided $115,000 to  the foundation.  In addition, Chemical Waste Management agreed to  make further contributions annually, based on tons of municipal waste  disposed at its landfill.  Since 1998, Chemical Waste Management has  contributed almost $300,000 to the foundation.  Some of these funds are  to be used to help build the Kettleman City Community Center, which  plans to provide a variety of social services.", "The Buttonwillow Community Foundation was established in June 1994.", "The directors of the foundation included representatives from local  government offices, the Chamber of Commerce, and a senior citizens\u2019  group.  This foundation\u2019s primary function was to provide grants to  facilitate projects promoting the health, education, recreation, safety  and welfare of the Buttonwillow residents.  Safety-Kleen, Inc., provided  an initial $50,000 donation to the foundation. Its annual contribution to  the foundation is linked to the tons of waste received at the facility, and  in calendar years 2000 and 2001, these contributions exceeded $100,000.", "The North Meadow Municipal Landfill worked with the community to  address the community\u2019s concerns.  Consequently, a fund called the  Economic Development Account was established for economic  development for minority business enterprises, social welfare projects,  relief of the poor and underprivileged, environmental education,  community revitalization, amelioration of public health concerns, and  for other charitable purposes within Hartford.  A board consisting of  community group and city representatives would determine how to  distribute funds from the account.  At the time of our review, the facility  had agreed to provide $9.7 million for the account over 10 years.  In  exchange for these contributions, the community group agreed to  accept the landfill\u2019s expansion and withdraw the complaint to EPA.", "Despite these efforts, community residents often felt these contributions  were inadequate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on Property Values", "paragraphs": ["Property values in a community are affected by many factors, including the  condition of the land and houses; the proximity of the property to natural  or manmade structures\u2014such as the facilities covered by this study\u2014that  might be viewed as desirable or undesirable; and economic conditions in  the surrounding or adjacent communities.  Information on property values  was not available for most of the communities where the facilities were  located.

The  Genesee Township tax assessor provided information showing that  property values in the area had not changed.  In the South Bronx, property  assessment data indicated that property values had increased in the Hunts  Point neighborhood\u2014the neighborhood where multiple waste  management facilities were located.  For this case, local officials stated  that the increase occurred because of factors such as expanding economic  development and the rising cost of housing in Manhattan.", "In locations where property values were not available, community groups  voiced concerns that the facilities would cause property values to decline.", "For example, residents of Alsen, Louisiana, believed that the location of  nearby industrial facilities, including the facilities studied for this report,  affected property values and reduced homeowners\u2019 ability to sell their  homes for a reasonable price.  Similar concerns were included in the  complaints regarding the hazardous waste landfills in California.
