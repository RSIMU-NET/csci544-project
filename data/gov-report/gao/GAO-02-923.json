Assessing a program's impact or benefit is often difficult, but the dissemination programs GAO reviewed faced a number of evaluation challenges--either individually or in common. The breadth and flexibility of some of the programs made it difficult to measure national progress toward common goals. The programs had limited opportunity to see whether desired behavior changes occurred because change was expected after people made contact with the program, when they returned home or to work. The five programs GAO reviewed addressed these challenges with a variety of strategies, assessing program effects primarily on short-term and intermediate outcomes. Two flexible programs developed common measures to conduct nationwide evaluations; two others encouraged communities to tailor local evaluations to their own goals. Congressional interest was key to initiating most of these evaluations; collaboration with program partners, previous research, and evaluation expertise helped carry them out. Congressional concern about program effectiveness spurred two formal evaluation mandates and other program activities. Collaborations helped ensure that an evaluation would meet the needs of diverse stakeholders."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are increasingly expected to focus on achieving results and to demonstrate, in annual performance reports and budget requests, how their activities will help achieve agency or governmentwide goals. We have noted that agencies have had difficulty explaining in their performance reports how their programs and activities represent strategies for achieving their annual performance goals. Agencies use information dissemination programs as one of several tools to achieve various social or environmental goals. In programs in which agencies do not act directly to achieve their goals, but inform and persuade others to act to achieve a desired outcome, it would seem all the more important to assure decision makers that this strategy is credible and likely to succeed. Various agencies, however, fail to show how disseminating information has contributed, or will contribute, to achieving their outcome-oriented goals.", "To assist agency efforts to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of such programs, we examined evaluations of five federal information dissemination program cases: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Compliance Assistance, the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), the National Tobacco Control Program, and the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. We identified useful evaluation strategies that other agencies might adopt. In this report, prepared under our own initiative, we discuss the strategies by which these five cases addressed their evaluation challenges. We are addressing this report to you because of your interest in encouraging results-based management.", "To identify the five cases, we reviewed agency and program documents and evaluation studies. We selected these five cases because of their diverse methods: two media campaigns were aimed at health outcomes, and three programs provided assistance or instruction aimed at environmental, educational, and health outcomes.

In spring 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched an effort as part of the President\u2019s Budget and Performance Integration Management Initiative to highlight what is known about program results. Formal effectiveness ratings for 20 percent of federal programs will initially be conducted under the executive budget formulation process for fiscal year 2004. However, agencies have had difficulty assessing outcomes that are not quickly achieved or readily observed or over which they have little control.", "One type of program whose effectiveness is difficult to assess attempts to achieve social or environmental outcomes by informing or persuading others to take actions that are believed to lead to those outcomes. Examples are media campaigns to encourage health-promoting behavior and instruction in adopting practices to reduce environmental pollution. Their effectiveness can be difficult to evaluate because their success depends on the effectiveness of several steps that entail changing knowledge, awareness, and individual behavior that result in changed health conditions or environmental conditions. These programs are expected to achieve their goals in the following ways:   The program will provide information about a particular problem, why it is important, and how the audience can act to prevent or mitigate it.", "The audience hears the message, gains knowledge, and changes its attitude about the problem and the need to act.", "The audience changes its behavior and adopts more effective or healthful practices.", "The changed behavior leads to improved social, health, or environmental outcomes for the audience individually and, in the aggregate, for the population or system.", "How this process can work is viewed from different perspectives. Viewed as persuasive communication, the characteristics of the person who presents the message, the message itself, and the way it is conveyed are expected to influence how the audience responds to and accepts the message. Another perspective sees the targeting of audience beliefs as important factors in motivating change. Still another perspective sees behavior change as a series of steps\u2014increasing awareness, contemplating change, forming an intention to change, actually changing, and maintaining changed behavior. Some programs assume the need for some of but not all these steps and assume that behavior change is not a linear or sequential process. Thus, programs operate differently, reflecting different assumptions about what fosters or impedes the desired outcome or desired behavior change. Some programs, for example, combine information activities with regulatory enforcement or other activities to address factors that are deemed critical to enabling change or reinforcing the program\u2019s message.", "A program logic model is an evaluation tool used to describe a program\u2019s components and desired results and explain the strategy\u2014or logic\u2014by which the program is expected to achieve its goals. By specifying the program\u2019s theory of what is expected at each step, a logic model can help evaluators define measures of the program\u2019s progress toward its ultimate goals.

An evaluation that examines how a program was implemented and whether it achieved its short-term and intermediate results can provide important information about why a program did or did not succeed on its long-term results. Scientific research methods can help establish a causal connection between program activities and outcomes and can isolate the program\u2019s contribution to them. Evaluating the effectiveness of information dissemination programs entails answering several questions about the different stages of the logic model:   Short-term outcomes: Did the audience consider the message credible and worth considering?

Thus, little information was available on how well a national program was progressing toward national goals.", "The Eisenhower Professional Development Program, National Tobacco Control Program, EPA\u2019s Compliance Assistance, and CSREES provide financial assistance to states or regional offices with limited federal direction on activities or goals. Many decisions about who receives services and what services they receive are made largely at the regional, county, or school district levels. For example, in the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, districts select professional development activities to support their school reform efforts, including alignment with state and local academic goals and standards. These standards vary, some districts having more challenging standards than others. In addition, training may take various forms; participation in a 2-hour workshop is not comparable to involvement in an intensive study group or year-long course. Such differences in short-term goals, duration, and intensity make counting participating teachers an inadequate way to portray the national program. Such flexibility enables responsiveness to local conditions but reduces the availability of common measures to depict a program in its entirety.", "These programs also had limited federal reporting requirements.

Even after making special efforts to locate people who have moved, each year a few more people from the original sample may not be reached or may refuse to cooperate. In the Eisenhower evaluation, 50 percent of the initial sample (60 percent of teachers remaining in the schools) responded to all three surveys. When a sample is tracked for several years, the cumulative loss of respondents may eventually yield such a small proportion of the original sample as not to accurately represent that original sample. Moreover, the proportion affected tends to diminish at each step of the program logic model, which can reduce the size of the expected effect on long-term outcomes so small as to be undetectable. That is, if the program reached half the targeted audience, changed attitudes among half of those it reached, half of those people changed their behavior, and half of those experienced improved health outcomes, then only one-sixteenth of the initial target audience would be expected to experience the desired health outcome.

The national program office provided state and local offices with software to record and analyze client data on these measures and produce tailored federal and state reports. In contrast, lacking standard reporting on program activities or client outcomes, the Eisenhower program had to conduct a special evaluation study to obtain such data. The evaluation contractor surveyed the state program coordinators to learn what types of training activities teachers were enrolled in and surveyed teachers to learn about their training experiences and practices. The evaluation contractor drew on characteristics identified with high-quality instruction in the research literature to define measures of quality for this study.", "In contrast, EPA and CDC developed guidance on how to plan and conduct program evaluations and encouraged state and local offices to assess their own individual efforts.  To measure the effects of EPA\u2019s enforcement and compliance assurance activities, the agency developed a performance profile of 11 sets of performance measures to assess the activities undertaken (including inspections and enforcement, as well as compliance assistance), changes in the behavior of regulated entities, and progress toward achieving environmental and health objectives. One set of measures targets the environmental or health effects of compliance assistance that must be further specified to apply to the type of assistance and relevant industry or sector.

At the time of our interview, NSPY had fielded three waves of interviews to assess initial and cumulative responses to the campaign but planned additional follow-up.

Program or evaluation staff can observe (directly or from documents) the use of skills learned in a workshop\u2014for example, a mother\u2019s explaining to another nonparticipating mother about the need to wash hands before food preparation.

Evidence of compliance can come from observations during follow-up visits to facilities that had received on-site compliance assistance or from tracking data that the audience may be required to report for regulatory enforcement purposes. For example, after a workshop for dry cleaners about the permits needed to meet air quality regulations, EPA could examine data on how many of the attendees applied for such permits within 6 months after the workshop.

In addition, the programs recommended caution in using self-reports of knowledge or behavior changes, encouraging evaluators\u2014rather than participants\u2014to assess change.", "Carefully wording questions can encourage participants to candidly record unpopular or negative views and can lessen the likelihood of their giving socially desirable responses.

These materials also encourage avoidance of  value-laden terms. Questions about potentially embarrassing situations might be preceded by a statement that acknowledges that this happens to everyone at some time.", "To reassure respondents, agencies also used the survey setting and administration to provide greater privacy in answering the questions. Evaluation guidance encourages collecting unsigned evaluation forms in a box at the end of the program, unless, of course, individual follow-up is desired. Because the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign was dealing with much more sensitive issues than most surveys, its evaluation took several steps to reassure respondents and improve the quality of the data it collected. Agency officials noted that decisions about survey design and collecting quality data involve numerous issues such as consent, parental presence, feasibility, mode, and data editing procedures. In this case, they chose a panel study with linked data from youths and one parent or guardian collected over three administrations. In addition, they found that obtaining cooperation from a representative sample of schools with the frequency required by the evaluation was not feasible.  So the evaluation team chose to survey households in person instead of interviewing youths at school or conducting a telephone survey.", "Hoping to improve the quality of sensitive responses, the surveyors promised confidentiality and provided respondents with a certificate of confidentiality from HHS. In addition, the sensitive questions were self- administered with a touch-screen laptop computer. All sensitive questions and answer categories appeared on the laptop screen and were spoken to the respondent by a recorded voice through earphones. Respondents chose responses by touching the laptop screen. This audio computer- assisted self-interview instrument was likely to obtain more honest answers about drug use, because respondents entered their reports without their answers being observed by the interviewer or their parents.

By asking for a detailed log of what participants ate the day before, EFNEP sought to obtain relatively objective information to compare with nutrition guidelines. By repeating this exercise at the beginning and end of the program, EFNEP obtained more credible evidence than by asking participants whether they had adopted desired practices, such as eating less fat and more fruit and vegetables.", "The Eisenhower evaluation also relied on asking about very specific behaviors to minimize subjectivity and potential bias. First, evaluators analyzed detailed descriptions of their professional development activities along characteristics identified as important to quality in prior research\u2014 such as length and level of involvement. Thus, they avoided asking teachers to judge the quality of their professional development activities. Second, teachers were surveyed at three points in time to obtain detailed information on their instructional practices during three successive school years. Teachers were asked to complete extensive tables on the content and pedagogy used in their course; then the evaluators analyzed whether these represented high standards and effective instructional approaches as identified in the research literature. The evaluators then compared teacher-reported instructional practices before and after their professional development training to assess change on key dimensions of quality.", "Some cooperative extension guidance noted that pretest-posttest comparison of self-report results may not always provide accurate assessment of program effects, because participants may have limited knowledge at the beginning of the program that prevents them from accurately assessing baseline behaviors. For example, before instruction on the sources of certain vitamins, participants may inaccurately assess the adequacy of their own consumption levels. The \u201cpost-then-pre\u201d design can address this problem by asking participants to report at the end of the program, when they know more about their behavior, both then and as it was before the program. Evidently, participants may also be more willing to admit to certain inappropriate behaviors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Use Program Logic Models to Show Links to Unmeasured Long-Term Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Assessing long-term social or health outcomes that were expected to take more than 2 to 3 years to develop was beyond the scope of most of these programs. Only EPA developed an approach for measuring long-term outcomes, such as the environmental effects of desired behavior change in cases where they can be seen relatively quickly. In most instances, programs measured only short-term and intermediate outcomes, which they claimed would contribute to achieving these ultimate benefits. Several programs used logic models to demonstrate their case; some drew on associations established in previous research. The Eisenhower and NIDA evaluations took special effort to track participants long enough to observe desired intermediate outcomes.", "EFNEP routinely measures intermediate behavioral outcomes of improved nutritional intake but does not regularly assess long-term outcomes of nutritional or health status, in part because they can take many years to develop. Instead, the program relies on the associations established in medical research between diet and heart disease and certain cancers, for example, to explain how it expects to contribute to achieving disease- reduction goals. Specifically, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) and Virginia cooperative extension staff developed a model to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the health- promoting benefits of its EFNEP program. The study used equations estimating the health benefits of the program\u2019s advocated nutritional changes for each of 10 nutrition-related diseases (such as colorectal cancer) from medical consensus reports. The study then used program data on the number of participants who adopted the whole set of targeted behaviors to calculate the expected level of benefits, assuming they maintained the behaviors for 5 years.", "EPA provided regional staff with guidance that allows them to estimate environmental benefits from pollution reduction in specific cases of improved compliance with EPA\u2019s regulations. To capture and document the environmental results and benefits of concluded enforcement cases, EPA developed a form for regional offices to record their actions taken and pollutant reductions achieved. The guidance provides steps, formulas, and look-up tables for calculating pollutant reduction or elimination for specific industries and types of water, air, or solid waste regulations. EPA regional staff are to measure average concentrations of pollutants before a specific site becomes compliant and to calculate the estimated total pollutant reduction in the first year of postaction compliance. Where specific pollution-reduction measures can be aggregated across sites, EPA can measure effects nationally and show the contribution to agencywide pollution-reduction goals. In part because these effects occur in the short term, EPA was unique among our cases in having developed an approach for measuring the effects of behavior change.", "Logic models helped cooperative extension programs and the evaluation of ONDCP\u2019s media campaign identify their potential long-term effects and the route through which they would be achieved. The University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension guidance encourages the use of logic models to link investments to results. They aim to help projects clarify linkages among program components; focus on short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes; and plan appropriate data collection and analysis.  The guidance suggests measuring outcomes over which the program has a fair amount of control and considering, for any important long-term outcome, whether it will be attained if the other outcomes are achieved. Figure 2 depicts a generic logic model for an extension project, showing how it can be linked to long-term social or environmental goals.", "The evaluation of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign followed closely the logic of how the program was expected to achieve its desired outcomes, and its logic models show how the campaign contributes to ONDCP\u2019s drug-use reduction goals. For example, the campaign had specific hypotheses about the multiple steps through which exposure to the media campaign message would influence attitudes and beliefs, which would then influence behavior. Thus, evaluation surveys tapped various elements of youths\u2019 attitudes and beliefs about drug use and social norms, as well as behaviors that are hypothesized to be influenced by\u2014or to mediate the influence of\u2014the campaign\u2019s message. In addition, NIDA plans to follow for 2 to 3 years those who had been exposed to the campaign to learn how the campaign affected their later behavior. Figure 3 shows the multiple steps in the media campaign\u2019s expected influence and how personal factors affect the process.", "Following program participants for years to learn about the effects on long-term outcomes for specific individuals exceeded the scope of most of these programs; only the formal evaluation studies of the Eisenhower and ONDCP programs did this. It can be quite costly to repeatedly survey a group of people or track individuals\u2019 locations over time and may require several attempts in order to obtain an interview or completed survey. The Eisenhower evaluation employed a couple of techniques that helped reduce survey costs. First, the evaluation increased the time period covered by the surveys by surveying teachers twice in one year: first about their teaching during the previous school year and then about activities in the current school year. By surveying teachers in the following spring about that school year, the evaluators were able to learn about three school years in the space of 1-1/2 actual years. Second, the case study design helped reduce survey costs by limiting the number of locations the evaluation team had to revisit. Concentrating their tracking efforts in 10 sites also allowed the team to increase the sample of teachers and, thus, be more likely to detect small effects on teaching behavior."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Control for External Influences or Assess Their Combined Effects", "paragraphs": ["Most of the evaluations we reviewed assumed that program exposure or participation led to the observed behavioral changes and did not attempt to control the influence of external factors. However, in order to make credible claims that these programs were responsible for a change in behavior, the evaluation design had to go beyond associating program exposure with outcomes to rule out the influence of other explanations. NIDA\u2019s evaluation used statistical controls and other techniques to limit the influence of other factors on attitudes and behaviors, while Eisenhower, CDC, and EPA encouraged assessment of the combined effect of related activities aimed at achieving the same goals.", "EFNEP\u2019s evaluation approach paired program exposure with before-and- after program measures of outcomes to show a change that was presumed to stem from the program. Where the recommended behavior is very specific and exclusive to a program, it can be argued that the program was probably responsible for its adoption. An EFNEP program official explained that because program staff work closely with participants to address factors that could impede progress, they are comfortable using the data to assess their effectiveness.", "Many factors outside ONDCP\u2019s media campaign were expected to influence youths\u2019 drug use, such as other anti-drug programs and youths\u2019 willingness to take risks, parental attitudes and behavior, peer attitudes and behavior, and the availability of and access to drugs. NIDA\u2019s evaluation used several approaches to limit the effects of other factors on the behavioral outcomes it was reporting. First, to distinguish this campaign from other anti-drug messages in the environment, the campaign used a distinctive message to create a \u201cbrand\u201d that would provide a recognizable element across advertisements in the campaign and improve recall of the campaign. The evaluation\u2019s survey asked questions about recognition of this brand, attitudes, and drug use so the analysis could correlate attitudes and behavior changes with exposure to this particular campaign.", "Second, NIDA\u2019s evaluation used statistical methods to help limit the influence of other factors on the results. The evaluation lacked a control group that was not exposed, since the campaign ran nationally, or baseline data on the audience\u2019s attitudes before the campaign began, with which to compare the survey sample\u2019s reaction. Thus, the evaluation chose to compare responses to variation in exposure to the campaign\u2014comparing those with high exposure to those with low exposure\u2014to assess its effects. This is called a dose-response design which assesses how risk of disease increases with increasing doses or exposure. This approach presumes that the advertisements were effective if you were more likely to adopt the promoted attitudes or behaviors as you saw more of them.", "However, because the audience rather than the evaluator determined how many advertisements they saw, it is not a random selection process, and other factors related to drug use may have influenced both audience viewing habits and drug-related attitudes and behaviors. To limit the influence of preexisting differences among the exposure groups on the results, the NIDA evaluation controlled for their influence by using a special statistical method called propensity scoring. This controls for any correlation between program exposure and risk factors for drug use, such as gender, ethnicity, strength of religious feelings, and parental substance abuse, as well as school attendance and participation in sensation-seeking activities. This statistical technique requires detailed data on large numbers of participants and sophisticated analysis resources.", "Some information campaigns are intertwined or closely associated with another program or activity aimed at the same goals. Both Eisenhower and the other programs fund teachers\u2019 professional development activities that vary in quality, yet they found no significant difference in quality by funding source in their sample. So the evaluation focused instead on assessing the effect of high-intensity activities\u2014regardless of funding source\u2014on teaching practice. EPA\u2019s Compliance Assistance program, for example, helps regulated entities comply with regulations along with its regulatory enforcement responsibilities\u2014a factor not lost on the entities that are regulated. EPA\u2019s dual role raises the question of whether any observed improvements in compliance result from assistance efforts or the implied threat of inspections and sanctions. EPA measures the success of its compliance assistance efforts together with those of incentives that encourage voluntary correction of violations to promote compliance and reductions in pollution.", "An alternative evaluation approach acknowledged the importance of combining information dissemination with other activities to the total program design and assessed the outcomes of the combined activities. This approach, exemplified by CDC and the public health community, encourages programs to adopt a comprehensive set of reinforcing media and regulatory and other community-based activities to produce a more powerful approach to achieving difficult behavior change. The proposed evaluations seek not to limit the influence of these other factors but to assess their combined effects on reducing tobacco use. CDC\u2019s National Tobacco Control Program uses such a comprehensive approach to obtain synergistic effects, making moot the issue of the unique contribution of any one program activity. Figure 4 depicts the model CDC provided to help articulate the combined, reinforcing effects of media and other community-based efforts on reducing tobacco use."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Interest, Collaboration, Available Information and Expertise Supported These Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["Agencies initiated most of these evaluation efforts in response to congressional interest and questions about program results.

The Congress encouraged school-based education reform to help students meet challenging academic standards with the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act of 1994. Concerned about the quality of professional development to update teaching practices needed to carry out those reforms, the Congress instituted a number of far-reaching changes and mandated an evaluation for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. The formal 3-year evaluation sought to determine whether and how Eisenhower-supported activities, which constitute the largest federal effort dedicated to supporting educator professional development, contribute to national efforts to improve schools and help achieve agency goals.", "The Congress has also been actively involved in the development and oversight of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. It specified the program effort in response to nationwide rises in rates of youths\u2019 drug use and mandated an evaluation of that effort. ONDCP was asked to develop a detailed implementation plan and a system to measure outcomes of success and report to the Congress within 2 years on the effectiveness of the campaign, based on those measurable outcomes. ONDCP contracted for an evaluation through NIDA to ensure that the evaluation used the best research design and was seen as independent of the sponsoring agency. ONDCP requested reports every 6 months on program effectiveness and impact. However, officials noted that this reporting schedule created unrealistically high congressional expectations for seeing results when the program does not expect to see much change in 6 months.", "Congressional interest in sharpening the focus of cooperative extension activities led to installing national goals that were to focus the work and encourage the development of performance goals. The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 gave states authority to set priorities and required them to solicit input from various stakeholders. The act also encouraged USDA to address high-priority concerns with national or multistate significance. Under the act, states are required to develop plans of work that define outcome goals and describe how they will meet them. Annual performance reports are to describe whether states met their goals and to report their most significant accomplishments. CSREES draws on these reports of state outcomes to describe how they help meet USDA\u2019s goals. State extension officials noted that the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, as well as increased accountability pressures from their stakeholders, created a demand for evaluations.", "EFNEP\u2019s performance reporting system was also initiated in response to congressional interest and is used to satisfy this latter act\u2019s requirements. USDA staff noted that the House Committee on Agriculture asked for data in 1989 to demonstrate the impact of the program to justify the funding level. On the basis of questions from congressional staff, program officials and extension partners formed a national committee that examined the kinds of information that had already been gathered to respond to stakeholders and developed standard measures of desired client improvements.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, with input from ONDCP, designed the evaluation of the campaign and drew on an expert panel of advisers in drug abuse prevention and media studies. The evaluation was carried out by a partnership between Westat\u2014bringing survey and program evaluation expertise\u2014and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication\u2014bringing expertise in media studies.

USDA staff noted that in the early 1990s, in response to congressional inquiries about EFNEP\u2019s effectiveness, a national committee was formed to develop a national reporting system for data on program results. The committee held an expert panel with various USDA nutrition policy experts, arranged for focus groups, and involved state and county EFNEP representatives and others from across the country. The committee started by identifying the kinds of information the states had already gathered to respond to state and local stakeholders\u2019 needs and then identified other questions to be answered. The committee developed and tested the behavior checklist and dietary analysis methodology from previous nutrition measurement efforts.

This influences whether and how the programs are evaluated\u2014what questions are asked and what data are collected\u2014as those who helped define the program and its goals have a stake in how to evaluate it. State extension evaluator staff also counted their relationships with their peers in other states as key partnerships that provided peer support and technical assistance.

Agency officials indicated that the evaluation was strongly influenced by the \u201ctheory of reasoned action\u201d perspective to explain behavioral change. This perspective assumes that intention is an important factor in determining behavior and that intentions are influenced by attitudes and beliefs. Exposure to the anti-drug messages is thus expected to change attitudes, intentions, and ultimately behavior. Similarly, CDC officials indicated that they learned a great deal about conducting and evaluating health promotion programs from their experience with HIV-AIDS prevention demonstration programs conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
