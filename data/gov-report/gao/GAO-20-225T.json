In December 2017, GAO reported that TSA has taken steps to enhance its foreign airport assessments. Since that time, TSA has developed a tool to better track and address foreign airport vulnerabilites. In addition, TSA reviews security directives and emergency amendments it issues to address security concerns. However, TSA's review process does not fully define how to coordinate with industry representatives and it has not determined if it is appropriate to incorporate the security measures of many longstanding directives into air carrier security programs in accordance with TSA policy. In October 2019, GAO recommended, and TSA officals agreed, that TSA better define how to coordinate with air carriers when reviewing directives and when to incorporate directives into security programs.", "Passenger screening rules. TSA develops screening rules by considering current intelligence and other factors to identify passengers who fall within the scope of the rules for enhanced screening. GAO found that TSA coordinates rules reviews through quarterly meetings and notifies an expanded set of DHS and TSA stakeholders of rule changes as called for by the Act. TSA tracks some data on rule implementation but does not comprehensively measure rule effectiveness. In its draft report, GAO recommended that TSA explore additional data sources for measuring the effectiveness of its rules. TSA is currently reviewing this recommendation.", "Aviation screening technologies. GAO found that TSA does not ensure that screening technologies continue to meet detection requirements after they have been deployed to airports. According to officials, the agency uses certification\u2014a step in the test and evaluation process\u2014to confirm that technologies meet detection requirements before they are deployed to airports, and calibration of the technologies to confirm that technologies are at least minimally operational while in use at airports. While these processes serve important purposes, performance can degrade over time. In its draft report, GAO recommended that TSA implement a process to ensure technologies continue to meet detection requirements after deployment. TSA is currently reviewing this recommendation.", "Surface transportation pipeline security . In December 2018, GAO identified some weaknesses and made recommendations to strengthen TSA's management of key aspects of its pipeline security program. For example, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies\u2014such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise\u2014necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. GAO recommended, and TSA concurred, that TSA develop a strategic workforce plan. As of October 2019, TSA has not yet fully addressed this recommendation.

Further details on our scope and methodology are available  within each of our published products. In addition, we regularly followed  up with relevant officials to solicit updated information on agency actions  taken in response to our recommendations. For our ongoing work on the  security of public areas, we reviewed and analyzed the best practices and  recommendations cited in the 2017 Public Area Security National  Framework.

In the last 2 years, we issued reports on  TSA\u2019s foreign airport and air carrier inspection programs (December  2017), assessments of Cuban aviation security (July 2018), and TSA\u2019s  process for reviewing security directives and emergency amendments  that apply at last point of departure airports (October 2019).", "Foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections. In  December 2017, we reported that TSA had taken steps to enhance its  foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections since 2011,  including aligning resources based on risk, resolving airport access  issues, making evaluations more comprehensive, and creating  operational efficiencies. For example, we found that TSA had  implemented targeted foreign airport assessments in locations where risk  was high and developed a system to strengthen its data analysis  capabilities. However, we also found that TSA\u2019s database for tracking  the resolution status of security deficiencies did not have comprehensive  data on security deficiencies\u2019 root causes and corrective actions. In  addition, the database lacked adequate categorization mechanisms such  as capturing subcategories that would better explain the root causes of  security deficiencies. We recommended, among other things, that TSA  fully capture and more specifically categorize data on the root causes of  security deficiencies that it identifies and corrective actions. To implement  this recommendation, TSA developed a tool to capture airport  vulnerability data and provided training to staff in the use of the tool and  developed guidance that delineates updated categories for root causes in  its data systems.", "Cuban aviation security. In July 2018, we reported on TSA\u2019s efforts to  ensure the security of air carrier operations between the United States  and Cuba. We found that TSA\u2019s inspections and assessments in Cuba  generally followed standard operating procedures, but TSA did not  inspect all air carriers at its own established frequency. We recommended  that TSA improve its ability to identify certain air carriers requiring  inspection in Cuba and develop and implement a tool that more reliably  tracks their operations between the United States and Cuba. In response  to our recommendation and as required under the TSA Modernization  Act, TSA developed several tools and processes that corroborate and  validate flight schedule data. For example, TSA developed a tool to  analyze aggregate flight data and validate or identify service to the United  States from international locations and began issuing monthly reports on  unscheduled operations to its inspectors responsible for Cuba. By taking  these steps, TSA is better able to identify operations requiring inspection  and corroborate and validate flight schedule data.", "Security directives and emergency amendments. When threat  information or vulnerabilities at foreign airports indicate an immediate  need for air carriers to implement additional security measures, TSA may  issue new or revise existing security directives (for domestic air carriers)  and emergency amendments (for foreign air carriers). The TSA  Modernization Act includes a provision for us to review the effectiveness  of the TSA process to update, consolidate, or revoke security directives,  emergency amendments, and other policies related to international  aviation security at last point of departure airports. As of March 2019,  there were 46 security directives and emergency amendments (i.e.,  directives) in effect related to air carrier operations at foreign airports.", "Earlier this month, we reported that TSA reviews directives, but its  process does not fully define how to coordinate with industry  representatives and TSA has not determined if it is appropriate to  incorporate the security measures of many longstanding directives into air  carrier security programs in accordance with TSA policy.  Representatives from four domestic air carriers stated that coordination  with TSA on directives has improved. However, representatives from six  air carriers and two associations indicated that TSA has issued revised  directives that are vague or difficult to implement because TSA did not  sufficiently involve them in the review process. This contributed to TSA  officials offering different interpretations of aircraft cabin search  requirements. Further, TSA policy states that directives are not intended  to be permanent and are expected to eventually be canceled or  incorporated into security programs. Our analysis found that TSA issued  more than one half (25) of the directives prior to 2014, meaning they have  been in effect for more than 5 years. Several have been in effect for more  than 10 years. We recommended, among other things, that TSA better  define how to coordinate with air carriers when reviewing directives and  when to cancel or incorporate longstanding security directives and  emergency amendments into security programs. TSA agreed with our  recommendations and plans to develop a process for more formal and  consistent coordination with air carrier and industry association  stakeholders and consideration of directives for cancellation or  incorporation into security programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Created a Domestic Aviation Security Working Group to Develop and Update Leading Practices with Transportation Security Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["Public area security. In November 2013, an armed individual entered  the Los Angeles International Airport, firing multiple shots killing a  transportation security officer and injuring two others and a passenger. As  a result of this and subsequent airport attacks, TSA co-hosted a series of  security summits with stakeholders and published the Public Area  Security National Framework in May 2017 outlining a series of best  practices and recommendations to secure airport pubic areas. The TSA  Modernization Act requires TSA and the DHS Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency to establish a public area security working  group to promote collaboration between TSA and public and private  stakeholders to develop non-binding recommendations for enhancing  security in public areas of transportation facilities. The Act also requires  TSA to periodically share best practices developed by TSA and  transportation stakeholders related to protecting public spaces of  transportation infrastructure from emerging threats.", "In March 2019, TSA officials established the public area security working  group to engage with stakeholders to validate and update the best  practices that were developed in the 2017 Public Area Security National  Framework.

Recent incidents involving aviation workers misusing  their access privileges have heightened concerns regarding the risk of  insider threats at airports. TSA estimated in 2018 that there were  approximately 1.8 million people with unescorted access to secured areas  of the nation\u2019s airports. We have ongoing work examining the actions  TSA, airport operators, and air carriers have taken to mitigate concerns  regarding insider threats at airports and the extent to which TSA\u2019s Insider  Threat Program is guided by a strategic plan. Additionally, the TSA  Modernization Act requires TSA, in consultation with the Aviation Security  Advisory Committee to conduct a study examining the cost and feasibility  to airports, airlines, and TSA of implementing enhanced employee  inspection measures at all access points between non-secured areas and  secured areas of certain airports.
