These reports describe the event, outcomes, and how  participation at the event enhanced utilization of small businesses for  research and development efforts. The reports are also used internally as  market research for future opportunities.", "Internal control standards call for management to use quality information  to make informed decisions and to define objectives in specific and  measurable terms so that performance toward achieving those objectives  can be assessed. Management should also determine whether  performance measures for the objectives are appropriate for evaluating  performance. Once performance measures are defined, management  should then establish and operate monitoring activities that allow them to  evaluate the effectiveness of the internal control system. Establishing  performance measures and developing a plan to capture and monitor  information on its small business engagement would help ensure Army  Futures Command is not missing opportunities to make informed  management and investment decisions for its research and development  efforts. Establishing these measures and a plan to monitor how the  command assesses small business engagement would also help it to  evaluate the overall effectiveness of its small business engagement in  providing support to the warfighter and identifying which small business  efforts have been most effective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The establishment of Army Futures Command represents a considerable  change to how the Army develops new weapon systems and prepares for  the future. While Army Futures Command is still finalizing how it will  operate, it is already engaging with small businesses in various ways.  However, the command could better manage these efforts. In particular,  formalizing coordination roles and responsibilities with Army organizations  that already have small business experience, such as the Army Office of  Small Business Programs, would allow the command to leverage  additional expertise as it pertains to small business engagement for  research and development.", "In addition, Army Futures Command does not systematically track  engagement across the command. By tracking this activity, the command  could more effectively oversee and manage overall small business  engagement.", "Finally, while Army Futures Command officials consider engaging with  small businesses critical to the success of modernization, it has not yet  developed performance measures to assess the effectiveness of its small  business engagement nor has it developed a plan for systematically  assessing its efforts. Establishing performance measures, and using them  to assess small business engagement, would provide the command with  information to evaluate, and potentially enhance, its engagement with  small businesses to help accomplish its research and development  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations to the Secretary of the Army.", "The Secretary of the Army should direct the Commanding General of  Army Futures Command to formalize coordination roles and  responsibilities for small business engagement in support of research and  development with relevant Army entities.

This report (1) describes what analyses, if any, the  Army conducted to determine the effect of its modernization initiatives on  small businesses; (2) describes how Army Futures Command is engaging  with small businesses to support research and development efforts and  assesses how it is coordinating with other relevant Army organizations;  and (3) assesses how Army Futures Command plans to track and  measure the performance of its engagement with small businesses to  support research and development efforts.", "We analyzed research and development contract awards and obligations  made during fiscal years 2013 through 2017 for the Army. The data are  presented in the background as it is prior to the establishment of Army  Futures Command in 2018. For the number of contracts, we used the  number of new base contract awards for research and development. For  the obligations, we analyzed both newly awarded base contracts and  associated orders under indefinite-delivery contracts since funds would  be obligated at the order level. The obligations in this analysis include  only those made during the fiscal year the contract was awarded. To  identify and analyze contracts awarded during that time period, we  requested data in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation  database from the Army. The Army used the product and service codes  for research and development to extract the relevant data for fiscal years  2013 through 2017. The data also included contracts awarded through  the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology  Transfer programs for that time period and business size and registered  location. We excluded foreign military sales obligations. We did not  include subcontractor data. We obtained the funding codes for  organizations that are transitioning to Army Futures Command, which  includes the former Army Research, Development, and Engineering  Command and the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command,  portions of which are transitioning to the new command. To determine the  proportion of contracts and associated obligations that supported these  organizations, we used their funding codes to identify the number of  contracts and associated obligations during our selected time period. To  assess the reliability of the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation data, we electronically tested for missing data, outliers, and  inconsistent coding. Based on these steps, we determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for identifying and analyzing Army contracts awarded  from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 for research and development efforts  and their obligations. We obtained data on grants, cooperative  agreements, and other types of agreements using the Defense  Assistance Awards Data System. We conducted initial analysis on the  data and discussed reliability and validity of the data with agency officials.  As a result, we determined that the data were not sufficiently reliable for  the purpose of this engagement and we excluded them from our review.", "To describe analyses the Army conducted on the potential effect  modernization efforts could have on small businesses, we collected and  reviewed available studies and analyses the Army conducted. We  reviewed the Army\u2019s science and technology portfolio analysis, studies  related to the establishment and future organizational structure of Army  Futures Command, and the Army\u2019s modernization strategy to determine if  the Army analyzed how small businesses could be affected.", "To describe how Army Futures Command is engaging with small  businesses to support research and development efforts, we reviewed  policies, procedures, and guidance from the Department of Defense,  Department of the Army, Army Futures Command, and other relevant  Army organizations on small business engagement. We also reviewed  relevant sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as well as  Defense and Army supplements to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, to  understand the framework for small business participation in support of  research and development efforts. We also reviewed relevant statutes,  regulations, and policies regarding research and development and small  business programs. We collected and analyzed documentation on how  Army Futures Command engages with small businesses, including its  roles and responsibilities, outreach efforts, and award documentation as  well as those of its subordinate components. To assess how Army  Futures Command coordinates with other Army organizations, we  reviewed policy documentation, such as a memorandum of understanding  on coordinating contract support and for small business engagement, in  addition to operational orders outlining roles and responsibilities. We  assessed the information we collected against Federal Standards for  Internal Control related to organizational structure, reporting lines, roles  and responsibilities, and using quality information.", "To assess how Army Futures Command plans to track and measure its  engagement with small businesses, we reviewed policies from the  Department of Defense and Army on engagement with small businesses.", "To understand how Army Futures Command plans to track its small  business engagement, we reviewed policy documentation from the  command, operational orders, briefs and memoranda.

In order to assess any  performance measures Army Futures Command plans to use to evaluate  its small business engagement, we reviewed available documentation on  the establishment of the command. We also reviewed documentation  from organizations transitioning to Army Futures Command to determine  how these organizations previously monitored and evaluated their small  business engagement. In addition, we assessed the information we  collected against Federal Standards for Internal Control related to  establishing monitoring activities, using quality information, defining  objectives, and evaluating results.", "To more completely understand the small business engagement efforts of  the new command, we interviewed officials from various Army offices,  including the Office of the Under Secretary of the Army, Army Futures  Command, organizations transitioning to the new command, Army Office  of Small Business Programs, members of the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, and  Army Contracting Command. We also met with two private sector entities  the Army has coordinated with for outreach to small businesses. These  entities have experience in engaging small businesses both in the private  sector and for government programs and discussed with us the concerns  and challenges small businesses have in working with the government.  These views are not generalizable but provide perspective on matters  relevant to the Army\u2019s efforts to engage with small businesses.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to July 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
