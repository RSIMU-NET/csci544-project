According to industry representatives, China and Russia produce enough lithium-7 to meet demand from U.S. pressurized water reactors, a type of commercial nuclear power reactor that requires lithium-7 for safe operation. However, China's continued supply may be reduced by its own growing demand, according to an expert that is familiar with China's plans. Specifically, China is building several pressurized water reactors and developing a new type of reactor that will require 1,000s of kilograms of lithium-7 to operate, rather than the 300 kilograms needed annually for all 65 U.S. pressurized water reactors. Relying on two producers of lithium-7 leaves U.S. pressurized water reactors vulnerable to lithium-7 supply disruptions.", "No federal entity has taken stewardship responsibility for assessing and managing risks to the lithium-7 supply, but DOE is taking some steps. Risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks, communication of risks to stakeholders, and then taking steps to manage the risks, according to federal standards for internal control. Officials at DOE, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) told GAO they view lithium-7 as a commercial commodity for which industry is responsible. Industry representatives told GAO that they had no concerns about the lithium-7 supply, as they have experienced no problems in obtaining it. But GAO learned that industry representatives may not be familiar with all the supply risks. Notwithstanding, DOE plans to set aside 200 kilograms of lithium-7 and is funding research on lithium-7 production methods. DOE also studied lithium-7 supply and demand and concluded that no further action is needed. However, GAO found several shortcomings in its study, including that DOE underestimated the amount of lithium-7 used domestically. Industry estimates show that about 300 kilograms of lithium-7 are used annually in the United States, whereas DOE estimated that 200 kilograms are used annually. This and other shortcomings make it unclear if DOE's conclusion is correct that no additional action is needed.", "Based on information from agency officials and industry representatives, GAO identified three options to mitigate a potential lithium-7 shortage: (1) building a domestic reserve is a low-cost option that could help in the short-term; (2) building a domestic production capability is a longer-term solution that could eliminate lithium-7 imports, but take about 5 years and cost $10-12 million, according to NNSA; and (3) reducing pressurized water reactors' reliance on lithium-7 is another longer-term solution, but may require years of research and changes in how reactors are operated."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy ensure a stable future supply of lithium-7 by directing the Isotope Program to take on a stewardship role for lithium-7 by taking steps, including fully assessing risks and accurately determining domestic demand.

Of the 100 commercial  nuclear power reactors in the United States, these 65 are pressurized  water reactors, a type of reactor that requires lithium hydroxide to be  added to the water that cools it. The lithium hydroxide is used in  pressurized water reactors to prevent the cooling water from becoming  acidic due to the addition of other chemicals that are critical to managing  the nuclear reaction. Without the lithium hydroxide, the cooling water\u2019s  acidity would increase the rate of corrosion of pipes and other  infrastructure in the reactor\u2014possibly causing them to fail. Lithium  hydroxide is made using lithium-7, an isotope of lithium that does not  interfere with the nuclear reaction within a reactor core. Lithium-7 is also  used in special purifiers called demineralizers that extract radioactive  material and contaminants from the cooling water. Low enriched lithium- 7 was produced in the United States by the Y-12 National Security  Complex (Y-12) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, from 1955 to 1963 as a by- product of producing lithium-6, which is used in the nuclear weapons  program. DOE has not needed to produce additional lithium-6 since that  time and, according to Y-12 officials, the department sold the resulting  supply of low-enriched lithium-7 on the open market, except for a limited  quantity.lithium-7.

Lithium-6 was enriched  in the United States by separating it from lithium-7 using a column  exchange process, called COLEX, that required very large quantities of  mercury, which can harm human health and the environment. Y-12 built a  COLEX facility and began operations in 1955 and used it through 1963 to  enrich lithium-6 and lithium-7. Y-12 experienced several problems with  the COLEX process, including equipment failures, worker exposure to  mercury, and mercury contamination of the environment. Y-12 shut the  COLEX facility down in 1963 and has not operated it since then.

Lithium hydroxide, made  with lithium-7 rather than lithium-6, is added to the cooling water to  reduce the acidity of the water and boric acid. Lithium-7 is used rather  than lithium-6 or natural lithium, which contains lithium-6, because lithium- 6 would react with nuclear material in the reactor core to produce tritium,  a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. According to industry representatives,  lithium hydroxide is added directly to the cooling water, via a chemical  feed tank, when a pressurized water reactor is started up after being shut  down, such as after refueling. Lithium-7 is also used in special water  purifiers\u2014called demineralizers\u2014that remove radioactive material and  impurities from the cooling water. Figure 1 shows the flow of water  through a typical pressurized water reactor, though some variations  among reactors may exist.

Because of the secrecy of their weapons programs, China  and Russia\u2019s lithium-7 production capabilities are not fully known,  according to lithium-7 brokers. According to industry representatives,  lithium-7 brokers, and NNSA documents, China and Russia have  produced enough lithium-7 to meet the current U.S. demand, which is not  expected to increase a significant amount in the near future, based on  DOE\u2019s information that shows five new pressurized water reactors  scheduled to begin operating by 2018.

China\u2019s demand is expected to increase because,  according to information from DOE, the International Atomic Energy  Agency, and an expert on nuclear reactors who has met with Chinese  scientists on this topic, China is constructing over 25 pressurized water  reactors that are scheduled to begin operating by 2015. Additionally,  China is planning to build a new type of nuclear power reactor\u2014a molten  salt reactor\u2014that will require dramatically larger amounts of lithium-7 to  operate. China is pursuing the development of two different types of  molten salt reactors, according to the expert, each of which will result in a  reactor that requires 1,000s of kilograms of lithium-7 to operate, rather  than the approximate 300 kilograms (about 660 pounds) annually needed  for all 65 U.S. pressurized water reactors combined, according to lithium- 7 brokers. China\u2019s first molten salt reactor is expected to be finished by 2017, and the second reactor by 2020, according to the reactor expert.Furthermore, molten salt reactors require a more pure form of lithium-7\u2014 99.995 percent, or higher\u2014than what is currently produced by China and  Russia, according to the reactor expert and a lithium-7 broker. To obtain  the higher enriched lithium-7, according to the reactor expert who is  familiar with China\u2019s research, China built a small facility that will feed in  lower-enriched lithium-7 and enrich it to the higher level of purity that is  needed. An Isotope Program official suggested to us that China\u2019s new  facility could increase the available supply of lithium-7 for pressurized  water reactors. However, according to the reactor expert, this new facility  may reduce the supply of lithium-7 available for export since it uses  lithium-7 as feedstock. This expert said that China has obtained lithium-7  from its own supplies and has purchased additional lithium-7 from Russia  to enrich in its own facility, possibly making China a net importer of  lithium-7. It is unknown, however, whether China has enough lithium-7 for  its increased nuclear fleet and molten salt reactors, or if it will need to  import additional quantities, which could reduce the available supply of  lithium-7. For example, one lithium-7 broker told us in June of this year  that China had no lithium-7 that it could sell to this broker.", "Russia\u2019s supply of lithium-7, on the other hand, may be largely available  for export because Russia is believed to have very little domestic demand  for lithium-7.

However,  because Russia\u2019s production capacity of lithium-7 is not known, U.S.  utilities cannot be assured that Russia will continue to meet their demand  for lithium-7 as China\u2019s demand increases. For example, one lithium-7  broker told us in June 2013 that he is having difficulty getting lithium-7  from Russia, though he is unsure if it is because Russia is unable to meet  demand or for some other reason.", "The risk of relying on so few producers of lithium-7 leaves the 65  pressurized water reactors in the United States vulnerable to supply  disruptions.

In the case of lithium-7, according to  representatives of two utilities, if not mitigated, a lithium-7 shortage could  possibly lead to the shutdown of one or more pressurized water reactors.  Pressurized water reactors are temporarily shut down to refuel about  every 18 months, after which time lithium-7, in the form of lithium  hydroxide, is added to the cooling water, according to industry  representatives. TVA representatives explained that nuclear reactors are  scheduled for refueling during times when there is low demand for  electricity, such as the spring or fall, when there is less need for heating  or air-conditioning of homes and businesses. During peak times of  electricity use, such as the summer months, commercial nuclear reactors  are critical for maintaining the stability of the electrical grid, according to  industry representatives.

An official in NNSA\u2019s Office of Nuclear Materials  Integration noted that NNSA is responsible for ensuring there is a  sufficient supply of lithium-7 for federal demand but not for industry\u2019s  demand. Furthermore, this official said that utilities are in the electricity  business and should, therefore, assume the responsibility of assessing  and managing risks. This official also stated that, in his view, given the  importance of lithium-7 to the nuclear power industry, the commercial  market would respond by increasing production to bring supply and  demand into balance.

The shortage was  addressed when an interagency committee took on a stewardship role by  researching alternatives and allocating the limited supply, among other  things. In that report, we recommended the Secretary of Energy clarify  which entity has a stewardship role for 17 isotopes that are sold by the  Isotope Program.

Industry  representatives we spoke with said that they have no concerns over the  lithium-7 supply because they have not experienced any supply  problems.

According to DOE\u2019s study, there are several  risks to the lithium-7 supply that could result in a shortage in a matter of  years. Specifically, DOE\u2019s study points out that increasing demand for  lithium-7 from construction of additional pressurized water reactors and  the development of molten salt reactors are risks to the lithium-7 supply  because demand could exceed the supply in a matter of years, if  production does not increase. The study also points out the risks of  relying on two foreign suppliers for lithium-7 and notes that a supply  shortage is a low probability risk, but it is one with high consequence.  DOE\u2019s study also describes several actions that industry could take to  help mitigate a lithium-7 shortage. In its discussions with industry  representatives, representatives identified the following four actions that  the nuclear power industry could take should a shortage of lithium-7  occur:  recycling lithium-7 from the demineralizers; increasing the burnable poisons in the reactor fuel;reducing the acidity of the cooling water to reduce the amount of  lithium-7 needed by using boric acid that is enriched with boron-10,  which would reduce the amount of boric acid added to the cooling  water, thus reducing the acidity; and developing alternative sources of lithium-7, including building a  domestic lithium-7 production capability.", "DOE\u2019s study of lithium-7 also lists two steps the Isotope Program is taking  and concludes that no further action is needed. First, the study states that  the Isotope Program will work with NNSA to prevent its inventory of  contaminated lithium-7 at Y-12 from being disposed of or distributed  without approval from DOE and will request that NNSA retain 200  kilograms (441 pounds) of this inventory to be purified and then sold to  the nuclear power industry in the event of a supply disruption.according to Isotope Program officials, as part of its mission to support  isotope production research and development, the program is also  funding research on enriching lithium-7 without employing the mercury- intensive COLEX method that was previously used. The study concludes  that the listed steps serve as an acceptable short-term strategy for  mitigating the risks of a lithium-7 shortage and concludes that no  additional action is needed.", "Nevertheless, our review found several shortcomings in DOE\u2019s study  regarding its assessment of domestic demand for lithium-7 and the  feasibility of the actions it says industry can take to mitigate the risks of a  supply disruption. First, our review found that DOE\u2019s Isotope Program, as  well as Y-12, underestimated domestic demand for lithium-7. While  studying lithium-7 supply and demand, DOE\u2019s Isotope Program and Y-12  both estimated annual domestic demand for lithium-7 to be about 200  kilograms per year, whereas the lithium-7 brokers estimated domestic  demand to be over 300 kilograms (662 pounds) per year, on average,  from 2008 through 2012. Isotope Program and Y-12 officials told us that  their estimate of 200 kilograms per year includes lithium-7 used in cooling  water, but it does not include lithium-7 used in demineralizers, which the  lithium-7 brokers did account for. Second, DOE\u2019s study concludes that  there is enough lithium-7 in inventory held on-site at reactors to keep the  reactors operating during the approximately 7 months required to purify  Y-12\u2019s lithium-7. However, DOE officials involved in the study said they  did not collect any data from utilities to determine what quantities they  held in inventory, and industry representatives told us that they are not  aware of any entity that keeps records of the amount of lithium-7  inventory held at utilities across the industry. Some industry  representatives also said that there is no standard practice for when to  purchase lithium-7 or how much inventory to have on hand and that they  believe inventory practices vary from utility to utility.", "Regarding the measures the study indicates industry can take to mitigate  a potential lithium-7 supply shortage, our review found that DOE\u2019s study  provides more optimistic assessments than industry\u2019s view about the  challenges involved in implementing these actions. For example, DOE\u2019s  study characterizes the process for recycling lithium-7 from  demineralizers to be straightforward and of low technical risk, and it  states that recycling can be implemented within a year. However,  according to representatives of a utility with whom we spoke, there is no  existing method to retrieve and recycle the lithium-7 from the  demineralizers. According to EPRI representatives who provided  information for DOE\u2019s study, the process is challenging because  extracting lithium-7 from the demineralizers may require a special process  to separate it from the other materials in the demineralizers, some of  which pose radiation risks. In addition, there are also application  challenges to recovering the lithium-7, such as modifying the plants to  implement the process. EPRI representatives estimated it would take  more than a year to develop the technology, and potentially many years  to address the application challenges before this process could be  implemented. Another mitigation option that DOE\u2019s study identifies is  increasing burnable poisons\u2014isotopes added to the nuclear fuel to help  control the nuclear reaction\u2014that would decrease the amount of boron  required in the cooling water, in turn reducing the amount of lithium-7  needed to decrease acidity. The study states that doing so should not  take a long time to implement, based on the premise that the modified  fuel could be changed when plants refuel, which is about every 18  months. EPRI representatives, however, said this would be a longer  process because any given fuel assembly is typically in the reactor for  three operating cycles of 18 months each, which means a fuel assembly  would be in the reactor for a total of about 4\u00bd years before being  replaced. Also, according to NRC officials, a change in the fuel would  require extensive modeling, testing, and regulatory reviews, which could  take considerably longer than 4\u00bd years. As a result of the shortcomings  in DOE\u2019s study, combined with the recent supply problems reported by  brokers, as we previously discussed, it is unclear if its conclusion is  correct that no additional actions need to be taken."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Options Exist to Mitigate a Potential Lithium-7 Shortage", "paragraphs": ["Based on information from government officials and industry  representatives, we identified three options for mitigating a potential  lithium-7 shortage in the near and long term, which could be implemented  by government, industry, or even a committee of federal and industry  stakeholders. The three near- and long-term options are: building a  domestic reserve of lithium-7, building domestic capability to produce  lithium-7, and reducing pressurized water reactors\u2019 reliance on lithium-7.", "The first option\u2014building a domestic reserve of lithium-7\u2014is a relatively  low-cost option and would provide a fixed quantity of lithium-7 that, in the  event of a shortage, could be used until a long-term solution is  implemented. Establishing a domestic reserve would involve building up a  stockpile of lithium-7 by importing an additional quantity above what is  needed each year, purifying all or a portion of the existing supply of  lithium-7 at Y-12 to make it suitable for use in pressurized water reactors,  or a combination of these two. Stockpiling could be accomplished by  individual utilities or, for example, by a steward that could maintain the  supply for all utilities. Increasing imports to establish a domestic reserve  could be initiated immediately, and the cost would be based on the  market price of lithium-7, which is currently less than $10,000 per  kilogram (about 2.2 lbs). However, stockpiling lithium-7 would have to be  carefully managed to avoid a negative impact on the market\u2014stockpiling  lithium-7 too aggressively could cause the price to increase or otherwise  disrupt the available supply. A second way to help build up a reserve is  the purification of all or a portion of the 1,300 kilograms of lithium-7 at Y- 12. DOE has plans to set aside 200 kilograms of the 1,300 kilograms of  lithium-7 at Y-12, which could be purified and sold to utilities. DOE  estimates it would take about 7 months to purify 200 kilograms and cost  about $3,000 per kilogram for a total cost of about $600,000; purifying the  remainder of the 1,300 kilograms would likely incur additional costs.", "The second option\u2014building a domestic lithium-7 production capability\u2014 is a longer-term solution that would reduce or eliminate the need for  importing supplies, but it would take several years to develop the  technology and construct a production facility. While lithium separation  was done in the United States until 1963 using the COLEX process, DOE  and Y-12 officials told us that the COLEX separation method will not be  used for a new production facility because of the large quantities of  mercury it requires. Officials from DOE and Y-12, as well as industry  representatives, identified several other potential separation techniques  that do not use mercury, such as solvent extraction, a process in which  the components to be separated are preferentially dissolved by a solvent  and are thus separated, and electromagnetic separation, a process that  uses electric and magnetic fields to separate isotopes by their relative  weights. While these techniques have been developed and used to  separate other materials\u2014for example, electromagnetic separation was  used to separate isotopes of uranium\u2014further development of the  techniques specifically for use with lithium-7 would be needed, according  to DOE documentation. In particular, DOE\u2019s Isotope Program is funding a  proposal from scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Y-12 to  conduct research on lithium separation techniques using solvent  extraction processes, which have been used in the pharmaceutical  industry. If successful, according to Y-12, its proposed research would  provide the basis for an industrial process to produce lithium-7. According  to Y-12 officials, the entire research and development process, and the  construction of a pilot facility capable of producing 200 kilograms of  lithium-7 per year, would take about 5 years and cost $10 to $12 million.", "The third option\u2014reducing pressurized water reactors\u2019 reliance on  lithium-7\u2013is also a longer-term option that would generally require  changes in how reactors are operated and may produce only modest  reductions in the use of lithium-7. Four possible changes that could be  made to reactors include the following:", "Lithium-7 can be recycled from used demineralizers. According to  industry representatives, the chemistry required for the recycling  process would be challenging, would require plant modifications, and  may pose risks to workers due to the presence of radioactive  materials. This option would reduce the amount of lithium-7 needed  for demineralizers but not reduce the amount of lithium-7 needed for  the cooling water.", "Potassium hydroxide can be used in lieu of lithium hydroxide in the  cooling water. According to nuclear power industry representatives,  making such a change would require about 10 years of research to  test the resulting changes in the rate of corrosion of pipes and other  infrastructure in the reactor.", "Using enriched boric acid in the cooling water in place of natural boric  acid would require less boric acid to be used, which would reduce the  acidity of the water and result in less lithium-7 being needed.  According to industry representatives, however, enriched boric acid is  expensive, and this change may require plant modifications and would  only modestly reduce the amount of lithium-7 needed.", "The nuclear fuel used in pressurized water reactors could be modified  to reduce the need for boric acid and thus also reduce the amount of  lithium-7 needed. According to industry representatives, however, this  would be expensive and require long-term planning because utilities  typically plan their fuel purchases for refueling 1\u00bd to 4\u00bd years in  advance. According to one utility, changing the fuel could also have  widespread impacts on operations and costs that are difficult to  quantify.", "Industry representatives characterized all four possible changes to  pressurized water reactors for reducing the demand for lithium-7 as  requiring significant modifications to reactor operations at all 65  pressurized water reactors. Furthermore, these possible changes would  need to be studied in more detail to determine the associated cost, time,  and safety requirements before implementation and, if necessary,  approved by NRC, all of which may take several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOE studied the lithium-7 supply and demand situation, including  identifying some supply risks, and is undertaking some actions to help  mitigate a potential shortage, such as setting aside 200 kilograms of  lithium-7 as a reserve. However, relying on two foreign producers to  supply a chemical that is critical to the safe operation of most of the  commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States places their  ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk. Furthermore, the  recent problems some brokers reported in obtaining lithium-7 from Russia  and China, combined with China\u2019s increasing demand for lithium-7  suggest that the potential for a supply problem occurring may be  increasing. DOE has not taken on stewardship responsibility, in part  because lithium-7 it is not in short supply, at which time it could fall under  the Isotope Program\u2019s mission. However, waiting for a critical isotope with  increasing supply risks to become short in supply before taking action  does not appear consistent with the mission of the Isotope Program.  Because no entity has assumed stewardship responsibility for lithium-7,  supply risks may not have been effectively communicated to industry,  which could then weigh the risks and respond appropriately. Furthermore,  there is no assurance that the risks have been fully analyzed and  mitigated, as outlined in federal standards for internal control. Similarly, a  shortage of helium-3 occurred in 2008 because, among other things,  there was no agency with stewardship responsibility to monitor the risks  to helium-3 supply and demand. The shortage was addressed when an  interagency committee took on a stewardship role by researching  alternatives and allocating the limited supply, among other things. Some  DOE officials have described lithium-7 as a commercial commodity used  by industry and, therefore, they assert that industry is responsible for  addressing any supply problems, despite its importance to the electrical  grid; NNSA and NRC concur that industry is responsible. Yet, industry is  not in a position like DOE to be aware of all the risks. DOE has studied  lithium-7 supply and demand to guide its decisions related to lithium-7.  However, its study contains shortcomings, including underestimating the  domestic demand, and may be underestimating the technological  challenges industry will face in trying to adjust to a supply disruption.  These shortcomings bring into question DOE\u2019s conclusion that no  additional actions are needed to mitigate a potential lithium-7 shortage. In  the end, without a full awareness of supply risks and an accurate  assessment of domestic demand, utilities may not be prepared for a  shortage of lithium-7. This leaves the reactors that depend on lithium-7  vulnerable to supply disruptions that, if not addressed, could lead to their  shutdown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure a stable future supply of lithium-7, we recommend that the  Secretary of Energy direct the Isotope Program, consistent with the  program\u2019s mission to manage isotopes in short supply, to take on the  stewardship role by fully assessing supply risks; communicating risks, as  needed, to stakeholders; ensuring risks are appropriately managed; and  fully and accurately determining domestic demand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOE and NRC for review and  comment.

DOE\u2019s written comments on our draft report are  included in appendix I. In an e-mail received August 15, 2013, NRC\u2019s  Audit Liaison in the Office of the Executive Director for Operations stated  that NRC generally agreed with the report\u2019s content and recommendation.  DOE and NRC provided technical comments that we incorporated as  appropriate.", "In its comment letter, DOE concurred with our recommendation and  stated that, in its view, ongoing efforts by DOE\u2019s Isotope Program satisfy  the recommendation. Specifically, DOE\u2019s letter states that to further  address lithium-7 utilization, demand, and inventory management, the  Isotope Program has initiated the development of a more in-depth survey  coordinated directly with the power industry through the Electric Power  Research Institute\u2014a new undertaking that we learned about after  providing a draft of our report to DOE for comment. We believe that this  undertaking is especially important since we found that few people in  industry were aware of the lithium-7 supply risks.", "In its written comments, DOE also states that the report includes several  inaccurate descriptions of the federal role with respect to the response to  lithium-7 availability and demand. Specifically, DOE does not agree with  our characterization that there is a lack of federal stewardship for  assessing and managing risks to the lithium-7 supply. DOE states that it  has been active in assessing and managing supply risks, including  engaging with stakeholders, forming an internal working group, and  identifying actions to be taken to mitigate a shortage.", "We disagree and believe that DOE\u2019s comment letter overstates both the  department\u2019s level of awareness of lithium-7 supply risks and its  involvement in mitigating these risks. At no time during our review did any  DOE official characterize DOE as a steward of lithium-7 or state that the  agency will manage supply risks. Notably, during our review, the Director  of the Facilities and Project Management Division, who manages the  Isotope Program, told us that the Isotope Program is not the steward of  lithium-7, nor should it be. Regarding engagement with stakeholders, we  found that Isotope Program officials were aware of only two of the three  key brokers of lithium-7 until we informed them of the third broker during a  meeting in June 2013\u2014over a year after the program became aware of a  potential lithium-7 supply problem. Moreover, at this same meeting,  program officials were not yet aware of recent lithium-7 supply problems  experienced by two of the three lithium-7 brokers. Regarding mitigation  actions, while DOE states in its comment letter that industry stakeholders  identified actions for consideration should a shortage of lithium-7 occur,  industry stakeholders told us that they were not aware that their input was  being used for a DOE study and would not characterize the actions as  DOE did in its study.", "We also disagree with DOE\u2019s comment letter suggesting that the  shortcomings identified in our report regarding the department\u2019s demand  estimates for lithium-7 were simply due to differences between our  estimates and the DOE internal working group\u2019s estimates as a result of  the demand quantities identified being for specific and different  applications. To identify the actions needed to mitigate a lithium-7  shortage, all the uses of lithium-7 must be considered. By not accounting  for the lithium-7 used in demineralizers, DOE left out an important use of  lithium-7 that may represent about one-third of the total demand for  pressurized water reactors. As DOE engages collaboratively with industry  for ensuring a stable supply of lithium-7, accurately accounting for lithium- 7 demand will be essential.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
