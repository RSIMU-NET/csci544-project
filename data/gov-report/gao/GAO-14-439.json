Specifically, the number of authorized positions across the commands grew from 5,731 in fiscal year 2004 to 10,515 in fiscal year 2013. According to DOD officials, recent and emerging missions have driven up demands at all three functional combatant commands and driven the growth in authorized personnel. In addition, costs to support headquarters operations also increased substantially at the functional combatant commands. Data, in constant fiscal year 2013 dollars, show that the combined costs to support headquarters operations for the commands increased from about $296 million in fiscal year 2001 to more than $1.236 billion in fiscal year 2013. Authorized positions and costs to support headquarters operations at the service component commands supporting the functional combatant commands also increased. Specifically, authorized positions grew from about 6,675 in fiscal year 2002 to about 7,815 in fiscal year 2013, and costs to support headquarters operations increased from about $614 million in fiscal year 2008 to about $657 million in fiscal year 2013.", "DOD's directed reductions to headquarters do not include all resources at the commands, which may affect DOD's ability to achieve significant savings in headquarters operations. In 2013, DOD directed reductions to management headquarters resources in an effort to streamline the department's management. However, GAO found that the department did not have a clear or accurate accounting of the resources being devoted to management headquarters to use as a starting point to track reductions. Officials noted that DOD relied on data self-reported by the commands, and GAO found that these data were potentially inconsistent and did not include the totality of headquarters resources. Specifically, GAO found that less than a quarter of the positions at the functional combatant commands are considered to be management headquarters even though many positions appear to be performing management headquarters functions such as planning, budgeting, and developing policies. As such, more than three quarters of the headquarters positions at the functional combatant commands are potentially excluded from DOD's directed reductions. However, the department does not have any plans to reevaluate the baseline on which the reductions are based, in part because it does not have an alternative source for complete and reliable data. GAO has also concluded that restructuring efforts must be focused on clear goals and consolidation initiatives grounded in accurate and reliable data. Section 904 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 requires that DOD develop and submit a plan for streamlining management headquarters by June 2014. Unless DOD reevaluates its decision to focus reductions to management headquarters and establishes a clearly defined and consistently applied starting point on which to base reductions, the department will be unable to track and reliably report its headquarters reductions and ultimately may not realize significant savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) reevaluate the decision to focus reductions on management headquarters to ensure meaningful savings, (2) set a clearly defined and consistently applied starting point as a baseline for the reductions, and (3) track reductions against the baselines in order to provide reliable accounting of savings and reporting to Congress.

The guidance states  that DOD must continue to reduce the cost of doing business, which  includes reducing the rate of growth in personnel costs and finding further  efficiencies in overhead and headquarters, in its business practices, and  in other support activities. One approach the department has pursued in  recent years to find cost savings is to reduce the footprint of headquarters  staff, such as the combatant commands and their subordinate unified  commands and respective service component commands. This approach  includes establishing personnel baselines, identifying personnel  reductions to achieve efficiencies, instituting caps on authorized civilian  personnel, and limiting service support contract expenditures. Further, in  July 2013, the Secretary of Defense directed a 20 percent cut in  management headquarters spending throughout DOD, to include  spending on government civilian personnel, facilities, and information  technology. The cuts, which apply to all headquarters staff at the  combatant commands and service component commands, are designed  to streamline DOD\u2019s management through efficiencies and elimination of  lower-priority activities.", "Among other constraints, the Budget Control Act of 2011 established requirements for  automatic budget sequestration, setting caps on the levels of DOD spending from 2013 to  2021.

During the course of our review, we found that the  functional combatant commands and service component commands had  different ways of capturing total costs to support headquarters operations.  All of the commands included costs for categories like civilian  compensation, and travel and transportation expenses. However, some  commands included categories such as software for command-specific  systems as well as command-specific equipment. Based on discussions  with DOD officials, it is unclear whether the commands were consistent in  their approaches for identifying and self-reporting the information they  provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Costs and Authorized Positions Are Not Included in DOD\u2019s Planned Headquarters Reductions", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis shows that not all costs and authorized positions are  included in DOD\u2019s planned headquarters reductions and that all of the  functional combatant commands exclude most of their authorized staffs  from management headquarters totals. While the trends we described  earlier in this report include the entire commands, we gathered  information directly from the commands to determine how much of their  organizations they considered management headquarters. We found that  less than a quarter of their personnel are designated as management  headquarters. This designation is critical because the Deputy Secretary of  Defense\u2019s July 2013 memorandum directed a 20 percent reduction to  DOD components\u2019 total management headquarters budgets for fiscal  years 2014 through 2019, including costs for civilian personnel, contract  services, facilities, information technology, and other costs that support  headquarters functions. In addition, the memorandum noted that  organizations should strive for a goal of 20 percent reductions in  authorized government civilian staff at the headquarters as well as a goal  of 20 percent reductions in military personnel billets on management  headquarters staffs.", "On the basis of our analysis of data on authorized positions at the  functional combatant commands and their service component commands,  we found that the commands designate less than a quarter of the total  authorized positions as part of their management headquarters functions.  Specifically, about 2,500 of about 10,500 total authorized positions are  accounted for in the functional commands\u2019 management headquarters  position totals. As a result, a 20 percent reduction to management  headquarters could result in a relatively small cut to the total number of  positions at the three functional combatant commands. Specifically, as  figure 7 shows, a 20 percent reduction to management headquarters  positions means that, combined, the functional combatant commands  would have to eliminate about 500 positions, or less than 5 percent of the  overall authorized positions at the commands.", "Compared to the functional combatant commands, the service  component commands have a larger percentage of authorized positions  included in their management headquarters totals. Based on our analysis  of data on authorized positions at the service component commands,  about 6,000 of about 7,800 total authorized positions are accounted for in  the management headquarters position totals (77 percent). As such, a 20  percent reduction to management headquarters positions means that,  combined, the service component commands would have to eliminate  about 1,200 positions, or about 15 percent of the overall authorized  positions at the commands. This reduction is larger than the 5 percent  reduction that would be required at the functional combatant commands if  the reductions are based on management headquarters totals, as DOD  calculated them.", "We further analyzed data provided by the individual functional combatant  commands to determine what they included in their management  headquarters totals. The proportion of personnel considered to be in  management headquarters positions at the three functional combatant  commands ranged from 20 to 28 percent of their overall personnel based  on their 2013 authorized positions. DOD officials explained that the  positions that are not accounted for in management headquarters  positions perform more operationally focused tasks and functions. For  example, STRATCOM officials stated that positions within the command\u2019s  Joint Functional Component Commands for Global Strike; Intelligence,  Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Integrated Missile Defense; and  Space are not included in the command\u2019s management headquarters  totals because the positions within these components and the missions  they perform are operational in nature. Similarly, TRANSCOM officials  told us that because the Joint Enabling Capabilities Command is a  deployable operational command component, all authorized positions  within this component are excluded from the command\u2019s management  headquarters totals. Moreover, officials at each of the functional  combatant commands told us that some authorized positions within their  headquarters\u2014such as those within the intelligence and operations  directorates\u2014are not considered management headquarters positions  because these positions perform operational tasks and functions.", "Examples of the positions within the individual commands that are  included in management headquarters and those that are not are as  follows:", "About 20 percent of SOCOM\u2019s reported total authorized positions, or  about 800 of 4,100 authorized positions, are included in the  command\u2019s management headquarters position totals.

However, STRATCOM excludes  these personnel from its management headquarters totals because,  according to STRATCOM officials, the headquarters directorates at these  component commands are relatively small and personnel rely heavily on  STRATCOM for support in these functional areas. Moreover, a majority of  the positions in SOCOM\u2019s research, development, and acquisition center,  which manages and supports the development, acquisition, and fielding  of critical items for special operations forces, are not included in the  command\u2019s management headquarters totals even though these  personnel perform headquarters-specific functions as defined in DOD  Instruction 5100.73, Major DOD Headquarters Activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Absent a Clear Starting Point, Savings Will Be Difficult to Track", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s reduction initiatives targeted management headquarters, and the  department reported a savings estimate from these reductions in its fiscal  year 2015 budget submission, but because the department did not have a  reliable way to determine the resources being devoted to such  headquarters as a starting point, actual savings will be difficult to track.  Specifically, DOD officials acknowledged the limitations of management  headquarters data, stating that they did not have an operationally clear  definition and good data about what constituted management  headquarters, and agreed that this made it difficult to establish a starting  point for reductions. However, the department does not have any plans to  reevaluate the baseline on which the reductions are based, in part  because it does not have an alternative source for complete and reliable  data. Moreover, DOD reported in its fiscal year 2015 budget submission  that reductions to management headquarters staffs will result in a savings  of $5.3 billion through fiscal year 2019 in comparison to DOD\u2019s overall  expected $2.7 trillion budget over those fiscal years. The department  based this total on incremental savings from reductions being realized  each year from fiscal years 2015 through 2019. However, this represents  a savings of about 2/10 of 1 percent. If DOD\u2019s headquarters reductions do  not have a clearly defined and consistently applied starting point on which  to target savings\u2014and reductions are only focused on what the  commands have self-reported as management headquarters activities\u2014 then the department may not be able to track its savings to management  headquarters or assure that reductions are achieved as intended.", "Accounting for management headquarters is a long-standing challenge  for DOD that has created problems before in tracking savings. In October  1997, in the wake of the mid-1990s military drawdown, we found that total  personnel and costs of defense headquarters were significantly higher  than were being reported. At the time, we found that about three-fourths  of subordinate organizations excluded from the management  headquarters accounting were actually performing management or  management support functions and that such accounting masked the true  size of DOD\u2019s headquarters organizations. In March 2012, we  concluded that DOD\u2019s data on its headquarters personnel lacked  completeness and reliability necessary for use in making efficiency  assessments and decisions. We recommended that the Secretary of  Defense revise DOD Instruction 5100.73, Major DOD Headquarters  Activities, to include all headquarters organizations; specify how  contractors performing headquarters functions will be identified and  included in headquarters reporting; clarify how components are to  compile the information needed for headquarters-reporting requirements;  and establish time frames for implementing actions to improve tracking  and reporting of headquarters resources. DOD generally concurred with  the findings and recommendations in that report and is taking steps to  address the recommendations. For example, DOD has begun the  process of updating DOD Instruction 5100.73, Major DOD Headquarters  Activities, to include all major DOD headquarters activity organizations.  However, the department has not yet taken actions to fully address our  recommendations. In April 2003, we testified on the importance of  periodically reexamining whether current programs and activities remain  relevant, appropriate, and effective in an agency\u2019s ability to deliver on its  mission and noted that restructuring efforts must be focused on clear  goals. Moreover, key questions that agencies should consider when  evaluating organizational consolidation note that the key to any  consolidation initiative is the identification of and agreement on specific  goals, with the goals of the consolidation being evaluated against a  realistic assessment of how the consolidation can achieve them. We  further noted that any consolidation initiatives must be grounded in  accurate and reliable data.", "Moreover, unless these issues are addressed, the department may be  unable to convince external stakeholders, such as Congress, that its  actions will address overhead in a meaningful way. Section 904 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 requires that  DOD develop and submit a plan for streamlining management  headquarters, to include the combatant commands, by June 2014.plan is to include a description of the planned changes or reductions in  staffing and services and the estimated cumulative savings to be  achieved from fiscal years 2015 through 2024. According to officials,  DOD has not yet decided how it plans to track its management  headquarters reductions and report to Congress to satisfy this statutory  requirement. Without establishing a starting point for reductions that  includes all headquarters personnel and resources within these  commands, it is unclear how the department will provide reliable  information to Congress. Moreover, since the universe of resources that  DOD has identified for headquarters reductions is relatively small  compared to the overall size of the functional combatant commands,  unless the department reevaluates its decision to base reductions on  management headquarters, it may not ultimately realize significant  savings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As it faces a potentially extended period of fiscal constraints, DOD has  concluded that reducing the resources it devotes to headquarters is a  reasonable area to achieve cost savings. However, by focusing the  reductions on management headquarters budgets and personnel\u2014which  tend to be inconsistently defined and often represent a small portion of  the overall headquarters\u2014in the way it has, the department is, in effect,  shielding much of the resources it directs to headquarters organizations  like those of the functional combatant commands. Unless the department  reevaluates its decision to focus reductions on management  headquarters and sets a clearly defined and consistently applied starting  point from which to base budgetary and staff reductions at headquarters  organizations and track them, DOD is likely to face difficulties ensuring  that its actions result in significant overhead savings. As the department  continues to identify efficiencies in its operations and potential reductions  in overhead, accurately identifying the universe of resources that DOD  dedicates to headquarters and using that as a starting point for reductions  would help DOD ensure it achieves savings. Finally, managing  headquarters resources is a long-standing challenge at DOD. We have  previously recommended that DOD improve the accounting of  management headquarters functions and develop a process to  periodically revalidate the size and structure of the combatant commands.", "We believe that these recommendations apply to the functional  combatant commands in this review, and are still valid, and thus are  making no new recommendations on these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the management of DOD\u2019s headquarters-reduction  efforts, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following  three actions:  1.

In  written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with  the first recommendation and concurred with the second and third  recommendations.

DOD stated that this department-wide  recommendation would garner greater savings. However, DOD officials  raised concerns that the recommendation seemed to be outside the  scope of the review, which focused on the functional combatant  commands, and with our distinction between management headquarters  and below-the-line organizations and the functions that personnel in these  positions perform. We agree that the recommendation has implications  beyond the functional combatant commands. While our review was  focused on the functional combatant commands, the issue we identified is  not limited to these commands. The findings related to the three  functional combatant commands illustrate a fundamental challenge facing  the department in its efforts to reduce headquarters overhead. As  discussed in this report, we have previously reported on problems with  the way that DOD accounts for management headquarters across the  department. As part of this review, we found that DOD did not have an  accurate accounting of the budgets and personnel associated with  management headquarters to use as a starting point for reductions. Given  the longstanding issues with accounting for management headquarters,  we believe the recommendation that the Secretary reevaluate the  decision to focus the department\u2019s reduction efforts on management  headquarters is appropriate.", "The department also stated in its letter that while the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s reductions were focused on management headquarters, the  military services were allowed to reduce below-the-line organizations\u2014 those not designated as management headquarters\u2014which includes  elements of the combatant commands. According to DOD, these  reductions will range from 3 percent up to 15 percent depending on the  military service. We recognize that the military services plan to implement  reductions that may result in savings at some non-management  headquarters organizations across the department. However, the  department\u2019s response did not delineate how these reductions were  determined, how they were applied by the military services, or how much  the actions would ultimately save the department. Further, in discussions,  DOD officials raised concerns about our distinction between management  headquarters and below-the-line organizations and the functions that  personnel in these positions perform. As noted in the report, we  understand the distinctions as defined in guidance between management  headquarters and below-the-line organizations, or those not considered to  be part of an organization\u2019s management headquarters. However, our  analysis focused on the extent to which the functional combatant  commands reported that personnel were performing management  functions, and we noted that this data was self-reported and potentially  inconsistent. The intent of the recommendation was to focus on positions  not included in the commands\u2019 assessment of management headquarters  positions, but in response to DOD\u2019s concern, we modified the  recommendation to clarify that the goal of ensuring cost savings was  related to the assessment of personnel performing management functions  versus the definition of people included in management headquarters  totals.", "In its comments, the department also questioned the use of Joint Table of  Distribution data from DOD\u2019s Electronic Joint Manpower and Personnel  System versus the Future Years Defense Program data in DOD\u2019s  Defense Resources Data Warehouse for this study. We attempted to use  the data warehouse as part of our prior work examining the resources  devoted to the geographic combatant commands in May 2013; however,  after querying the database, Joint Staff officials explained that the data it  yielded were unreliable. Therefore, the officials suggested that we obtain  the authorized position and costs to support headquarters operations data  directly from the combatant commands and service component  commands. DOD noted in its comments that the data trends may be  skewed since the Joint Table of Distribution presents a point-in-time look  at on-hand personnel. For this review, we focused on authorized positions  as documented on the combatant command\u2019s Joint Tables of Distribution  rather than focusing on personnel on hand because data on authorized  positions provided the most accurate and repeatable data to identify  trends. Moreover, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  1001.01A, Joint Manpower and Personnel Program, notes that Joint  Tables of Distribution are documented in the Joint Staff\u2019s Electronic Joint  Manpower and Personnel System which is DOD\u2019s system of record to  document the unified combatant commands\u2019 organizational structure and  track the manpower and personnel required to meet the combatant  commands\u2019 assigned missions. The instruction also states that manpower  authorizations on the Joint Table of Distribution should be compared with  the Future Years Defense Program and any disconnects must be  resolved. Finally, in January 2012, the Vice Director of the Joint Staff  issued a memo identifying its Electronic Joint Manpower and Personnel  System as the authoritative data source for DOD and for congressional  inquiries of joint personnel, stating that the system must accurately reflect  the manpower and personnel allocated to joint organizations, such as the  combatant commands, to provide senior leaders with the necessary data  to support decision making in a fiscally constrained environment.  Therefore, we maintain that the use of authorized military and civilian  positions from the combatant command\u2019s Joint Tables of Distribution, as  documented in DOD\u2019s Electronic Joint Manpower and Personnel System,  was appropriate for our review of the resources devoted to the functional  combatant commands.", "DOD concurred with the second and third recommendations that the  Secretary of Defense: set a clearly defined and consistently applied  starting point as a baseline for the reductions, and track reductions  against the baselines in order to provide reliable accounting of savings  and reporting to Congress. In its response, DOD recommended the use  of the Future Years Defense Program data to set the baseline going  forward and stated that it was enhancing data elements within DOD\u2019s  Resource Data Warehouse to better identify management headquarters  resources to facilitate tracking and reporting across the department. We  agree that enhancements to the data elements will increase DOD\u2019s  capability to track and report management headquarters resources  across the department and, thus, the Future Years Defense Program data  could be used to set baselines and track future reductions. These  enhancements, if implemented, would address the intent of the  recommendations.", "DOD also provided what it considered significant points of fact.
