Two emerging contaminants--trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchlorate--are of particular concern to DOD because they have significant potential to impact people or DOD's mission. TCE, a degreasing agent in metal cleaning which has been used widely in DOD industrial and maintenance processes, has been documented at low exposure levels to cause headaches and difficulty concentrating. High-level exposure may cause dizziness, headaches, nausea, unconsciousness, cancer, and possibly death. Similarly, perchlorate has been used by DOD, NASA, and others in making, testing, and firing missiles and rockets. It has been widely found in groundwater, surface water, and soil across the United States, Perchlorate health studies have documented particular risks to fetuses of pregnant women. GAO was asked for testimony to summarize its past work on perchlorate-, TCE-, and defense-activities related to (1) the state of knowledge about the emerging contaminants TCE and perchlorate, (2) DOD responsibilities for managing TCE and perchlorate contamination at its facilities, and (3) DOD activities to address TCE and perchlorate contamination."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While TCE and perchlorate are both classified by DOD as emerging contaminants, there are important distinctions in how they are regulated and in what is known about their health and environmental effects. Since 1989, EPA has regulated TCE in drinking water. However, health concerns over TCE have been further amplified in recent years after scientific studies have suggested additional risks posed by human exposure to TCE. Unlike TCE, no drinking water standard exists for perchlorate--a fact that has caused much discussion in Congress and elsewhere. Recent Food and Drug Administration data documenting the extent of perchlorate contamination in the nation's food supply has further fueled this debate. While DOD has clear responsibilities to address TCE because it is subject to EPA's regulatory standard, DOD's responsibilities are less definite for perchlorate due to the lack of such a standard. Nonetheless, perchlorate's designation by DOD as an emerging contaminant has led to some significant control actions. These actions have included responding to requests by EPA and state environmental authorities, which have used a patchwork of statutes, regulations, and general oversight authorities to address perchlorate contamination. Pursuant to its Clean Water Act authorities, for example, Texas required the Navy to reduce perchlorate levels in wastewater discharges at the McGregor Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant to 4 parts per billion (ppb), the lowest level at which perchlorate could be detected at the time. In addition, in the absence of a federal perchlorate standard, at least nine states have established nonregulatory action levels or advisories for perchlorate ranging from 1 ppb to 51 ppb. Nevada, for example, required the Kerr-McGee Chemical site in Henderson to treat groundwater and reduce perchlorate releases to 18 ppb, which is Nevada's action level for perchlorate. While nonenforceable guidance had existed previously, it was not until EPA adopted its 1989 TCE standard that many DOD facilities began to take concrete action to control the contaminant. According to EPA, for example, 46 sites at Camp Lejeune have since been identified for TCE cleanup. The Navy and EPA have selected remedies for 30 of those sites, and the remaining 16 are under active investigation. Regarding perchlorate, in the absence of a federal standard DOD has implemented its own policies on sampling and cleanup, most recently with its 2006 Policy on DOD Required Actions Related to Perchlorate. The policy applies broadly to DOD's active and closed installations and formerly used defense sites within the United States and its territories. It requires testing for perchlorate and certain cleanup actions and directs the department to comply with applicable federal or state promulgated standards, whichever is more stringent. The policy notes, that DOD has established 24 ppb as the current level of concern for managing perchlorate until the promulgation of a formal standard by the states and/or EPA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss our work on the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) activities associated with emerging contaminants and the  cleanup of its hazardous waste sites. DOD defines emerging contaminants  as chemicals or materials characterized by (1) a perceived or real threat to  human health or environment and (2) a lack of published health standards  or a standard that is evolving or being reevaluated. DOD may also classify  a contaminant as \u201cemerging\u201d because of the discovery of a new source of  contamination, pathway to human exposure, or more-sensitive detection  method. Two emerging contaminants\u2014trichloroethylene (TCE) and  perchlorate\u2014are of particular concern to DOD because they have  significant potential to impact people or DOD\u2019s mission.", "As we have previously reported, DOD faces the daunting task of cleaning  up thousands of military bases and other installations across the country.  Many of these sites are contaminated with toxic and radioactive wastes in  soil, water, or containers such as underground storage tanks, ordnance  and explosives, and unsafe buildings. Identifying and investigating these  hazards will take decades, and cleanup will cost many billions of dollars.", "In addition to the federal fiscal implications of the large cleanup costs,  defense-related contamination problems have economic consequences for  individual communities. Many of these formerly used defense sites are  now owned by states, local governments, and individuals and used for  parks, schools, farms, and homes. Of particular concern are military  facilities closed under DOD\u2019s Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)  program that are intended to be redeveloped for productive new uses and  must generally be cleaned up before conversion. Environmental cleanup is  necessary for the transfer of unneeded contaminated property, which  becomes available as a result of base closures and realignment. Concerns  have risen in recent years within affected communities about the extent to  which contamination on these properties could delay or affect the  potential for economic redevelopment to replace jobs that were lost as a  result of the base closures. While most of the land on bases closed  between 1988 and 1995 has been cleaned up and transferred for  redevelopment, some has been awaiting cleanup and conversion for many  years. Additional bases approved for closure in the 2005 BRAC round will  increase the inventory of military properties slated for civilian reuse.", "As you requested, my remarks today will focus on (1) the state of  knowledge about certain emerging contaminants of concern to the  Subcommittee\u2014specifically TCE and perchlorate, (2) DOD\u2019s  responsibilities for managing emerging contaminants for which federal  regulatory standards do not exist, as is the case with perchlorate, and (3)  DOD\u2019s activities to address the emerging contaminants TCE and  perchlorate contamination at its facilities. To address these issues, we  relied primarily on our May 2005 report and April 2007 testimony on  perchlorate and our May 2007 report and June 2007 testimony on drinking  water contamination problems at the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune  (Camp Lejeune). We also used information from related GAO work on  DOD cleanup issues and examined recent data and other information  from DOD, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA), and the states.", "In summary, we found the following:    While TCE and perchlorate are both DOD-classified emerging  contaminants, there are important distinctions in the extent to which they  are regulated and in what is known about their effects on human health  and the environment. TCE, a degreaser for metal parts that DOD has used  widely for industrial and maintenance processes, has been found in  underground water sources and many surface waters as a result of the  manufacture, use, and disposal of the chemical. TCE has been shown to  cause headaches and difficulty concentrating at low levels of exposure,  whereas high-level exposure may cause dizziness, headaches, nausea,  unconsciousness, cancer, and possibly death. As a consequence of these  health risks from TCE ingestion, EPA adopted a TCE drinking water  standard that became effective in 1989. However, health concerns over  TCE have been further amplified in recent years as scientific studies have  suggested additional risks posed by human exposure to TCE. In addition,  ongoing study of the health affects associated with past exposures on  Camp Lejeune may affect DOD\u2019s decision whether to settle or deny the  pending health claims of former residents. Perchlorate, a primary  ingredient in propellant used in the manufacture and firing of rockets and  missiles, has been found in drinking water, groundwater, surface water,  and soil across the United States. Health studies have shown that it can  affect the thyroid gland, which helps to regulate the body\u2019s metabolism,  and may cause developmental impairments in the fetuses of pregnant  women. Unlike TCE, EPA has not set a regulatory standard limiting  perchlorate in drinking water\u2014a fact that has caused much discussion in  Congress and elsewhere. Recent FDA data documenting extensive, low- level perchlorate contamination in the nation\u2019s food supply have further  fueled the debate about the extent of perchlorate contamination and its  health effects.", "While DOD has certain regulatory compliance responsibilities with regard  to emerging contaminants such as TCE that are regulated by EPA or state  governments, responsibilities are less definite for other emerging  contaminants, such as perchlorate, that lack federal regulatory standards.  In the absence of a federal regulatory standard, DOD\u2019s designation of  perchlorate as an emerging contaminant indicates its concern about the  significant potential impact the chemical has on people or the  department\u2019s mission. That designation also has resulted in DOD deciding  to take certain actions and cleanup efforts even without a federal  requirement. While there is no nationwide perchlorate standard, DOD has  taken steps to address perchlorate in individual cases in response to EPA  regional or state agency actions under various environmental laws such as  the Clean Water Act. For example, pursuant to its authority under the  Clean Water Act\u2019s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) program, Texas required the Navy to reduce perchlorate levels in  wastewater discharges at the McGregor Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve  Plant to 4 parts per billion (ppb), the lowest level at which perchlorate  could be detected. Also, in the absence of a federal perchlorate standard,  at least eight states have established nonregulatory action levels or  advisories for perchlorate ranging from 1 ppb to 51 ppb. Nevada, for  example, required the Kerr-McGee Chemical site in Henderson to treat  groundwater and reduce perchlorate concentration releases to 18 ppb\u2014 Nevada\u2019s action level.", "DOD is taking a number of actions to address emerging contaminants,  including TCE and perchlorate. In 1979, EPA issued nonenforceable  guidance establishing \u201csuggested no adverse response levels\u201d for TCE in  drinking water. However, the guidance did not suggest actions that public  water systems should take if TCE concentrations exceeded those values.  Ten years later, EPA\u2019s drinking water standard for TCE of 5 ppb became  effective. The new standard served as a regulatory basis for many DOD  facilities to take concrete actions to control TCE. According to EPA\u2019s  Region 4 Superfund Director, for example, 46 sites at Camp Lejeune have  since been identified for TCE cleanup. The Navy and EPA have selected  remedies for 30 of those sites, and the remaining 16 are under active  investigation. Regarding perchlorate, in the absence of a federal  perchlorate standard, DOD adopted its own policies on sampling and  cleanup\u2014specifically a 2003 interim policy followed by a more  comprehensive 2006 policy that required more aggressive sampling and, in  some cases, cleanup. The 2006 policy applies broadly to DOD\u2019s active and  closed installations and formerly used defense sites within the United  States, its territories and possessions.

TCE is a colorless liquid with a sweet, chloroform-like odor  that is used mainly as a degreaser for metal parts. The compound is also a  component in adhesives, lubricants, paints, varnishes, paint strippers, and  pesticides. At one time, TCE was used as an extraction solvent for  cosmetics and drug products and as a dry-cleaning agent; however, its use  for these purposes has been discontinued. DOD has used the chemical in a  wide variety of industrial and maintenance processes. More recently, the  department has used TCE to clean sensitive computer circuit boards in  military equipment such as tanks and fixed wing aircraft.", "Because TCE is pervasive in the environment, most people are likely to be  exposed to TCE by simply eating, drinking, and breathing, according to the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Toxic Substances  and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Industrial wastewater is the primary  source of release of TCE into water systems, but inhalation is the main  route of potential environmental exposure to TCE. ATSDR has also  reported that TCE has been found in a variety of foods, with the highest  levels in meats, at 12 to 16 ppb, and U.S. margarine, at 440 to 3,600 ppb. In  fact, HHS\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)  suggested that approximately 10 percent of the population had detectable  levels of TCE in their blood.", "Inhaling small amounts of TCE may cause headaches, lung irritation, poor  coordination, and difficulty concentrating, according ATSDR\u2019s  Toxicological Profile. Inhaling or drinking liquids containing high levels of  TCE may cause nervous system effects, liver and lung damage, abnormal  heartbeat, coma, or possibly death. ATSDR also notes that some animal  studies suggest that high levels of TCE may cause liver, kidney, or lung  cancer, and some studies of people exposed over long periods to high  levels of TCE in drinking water or workplace air have shown an increased  risk of cancer. ATSDR\u2019s Toxicological Profile notes that the National  Toxicology Program has determined that TCE is \u201creasonably anticipated  to be a human carcinogen\u201d and the International Agency for Research on  Cancer has determined that TCE is probably carcinogenic to humans\u2014 specifically, kidney, liver and cervical cancers, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, and non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\u2014based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity in  humans and additional evidence from studies in experimental animals.", "Effective in 1989, EPA adopted an MCL of 5 ppb of TCE in drinking water  supplies pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act. Despite EPA\u2019s  regulation of TCE as a drinking water contaminant, concerns over serious  long-term effects associated with TCE exposures have prompted  additional scrutiny by both governmental and nongovernmental scientific  organizations. For example, ATSDR initiated a public health assessment in  1991 to evaluate the possible health risks from exposure to contaminated  drinking water on Camp Lejeune. The health concerns over TCE have  been further amplified in recent years after scientific studies have  suggested additional risks posed by human exposure to TCE. ATSDR is  continuing to develop information about the possible long-term health  consequences of these potential exposures in a subregistry to the National  Exposure Registry specifically for hazardous waste sites.", "As we previously reported with respect to Camp Lejeune, those who lived  on base likely had a higher risk of inhalation exposure to volatile organic  compounds such as TCE, which may be more potent than ingestion  exposure. Thus, pregnant women who lived in areas of base housing with  contaminated water and conducted activities during which they could  inhale water vapor\u2014such as bathing, showering, or washing dishes or  clothing\u2014likely faced greater exposure than those who did not live on  base but worked on base in areas served by the contaminated drinking  water.", "Concerns about possible adverse health effects and government actions  related to the past drinking water contamination on Camp Lejeune have  led to additional activities, including new health studies, claims against the  federal government, and federal inquiries. As a consequence of these  growing concerns\u2014and of anxiety among affected communities about  these health effects and related litigation\u2014ATSDR has undertaken a study  to examine whether individuals who were exposed in utero to the  contaminated drinking water are more likely to have developed certain  childhood cancers or birth defects. This research, once completed later in  2007, is expected to help regulators understand the effects of low levels of  TCE in our environment.", "In addition, some former residents of Camp Lejeune have filed tort claims  and lawsuits against the federal government related to the past drinking  water contamination. As of June 2007, about 850 former residents and  former employees had filed tort claims with the Department of the Navy  related to the past drinking water contamination. According to an official  with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General\u2014which is handling the claims  on behalf of the Department of the Navy\u2014the agency is currently  maintaining a database of all claims filed. The official said that the Judge  Advocate General is awaiting completion of the latest ATSDR health study  before deciding whether to settle or deny the pending claims in order to  base its response on as much objective scientific and medical information  as possible.

Perchlorate  is a primary ingredient in propellant and has been used for decades by the  Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and the defense industry in manufacturing, testing, and  firing missiles and rockets. Other uses include fireworks, fertilizers, and  explosives. It is readily dissolved and transported in water and has been  found in groundwater, surface water, drinking water, and soil across the  country. The sources of perchlorate vary, but the defense and aerospace  industries are the greatest known source of contamination.", "Scientific information on perchlorate was limited until 1997, when a better  detection method became available for perchlorate, and detections (and  concern about perchlorate contamination) increased. In 1998, EPA first  placed perchlorate on its Contaminant Candidate List, the list of  contaminants that are candidates for regulation, but the agency concluded  that information was insufficient to determine whether perchlorate should  be regulated under the SDWA. EPA listed perchlorate as a priority for  further research on health effects and treatment technologies and for  collecting occurrence data. In 1999, EPA required water systems to  monitor for perchlorate under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring  Rule to determine the frequency and levels at which it is present in public  water supplies nationwide.", "Interagency disagreements over the risks of perchlorate exposure led  several federal agencies to ask the National Research Council (NRC) of  the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate perchlorate\u2019s health effects.  In 2005, NRC issued a comprehensive review of the health effects of  perchlorate ingestion, and it reported that certain levels of exposure may  not adversely affect healthy adults. However, the NRC-recommended more  studies on the effects of perchlorate exposure in children and pregnant  women and recommended a reference dose of 0.0007 milligrams per  kilogram per day. In 2005, the EPA adopted the NRC recommended  reference dose, which translates to a drinking water equivalent level  (DWEL) of 24.5 ppb. If the EPA were to develop a drinking water standard  for perchlorate, it would adjust the DWEL to account for other sources of  exposure, such as food.", "Although EPA has taken some steps to consider a standard, in April 2007  EPA again decided not to regulate perchlorate\u2014citing the need for  additional research\u2014and kept perchlorate on its Contaminant Candidate  List. Several human studies have shown that thyroid changes occur in  human adults at significantly higher concentrations than the amounts  typically observed in water supplies. However, more recent studies have  since provided new knowledge and raised concerns about potential health  risks of low-level exposures, particularly for infants and fetuses.  Specifically, in October 2006, researchers from the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) published the results of the first large study  to examine the relationship between low-level perchlorate exposure and  thyroid function in women with lower iodine levels. About 36 percent of  U.S. women have these lower iodine levels. The study found decreases in a  thyroid hormone that helps regulate the body\u2019s metabolism and is needed  for proper fetal neural development.", "Moreover, in May 2007, FDA released a preliminary exposure assessment  because of significant public interest in the issue of perchlorate exposure  from food. FDA sampled and tested foods such as tomatoes, carrots,  spinach, and cantaloupe; and other high water content foods such as apple  and orange juices; vegetables such as cucumbers, green beans, and greens;  and seafood such as fish and shrimp for perchlorate and found widespread  low-level perchlorate levels in these items. FDA is also planning to publish,  in late 2007, an assessment of exposure to perchlorate from foods, based  on results from its fiscal year 2005-2006 Total Diet Study\u2014a market basket  study that is representative of the U.S. diet.", "Some federal funding has been directed to perchlorate studies and cleanup  activities. For example, committee reports related to the DOD and EPA  appropriations acts of fiscal year 2006 directed some funding for  perchlorate cleanup. In the Senate committee report for the Department of  Health and Human Services fiscal year 2006 appropriations act, the  committee encouraged support for studies on the long-term effects of  perchlorate exposure. The Senate committee report for FDA\u2019s fiscal year  2006 appropriations act directed FDA to continue conducting surveys of  perchlorate in food and bottled water and to report the findings to  Congress. In the current Congress, legislation has been introduced that  would require EPA to establish a health advisory for perchlorate, as well  as requiring public water systems serving more than 10,000 people to test  for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer confidence  reports. Other pending legislation would require EPA to establish a  national primary drinking water standard for perchlorate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Responsibilities to Address Perchlorate and Other Emerging Contaminants Where Federal Regulatory Standards Do Not Exist", "paragraphs": ["DOD has certain responsibilities with regard to emerging contaminants  such as TCE that are regulated by EPA or state governments, but its  responsibilities and cleanup goals are less definite for emerging  contaminants such as perchlorate that lack federal regulatory standards.

For example, at EPA\u2019s  request, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) installed monitoring  wells and sampled for perchlorate at Camp Bonneville, a closed  installation near Vancouver, Washington. Utah state officials also reported  to us that DOD removed soil containing perchlorate at the former  Wendover Air Force Base in Utah, where the Corps found perchlorate in  2004. However, as we previously reported, DOD cited reluctance to sample  on or near active installations because of the lack of a federal regulatory  standard for perchlorate.", "In the absence of a federal standard, DOD has also worked with individual  states on perchlorate sampling and cleanup. For example, in October 2004,  DOD and California agreed to prioritize perchlorate sampling at DOD  facilities in California, including identifying and prioritizing the  investigation of areas on active installations and military sites (1) where  the presence of perchlorate is likely based on previous and current  defense-related activities and (2) near drinking water sources where  perchlorate was found.", "In January 2006, DOD updated its policy with the issuance of its Policy on  DOD Required Actions Related to Perchlorate. The new policy applies  broadly to DOD\u2019s active and closed installations and formerly used  defense sites within the United States, its territories and possessions. It  directs DOD to test for perchlorate and take certain cleanup actions. The  policy also acknowledges the importance of EPA direction in driving  DOD\u2019s response to emerging contaminants. It stated, for example, that its  adoption of 24 ppb as the current level of concern for managing  perchlorate was in response to EPA\u2019s adoption of an oral reference dose  that translates to a Drinking Water Equivalent Level of 24.5 ppb. The  policy also states that when EPA or the states adopt standards for  perchlorate, \u201cDOD will comply with applicable state or federal  promulgated standards whichever is more stringent.\u201d", "The 2006 policy directs DOD to test for perchlorate when it is reasonably  expected that a release has occurred. If perchlorate levels exceed 24 ppb,  a site-specific risk assessment must be conducted. When an assessment  indicates that the perchlorate contamination could result in adverse health  effects, the site must be prioritized for risk management. DOD uses a  relative-risk site evaluation framework across DOD to evaluate the risks  posed by one site relative to other sites and to help prioritize  environmental restoration work and to allocate resources among sites.  The policy also directs DOD\u2019s service components to program resources to  address perchlorate contamination under four DOD programs\u2014 environmental restoration, operational ranges, DOD-owned drinking water  systems, and DOD wastewater effluent discharges.", "Under the 2006 perchlorate policy, DOD has sampled drinking water,  groundwater, and soil where the release of perchlorate may result in  human exposure and responded where it has deemed appropriate to  protect public health. As we have reported, DOD is responsible for a large  number of identified sites with perchlorate contamination, and the  department has allotted significant resources to address the problem.  According to DOD, sampling for perchlorate has occurred at 258 active  DOD installations or facilities. Through fiscal year 2006, DOD reported  spending approximately $88 million on perchlorate-related research  activities, including $60 million for perchlorate treatment technologies,  $9.5 million on health and toxicity studies, and $11.6 million on pollution  prevention. Additional funds have been spent on testing technology and  cleanup. DOD also claims credit for other efforts, including strict handling  procedures to prevent the release of perchlorate into the environment and  providing information about perchlorate at DOD facilities and DOD\u2019s  responses. For example, DOD posts the results of its perchlorate sampling,  by state, on MERIT\u2019s Web site.", "As we have previously reported, DOD must comply with cleanup  standards and processes under applicable laws, regulations and executive  orders, including EPA drinking water standards and state-level standards.  In the absence of a federal perchlorate standard, DOD has also initiated  perchlorate response actions to clean up perchlorate contamination at  several active and formerly used defense sites under its current  perchlorate policy. For example, at Edwards Air Force Base in California,  DOD has treated 32 million gallons of ground water under a pilot project  for contaminants that include perchlorate. In addition, DOD has removed  soil and treated groundwater at the Massachusetts Military Reservation  and Camp Bonneville in Washington State.", "In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, DOD faces significant challenges, and  potentially large costs, in addressing emerging contaminants, particularly  in light of the scientific developments and regulatory uncertainties  surrounding these chemicals and materials. To help address them, DOD  recently identified five emerging contaminants for which it is developing  risk management options. As in the case of TCE, DOD took action to  address contamination after EPA established an MCL in 1989. DOD has  stated that further efforts to address perchlorate would require a  regulatory standard from EPA and/or the states. The fact that some states  have moved to create such standards complicates the issue for DOD by  presenting it with varying cleanup standards across the country.", "As the debate over a federal perchlorate standard continues, the recently- issued health studies from CDC and FDA may provide additional weight to  the view that the time for such a standard may be approaching. Until one  is adopted, DOD will continue to face the challenges of differing  regulatory requirements in different states and continuing questions about  whether its efforts to control perchlorate contamination are necessary or  sufficient to protect human health.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
