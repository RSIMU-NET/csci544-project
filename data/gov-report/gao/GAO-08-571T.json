For fiscal year 2007, the federal government continued to report improved information security performance relative to key performance metrics established by OMB. For example, an increasing percentage of systems governmentwide had been tested and evaluated, had tested contingency plans, and had been certified and accredited. However, IGs at several agencies sometimes disagreed with the agency reported information and identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these and other security program activities. Despite agency reported progress, major federal agencies continue to experience significant information security control deficiencies that limit the effectiveness of their efforts to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and information systems. Most agencies did not implement controls to sufficiently prevent, limit, or detect access to computer networks, systems, or information. In addition, agencies did not always effectively manage the configuration of network devices to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity, patch key servers and workstations in a timely manner, assign duties to different individuals or groups so that one individual did not control all aspects of a process or transaction, and maintain complete continuity of operations plans for key information systems. An underlying cause for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully or effectively implemented agencywide information security programs. As a result, federal systems and information are at increased risk of unauthorized access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of sensitive information, as well as inadvertent or deliberate disruption of system operations and services. Such risks are illustrated, in part, by an increasing number of security incidents experienced by federal agencies. Nevertheless, opportunities exist to bolster federal information security. Federal agencies could implement the hundreds of recommendations made by GAO and IGs to resolve prior significant control deficiencies and information security program shortfalls. In addition, OMB and other federal agencies have initiated several governmentwide initiatives that are intended to improve security over federal systems and information. For example, OMB has established an information systems security line of business to share common processes and functions for managing information systems security and directed agencies to adopt the security configurations developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Departments of Defense and Homeland Security for certain Windows operating systems. Opportunities also exist to enhance policies and practices related to security control testing and evaluation, FISMA reporting, and the independent annual evaluations of agency information security programs required by FISMA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss  information security over federal systems.

The failure of the pumps was traced to excessive  traffic on the control system network, possibly caused by the failure of  another control system device.", "Officials at the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and  Security discovered a security breach in July 2006. In investigating this  incident, officials were able to review firewall logs for an 8-month period  prior to the initial detection of the incident, but were unable to clearly  define the amount of time that perpetrators were inside its computers, or  find any evidence to show that data was lost as a result.", "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed that in January 2003, the  Microsoft SQL Server worm known as \u201cSlammer\u201d infected a private  computer network at the idled Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Oak  Harbor, Ohio, disabling a safety monitoring system for nearly 5 hours. In  addition, the plant\u2019s process computer failed, and it took about 6 hours for  it to become available again.", "When incidents occur, agencies are to notify the federal information  security incident center\u2014US-CERT. As shown in figure 7, the number of  incidents reported by federal agencies to US-CERT has increased  dramatically over the past 3 years, increasing from 3,634 incidents  reported in fiscal year 2005 to 13,029 incidents in fiscal year 2007, (about a  259 percent increase).", "Incidents are categorized by US-CERT in the following manner:    Unauthorized access: In this category, an individual gains logical or  physical access without permission to a federal agency\u2019s network, system,  application, data, or other resource.", "Denial of service: An attack that successfully prevents or impairs the  normal authorized functionality of networks, systems, or applications by  exhausting resources. This activity includes being the victim or  participating in a denial of service attack.", "Malicious code: Successful installation of malicious software (e.g., virus,  worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity) that infects an  operating system or application. Agencies are not required to report  malicious logic that has been successfully quarantined by antivirus  software.", "Improper usage: A person violates acceptable computing use policies.", "Scans/probes/attempted access: This category includes any activity that  seeks to access or identify a federal agency computer, open ports,  protocols, service, or any combination of these for later exploit.

For example, we  recommended agencies correct specific information security deficiencies  related to user identification and authentication, authorization, boundary  protections, cryptography, audit and monitoring and physical security. We  have also recommended that agencies fully implement comprehensive,  agencywide information security programs by correcting weaknesses in  risk assessments, information security policies and procedures, security  planning, security training, system tests and evaluations, and remedial  actions. The effective implementation of these recommendations will  strengthen the security posture at these agencies.", "In addition, recognizing the need for common solutions to improving  security, OMB and certain federal agencies have continued or launched  several governmentwide initiatives that are intended to enhance  information security at federal agencies. These key initiatives are  discussed below.", "The Information Systems Security Line of Business: The goal of this  initiative is to improve the level of information systems security across  government agencies and reduce costs by sharing common processes and  functions for managing information systems security. Several agencies  have been designated as service providers for IT security awareness  training and FISMA reporting.", "Federal Desktop Core Configuration: This initiative directs agencies that  have Windows XP deployed and plan to upgrade to Windows Vista  operating systems to adopt the security configurations developed by NIST,  DOD, and DHS. The goal of this initiative is to improve information  security and reduce overall IT operating costs.", "SmartBUY: This program, led by GSA, is to support enterprise-level  software management through the aggregate buying of commercial  software governmentwide in an effort to achieve cost savings through  volume discounts. The SmartBUY initiative was expanded to include  commercial off-the-shelf encryption software and to permit all federal  agencies to participate in the program. The initiative is to also include  licenses for information assurance.", "Trusted Internet Connections initiative: This is an effort designed to  optimize individual agency network services into a common solution for  the federal government. The initiative is to facilitate the reduction of external connections, including Internet points of presence, to a target of  fifty.", "In addition to these initiatives, OMB has issued several policy  memorandums over the past two years to help agencies protect sensitive  data. For example, it has sent memorandums to agencies to reemphasize  their responsibilities under law and policy to (1) appropriately safeguard  sensitive and personally identifiable information, (2) train employees on  their responsibilities to protect sensitive information, and (3) report  security incidents. In May 2007, OMB issued additional detailed guidelines  to agencies on safeguarding against and responding to the breach of  personally identifiable information, including developing and  implementing a risk-based breach notification policy, reviewing and  reducing current holdings of personal information, protecting federal  information accessed remotely, and developing and implementing a policy  outlining the rules of behavior, as well as identifying consequences and  potential corrective actions for failure to follow these rules.", "Opportunities also exist to enhance policies and practices related to  security control testing and evaluation, FISMA reporting, and the  independent annual evaluations of agency information security programs  required by FISMA.", "Clarify requirements for testing and evaluating security controls.  Periodic testing and evaluation of information security controls is a  critical element for ensuring that controls are properly designed, operating  effectively, and achieving control objectives. FISMA requires that agency  information security programs include the testing and evaluation of the  effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, and practices,  and that such tests be performed with a frequency depending on risk, but  no less than annually.", "We previously reported that federal agencies had not adequately designed  and effectively implemented policies for periodically testing and  evaluating information security controls. Agency policies often did not  include important elements for performing effective testing such as how to  determine the frequency, depth, and breadth of testing according to risk.  In addition, the methods and practices at six test case agencies were not  adequate to ensure that assessments were consistent, of similar quality, or  repeatable. For example, these agencies did not define the assessment  methods to be used when evaluating security controls, did not test  controls as prescribed, and did not include previously reported remedial  actions or weaknesses in their test plans to ensure that they had been  addressed. In addition, our audits of information security controls often  identify weaknesses that agency or contractor personnel who tested the  controls of the same systems did not identify. Clarifying or strengthening  federal policies and requirements for determining the frequency, depth,  and breadth of security controls according to risk could help agencies  better assess the effectiveness of the controls protecting the information  and systems supporting their programs, operations, and assets.", "Enhance FISMA reporting requirements. Periodic reporting of  performance measures for FISMA requirements and related analyses  provides valuable information on the status and progress of agency efforts  to implement effective security management programs.", "In previous reports, we have recommended that OMB improve FISMA  reporting by clarifying reporting instructions and requesting IGs to report  on the quality of additional performance metrics. OMB has taken steps to  enhance its reporting instructions. For example, OMB added questions  regarding incident reporting and assessments of system inventory.  However, the current metrics do not measure how effectively agencies are  performing various activities. Current performance measures offer limited  assurance of the quality of agency processes that implement key security  policies, controls, and practices. For example, agencies are required to test  and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls over their systems at least  once a year and to report on the number of systems undergoing such tests.  However, there is no measure of the quality of agencies\u2019 test and  evaluation processes. Similarly, OMB\u2019s reporting instructions do not  address the quality of other activities such as risk categorization, security  awareness training, intrusion detection and prevention, or incident  reporting. OMB has recognized the need for assurance of quality for  certain agency processes. For example, it specifically requested that IGs  evaluate the quality of their agency\u2019s certification and accreditation  process. OMB instructed IGs to rate their agency\u2019s certification and  accreditation process using the terms \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d  \u201cpoor,\u201d or \u201cfailing.\u201d For fiscal year 2007, OMB requested that IGs identify  the aspect(s) of the certification and accreditation process they included  or considered in rating the quality of their agency\u2019s process. Examples  OMB included were security plan, system impact level, system test and  evaluation, security control testing, incident handling, security awareness  training, and security configurations (including patch management). While  this information is helpful and provides insight on the scope of the rating,  IGs are not requested to comment on the quality of these items. Providing  information on the quality of the security-related processes used to  implement key control activities would further enhance the usefulness of  the annually reported data for management and oversight purposes.", "As we have previously reported, OMB\u2019s reporting guidance and  performance measures did not include complete reporting on certain key  FISMA-related activities. For example, FISMA requires each agency to  include policies and procedures in its security program that ensure  compliance with minimally acceptable system configuration requirements,  as determined by the agency. In our report on patch management, we  stated that maintaining up-to-date patches is key to complying with this  requirement. As such, we recommended that OMB address patch  management in its FISMA reporting instructions. OMB\u2019s current reporting  instructions only request that IGs comment on whether or not they  considered patching as part of their agency\u2019s certification and  accreditation rating but nothing more. As a result, OMB and Congress lack  information that could identify governmentwide issues regarding patch  management. This information could prove useful in demonstrating  whether or not agencies are taking appropriate steps for protecting their  systems.", "Consider conducting FISMA-mandated annual independent evaluations  in accordance with audit standards or a common approach and  framework. We previously reported that the annual IG FISMA evaluations  lacked a common approach and that the scope and methodology of the  evaluations varied across agencies.", "Similar to our previous reports, we found that the IGs continue to lack a  common methodology, or framework, which culminated in disparities in  type of work conducted, scope, methodology, and content of the IGs\u2019  annual independent evaluations. To illustrate:    Of 24 agency IGs, seven reported performing audits that were in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and  one cited compliance with the Quality Standards for Inspections, issued by  the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE). The remaining  IGs did not indicate whether or not their evaluations were performed in  accordance with professional standards.", "One IG indicated that the evaluation focused specifically on nonfinancial  systems, while others cited work conducted for financial systems as part  of their evaluations. In addition, multiple IGs indicated that their reviews  were focused on selected components, whereas others did not make any  reference to the scope or breadth of their work.", "According to their FISMA reports, certain IGs reported interviewing  officials and reviewing agency documentation, such as security plans. In  addition, certain IGs also conducted technical vulnerability assessments.  In contrast, other IGs did not indicate their methods for evaluating  controls.", "The content of the information reported by IGs varied. For example,  several IGs only provided a completed OMB template, while others  completed the OMB template and provided reports summarizing their  evaluations. Content in these reports also differed in that several included  comments on whether or not their agency was in compliance with laws  and regulations.", "Several reports were comprised of a summary of relevant information  security audits conducted during the fiscal year, while others included  additional evaluations that addressed specific FISMA-required elements,  such as risk assessments and remedial actions. Furthermore, some IGs  issued recommendations to their agencies to improve the effectiveness of  those agencies\u2019 information security programs, while others did not  indicate whether or not recommendations were issued.", "These inconsistencies could hamper the efforts of the collective IG  community to perform their evaluations with optimal effectiveness and  efficiency. Conducting the evaluations in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards and/or a robust commonly used  framework or methodology could provide improved effectiveness,  increased efficiency, quality control, and consistency in assessing whether  the agency has an effective information security program. IGs may be able  to use the framework and methodology to be more efficient by focusing  evaluative procedures on areas of higher risk and by following an  integrated approach designed to gather sufficient, competent evidence  efficiently. Having a documented methodology may also offer quality  control by providing a standardized methodology, which can help the IG  community obtain consistency of application.", "Last year we reported on efforts to develop such a framework. In  September 2006, the PCIE developed a tool to assist the IG community  with conducting its FISMA evaluations. The framework consists of  program and system control areas that map directly to the control areas  identified in NIST Special Publication 800-100 and NIST Special  Publication 800-53, respectively. According to PCIE members, the  framework includes broad recommendations rather than a specific  methodology due to the varying levels of resources available to each  agency IG. According to PCIE members, this framework is an effort to  provide a common approach to completing the required evaluations, and  PCIE has encouraged IGs to use it.", "In summary, agencies have reported progress in implementing control  activities, but persistent weaknesses in agency information security  controls threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal  information and information systems, as illustrated by the increasing  number of reported security incidents. Opportunities exist to improve  information security at federal agencies. OMB and certain federal agencies  have initiated efforts that are intended to strengthen the protection of  federal information and information systems. Opportunities also exist to  enhance policies and practices related to security control testing and  evaluation of information security performance metrics and independent  evaluations. Until such opportunities are seized and fully exploited and the  hundreds of GAO and IG recommendations to mitigate information  security control deficiencies and implement agencywide information  security programs are fully and effectively implemented, federal  information and systems will remain at undue and unnecessary risk.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
