The  introduction to the plan specifies that it was produced to help identify the  capabilities needed to strengthen the region\u2019s homeland security efforts  and to define the framework for achieving those capabilities. The scope of  the plan, as outlined in the introduction, is strategic investment in new and  existing capabilities to help all localities in the NCR prepare for, prevent,  protect against, respond to, and recover from all-hazards threats and  events. Specifically, the plan\u2019s goals and objectives are designed to build  new and expanded capabilities and to ensure maintenance of previous  investments. Additionally, the aim of these capabilities, according to the  plan, is to help support the localities in the NCR as they execute their  operational plans in all phases of homeland security. The plan\u2019s  methodology appendix specifies that the effort to produce the 2010 plan  started with an NCR partner-led assessment of progress under the 2006  NCR Strategic Plan and stakeholder recommendations on how best to  update the goals to reflect current priorities of the NCR. As part of this  effort, subject-matter experts identified priority capabilities from the 2010  UASI Investment Justifications that serve as the foundation for the plan\u2019s  goals and objectives.

It is not clear from the strategy how the  NCR plans to update risk information, but according to responsible NCR  officials, a regional risk assessment will be conducted every 2-4 years,  and during this fiscal year the NCR will be making decisions about the  timing and methodology for the next regional risk assessment. In addition,  the officials said risk information can enter prioritization decisions as  subject matter experts bring to bear their knowledge of critical- infrastructure sector-specific risk assessments and lessons learned from  regional and worldwide incidents.", "The 2010 NCR Strategic Plan includes a profile of the region that details  how particular social, economic, and critical-infrastructure factors in the  region serve to increase both the threat and consequence components of  its profile. For example, the plan\u2019s profile explains that the NCR has more  than 340,000 federal workers; 2,000 political, social, and humanitarian  nonprofit organizations; more than 20 million tourists per year; 4,000  diplomats at more than 170 embassies; and some of the most important  symbols of national sovereignty and democratic heritage. The plan notes  that the region needs to be prepared for a variety of threats and  challenges.

The  strategy clearly identifies updated and prioritized goals from the previous  version of the strategy. Each of these four goals is accompanied by  supporting objectives, which in turn, are supported by more targeted  initiatives. According to the strategy, the goals, objectives, and initiatives  were developed by multiple stakeholders, including emergency  managers, first responders, health-care officials, and information- technology specialists, among others, and focus on developing and  sustaining key capabilities in the region.

NCR provided us with a draft copy of the Performance  Measurement Plan, which is currently under development. Our review of  this draft showed that the NCR has begun efforts to develop measures.  While the 2010 plan states that the initiatives it defines are intended to be  attained during the next 3 to 5 years, the strategy does not currently  communicate specific milestones for achieving the plan\u2019s objectives and  initiatives. However, according to NCR officials, with the annual planning  and implementation cycle beginning in January 2012, they plan to enter  into a new phase of their strategy efforts, designed to make the strategy  process more data-driven and project-management focused.

For example, if the region is threatened by a hurricane, awareness of the status of roads,  shelters, traffic, available medical resources, power outages, and the like is important in making  decisions about what type of assistance is needed and where it is needed. To coordinate an effective  response, NCR partners need to share their information and have access to the information of others.  The NCR fusion centers include the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center, the Washington  Regional Threat and Analysis Center, the NCR Intelligence Center, and the Virginia Fusion Center. A  fusion center is a physical location where data can be collected from a variety of sources, including  but not limited to police departments, fire departments, health departments, and the private sector.  Experts analyze the incoming information and create intelligence products, which can be used to  maximize resources, streamline operations, and improve the ability to address all-hazards incidents  and threats. Fusion centers help to prevent terrorism and criminal activities as well as support  preparedness for man-made and natural hazards to trigger quick and effective response to all- hazards events.", "Critical services are defined as life-sustainment services during an emergency and include energy  (electric power and gas), water supply, transportation, food, and communications. These are all  supplied routinely by the CI/KR sectors. During a disaster, providing critical life-sustaining services  ensures that government and private health, safety, and emergency services continue, and that plans  are in place to compensate for losses among interdependent systems.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
