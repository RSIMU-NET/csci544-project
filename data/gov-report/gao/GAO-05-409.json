In light of SBA's actions, GAO undertook a follow-up review to (1) describe the nature of the deficiencies SBA identified, (2) determine whether its corrective actions resolved the deficiencies, and (3) assess whether its procedures provide a reasonable basis for future credit estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SBA took prompt action with a comprehensive review of its financial records and systems to identify the deficiencies related to accounting for its disaster loans and loan sale program. SBA's review found (1) the cash flow model used to estimate the cost of the disaster loan program was unreliable and underestimated the cost, (2) the model used to determine whether sales were beneficial had errors and incorrectly indicated that loans were sold at gains, (3) incorrect loan values used to calculate the results of loan sales led to inaccurate reporting in SBA's financial statements, and (4) incomplete tools provided by OMB to calculate interest payments on borrowings from Treasury resulted in excess payments to Treasury and an insufficient balance in SBA's financing account and subsidy allowance. To resolve these deficiencies, SBA implemented a number of corrective actions during fiscal years 2003 and 2004. To address the first three, SBA developed a new cash flow model to estimate the costs and loan values for the disaster loan program. This improved the agency's ability to prepare more reliable cost estimates and determine the gain or loss on prior loan sales. To address the fourth deficiency, SBA analyzed its interest payments to Treasury and found that it had overpaid by about $134 million. SBA included this amount in its reestimates for the disaster loan program to correct prior interest payments and also implemented a different approach to update or \"reestimate\" its cost estimates, which will adjust its transactions with Treasury going forward. However, until OMB updates its tools for computing these interest payments, other credit agencies may also be over- or underpaying interest to Treasury. Further, SBA improved its policies and procedures to help ensure that future loan program cost estimates will be reasonable. For example, SBA implemented new standard operating procedures for calculating reestimates and prepared documentation to support the rationale and basis for key aspects of the cash flow model. However, because of the complexities associated with estimating loan program costs, additional actions by SBA would help improve the long-term reliability of cost estimates. These include (1) further documentation of the model and disaster data to readily provide for knowledge transfer between staff and contractors to help ensure proper maintenance, updating, and running of the model; (2) periodic assessments of the model's ability to predict loan performance; and (3) additional procedures to ensure the disaster data used in the model are tested to verify and document that they are reliable. In addition, there may be opportunities to improve the model with additional variables, such as financial strength of borrowers, as well as revisions to simplify the estimation process that warrant further consideration by SBA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, the Small Business Administration (SBA) began a loan asset sales  program at the direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to  reduce the amount of loans the agency owned and serviced.

The loans eligible for sale  were disaster assistance and other direct loans and defaulted business loan  guarantees.  Between fiscal years 1999 and 2003, SBA conducted seven  sales, divesting itself of about 166,000 loans with an outstanding balance of  about $5.7 billion.  Approximately 86 percent of the amount sold was  disaster assistance loans.", "Our January 2003 report on SBA\u2019s first five loan sales identified significant  anomalies in SBA\u2019s disaster loan accounts and raised serious concerns  about its ability to properly account for its loan sales and to estimate the  costs associated with its remaining disaster loan portfolio for budget and  accounting purposes. In response to our findings and recommendations,  SBA and its contractors (hereinafter referred to as SBA) conducted an  extensive analysis of its accounting and budgeting for its loan sales and  disaster loan program and implemented a number of corrective actions  during fiscal years 2003 and 2004, including the development of a new cash  flow model to estimate the cost of the disaster loan program for budget and  financial reporting purposes.", "In light of these events, we were asked to conduct a follow-up review to  assess SBA\u2019s corrective actions.

We also assessed the sufficiency of its policies  and procedures to estimate program costs and its corrective actions based  on applicable guidance.  We provided SBA a draft of this report and OMB a  draft of applicable sections of this report for review and comment.

Interest rates on disaster  loans vary, depending on the borrower\u2019s ability to obtain credit in the  private sector.", "The President\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget proposed that SBA begin selling  disaster and business loans that the agency was servicing and transition  from servicing loans directly to overseeing private-sector servicers. Before  its loan asset sales program began, SBA was servicing approximately  300,000 loans, with a principal balance of over $9 billion. About 286,000 of  these loans, with a principal balance of $7 billion, were disaster assistance  loans.", "SBA, as well as other credit agencies, is required to account and budget for  its credit programs in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of  1990 (FCRA).  FCRA was enacted to require agencies to more accurately  measure the government\u2019s cost of federal credit programs and to permit  better cost comparisons, both among credit programs and between credit  and noncredit programs. The act gave OMB responsibility for coordinating  credit program estimates required by the act.  Authoritative guidance on  preparing cost estimates for the budget and conducting loan sales is  contained in OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution  of the Budget.  The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board  developed accounting standards for credit programs.  This guidance is  generally found in Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards  No. 2, Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees, which became  effective in fiscal year 1994.  This standard, which generally mirrors FCRA  and budget guidance, established accounting guidance for estimating the  subsidy cost of loan programs, as well as recording loans and loan sales for  financial reporting purposes.", "According to FCRA, the actual and expected costs of federal credit  programs should be recognized in budgetary reporting. The accounting  standard also requires these costs to be recognized for financial reporting.  To determine the expected cost of a credit program, agencies are required  to predict or estimate the future performance of the program on a cohort  basis. This cost, known as the subsidy cost, is the net present value of  disbursements by the government minus estimated payments to the  government over the life of the loan or loan guarantee, excluding  administrative costs. Figure 1 presents the cash flows included in the  subsidy cost calculation for direct and guaranteed loans.", "FCRA established a special budgetary accounting system to record the  budget information necessary to implement credit reform.  Loans and loan  guarantees made on or after October 1, 1991\u2014the effective date of credit  reform\u2014use the (1) program and (2) financing accounts to handle credit  transactions. The program account is included in budget totals, receives  separate appropriations for the administrative and subsidy costs of a credit  program, and records the budget authority and outlays for these costs. The  program account is used to pay the associated subsidy cost to the financing  account when a direct or guaranteed loan is disbursed.  The financing  account, which is nonbudgetary, is used to collect the subsidy cost from  the program account, borrow from Treasury to provide financing for loan  disbursements, and record the cash flows associated with direct loans or  loan guarantees over their lives, including loan disbursements, default  payments to lenders, loan repayments, interest payments, recoveries on  defaulted loans, and fee collections.  Figure 2 shows the flow of program  and financing accounts transactions for a direct loan program.", "FCRA requires that the rate of interest charged by Treasury on lending to  financing accounts be the same as the final discount rate used to calculate  the net present value of cash flows when estimating the subsidy cost of a  credit program. The final discount rate for a cohort of loans is determined  based on interest rates prevailing during the period that the loans are  disbursed.  Once the loans for a cohort are substantially disbursed (at least  90 percent), the final discount rate for that cohort is determined, and this  rate is to be used for financing account interest calculations. The same rate  is required to be used to calculate subsidy costs and interest on the  financing account, so that the financing account will break even over time  as it uses its collections to repay its Treasury borrowing. OMB provides  tools for agencies to use to calculate interest on the financing account.", "To estimate the cost of credit programs, agencies first estimate the future  performance of direct and guaranteed loans, using cash flow models, when  preparing their annual budgets. The data used for these budgetary  estimates are generally updated or \u201creestimated\u201d annually as of the end of  the fiscal year to reflect any changes in loan performance since the  estimates were prepared, as well as any expected changes in assumptions  related to future loan performance. Increases in subsidy costs that are  recognized through reestimates are funded through permanent indefinite  budget authority.", "Before SBA could proceed with a loan sale, OMB had to approve it.  This  approval was based primarily on whether or not the sale was expected to  be financially beneficial to the government, meaning that the estimated  proceeds were expected to be greater than the estimated value of holding  the loans.  SBA estimated the current value to the government of holding  the loans, also known as the \u201chold value,\u201d in accordance with OMB Circular  A-11.  The hold value is the expected net cash flows from the loans,  discounted at current Treasury rates. This differs from the net book value  recorded on SBA\u2019s books, which is the expected net cash flows from the  loans discounted using Treasury rates in effect when the loans were  disbursed. Therefore, the hold value takes into account changes in interest  rates since the loans were disbursed, whereas the net book value does not.", "Our January 2003 report on SBA\u2019s first five loan sales highlighted  accounting anomalies related to its disaster loans and loan sales program.   Specifically, SBA incorrectly calculated the accounting losses on the loan  sales it disclosed in its financial statements and lacked reliable financial  data to determine the overall financial impact of the sales. Further, because  SBA did not analyze the effect of loan sales on its remaining portfolio, its  reestimates of loan program costs for the budget and financial statements  may have contained significant errors. In addition, SBA could not explain  significant declines in its subsidy allowance for disaster loans.", "In response to our findings, SBA took immediate action to begin the  process of identifying the deficiencies that contributed to the disaster loan  accounting anomalies, including unexplained significant declines in its  subsidy allowance. A team of financial experts, including contractors and  staff from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, was assembled to  conduct detailed reviews of financial records and systems related to the  disaster and loan sales programs. Several diagnostic-type analyses were  performed, including detailed reconciliations of the subsidy allowance and  testing of alternative versions of the cash flow model used to estimate the  cost of the disaster loan program. In January 2003, SBA hired IBM Business  Consulting Services (IBM) to help determine reasons for the abnormal  balance in the disaster loan program\u2019s subsidy allowance and to identify  recommendations for correcting any deficiencies noted. IBM assisted SBA  in a detailed review of SBA\u2019s accounting and budgeting for the disaster loan  program and its loan sale procedures. IBM summarized the results of this  review in a March 2003 report. According to SBA officials, the core  diagnosis of the problems was completed by April 2003 with the  submission and analysis of the report from IBM."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Identified Major Deficiencies in Models and Methodologies Used to Account for the Disaster Loan Program", "paragraphs": ["SBA and its contractors identified four key deficiencies related to the  disaster loan program accounting anomalies.

This methodology could have  produced reasonable cash flow estimates, even considering loan sales, if all  loans had similar characteristics.  However, this was not the case, and  flaws in this methodology became apparent once SBA began substantial  loan sales and the loans sold had different characteristics than the loans  not sold.  For example, the sold loans tended to have longer borrower  repayment periods, or loan terms, than the loans not sold. Therefore, the  sold loans would have had subsidized interest for a longer period of time  and would have cost more.  Because the single illustrative loan did not take  into consideration these differences when estimating cash flows, the model  had problems reestimating the cost of the program.", "In addition to the basic flaw in the methodology, SBA incorrectly calculated  the single illustrative loan\u2019s average loan-term assumptions used in the cash  flow model.  SBA estimated costs of the disaster loan program using  average loan-term assumptions of 16 years for business disaster loans and  17 years for home disaster loans. In our January 2003 report, we raised  concerns about the validity of these assumptions, as our review of disaster  loans sold indicated an average loan term of about 25 years.  SBA\u2019s loan- term assumptions were based on the number of loans, rather than the  dollar value of loans disbursed, and therefore was a straight average rather  than a weighted average. However, SBA found that, for all disaster loans,  the average loan term, based on the dollar value of loans disbursed, was 23  years. Therefore, the model, which used loan terms of 16 and 17 years, did  not consider cash flows for the full term of the loans. Given that the  borrower interest rates on these loans were generally below market rates  and less than SBA\u2019s cost of borrowing from Treasury to finance its loans,  understating the loan term also understated the program costs. According  to SBA, this caused the model to underestimate the cost of the disaster loan  program by 6 to 7 percent.", "Further, during the reestimate process, SBA did not update the estimated  principal and interest with actual collection amounts, which resulted in  inaccurate data being used to calculate costs. These flaws related to the  methodology, loan-term assumptions, use of inaccurate data, and other  problems, resulted in unreliable subsidy cost estimates and reestimates for  the disaster loan program. Collectively, the problems with SBA\u2019s cash flow  model resulted in significant underestimates of the cost of the program,  which was ultimately reflected in the negative balance in the disaster loan  subsidy allowance. The negative balance would occur for programs that  are expected to be profitable, which would not be expected for the disaster  loan program, or when the allowance is overspent, meaning that the  program cost far more than estimated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Model Used to Determine Whether Loan Sales Were Beneficial Was Also Flawed", "paragraphs": ["When SBA sold loans, it used another model, called the hold model, to  estimate the value to the government of holding the loans scheduled for  sale until they were repaid, either at or before maturity.  The hold model  considered the same possible cash flows as the cash flow model used to  estimate the cost of the program, including principal and interest  collections, prepayments, delinquencies, defaults, and recoveries.   However, the hold model differed from the cash flow model because it was  constructed using a different methodology. The hold model measured loans  individually whereas the cash flow model, as previously discussed, used a  single-loan approach.  In addition, expected defaults were determined  differently, which caused the hold model to produce higher default rates  than the cash flow model.  Further, the hold model used economic  variables and performance indicators and the cash flow model did not.  As  a result of these differences, the two models produced different results.   While the hold model\u2019s conceptual design was superior to the cash flow  model, it too contained serious flaws that produced misleading results.", "For example, the hold model erroneously used assumptions in determining  the amount of recoveries expected on defaulted loans. The recovery  assumptions were taken from the cash flow model used to estimate the  cost of the program.  These assumptions were calculated based on actual  recoveries as a percentage of the value of loans disbursed and, therefore,  should have been applied based on the value of loans disbursed. The hold  model, however, erroneously applied this percentage to estimated  defaulted loan amounts, therefore calculating a far lower amount of  estimated recoveries than was appropriate, which made the value of  holding the loans seem much lower. Collectively, problems with SBA\u2019s hold  model caused it to undervalue the loans it sold by about 30 percent,  according to disclosures in SBA\u2019s fiscal year 2003 financial statements.

For example,  when calculating the net book value for the disaster loans that were sold,  SBA did not allocate a portion of the subsidy allowance for financing costs  associated with lending to borrowers at below-market interest rates. Given  that a large portion of the subsidy cost was related to providing below- market borrower interest rates, this omission resulted in a significant  overestimate of the net book value of the loans sold and, therefore, a  significant overestimate of the losses SBA disclosed in its financial  statements related to the sale of its disaster loans.

A direct loan program, including the disaster loan  program, funds its lending to borrowers with the subsidy cost it receives  through appropriations and from borrowing from Treasury. Because the  borrowing is expected to be repaid with collections from borrowers,  borrowing is not a budgeted cost to the program and is accounted for in the  program\u2019s financing account. FCRA requires that the rate of interest  charged to the financing account on the agency\u2019s borrowing be the same as  the interest rate used to discount cash flows (discount rate) when  estimating the subsidy cost for a program.  The equality of these rates is  fundamental to achieving the proper balance in the financing account. If  subsidy cost calculations are accurate and the proper interest rates used,  the financing account will break even over time as it uses collections from  borrowers to repay Treasury borrowings.", "SBA, in coordination with OMB, found that the tools provided to agencies  to calculate interest for the financing account did not adjust the amount of  interest paid by the financing account while the loans were disbursing. The  discount rate used to estimate the subsidy cost is not final until the loans in  a cohort are substantially disbursed (at least 90 percent), which, for the  disaster program, generally may take at least 2 years.  When the loans are  substantially disbursed, and the final discount rate is fixed, the reestimate  process retroactively adjusts the subsidy costs to reflect the final discount  rate.", "SBA and other agencies must make annual interest payments to Treasury  while the loans are disbursing, although the final interest rate has not yet  been determined.  Thus in the early years of a cohort, before the loans are  substantially disbursed, an interim interest rate is used to calculate interest  payments.  However, the tools provided by OMB to calculate interest  between the financing account and Treasury do not retroactively adjust  prior interest earnings or payments to reflect the final interest rate.  This  failure to adjust prior interest payments to reflect the final interest rate  resulted in excess payments to Treasury and an insufficient balance in  SBA\u2019s financing account and subsidy allowance, since the interest  payments impact both.  This omission in the tools OMB provides to all  agencies that disburse or guarantee loans could result in a disconnect  between the amounts required to be earned from or paid to Treasury to  make the financing account whole, and the actual amounts earned or paid.

In contrast to the prior model\u2019s flawed single loan approach to  estimate the cash flows, the new model was designed to estimate cash  flows individually for each loan. This design facilitates calculating loan  values for loans sold to determine gains or losses on loan sales and, if SBA  schedules additional loan sales, could also be used to calculate loan values  for determining whether these sales would be financially beneficial to the  government, thus negating the need for a separate hold model. Application  of the model enabled SBA to retroactively determine the results of its prior  loan sales and to correct the abnormal balance in its subsidy allowance.", "During the development of the new cash flow model, SBA analyzed the  available disaster loan data, including loan performance information, loan  terms, disaster type and magnitude, and regional information, as well as  certain economic data, such as unemployment, gross domestic product,  and interest rates. Based on these analyses, the data that best predicted  default and prepayment behavior\u2014two important cash flows for the  disaster loan program\u2014were selected to use as variables in the model.

Based on these variables, there are a total of 162 groups of  loans used to segment the disaster loan portfolio.", "On a loan-by-loan basis, the cash flow model estimates the expected  principal and interest payments based on loan contract terms. Then the  model estimates deviations from these expected payments for  delinquencies, charge-offs, and prepayments. These deviations are  calculated based on historical averages of loan performance for each group  of loans. Lastly, the model estimates recoveries on charged-off loans based  on historical averages. The model\u2019s methodology is based on the  assumption that the behavior of loans in the future, taking several  important loan characteristics into account, will be similar to loans in the  past.  However, as discussed later, if future loans are made to substantially  different types of borrowers, such as those with better or worse financial  strength, or have substantially different loan terms, changes to the model  would be required to correctly consider these new characteristics in the  cash flow estimates.", "Throughout the development of the model, SBA documented several  analyses of the performance and characteristics of its disaster loans and  the model\u2019s ability to predict loan performance. In addition to its own  analyses, SBA contracted with Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) to conduct an  independent review of the model.  E&Y reviewed the model documentation  and computer code, and reviewed SBA\u2019s testing and validation analyses.  E&Y summarized its observations and findings in two reports issued in  November and December 2003. E&Y noted that the model can be  expected to perform reasonably well for reestimates of existing loans and  to produce stable estimates over time given the model\u2019s emphasis on long- term averages. In addition, E&Y stated that given the limitation of what can  be known about future loans, the model takes a reasonable approach to  estimating costs of future loans for budget purposes.

When SBA used  this new model for the first time to reestimate the cost of the disaster loan  program, it resulted in a reestimate indicating increased costs of over  $1 billion as of the end of fiscal year 2003. As shown in figure 3, the  adjustment to increase these costs on SBA\u2019s books helped bring the disaster  loan program\u2019s subsidy allowance to a positive balance and more in line  with expectations for this type of subsidized program. In SBA\u2019s fiscal year  2004 financial statements, the subsidy allowance was reported to be about  $613 million, or about 20 percent, of the $3 billion outstanding balance of  the disaster loan program.  Given that the estimated cost of the program  generally ranges from $16 to $36 for every $100 that SBA lends, this balance  is within the expected range.

Lastly, additional  procedures to test the disaster data used in the model will help ensure their  reliability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Policies and Procedures Strengthened Internal Controls", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 2003 and 2004, SBA enhanced its policies and  procedures by implementing several of the internal control practices  identified in federal accounting guidance that will help it ensure that future  cost estimates are reliable and reasonable. SBA developed and  implemented standard operating procedures for calculating its reestimates  based on federal accounting guidance.  These procedures established an  internal review process and standardized steps that must be performed and  documented as part of the reestimate process. Steps included ensuring that  the correct cash flow model files are used, verifying that the model  appropriately reflects the program\u2019s structure, documenting any technical  changes to the model, updating actual data and estimated cash flows in the  model, and reviewing the reasonableness of the estimated cash flows. The  procedures also call for the cash flow model to be reviewed by an outside  party. The supporting documentation for the reestimates was provided to  SBA\u2019s financial statement auditor during the fiscal year 2004 audit.  The  auditor noted in its report on internal controls that the adherence to a set of  standard operating procedures for calculating reestimates, along with  improved documentation and an effective internal review process, were  critical to SBA\u2019s success in meeting key milestone dates and completing the  audit process within accelerated financial reporting deadlines.", "SBA also established other important internal control practices identified  in the guidance.  During the development of the new cash flow model, SBA  documented key analyses and decisions regarding the model\u2019s  methodology. For example, SBA compared the characteristics of the loans  sold to the loans kept and developed an approach within the new model to  take those differences into account when estimating loan performance.  It  also documented the basis for selecting the model\u2019s methodology and  variables, the assumptions and calculations in the model, and results of  testing the model\u2019s ability to predict cash flow estimates. This  documentation helps support the rationale and basis for key aspects of the  model that provide important cost information for budgets and financial  statements.", "SBA has also established procedures to coordinate the preparation of cost  estimates among budget, accounting, and program offices. This will help  ensure that the estimates are reviewed and prepared with the proper  information. Further, as previously discussed, SBA implemented the  balances approach for reestimates. This approach will help ensure that  SBA\u2019s account balances are in line with expected future cash flows.  These  practices and the other practices discussed above will help ensure that  anomalies such as those we identified during our last review do not go  undetected or uncorrected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Documentation, Analysis, and Testing Would Improve Long-Term Reliability of Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["While SBA resolved its accounting anomalies related to the disaster loan  program and made important improvements to its policies and procedures,  we found that additional enhancements to internal controls would help  ensure the long-term reliability of future cost estimates. Further,  strengthening internal controls will help SBA identify potential problems in  the future and sustain the progress it has already made.", "Even though SBA completed substantial documentation for the new cash  flow model, we found that this documentation was not sufficient to readily  provide for knowledge transfer between staff and contractors to help  ensure proper maintenance and updating of the model. For example, the  documentation does not specify what is done to prepare the data for use in  the model and does not always clearly indicate the data sources. In  addition, SBA\u2019s documentation to explain the files used to run the model  and update the data used in the model was not complete.  For example, in  SBA\u2019s documentation of the files and steps used to run the cash flow model,  out of a total of 19 steps, 6 steps had no explanations of the process and  another 2 were not complete and indicated that someone who was no  longer employed at SBA was to provide the information.", "Improved documentation is particularly important because SBA relied on a  contractor to help develop the new cash flow model for the disaster loan  program and has recently experienced significant turnover in staff  responsible for preparing cost estimates. Without complete and detailed  documentation on how to maintain the model, update it with additional  data, and run it, it will be more difficult for current SBA staff to fully  understand the model, which could result in future errors in the cash flow  estimates.", "Thorough documentation of the model is even more important given the  complexity associated with its calculation process. E&Y noted in its review,  and we agree, that the model\u2019s complexity creates an ongoing challenge  related to transparency and maintenance.  Because complexity increases  the risk of errors occurring, SBA could benefit from continuing to evaluate  whether there are opportunities to simplify the estimation process with  model revisions or alternative estimation methodologies.", "There may also be opportunities to improve the model with additional  variables. When estimating loan performance, the new model does not use  data related to the financial strength of borrowers.  Because this kind of  information has been shown to be useful in predicting loan performance,  such as defaults and prepayments, incorporating this type of information  could improve the model\u2019s estimates. Further, additional detailed data on  borrower financial strength and loan collateral, among other things, may  improve the model\u2019s effectiveness for supporting any future loan sales.  According to SBA officials, beginning in fiscal year 2003 SBA began  collecting credit scores for disaster loan borrowers. Once these newer  loans have sufficient historical data, SBA will be able to evaluate the  usefulness of these data as a potential variable to predict loan  performance.", "In addition to opportunities to improve the model, SBA could also enhance  its procedures to ensure that the model\u2019s estimates reasonably predict  future loan performance. While SBA has completed testing of the model\u2019s  ability to predict loan performance, it is important that SBA establish a  process to help ensure this testing continues routinely and that causes of  any significant variances are identified and addressed.  For example, as  stated earlier, if future loans are made to substantially different types of  borrowers or have substantially different loan terms, changes to the model  would be required to correctly consider these new characteristics in the  cash flow estimates. Routine testing would help identify this type of  change.", "While the new cash flow model provides SBA with a sound approach to  estimate costs for the disaster loan program, additional verification  procedures would provide better assurance that data used by the model are  reliable.  Federal accounting guidance requires agencies to accumulate  sufficient, relevant, and reliable supporting data that provide a reliable  basis for estimates of future loan performance. Because SBA\u2019s old cash  flow model used data from SBA\u2019s Main On-Line System for Tracking  Evaluation and Response (MONSTER) database which contains summary  information, most of its detailed data reliability assessments and  reconciliation practices revolved around MONSTER. For example, SBA  maintains a reconciliation that tracks loans in MONSTER with its general  ledger at a cohort level. However, the new model uses data from MONSTER  and loan-level data from SBA\u2019s Electronic Loan Information Processing  System (ELIPS) database.  SBA officials indicated that plans are to  continue to move away from using MONSTER. While SBA routinely  reconciles its ELIPS database at a high level, as it moves toward using  ELIPS data for estimating its disaster program costs, it is important that  SBA reconcile and test the data at the level used in the model."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SBA took prompt action to identify the deficiencies related to its disaster  and loan sale programs with a comprehensive review of its financial  records.
