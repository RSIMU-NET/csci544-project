Lands leased under other laws have different distribution requirements. In fiscal year 1996, 41 states received a total of about $481 million in revenues from the development of federal onshore minerals. Wyoming, New Mexico, and California received about $206 million, $124 million, and $28 million, respectively.", "Wyoming, New Mexico, and California also manage mineral development on private and state-owned lands. In these states, revenues from state-owned land are used to fund public educational institutions. Wyoming\u2019s bonus, rental, and royalty revenues from minerals on state-owned land in fiscal year 1996 were $29 million. In New Mexico, these revenues from minerals on state land were $115 million.

Resource planning may include identifying areas with a potential for mineral resources; planning for future mineral development and how that development will affect other resources on the land (such as recreation, livestock grazing, and wildlife); and geophysical exploration by potential lessees. Use authorization includes lease issuance and the approval of post-leasing activities\u2014including the drilling of oil and gas wells and the extraction of other mineral resources\u2014and such associated activities as the construction of roads, facilities, pipelines, storage tanks, and modifications to operations. Once approved and under way, these operations may be inspected periodically to determine whether they comply with applicable laws, regulations, and lease terms.

BLM also issues leases and manages operations for oil, gas, coal, and other minerals (1) on lands with split ownership, namely where the minerals are federally owned but the surface is not, and (2) on certain lands managed by other federal agencies. BLM is also responsible for performing inspections to verify the quantity of minerals produced on federal leases. In addition to MLA, major federal laws governing BLM\u2019s management of onshore minerals include (1) the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976, which gave BLM general management responsibilities for public land, endorsed multiple-use management, and prescribed a planning process similar to the Forest Service\u2019s; (2) NEPA; (3) the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act; (4) the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976; and (5) the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), which was enacted to ensure that the Secretary of the Interior properly accounts for all oil and gas from public lands.", "MMS collects, audits, and disburses most mineral revenues from production on federal lands.

These plans must include public involvement and may be appealed to the agency or challenged in court. The three states we reviewed do not have similar land-use planning processes, and neither Wyoming nor New Mexico has similar requirements for environmental analysis to those for the federal land-managing agencies. In responding to a draft of this report, officials from California\u2019s State Lands Commission commented that the California Environmental Quality Act and other state laws require the protection of the environment, which includes developing environmental information and mitigation requirements; protecting significant environmental values on state lands; and balancing public needs in approving the uses of state lands. A New Mexico state official noted that mineral development in that state does not occur at the expense of archaeological or environmental concerns.", "Federal law also requires certain royalty management activities that are different from state activities. For example, FOGRMA requires the Secretary of the Interior to have a strategy for inspecting oil and gas operations to ensure that all production is reported. This strategy includes inspections of equipment, specific measurement of oil and production, and site security procedures. In contrast, the states rely primarily upon comparisons of royalty and production reports to verify production amounts rather than on field inspections. (See app. II for more details on the states\u2019 activities.)", "Other differences are state-specific. For example, federal land in Wyoming contains over twice as many producing coal leases than does state land. By law, BLM must perform an economic evaluation of coal for leasing but not for oil and gas leasing. The scope of the regulatory agencies\u2019 responsibilities also differs from that of the federal program, as these agencies regulate mineral development on state, private, and in some cases, federal and other land.

(See app. VII.) However, Commission officials commented that our reporting of the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources\u2019 costs overstated the cost of managing state lands. We adjusted the text of our report to clarify that the regulatory agencies\u2019 scope of authority extends beyond state lands in all three states and that about 95 percent of California\u2019s Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources\u2019 time is devoted to regulating the development of minerals on privately owned and other land.

For example, Wyoming received about 43 percent of the federal onshore leasable mineral revenues in fiscal year 1996. To compute the revenue-based allocation, MMS multiplied $57 million by 43 percent, which resulted in an allocation of about $24 million for Wyoming. 3.

One-half of the $28 million is about $14 million. 4. The lower amount is deducted according to each state\u2019s revenue-distribution formula in the following fiscal year.
