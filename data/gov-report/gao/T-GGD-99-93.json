Of the 117 major rules issued by these agencies during this period, the preambles indicated that only 1 had a federalism assessment.  State and local representatives that we consulted said that certain federal agencies should have done assessments for more of these major rules; however, the agencies said that their rules did not have sufficient federalism implications to trigger the executive order\u2019s requirements.  All three of the agencies we visited had some kind of written guidance on the executive order and had designated an official or office responsible for ensuring its implementation.  However, the methods the agencies use to determine whether federalism assessments are needed varied among the agencies.

The executive order establishes a set of fundamental principles and criteria that executive departments and agencies should use when formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications.  For example, the executive order says that federal agencies should refrain to the maximum extent possible from establishing uniform, national standards for programs with federalism implications and that, when national standards are required, they should consult with appropriate officials and organizations representing the states in developing those standards.  The order says that regulations and other policies have federalism implications if they \u201chave substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\u201d", "Executive Order 12612 also contains specific requirements for agency implementation and governmentwide coordination and review.  For example, the head of each executive department and agency is required to designate an official to be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the order, and for determining which proposed policies have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment. If an assessment is prepared, it must accompany any proposed or final rule submitted to OMB for review under Executive Order 12866.  OMB, in turn, is required to ensure that agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions are consistent with the policies, criteria, and requirements in the federalism executive order. and procedural steps during the rulemaking process for certain rules that involve a mandate.", "On May 14, 1998, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13083 on \u201cFederalism,\u201d which was intended to replace both Executive Order 12612 and Executive Order 12875.  The new executive order was to take effect in mid-August 1998, and would have made a number of changes to the specific requirements in Executive Order 12612.  For example, agencies would no longer have been required to designate an official to ensure implementation of federalism requirements, and would not have been required to prepare federalism assessments for regulations and other policies with federalism implications.  However, the President suspended Executive Order 13083 before it became effective in response to concerns raised by the National Governors\u2019 Association and other interested parties.  Many of the commentators objected to the new order because they believed it expanded the federal government\u2019s authority to make national policies and standards.  There was also criticism that the new order was issued without consulting affected state and local government representatives. With the suspension of Executive Order 13083, Executive Order 12612 remains the primary presidential directive to federal agencies on how they are to develop and implement regulations that have federalism implications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Rules Address Executive Order 12612 Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Executive Order 12612 does not require agencies to mention the order in the preamble to their final rules or to note in those preambles whether a federalism assessment was prepared.  Therefore, our review of the rule preambles does not show whether agencies considered the executive order or whether the agencies prepared federalism assessments.  However, mentioning the executive order in the preamble to a final rule is a clear indication that the agency was aware of and considered its requirements in some way.

At least one of the four organizations indicated that 79 of the 116 rules should have had a federalism assessment.

One facet of the ASPE\u2019s review is to determine whether the rules comply with Executive Order 12612.

The guidance indicates that a rule should be considered to have significant federalism implications if it (1) has a direct causal effect on the states; (2) primarily relates to the structure and role of states (e.g., not just a reduction in funding of grant programs); (3) has effects within a reasonably foreseeable time frame (e.g., within the next 5 years); and (4) has a significant incremental effect (e.g., requiring states to do something that they are not already doing).   The guidance also says that an assessment must be prepared if an action will directly create significant effects on states even if the action is mandated by law or the department otherwise has no discretion.
