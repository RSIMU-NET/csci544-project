For example, the act required OMB to issue guidance to agencies for reducing reporting burden for federal award recipients (including both grantees and contractors) based on the pilot's findings. OMB partially met this requirement because the guidance it issued only applied to grants.", "The pilot program consisted of two parts, which differed considerably in both design and results: The grants portion, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), examined six approaches for reducing grantee reporting burden and found positive results related to reductions in reporting time as well as reduced duplication. HHS incorporated ongoing stakeholder input during the pilot, and its findings contributed to government-wide initiatives related to federal reporting and reducing grantee-reporting burden.", "The procurement (contracts) portion of the pilot, led by OMB with assistance from the General Services Administration (GSA), did not collect sufficient evidence to determine whether centralizing procurement reporting through a single web-based portal would reduce contractor reporting burden\u2014a key objective of the pilot. The pilot planned to test the portal by collecting weekly Davis-Bacon wage data from a minimum of 180 contractors, potentially resulting in thousands of submissions over a year. However, in the end, the pilot did not result in any Davis-Bacon data due to lack of contractor participation and the absence of iterative and ongoing stakeholder engagement. Subsequently, OMB expanded the pilot to include hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) reporting but received only 11 HFC submissions. (See figure.) In addition, HFC reporting was not suited for assessing changes in reporting burden because it was a new requirement and thus no comparative data existed.

In addition, the DATA Act added section 5 to  the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006  (FFATA), which provided an opportunity for simplifying reporting for  federal contracts, awards, and subawards. Toward that end, the act  required OMB, or a federal agency designated by OMB, to establish a  pilot program to test potential approaches for reducing reporting burden  for federal award recipients\u2013-both grantees and contractors  (procurement).

To meet these requirements, OMB established a pilot  program with two components\u2014one that focused on federal grants and  another on federal contracts (procurement). OMB designated HHS as the  executing agency of the grants portion of the Section 5 Pilot with  oversight from OFFM. OFPP was responsible for designing and leading  the procurement portion of the pilot focusing on reporting of Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) procurement requirements. OFPP  collaborated with the Chief Acquisitions Officers\u2019 Council and GSA on  specific aspects of implementation including the development of the  Central Reporting Portal, a reporting tool which is intended to centralize  FAR reporting. See figure 1 for a timeline of the activities undertaken by  the grants and procurement portions of the pilot as well as deadlines  required by the act.", "As part of our ongoing oversight of the DATA Act\u2019s implementation, we  have monitored OMB\u2019s efforts to meet its statutory requirements related  to the Section 5 Pilot. In April 2016, we reported on the design plans for  the Section 5 Pilot. We found that HHS\u2019s design for the grants portion of  the pilot was generally on track to meet statutory requirements and  partially adhered to leading pilot design practices. However, we also  reported that the procurement portion was not on track to meet  requirements, and that its plans did not follow leading pilot design  practices. In response to a recommendation in our report, OMB revised  its plan for the procurement portion to better reflect leading practices for  pilot design identified in our April 2016 report. These changes included  more fully documenting its data collection plans and including a sampling  plan to meet diversity requirements for pilot participants.", "According to OMB staff, the ongoing work and related grants guidance  resulting from the Section 5 Pilot reflects a broader strategy for reducing  federal recipient reporting burden that is outlined in the President\u2019s  Management Agenda (PMA). Released in March of 2018, and led by the  Executive Office of the President and the President\u2019s Management  Council, PMA is a strategy to modernize how federal agencies deliver  mission outcomes and provide services in three key areas: (1) modern  information technology; (2) data, accountability, and transparency; and (3)  the workforce for the 21st Century.", "Several Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goals include PMA\u2019s milestones and  activities. These CAP goals identify opportunities for multiple agencies to  collaborate on government-wide efforts and report on goal progress  quarterly. Two of these, CAP Goals 5 and 8, include strategies for  reducing federal award recipient reporting burden. OMB staff told us that  some of the findings from the Section 5 Pilot and recommendations from  their subsequent report to Congress informed the focus of these CAP  goals. For example, according to OMB staff, the grants portion of the  Section 5 Pilot focused on identifying how changes in grants data  collection and grant management may reduce federal recipient reporting  burden.

Although the $122 billion in grants included in the pilot greatly  exceeded the upper bound, this was principally a result of the decisions  by OFFM and HHS to pilot different test models for reducing reporting  burden, and to include a wide range of different types of grants. The total  value of grant awards exceeded the amount envisioned by the act.", "OMB\u2019s August 2017 report stated that the decision to go beyond the  minimum requirement of testing one approach was made in the interest of  achieving the DATA Act\u2019s objective to identify ways to reduce reporting  burden as well as the effect this decision would have on the aggregate  value of grants sampled. We believe that the pilot substantively met this  requirement and did not identify any negative effects related to the larger  aggregate value of grants, contracts, and subawards included in the  grants portion of the pilot. We found that the approach followed by OMB  and HHS furthered the broader objective identified by this section of the  act.", "In addition, we determined that the pilot partially met two of the act\u2019s  requirements. The first of these requirements concerns the act\u2019s  requirement that OMB\u2019s report to Congress include a description of the  data collected, the usefulness of the data provided, and the cost to collect  pilot data from participants. The report that OMB issued to Congress in  August 2017 included information on the first two of these but only partly  addressed the third. Specifically, it contained cost information for only the  grants portion of the pilot, stating that the cost associated with executing  this portion during fiscal years 2015 through 2017 was more than $5.5  million. The report did not contain any cost information on the  procurement portion of the pilot.", "The DATA Act also required that OMB issue guidance to agencies for  reducing reporting burden for federal award recipients\u2014including both  grantees and contractors\u2014but the guidance subsequently issued only  pertained to the grants community. We determined that OMB only  partially met this requirement. On September 5, 2018, OMB issued M-18- 24: Strategies to Reduce Grant Recipient Reporting Burden. Among other  things, this memorandum contained guidance to federal agencies making  the SF-424B form optional based on findings from the grants portion of  the pilot.

These recommendations  covered (1) standardizing core data elements, (2) eliminating duplication  through auto-population of data, and (3) leveraging information  technology open data standards to develop new tools across the federal  government. We found that evidence from the grant test models  supported all three recommendations for streamlining federal reporting  discussed in the report. For example, OMB recommended that its staff  standardize core data elements used for managing federal financial  assistance awards based on reductions in administrative burden  experienced in the CDER Library 1 test model. In another example, four  test models supported OMB\u2019s recommendation for increased use of data  auto-population from existing federal data sources as a way to reduce  duplication in reporting.", "Findings from the grants portion of the Section 5 Pilot also provided  support for government-wide efforts to streamline reporting and reduce  recipient reporting burden.

Among  other things, M-18-24 requires that federal agencies evaluate the systems  and methods currently used to collect information from grant recipients to  eliminate duplicative data requests. OMB staff confirmed that M-18-24  incorporates findings from some of the test models of the grants portion of  the pilot such as the Single Audit test model, which examined reducing  duplicative reporting of grant recipients\u2019 data. The efforts to reduce  duplicative reporting in M-18-24 also align with OMB\u2019s recommendation in  its August 2017 report to Congress to eliminate unnecessary duplication  in reporting by leveraging information technology that can auto-populate  from existing data sources.", "In addition, OMB staff told us that findings from the grants portion of the  pilot contributed to broader, government-wide initiatives related to federal  reporting. For example, according to OMB staff, the three  recommendations from the August 2017 report to Congress are reflected  in CAP Goal 8 of the President\u2019s Management Agenda, which focuses on  results-oriented accountability for grants. These OMB staff also told us  that findings from the grants portion of the pilot informed two CAP Goal 8  strategies. For example, the CAP Goal 8 grants management strategy  focuses on standardizing grants management business processes and  data. OMB developed a comprehensive taxonomy for core grants  management data standards that is currently available for public  comment. In addition, a second strategy focuses on incorporating a risk- based performance management approach to metrics in grant award  operations to determine low-risk and high-value federal awards.

OMB\u2019s Office of Federal  Procurement Policy (OFPP) sought to assess five test models that,  according to the report to Congress, were essential to centralized  procurement reporting. However, the pilot did not fully test any of the  hypotheses associated with those test models. The reasons for not  testing the hypotheses included a lack of contractor participation and a  lack of iterative and ongoing stakeholder participation and engagement  throughout the course of the pilot. See appendix III for additional  information regarding the various procurement test models, associated  hypotheses, and additional details regarding our assessment.", "The procurement portion of the pilot focused entirely on the development  and testing of a central reporting portal to consolidate FAR reporting  requirements. According to OFPP staff, the pilot intended to eventually  identify ways to centralize a wide range of reporting requirements that  contractors currently meet through decentralized methods. Contractors  must report many types of information depending on the contract. Toward  that end, OFPP, with the assistance of GSA, created a procurement  reporting website called the Central Reporting Portal. To test the efficacy  of this portal for reducing burden, OFPP initially decided to examine how  well it handled a specific FAR reporting requirement\u2014the reporting of  payroll data in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. According to pilot  plans, Davis-Bacon reporting requirements were selected because they  were identified by contractors as \u201cpain points\u201d during initial stakeholder  outreach conducted in 2014 and 2015. OFPP planned to collect and  analyze 1 year of weekly Davis-Bacon wage reporting data from at least  180 contractors through the Central Reporting Portal to identify how  centralized reporting might reduce contractor reporting burden.", "However, during the 12-month procurement data collection period, no  contractors agreed to submit their Davis-Bacon data as part of the pilot.  Consequently, OFPP did not collect any wage data. Despite OFPP  stating in its plans and reiterating to us as late as September 2017 that it  expected to be able to secure at least 180 pilot participants, only one  contractor expressed interest in reporting its Davis-Bacon information  using the portal. This contractor withdrew from the pilot before  submitting any data through the Central Reporting Portal. OFPP staff told  us they were aware of the potential for low pilot participation for Davis- Bacon reporting when pilot testing began in February 2017 because  contractors already had established processes for fulfilling the highly  complex Davis-Bacon reporting requirements, and pilot participation was  optional. According to GSA contracting staff, the one contractor who  initially expressed interest ultimately decided not to participate because  the format in which the contractor tracked and reported payroll data was  incompatible with that used by the pilot portal, resulting in additional  burden.", "However, it was not until August 2017\u2014approximately 7 months into its  year-long data collection period\u2014that specific steps were taken to  address the fact that the procurement portion of the pilot had not collected  any data from Davis Bacon contractors. During this period OFPP did not  conduct pilot outreach activities with the contractors, who were key to  successful implementation of the pilot. OFPP staff told us that at the time  of the pilot launch they learned that contractors were interested in having  the Central Reporting Portal be able to communicate with third-party  payroll reporting systems to automate reporting. OFPP staff said that  although they are exploring this possibility, it was not a capability that was  included as part of the pilot. Had this type of feedback on stakeholder  needs been obtained sooner, OMB could have explored the feasibility of  adding this capability to the portal or engaged in communication with  stakeholders to develop alternate approaches that might have persuaded  more contractors to participate.", "The usefulness of iterative and ongoing communication is recognized by  the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. Those  standards state that management should use quality information to  achieve its objectives, and that management should collect quality  information by engaging with stakeholders through iterative and ongoing  processes and in a timely manner. In this case, key stakeholders include  relevant agencies, contracting officials, and contractors using the system.  OFPP\u2019s plan for the procurement portion of the pilot recognized the  importance of stakeholder engagement stating that, to include a diverse  group of recipients in the pilot, they should identify eligible participants for  the pilot, conduct outreach to identify participants, and repeat this process  as necessary until they achieved the sample necessary to test the Central  Reporting Portal. However, as previously stated, no contractors agreed  to submit their Davis-Bacon data as part of the pilot. Therefore, OFPP did  not repeat this process until the pilot obtained the necessary sample size.  Such interactions could have provided important information on  contractors\u2019 needs and concerns that OFPP could have used to inform  their decisions regarding the pilot\u2019s implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expansion of Procurement Pilot to Include Hydrofluorocarbon Reporting Had Limitations", "paragraphs": ["In November 2017, OFPP expanded the type of data accepted by the  pilot to include hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) reporting, a new FAR reporting  requirement. However, this choice had limitations in its suitability for  providing useful data for testing the hypotheses of the five procurement  test models. Unlike Davis-Bacon reporting, where contractors submit  weekly reports, HFC is an annual reporting requirement for contractors  that emit HFC gases over a certain threshold. The Central Reporting  Portal is the only location where contractors can submit HFC reporting.  For the purposes of the pilot, the Central Reporting Portal accepted HFC  submissions from November 2017 through February 2018.", "During the pilot, 11 HFC annual reports were submitted to the portal (see  figure 3). As a result of the small number of reports collected, OMB  collected much less data than it had initially expected to receive to test  the capabilities of the Central Reporting Portal. If the procurement portion  of the pilot had been executed as planned, it could have theoretically  resulted in 9,360 Davis-Bacon submissions for analysis. A larger data  set of contractors\u2019 experiences using the Central Reporting Portal could  have informed OMB\u2019s decision-making process through analysis of more,  and potentially more varied data.", "In addition to the small number of submitted HFC annual reports, the  decision to switch to using HFC data had another limitation. These data  could not be used to examine changes in reporting burden as a result of  using the Central Reporting Portal. This is because HFC reporting was a  new reporting requirement, and as such, it did not have an established  reporting process to use as a point of comparison to assess changes in  reporting burden.
