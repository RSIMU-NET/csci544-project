In Cape Verde, MCC altered the scope of its three projects, meeting some key original targets and many final targets by the compact's end. For example, an activity to upgrade and expand a major port in Cape Verde, which represented almost 50 percent of the $110.1 million compact at signature, faced inaccurate early planning assumptions and increased costs. As a result, MCC split the port activity into two phases, funding the completion of the first phase--which covered about one-third of total expected costs for the port activity. In Honduras, MCC met a key original target and most final targets by the end of the $205 million compact. For example, MCC constructed approximately half of the planned highway and all rescoped secondary roads. In addition, several compact activities in Cape Verde and Honduras face challenges to long-term sustainability. Although MCC took steps to provide for sustainability, the governments of both Cape Verde and Honduras may have difficulty maintaining the infrastructure projects in the long term due to lack of funding, among other challenges. For example, MCC included privatization of port operations and road maintenance funding as conditions of the Cape Verde compact. However, the government has had difficulty meeting these requirements, calling into question the long-term sustainability of some projects. In Honduras, both uncertain government funding for road maintenance and design decisions on construction projects may jeopardize the sustainability of MCC-funded roads. MCC impact evaluations for the Cape Verde and Honduras compacts are ongoing but delayed, and updated economic rate of return (ERR) analyses of the largest compact projects have not been well documented or linked to revised targets. MCC has taken steps to modify impact evaluation designs in response to implementation challenges and delays. For example, challenges in implementing the original evaluation design for the farmer training and development activity in Honduras led MCC to enhance the methodology by adding a supplemental design. Furthermore, updated ERR analyses of projects representing over 50 percent of compact funds have not been well documented or supported. For example, MCC updated its ERR analysis for the Honduras transportation project, but documentation for the underlying quantitative analysis supporting the updated ERR is not available. Additionally, ERR analyses updated in response to rescoping compact activities were not consistently linked to revised targets and indicators. For example, MCC updated the ERR analysis for the watershed management and agricultural support project in Cape Verde, but the analysis does not reflect the values and numerical ranges of key revised targets. In addition, although original ERRs are estimated for a 20-year period, MCC has not developed guidance for updating ERRs following compact completion. Re-estimated end-of-compact ERRs will likely be lower than predicted at compact signature."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that MCC (1) work with countries to make decisions that reduce long-term maintenance needs, (2) ensure updated economic analyses are documented and consistent with monitoring targets, and (3) develop guidance for updating economic analyses following compact completion.

We reviewed MCC guidance and policy documents, as well as the  compacts and monitoring and evaluation plans for each country, to  identify criteria for our assessment. We interviewed MCC officials in  Washington, D.C., as well as MCC and Millennium Challenge Account  (MCA) officials in Cape Verde and Honduras, regarding the results of  each compact activity, including the quality and sustainability of the  projects. We also visited compact projects in both countries and met with  contractors, construction supervisors, grantees, and beneficiaries.", "We focused our review more heavily on activities that represent a higher  proportion of compact funds in both countries. In assessing and reporting  MCC\u2019s results, we compared actual results achieved at the end of the  compact for select performance indicators to both the original and, in  some cases, revised targets associated with each indicator. We  considered the original target to be that which was first documented for  each performance indicator, and the final target to be the target last  documented in MCC monitoring documents. Given that MCC tracked  several performance indicators for each compact project, we reported on  key indicators that most closely represented the goal of each compact  activity and also considered which indicators MCC reports in its public  communications. Additionally, we reviewed the monitoring information  collected by MCC and MCA and interviewed officials and contractors  about the quality of the data. In reviewing the extent to which MCC has  assessed progress toward the compacts\u2019 goals, we reviewed planned  evaluation designs and interviewed officials from MCC and MCA, as well  as impact evaluators.

According to the contractor, ministry  staff have multiple responsibilities, including involvement in multiple  donors\u2019 agriculture-related projects.  \uf0b7  MCA-Cape Verde determined that all MFIs performed well under the  access to credit activity, and MCC converted the loans to grants at the  end of the compact, which will sustain agricultural loan efforts for at  least 2 years.", "Private sector development project. MCC required the Cape Verde  Chambers of Commerce, the implementers of a new credit bureau, to  secure a private sector partner and private sector investments to help  support the bureau before MCC provided funding to the chambers.  Private ownership may provide an incentive to enhance the sustainability  of the credit bureau.", "Transportation project. To enhance the sustainability of its  transportation project investments, MCC conditioned compact funding  disbursements on the government meeting increased road maintenance  funding levels and included a vehicle weight control activity in the project.  However, the funding levels that the government achieved may not be  sufficient to fund all road maintenance needs. In addition, the weight  control activity was terminated. Both issues call into question the long- term sustainability of the infrastructure project activities.  \uf0b7  According to the compact, the key issue for sustainability of the  transportation project is routine, periodic, and emergency road  maintenance, such as sealing cracks, repainting the pavement  markings, cleaning ditches and drainage structures, repairing  potholes, resurfacing, and clearing landslides. As a condition of  compact funding, MCC and the Honduran government agreed to  increase funding levels for maintenance, which the government met,  increasing funding from $37 million in 2005 to $64 million in 2010.  However, this funding is to maintain all Honduran roads, not  specifically compact-funded roads and does not ensure road  maintenance after 2010. According to MCC officials, they expect that  the Honduran government will maintain the MCC-funded sections of  CA-5 and some of the key secondary roads but are concerned that it  may not be at the level required to maximize the roads' lifespan.  Contractors and construction supervisors also expressed concerns  that the roads will be adequately maintained. According to  transportation ministry officials and documents, the government\u2019s  maintenance allocation for 2010 represents less than half of the road  maintenance allocation required by Honduran law and is about 30  percent of the amount officials estimate is needed to maintain the  roads.  \uf0b7  The extent to which the Honduran government implements the vehicle  weight control activity, which MCC eliminated in 2009 in response to  the political situation, also affects sustainability. According to  government officials, a large number of truckers exceed legal weight  limits. Without enforcement of weight limits on the CA-5 and other  MCC-funded roads, the roads will deteriorate faster and require  additional maintenance.", "In addition, decisions to limit certain design features may present  challenges to maintaining the reconstructed roads. We observed quality  deficiencies\u2014erosion, roughness, and landslides\u2014that will likely increase  the amount and cost of maintenance needed over time (see fig. 7).  Failure to perform needed maintenance will result in road deterioration  decreasing the road-user cost benefits expected from the improved  roads. Most of these deficiencies could have been mitigated during  project design and construction. For example, the project designer could  have included the International Roughness Index (IRI) measures in the  contract documents as a performance specification, requiring the  contractor to meet IRI targets set by MCC and MCA-Honduras\u2014which  would decrease long-term maintenance and road-user costs.  Additionally, landslides and their associated maintenance costs could  have been minimized if more detailed geotechnical analysis evaluating  slope stability had been conducted during design. Such analysis would  have enabled designers to include landslide stabilization and prevention  measures in the construction plans. A more detailed geotechnical study  regarding slope stability was completed for portions of CA-5 section 2  after a landslide occurred.", "Rural development project. MCC took steps to increase the  sustainability of activities under the rural development project. The  sustainability of some activities was enhanced by these steps, but for  other activities challenges remain.  \uf0b7  The contractor for the farmer training activity involved the private  sector in program activities, including buyers, wholesalers, and input  and equipment service providers to increase sustainability. The farmer  training activity also helped farmers form associations to increase the  sustainability of techniques and production practices. However,  according to the contractor and Honduran farmers, some program  farmers, who began receiving assistance late in the compact, are  expected to face difficulty sustaining new techniques without the  support of technicians.", "In many cases, responsibility for maintenance of upgraded farm-to- market roads resides with the municipalities where the roads are  located. However, according to MCA-Honduras officials, the  municipalities lack equipment, expertise, and funding for road  maintenance.  \uf0b7  MCA-Honduras took steps to increase the sustainability of the farmer  access to credit activity in Honduras by enabling the agricultural credit  fund to continue for 5 years beyond the end of the compact. In  addition, according to the activity contractor, the financial products  developed with the technical assistance are self-sustaining and self- financing.  \uf0b7  Local organizations supported the implementation of the agricultural  public goods grants, which will help improve the activity\u2019s  sustainability, according to MCA-Honduras officials.

MCC  engaged an impact evaluator in the last year of implementation of the  watershed management and agricultural support project, and slower  than expected project implementation has delayed final data collection  for the impact evaluation. According to the independent evaluator  hired to assess the project, designing the evaluation after compact  implementation may limit the quality of the results by, for instance,  hindering the collection of quality baseline data. Baseline data were  collected before project implementation, but the impact evaluator has  cited concerns about the quality of this data. According to MCC  officials, MCC plans to address these concerns about the quality of  baseline data through additional data collection.  \uf0b7  Private sector development project. The private sector  development project, which was significantly rescoped, will not be  assessed using a quantitative evaluation since the technical  assistance provided did not lend itself to a quantitative evaluation;  however, a qualitative evaluation has been completed.", "Honduras. Project delays and challenges in implementing originally  planned impact evaluation designs have slowed progress of some impact  evaluations. MCC initially anticipated completing impact evaluations for  the Honduras compact projects by the end of the compact. However,  according to MCC officials, MCC modified its approach to impact  evaluations so that evaluations are completed after the end of the  compact.  \uf0b7  Transportation project. The impact evaluation for the transportation  project began before project implementation, but delays in road  construction led to delays in collecting necessary data and completing  the evaluation. According to the impact evaluator, other than some  delays in final data collection, the transportation impact evaluation  was planned with a robust design and has been implemented as  planned.  \uf0b7  Farmer training and development activity. Challenges encountered  in implementing the original evaluation design led to potential  limitations in the results. As a result, MCC added a supplemental  design to enhance the methodology. Specifically, the impact evaluator  had identified a certain group of farmers to participate in the program  and serve as a sample for the evaluation. However, the activity  contractor chose not to train a large portion of the selected group,  reducing the sample size for the evaluation and potentially limiting the  results. According to MCC, the challenge in implementing the original  evaluation design arose because the contractor was focused on  achieving targets set in the contract, instead of implementing the  activity in parallel with the evaluation methodology, which was not  outlined in the contract. MCC noted that this experience highlighted  the importance of incorporating impact evaluation designs into  implementation plans and contracts and the need to anticipate and  manage potential tradeoffs.  \uf0b7  Farmer access to credit activity. According to the impact evaluator,  the assessment of the farmer access to credit activity was  complicated by changes that took place during implementation, such  as the expansion of the activity beyond an exclusive focus on program  farmers, as well as the delay in program implementation. By the time  changes were made to the activity, no baseline data had been  collected. Subsequently, MCA-Honduras hired a third-party contractor  to collect qualitative data. However, when the impact evaluator\u2019s  contract ended at the end of the compact, these data had not been  analyzed and an evaluation report had not been completed as  originally intended.  \uf0b7  Agricultural public goods grants facility activity. The impact  evaluator conducted an economic rate of return calculation by  comparing the costs and benefits that resulted from the agricultural  public goods grants facility activity. For example, the report compared  the expected costs and benefits as a result of certain grant activities  with the estimated costs and benefits had the grant activity not been  implemented.

However, the updated ERR analyses were not always  well-documented or supported. In addition, the analyses were not  consistently updated when projects or activities were rescoped or when  key targets were revised, as stated in MCC guidance and policy  documents.", "Updated ERR analyses were not well-documented or supported for  projects constituting almost 50 percent of compact funds in Cape Verde  and more than 65 percent of compact funds in Honduras.  \uf0b7  For Cape Verde, MCC increased its ERR for the port improvement  activity from 23 percent to 29 percent as the investment cost tripled.  In re-estimating the ERR, MCC relied on a new model prepared by a  French engineering consulting firm. The model incorporated efficiency  gains leading to benefits to consumers and firms, such as reduced  wait times and other cost savings. The analysis assumes that these  benefits also have an economywide effect. However, MCC does not  have documentation for the modeling of the economywide effect. As a  result, it is unclear how the analysis incorporates the project\u2019s effect  on the overall economy. If the economywide effect is not taken into  account, the activity ERR drops from 28.6 percent to 9.3 percent,  which is below MCC\u2019s hurdle rate of 10 percent cited in the MCC  Cape Verde restructuring memo. However, according to an MCC  official, the prevailing hurdle rate was 4.8 percent, and thus the  investment remained well above the minimum standard established  for Cape Verde. Furthermore, the extent to which consumers will  benefit from the project is also not clear.  \uf0b7  For Honduras, the original economic analysis for the transportation  project established an ERR of 24 percent. Updates of the monitoring  and evaluation plan in 2008 and 2010 cite an ERR of 12 percent.  However, documentation for the underlying quantitative analysis  supporting the updated ERR is not available.", "Updated ERR analyses do not always reflect changes in key targets  revised after decisions about project rescoping have been made.  \uf0b7  For Cape Verde, when each of the three projects was rescoped, MCC  updated all relevant ERR analysis. However, the updated ERR  analysis does not reflect the values or numerical ranges of key  updated targets in the monitoring and evaluation plan. For example,  the revised targets for the watershed management and agricultural  support project include a revised volume of available water of 627,500  cubic meters, but in the updated ERR analysis, total water capacity is  17,000 cubic meters. In addition, the revised targets for the project  include a farmer productivity target of 9.4 to 14.3 tons of crops per  hectare, which overlaps only slightly with the range for farmer  productivity of 13 to 20 tons of crops per hectare in the updated ERR  analysis.  \uf0b7  For Honduras, where both compact projects were rescoped, MCC did  not update the projected ERRs for the transportation and rural  development projects to reflect all changes. For example, for the  transportation project, MCC eliminated the weight control activity but  did not update the project level ERR in the revised monitoring and  evaluation plan to reflect this rescoping. In addition, the projected  ERR for the farm-to-market roads activity was updated in the revised  monitoring and evaluation plans, but this update was not incorporated  in revising the rural development project level ERR. Moreover, MCC  revised key targets, but the ERR analyses do not reflect those  revisions. For example, the original ERR analysis for the farmer  training and development activity of the rural development project is  based on 14,400 hectares of high-value crops at the end of the  compact. The 2008 and 2010 monitoring and evaluation plans  establish revised targets of 11,830 and 8,400 hectares, respectively,  at compact completion but do not revise the ERR.", "MCC officials stated that when key indicators and targets were modified,  MCC assessed the effects of these changes on ERRs using the existing  models but did not formally document those assessments.

Although MCC does not  have guidance that requires re-estimation of ERRs, it plans to update  ERRs for its investments in Cape Verde and Honduras. Since the initial  ERR analysis is an estimate of the expected total increase in incomes  over a typical 20-year period attributable to a proposed MCC-funded  project relative to the total costs, ERR analysis at compact completion  can provide updated estimates based on actual project costs. Further, for  projects or activities that have been rescoped, revised estimates of  benefits can be included in the ERR analysis. In addition, when data on  actual benefits accrued to project beneficiaries are collected by impact  evaluations, these data can also be used to re-estimate the ERRs.  According to MCC officials, MCC requires independent evaluators to  calculate ERRs at compact completion, but guidance is currently not  available to guide this analysis. In the case of the sole Honduras ERR  calculated at compact completion to date by an independent evaluator, in  the absence of guidance, the evaluator prepared the ERR analysis in  such a way that it cannot be compared to the initial ERR estimate.  Furthermore, even though the original ERRs are estimated over a 20-year  period, according to MCC officials, MCC has not yet determined whether  it will re-estimate the returns as additional benefit data from impact  evaluations or other sources become available.

For any further re-estimates of Cape Verde  and Honduras ERRs, several factors would likely contribute to lower  estimates of returns on investments than originally predicted\u2014as seen in  the following examples.  \uf0b7  Reductions in projects\u2019 or activities\u2019 original scopes while MCC  investments remained largely unchanged would lower expected  benefits. For example, for the Honduras transportation project, MCC  reduced the scope of the secondary roads construction activities to  align actual costs with project allocations and terminated the weight  control activity. Similarly, in Cape Verde, MCC funded about one-third  of the port improvement activity.  \uf0b7  Measured results that lagged behind project or activity targets would  lead to lower benefits than originally projected. For example, the  original ERR analysis of the rural development project in Cape Verde  assumed that the project would lead to 111 hectares under drip  irrigation; however, by compact completion, about 13 hectares were  under drip irrigation.", "Factors subsequent to compact completion  \uf0b7  Cost overruns for MCC-funded projects not finished by compact  completion would lead to lower ERRs. Costs for the Cape Verde port  improvement activity, which was not finished by compact completion,  are currently estimated at about $148 million. These costs exceed  both the estimated investment costs of about $106 million for the  activity in the updated ERR analysis and the cost contingency of 20  percent included in the updated analysis, totaling approximately $127  million.  \uf0b7  Factors affecting long-term sustainability, such as maintenance of the  physical infrastructure and future training to prevent depreciation of  acquired skills and human capital, can affect estimated benefits. For  example, according to MCA-Honduras officials, the sustainability of  many of the farm-to-market roads constructed for the Honduras rural  development project is in question because the municipal  governments responsible for maintaining the roads lack equipment  and expertise.

MCC directed the  majority of funding in the Cape Verde and Honduras compacts to  infrastructure projects, and for the economic benefits of these  investments to be realized, the projects must be properly sustained over  the planned 20-year benefit period. To promote sustainability, MCC took  steps to require partner countries to plan to efficiently operate and  maintain the infrastructure, including privatization of port operations in  Cape Verde and the provision of road maintenance funding in Cape  Verde and Honduras. The partner countries made progress meeting  MCC\u2019s requirements in these areas, but they continue to face funding and  other challenges that are key to sustainability. At the same time, MCC lost  its ability to influence country decisions regarding sustainability once the  compacts ended. In addition, MCC and MCA made design decisions that  did not include measures to minimize landslides and erosion and did not  include international roughness criteria among the contract specifications,  which will result in higher long-term maintenance costs. In light of road  maintenance funding deficits in both countries, these decisions put the  sustainability of MCC-funded roads at risk.", "MCC\u2019s ERR projections serve as the foundation and economic  justification for MCC\u2019s investments.

We  interviewed MCC officials in Washington, D.C., regarding their processes  for overseeing compact activities. We traveled to Santiago and Santo  Ant\u00e3o islands in Cape Verde in December 2010 and Tegucigalpa,  Honduras, in November 2010. We interviewed MCC and Millennium  Challenge Account (MCA) officials in both countries regarding the results of  each compact activity, including the quality and sustainability of the  projects. We visited infrastructure projects in both countries, including visits  to the port and to roads and bridges in Cape Verde, and to the CA-5  highway, and secondary and farm-to-market roads in Honduras. We met  with project construction contractors, independent construction supervisors,  and MCA project management consultants. We interviewed contractors  and grantees of noninfrastructure activities and held meetings with  beneficiaries of certain projects. For Cape Verde, we interviewed the  contractor and two grantees for the access to credit activity, the contractor  for the credit bureau activity under the private sector development project,  and the contractor and eight beneficiaries of the watershed management  and agricultural support project, including the farmer training activity. For  Honduras, we interviewed the contractor and more than 30 beneficiaries of  the farmer training and development activity, contractors and several  financial institutions participating in the farmer access to credit activity, and  three grantees in the agricultural public goods grants activity. In addition,  we interviewed officials from the governments of Cape Verde and  Honduras about compact implementation, results, and sustainability,  including Cape Verde\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Rural Development and  Marine Resources, Port Authority, and Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport  and Telecommunications, and Honduras\u2019 Ministry of Transportation,  Ministry of the Presidency, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Finance.

MCC used these performance  indicators and targets to track progress and assess results of compact  activities; thus, we used these indicators and targets as criteria for  assessing MCC results achieved. To track progress toward compact  goals, MCA is required to compile and submit a performance indicator  tracking table on a quarterly basis as part of its quarterly disbursement  request package sent to MCC. This tracking table displays performance  targets and progress on all performance indicators included in a country\u2019s  monitoring and evaluation plan. A complete indicator tracking table  provides detailed information that shows cumulative past performance,  recently completed performance, and the remaining annual targets for  each performance indicator. We collected and analyzed all available  indicator tracking tables for both countries to account for the actual results  achieved against each performance target throughout the compact. We  met with MCA staff in Cape Verde and Honduras about the steps they  took to ensure that data used to track program results were valid, reliable,  and timely, including conducting periodic data checks and hiring  independent evaluators to review the reliability of data.

Given that there were three versions of the monitoring and  evaluation plan for each country, we considered the original target to be  the one listed the first time a performance indicator was introduced and  the final target the one listed in the final 2010 monitoring and evaluation  plan. In addition, in some cases, MCC revised the name or  characterization of a performance indicator while the definition and type of  measurement remained constant. In these cases, we chose to report the  original target as that associated with the original or parent indicator, and  the final target as that associated with the revised indicator. Given that  MCC tracked several performance indicators for each compact project,  we chose to report on a selection of key indicators that most closely  represented the goal of each compact activity. For example, we reported  the volume of available water for the water management and soil  conservation activity in Cape Verde but did not report the value of  irrigation construction contracts signed. In addition, we considered which  performance indicators MCC selected to report on in its public  communications about compact results. We did not report results for  indicators that MCC eliminated and stopped tracking during the life of the  compact, but we reported on such eliminated indicators in discussions of  canceled or rescoped activities.", "To examine the extent to which infrastructure projects met performance  targets, met quality standards, and were sustainable, we interviewed  MCA officials, project construction contractors, independent construction  supervisors, project management consultants, the Cape Verde port  design engineer, and officials with the Honduran ministries of  transportation and finance.

Lastly, we conducted site  inspections of projects that accounted for a majority of the MCC-provided  infrastructure funding in Cape Verde and Honduras to verify the extent to  which projects had been completed and to observe whether there were  any visual deficiencies in construction. These interviews, document  reviews, and site visits were used to determine if the MCAs had  implemented MCC\u2019s quality assurance framework, if there was supporting  documentation to verify that quality testing had been undertaken, if any  quality deficiencies were encountered during construction, if any quality  deficiencies remain, and whether the infrastructure projects would be  sustainable.

However, the  mountainous terrain through which the roads were built presents hazards  such as landslides and erosion from storm water runoff. According to the  construction supervisor, the low volume of traffic for which the roads were  built influenced decisions to limit some design features, such as removing  steep roadside slopes and installing or repairing drainage structures and  retaining walls, to control costs. For example, in consideration of limiting  costs and reducing environmental impacts, the construction supervisor  authorized less earthwork than had been proposed by the construction  contractor when the road activity was being redesigned. This resulted in  the exposure of some road sections to potential damage from landslides  and water runoff because they are adjacent to steep slopes.

MCC expects section 1 to be completed by June 2012.", "However, in March 2011, MCC officials stated that additional work  added to the contract may require MCA-Honduras to extend that date.  \uf0b7  Section 2. Construction began in February 2009 on the $68 million,  33.3-kilometer section 2 of the CA-5 highway and was about half  completed when the compact ended. MCC allocated about $21 million  (31 percent) and CABEI allocated about $47 million (69 percent) for  section 2, with MCC\u2019s allocation covering the cost of about 10  kilometers of constructed road. Construction was scheduled to be  completed by March 2011, but MCA-Honduras is considering  extending the completion date to September 2011 because of  additional construction work, rain, and other delays.  \uf0b7  Sections 3 and 4.

Construction contract bid  amounts for reconstructing each section of the CA-5 highway were  significantly higher than MCC\u2019s initial estimates, owing in part to  requests from the Honduras government for changes in scope and  changes in design, according to MCA-Honduras officials.", "Section 1. The construction contract bid for section 1 exceeded  estimated costs by 15 percent.", "Section 2. The construction contract bid for section 2 exceeded  estimated costs by 112 percent. The original design was to increase  the road from two to three lanes in some areas. However, the  Honduras government requested that the entire section have four  lanes, increasing the travel lane pavement area by 43 percent.", "Section 3. The construction contract bid for section 3 exceeded  estimated costs by 11 percent, after the Honduras government  requested a third lane for passing to improve traffic flow in a few areas  with steep inclines.", "Section 4. The construction contract bid for section 4 exceeded  estimated costs by about 75 percent. The Honduras government  requested that four lanes be installed in some portions of the section  and that concrete, rather than asphalt, be used for the pavement. In  addition, according to MCA-Honduras officials, 12 kilometers of a  special base treatment were added to support the concrete  pavement.  \uf0b7  Land acquisition costs. The additional costs of acquiring right-of- way for the additional lanes and relocating adjacent housing and  businesses exceeded initial estimates by almost 600 percent.  According to MCA-Honduras officials, the original estimate for land  acquisition and relocation was $3.1 million, but the final budgeted cost  was about $20.2 million. Officials said that due-diligence studies  conducted before the design phase had not included the costs of  resettling residents and business owners from acquired land. In  addition, the original land acquisition costs were estimated based on  the land\u2019s official value for tax purposes rather than on its market  value (which is typically higher), in accordance with normal practice in  Honduras, and did not include relocation costs. MCA-Honduras  officials said that, to accelerate the acquisition of land for the CA-5,  they worked with the Honduras government to pass legislation that  allows citizens to be reimbursed for market value land costs and  relocation costs. According to MCC officials, relocation of the  businesses provided economic benefits by allowing the business  owners to retain their livelihood. In addition, businesses were grouped  together to reduce traffic congestion related to cars stopping along the  road and small chambers of commerce were developed to promote  the businesses (see fig. 12).  \uf0b7  Contract modifications. Modifications of contracts during  construction for sections 2, 3, and 4 raised CA-5 costs by about 6  percent, according to our review of construction supervision reports. A  construction supervision official for section 2 stated that some of these  increases were the result of road design plans with insufficient detail,  which required the construction of additional retaining walls,  earthwork, and drainage pipes beyond those included in the contract  plans.

MCC terminated funding for this activity in 2009 in response to the  country\u2019s political situation (see table 16 for key performance results for  the weight control activity).", "MCC officials stated that prior to the decision to eliminate the activity, they  worked with the Honduran government to enact legislation allowing Fondo  Vial\u2014the Honduran road maintenance agency\u2014to regulate and enforce  weight limits on Honduran roads. According to the Honduran government  and MCA-Honduras officials, the government is trying to develop a smaller  weight control activity, with one permanent weigh station and two portable  stations, to start enforcing weight limits on the CA-5. However, at the time  of our visit in November 2010, the government had not established a  definite plan or obtained funding for the activity, and MCC is no longer  monitoring the activity to provide us with an update."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transportation Project: Quality", "paragraphs": ["To provide management control and ensure quality for the Honduras  transportation project, MCA-Honduras established an organization  consistent with MCC\u2019s management structure for infrastructure projects.", "The management organization for infrastructure projects included a MCA- Honduras transportation director and staff; contracted project  management consultant who also performed design engineer services;  and contracted independent construction supervisors, who reviewed the  work of the project construction contractors for the CA-5 highway and  secondary roads. MCC hired an independent engineering consultant to  provide them with independent reviews and recommendations of MCA- Honduras\u2019 design and construction activities.", "In addition, MCA-Honduras implemented a quality control process, with  independent construction supervisors and contractors ensuring that  construction of the CA-5 highway and secondary roads followed  designs. The contractors were responsible for the primary testing, or  quality control, and independent construction supervisors were  responsible for a smaller amount of testing to confirm that the contractor\u2019s  tests were accurate. In our review of contracts, we found that to  implement the quality control plan, the independent construction  supervisors and contractors conducted testing on certified testing  equipment and kept records of daily activities and test results   (see fig. 14).", "While the work on the CA-5 highway sections and secondary roads was  conducted with a quality control process in place, we observed instances  of roadside erosion, pavement roughness, surface slickness, landslides,  steep slopes, and limited use of roadside safety measures that raised  concerns about the quality of the completed works.  \uf0b7  Roadside erosion. We found problems with erosion in some areas  that had not been adequately revegetated, resulting in drop-offs at the  edge of pavement, undermining of sidewalks, and filling of drainage  areas (see fig. 15). At one site, construction supervision officials  stated that revegetation was included in the contract to control  erosion, but they decided not to have the contractor install it because  it was dry season and the revegetation would not survive. At another  location, there was no erosion control included in the design of a  drainage way, resulting in erosion from rains. If these erosion  problems are not resolved during construction, they will present  maintenance challenges that will require additional funding.  \uf0b7  Pavement roughness. Pavements on the CA-5 section 3, the CA-5  section 4, and secondary roads met contractual requirements for  pavement smoothness; however, these CA-5 sections and secondary  roads did not meet the International Roughness Index (IRI) targets  that MCC and MCA-Honduras had set (see table 17). The project  designer had not included the IRI measures in the contract documents  as a performance specification; thus, the contractor was not required  to meet IRI targets, which resulted in increased long-term  maintenance and user costs.  \uf0b7  Surface slickness. On two of the completed secondary roads, we  observed some areas of asphalt seepage to the road surface\u2014a  condition known as asphalt flushing, which can affect road safety by  reducing skid resistance, making the surface slick, or obscuring  pavement markings (see fig. 16). According to MCA-Honduras  officials, the contractor previously had taken action to mitigate the  deficiency on the road with the worst flushing and felt it was  satisfactorily repaired; however, it still existed at the time of our visit in  November 2010.  \uf0b7  Landslides. Landslides were found along CA-5 in sections 2, 3, and  4. For example, in the unfinished section 2 of the CA-5, a large  landslide made the uncompleted road almost impassable and caused  delays in construction of section 2 (see fig. 17). The geotechnical  analysis identified by MCC as being those used to assess the risks of  landslides in the original CA-5 highway designs did not include  detailed analysis identifying how specific slopes would be stabilized,  prevention measures that could be included in the construction plans,  or an analysis of sections 3 and 4 of the CA-5. If such detailed  analysis had been conducted during the design of the highway, the  construction plans could have included such measures, thus reducing  landslides and maintenance costs.  \uf0b7  Steep slopes. In several locations along one secondary road, we  observed that the contractor had excavated soil to construct the road  and left steeps slopes that were almost vertical, with soil eroding  along the face of the excavation and filling drainage areas (see fig.  18). Construction supervisor officials said that this type of design and  construction was typical in Honduras because there was limited right- of-way available to construct gentler slopes that were less subject to  erosion. However, we observed some locations where there appeared  to be sufficient right-of-way and the slope was still vertical. For  example, on one contract where right-of-way was available, the  construction supervision officials stated that the work was constructed  with a steep slope to save the cost of the excavation. Although the  decision to limit right-of-way acquisitions and reduce the amount of  excavation reduces costs and reconstruction time, it increases the  cost of long-term maintenance to ensure the pavement does not  deteriorate due to inadequate drainage.", "Inadequate or inconsistent traffic safety measures. We found inadequate  or inconsistent use of traffic safety measures on the completed CA-5  sections and secondary roads:  \uf0b7  Concrete barrier wall was installed along retaining walls with drop- offs, but guardrail was not generally installed along steep  embankments and drop-offs (see fig. 19).  \uf0b7  Guardrail with safety end treatments or crash cushions to protect  motorists was not installed at the ends of most concrete barrier walls  and concrete bridges (see fig. 19).  \uf0b7  Guardrail was installed to protect vehicles from concrete bridge railing  ends on one secondary road but not on another, in part due to limited  funding for the second road, according to MCC officials.  \uf0b7  Solid pavement centerlines were installed in a different manner on  one secondary road than on the other two roads, with the one road  not following design standards that MCC officials said they generally  used for the activity. MCC officials attributed the lack of uniform  centerlines to one road contract having less detailed specifications  than the other two road contracts, resulting in the contractor using a  different standard supplied by the Honduran transportation ministry.  MCC asserted that motorist safety was not affected; however, this  approach differs from the traffic controls used in the United States,  where uniformity of traffic control devices, such as pavement  markings, is considered vital to their effectiveness, promoting highway  safety and efficiency and minimizing the occurrence of crashes.", "MCC officials expressed confidence in the safety of the completed CA-5  sections and secondary roads, stating that the design of the road  reconstruction had met Central American standards; that the Honduras  transportation ministry had accepted and approved the proposed designs;  and that the traffic safety devices included in the reconstruction exceeded  those traditionally used on Honduran roads. However, MCC officials  acknowledged that they did not perform a cost-benefit analysis of  additional traffic control and traffic safety devices during the design of the  contracts and that funding limitations had affected the extent to which  safety improvements were included in the construction contracts.  According to MCC, additional safety improvements were installed when  funding was available.", "Uncertainty over Honduras government funding for road maintenance  calls into question the likely sustainability of the MCC-funded roads.  According to the compact, the key issue for sustainability of the  transportation project is routine, periodic, and emergency road  maintenance, such as sealing cracks, repainting the pavement markings,  cleaning ditches and drainage structures, repairing potholes, resurfacing,  and clearing landslides. Several of the quality deficiencies we observed\u2014 erosion, roughness, slickness, and landslides\u2014will increase the amount  and cost of maintenance needed over time, and failure to perform the  planned maintenance may result in escalating maintenance needs. For  example, without required maintenance,  \uf0b7  erosion may block drainage, causing road deterioration and  undermining the sidewalks, pavements, or drainage structures,  causing them to fail;  increasingly rough pavement, as measured by the IRI, will likely  require the road to be resurfaced sooner than planned and raise road  user costs; and  landslides may close roads, produce unexpected safety hazards, or  block drainage, causing road deterioration.", "However, several circumstances call into question the Honduran  government\u2019s ability to provide the required maintenance over the 20-year  period specified in the compact. MCC expressed concerns about whether  the reconstructed roads would be maintained so as to sustain reductions  in road users\u2019 travel costs. Contractors and construction supervisor  officials also expressed a concern that, unless the Honduras government  improved its level of road maintenance, the reconstructed roads would  likely not be maintained.", "Although MCC officials worked with the Honduras government to increase  its funding of road maintenance from a precompact amount of $37 million  in 2005 to $64 million in 2010, this funding is for maintenance of all roads  on the official Honduran road network and not specifically for compact- funded roads. In addition, the commitment did not specifically address  road maintenance after 2010. With the increased funding, MCC officials  stated that they expect that the Honduran government will maintain the  MCC-funded sections of CA-5 and some of the key secondary roads, but  are concerned that it may not be at the level required to maximize the  road\u2019s life span.", "The amount that the Honduran government has committed for road  maintenance is less than required by law and needed for the roads.  According to officials from the Honduras transportation ministry and  documents prepared by Fondo Vial, the government\u2019s allocation for 2010  represents less than half of the road maintenance allocation required by  Honduras law. These documents show that Honduras law requires the  government to allocate 40 percent of a fuel tax for road maintenance.  However, according to our analysis of Fondo Vial documents, the  percentage of fuel tax allocated for road maintenance has varied, from 27  percent in 2000 to 14 percent in 2006 to 19 percent in 2010, even though  Fondo Vial\u2019s road maintenance plan recommends road maintenance be  funded at $210 million annually\u2014or about 60 percent of the fuel tax.", "MCC\u2019s elimination of the vehicle weight control activity from the  Transportation Project and the extent to which the Honduran government  completes the activity in the future will affect the sustainability of the CA-5  road reconstruction. According to one Honduras government official,  there is currently no control of overweight trucks shipping goods, and a  large number of truckers exceed legal weight limits. Without  enforcement of weight limits on the CA-5 and other MCC-funded roads,  the roads will deteriorate faster, reducing transportation cost savings and  increasing road maintenance costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Honduras Rural Development Project", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Farmer Training and Development Activity", "paragraphs": ["MCC disbursed $26.6 million for the farmer training and development  activity, which was designed to improve the techniques and business  skills of farmers, assist farmers in improving agricultural productivity, and  achieve higher incomes from the production of high-value horticulture  crops.", "MCC did not meet some of its original key targets, but it met or exceeded  three of its four final targets for the farmer training and development  activity (see table 18 for key performance results for the farmer training  and development activity).

In addition to providing technical assistance  directly to farmers, the farmer training and development activity involved  working with entities along the farm production value chain to enhance  the sustainability of the activity after compact completion. For instance,  the contractor emphasized involving the private sector in program  activities, including buyers, wholesalers, processors, and input and  equipment service providers. In addition, the farmer training activity also  helped farmers form associations for growing and selling their products to  increase the sustainability of techniques and production practices.  According to farmers we spoke with, forming associations helped them  sell to larger producers and encouraged certain producers to purchase  goods directly from these farms, which had not happened previously.", "However, according to the contractor and farmers we spoke with in  Honduras, sustainability remains a concern for more than half of farmers  receiving assistance. In its final report submitted to MCA, the contractor  estimated that it takes approximately four to six production cycles for the  new skills farmers obtain to become sustainable. According to the report,  90 percent to 95 percent of program farmers who began receiving  assistance in the first 2 years of the program will continue using the new  technologies. However, of the farmers who were recruited late\u2014more  than 50 percent of the total number of program farmers\u2014half are  expected to reach sustainability. Farmers in Honduras stated that,  although they intended to continue using the new techniques, they were  concerned about the ability of some farmers to sustain their new skills  and overcome future challenges after the program ended.

The partial termination of the Honduras  compact in 2009, in response to the country\u2019s political situation, included  termination of the uncommitted portion of the farm-to-market roads  activity, representing approximately 93 kilometers of farm-to-market  roads. In addition, in generating the original target, MCC used a per- kilometer cost estimate of $14,300, based on Fondo Vial quality,  environmental, and social standards, but revised the estimate to $42,000  per kilometer because the Fondo Vial standards did not meet compact  requirements. Furthermore, according to MCC officials, MCC chose to  improve the durability of the roads built to increase the life of the roads  by, for instance, adding drainage structures that reduce water damage.  As a result, MCC funded fewer total kilometers of road.", "The farm-to-market roads reconstructed were selected based on a list of  proposed roads with an estimated economic rate of return of at least 12  percent.

The agricultural credit trust was a $6 million fund that was  designed to provide loans to financial institutions to improve the  availability of credit for rural lending. The technical assistance program  provided assistance to financial and nonfinancial institutions to strengthen  the institutions and assist them in developing products to more effectively  serve the horticulture industry. The expansion of the national property  registry activity was designed to create a new registry of movable  property and facilitate implementation of legislation required to institute  such a new system.", "According to MCA-Honduras officials, implementation challenges led to  scope modifications and delays in the farmer access to credit activity. An  initial lack of interest in accessing the agricultural credit fund among  traditional banking institutions led MCA-Honduras and the contractors to  refocus these activities on smaller sources of credit, such as financial  intermediaries and input suppliers. These early challenges and resulting  modifications meant that the agricultural credit fund was not effectively  operating until late in the compact.", "In addition, the agricultural credit fund, which was initially intended to  target program farmers, was modified to include horticulture producers  and businesses. According to MCC, small farmers making the transition  to high-value horticulture used existing resources and savings and did not  require access to credit until market opportunities expanded. Due to this  delay in demand for credit and an interest in enhancing the sustainability  of the lending activity, MCC and MCA-Honduras decided to expand the  scope to include nonprogram farmers. Additionally, according to MCA- Honduras and MCC officials, some initial opposition to reforming  collateral laws and a political transition in Honduras significantly  increased the time it took to enact the new law.", "MCC met most key original and all final targets for the farmer access to  credit activity, following modifications and delays in implementation (see  table 20 for key performance results for the farmer access to credit  activity).

The  agricultural credit fund will continue operating for 5 additional years after  the compact is complete, which will enhance the sustainability of these  loans to the horticultural industry. Since MCA-Honduras and MCC will no  longer oversee the agricultural credit fund after compact end, a committee  chaired by Honduras\u2019s Ministry of Finance was set up to oversee the  administration of the agricultural credit fund.
