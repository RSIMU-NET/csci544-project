GAO identified 23 instances of overlap involving 43 of BBG's 69 services. For example, in 8 instances involving 16 services, a Voice of America service and a Radio Free Asia service overlapped. Almost all overlapping services also broadcast on the same platform (i.e., radio or television). BBG officials noted that some overlap may be helpful in providing news from various sources in countries of strategic interest to the United States; however, they acknowledged that overlap reduces the funding available for broadcasts that may have greater impact. BBG budget information indicates that BBG spent approximately $149 million in fiscal year 2011 to maintain language services broadcasting in the same countries and languages--nearly 20 percent of its total appropriations. However, BBG has not estimated the potential savings and efficiencies from reducing unnecessary overlap. Further, BBG's annual language service review--its primary means of prioritizing broadcast languages and planning resource allocations--does not systematically consider the cost and impact of overlap. As a result, BBG may be missing opportunities to reduce overlap as appropriate, strengthen impact, and improve BBG entity coordination.", "More than half of BBG's broadcast languages are used by other international broadcasters--U.S. commercial international broadcasters and other major democratic nations' government-supported international broadcasters--although these broadcasters' objectives differ from BBG's. The U.S. commercial broadcasters that GAO identified transmit in seven of the BBG languages and target different audiences, with for-profit aims. Other democratic nations' broadcasters, including Germany's Deutsche Welle and the United Kingdom's BBC, transmit in 35 of the 59 BBG languages, although each broadcaster represents the unique perspectives and interests of its respective country. BBG's annual language service review generally considers the broadcast alternatives available to targeted audiences by identifying the most significant broadcasters in each market BBG serves. However, the review process does not systematically identify the languages used and the countries served by other international broadcasters, and it does not assess the extent to which these broadcasters provide similar or complementary alternatives to BBG broadcasts.

We obtained  and reviewed BBG\u2019s interpretation of the International Broadcasting Act  provisions related to overlap and duplication.", "We also reviewed information from BBG on the broadcast coverage of  each entity, by country, language, and platform. To assess language  service overlap among BBG entities, we identified instances in which the  language services of two BBG entities broadcast in the same language  and country, and we calculated the percentage of language services that  overlap with another BBG language service. In our calculations, each  instance of overlap involved two overlapping services. Some language  services produce content in multiple languages; for those, we considered  the language service to overlap if any of its languages overlapped with  other BBG services. In addition, we counted BBG\u2019s services in English,  English to Africa, and Special English/Learning English as one language  service. To obtain views about the causes and impact of overlap, we  interviewed officials from BBG, the Department of State, and the U.S.  Agency for International Development, as well as experts from U.S. and  international organizations. We visited and conducted interviews at the  headquarters of VOA (Washington, D.C.), MBN (Springfield, Va.), RFA  (Washington, D.C.), and RFE/RL (Prague, Czech Republic), and we  interviewed OCB officials by telephone. We also reviewed BBG\u2019s  methodology for its annual language service review and described the  extent to which it included consideration of the cost and impact of overlap.  We did not analyze the content of broadcast programs, overlap in BBG  administrative or technical operations, or management and administrative  streamlining proposals.", "To examine the extent to which BBG broadcasts in the same languages  as other international broadcasters, we interviewed representatives of  U.S. commercial broadcasters and democratic nations\u2019 government- supported international broadcasters. Through interviews with the  National Association of Broadcasters, the Association for International  Broadcasting, and other experts, we identified several U.S. commercial  broadcasters that provide general news programming to audiences  outside the United States. We conducted interviews with representatives  of two of these broadcasters: Fox News and CNN International. We  interviewed major democratic nations\u2019 international broadcasters\u2014 Audiovisuel Ext\u00e9rieur de la France (AEF), the British Broadcasting  Corporation World Service (BBC), Deutsche Welle (DW), and Radio  Netherlands Worldwide (RNW)\u2014as well as several other public  international broadcasters, including Voice of Russia. We interviewed  some international public broadcasters at a global media forum in Bonn,  Germany, and others by telephone. For both U.S. commercial  broadcasters and democratic nations\u2019 international broadcasters, we  reviewed information on their objectives and the languages in which they  broadcast, and we compared these to BBG objectives and broadcast  languages.", "We assessed BBG\u2019s processes for compiling information on the  broadcast languages used and countries served by BBG entities\u2019  language services, and we determined that these data were adequate  and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2012 to January  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: BBG Language Services", "paragraphs": ["Voice of America (VOA)", "Africa Division  Central Africa (Kinyarwanda, Kirundi)", "Horn Of Africa (Amharic, Tigrigna, Afaan Oromoo)", "Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB)", "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL)", "Balkans (Bosnian, Macedonian, Serbian, Albanian, Montenegrin, Croatian)*  Radio Farda (Persian)*  Radio Free Afghanistan (Dari and Pashto)*  Radio Mashaal (Pashto)*  Radio Free Iraq (Arabic)*  North Caucasus Unit (Avar, Chechen and Circassian)", "Tatar-Bashkir (Tatar, Crimean Tatar, Bashkir)", "Radio Free Asia (RFA)", "Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Languages Used by BBG and Selected Other Government-Supported International Broadcasters as of 2012", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BBG AEF BBC DW RNW China Russia Language", "paragraphs": ["Swahili  (Kiswahili)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BBG AEF BBC DW RNW China Russia Language", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from BBG", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Jason Bair (Assistant Director),  Marissa Jones, Mary Moutsos, Ashley Alley, Qahira El\u2019Amin, Julia Jebo  Grant, and Reid Lowe made key contributions to this report.
