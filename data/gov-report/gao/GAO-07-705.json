Various studies and experts estimate the direct economic impact from cybercrime to be in the billions of dollars annually. The annual loss due to computer crime was estimated to be $67.2 billion for U.S. organizations, according to a 2005 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) survey. In addition, there is continued concern about the threat that our adversaries, including nation-states and terrorists, pose to our national security. For example, intelligence officials have stated that nation-states and terrorists could conduct a coordinated cyber attack to seriously disrupt electric power distribution, air traffic control, and financial sectors. Also, according to FBI testimony, terrorist organizations have used cybercrime to raise money to fund their activities. Despite the estimated loss of money and information and known threats from adversaries, the precise impact of cybercrime is unknown because it is not always detected and reported. Numerous public and private entities have responsibilities to protect against, detect, investigate, and prosecute cybercrime. The Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Defense, and the Federal Trade Commission have prominent roles in addressing cybercrime within the federal government, and state and local law enforcement entities play similar roles at their levels. Private entities such as Internet service providers and software developers focus on the development and implementation of technology systems to detect and protect against cybercrime, as well as gather evidence for investigations. In addition, numerous cybercrime partnerships have been established between public sector entities, between public and private sector entities, and internationally, including information-sharing efforts. Entities face a number of key challenges in addressing cybercrime, including reporting cybercrime and ensuring that there are adequate analytical capabilities to support law enforcement. While public and private entities, partnerships, and tasks forces have initiated efforts to address these challenges, federal agencies can take additional action to help ensure adequate law enforcement capabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The rapid increase in computer interconnectivity has revolutionized the  way that our government, our nation, and much of the world communicate  and conduct business.

For example, it can be a crime to  access (\u201chack into\u201d) a computer without authorization or to distribute  viruses. Cybercrime also includes the use of computers as tools to conduct  criminal activity such as fraud, identity theft, and copyright infringement.  Computers significantly multiply the criminal\u2019s power and reach in  committing such crimes. Figure 1 describes and compares cybercrime and  traditional criminal techniques.", "Cybercrime techniques have characteristics that can vastly enhance the  reach and impact of criminal activity, such as the following:    Criminals do not need to be physically close to their victims to commit a  crime.", "Technology allows criminal actions to easily cross multiple state and  national borders.", "Cybercrime can be carried out automatically, at high speed, and by  attacking a vast number of victims at the same time.", "Cybercriminals can more easily remain anonymous.", "To help facilitate cybercrimes, criminals use several techniques listed in  table 1.", "Companies that process large volumes of Internet traffic, such as Postini,  Symantec, and IBM analyze their traffic for patterns and trends and have  found that the cybercrime techniques in table 1 are prevalent.

As figure 2 shows, this basic process is one of  protection, detection, investigation, and prosecution.", "To protect networks and information against cybercrime, organizations  and individuals implement cybersecurity techniques such as access  controls (passwords) and firewalls. In addition, they use monitoring  devices or intrusion detection systems to detect incidents that could  potentially be criminal intrusions. As figure 2 shows, monitoring unusual  activity allows organizations and individuals to make adjustments to  improve protection. When a suspected cybercrime is detected,  organizations and individuals must decide what action to pursue.  Depending on the severity of the incident, the level of evidence, and their  comfort with revealing the incident, they may or not report it to law  enforcement.", "Generally, investigations begin once an incident is reported to law  enforcement. During the preliminary investigation, federal, state, or local  law enforcement, along with their respective prosecutors, determine if a  crime occurred and if a further investigation is warranted. Also, in some  cases, private sector and academic analysts may provide expertise. Among  the factors weighed by law enforcement authorities in determining  whether to conduct an investigation is whether their agency has  jurisdiction over the crime, the number and location of the victims, the  expected location of the criminal, the amount of loss, and the agency\u2019s  investigative priorities and available resources. If it is determined that an  investigation will not be pursued, law enforcement may provide advice to  victims that may be used to improve their protective measures. When a  criminal investigation is pursued, law enforcement investigators have the  initial responsibility for leading the evidence-gathering effort and working  with cyberforensic investigators and examiners with the technical  expertise to analyze the evidence. In cases where evidence is not  voluntarily provided, law enforcement can use various subpoena  authorities to obtain information needed to perform the investigation.", "A key component of cybercrime investigations is the gathering and  examination of electronic evidence that can be useful for prosecution.  Using cyberforensic tools and techniques, cybercrime investigators and  examiners gather and analyze electronic evidence. If available,  cyberforensic laboratories may be used to extract the electronic evidence  and present it in a court-admissible format. The evidence could entail  analysis of terabytes of information on multiple electronic devices, the  electronic path taken by a fraudulent e-mail, pornographic images stored  on a hard drive, or data stored on a mutilated but later reconstructed CD- ROM. The ability to gather electronic evidence and the assurance that  cyberforensic procedures do not compromise the evidence gathered can  be key to building a case and prosecuting cybercriminals.", "Cybercrime investigations and evidence gathering can also be conducted  while a crime is ongoing. If a crime is being investigated while it is still  occurring, investigators may use sophisticated techniques to investigate  criminal activity that include court-ordered wiretaps. In determining  whether and how to gather evidence of information transmitted  electronically, law enforcement may make an application to a court for a  wiretap pursuant to the Wiretap Act. To obtain such orders, the  application to the court must describe, among other things, the criminal  activity and the identity of those involved, if known.", "If sufficient evidence is gathered, it can lead to a prosecution. Federal and  state prosecutors determine if a prosecution will be pursued based on a  number of factors including jurisdiction over the crime, the type and  seriousness of the offense, the sufficiency of the evidence, their  prosecutorial priorities, and the location and number of the victims.  Prosecuting attorneys will also consider the dollar loss and the number of  incidents. Some federal prosecuting attorneys may not pursue cybercrime  cases because they do not meet the minimum thresholds established for  their districts. Thresholds are established by prosecuting attorneys to  appropriately focus their limited resources on the most serious crimes that  match their district\u2019s priorities. For example, if fraud has been committed  through the use of a computer, the amount of the dollar loss may need to  reach a specific threshold amount for the U.S. Attorney to accept the case.  When the U.S. Attorney does not accept a case for prosecution because it  does not meet such a threshold, state authorities may decide to accept the  case for prosecution.", "In addition to criminal remedies, civil remedies are available to address  cybercrime activity. The burden of proof in a civil case is not as high as in  a criminal case. At the federal level, the FTC investigates activities that  could be classified as cybercrime as part of its consumer protection  mission and seeks civil injunctions and monetary remedies. In addition,  many states have civil statutes that may be applied to cybercrime  situations. In the State of Washington, for example, the Attorney General  can apply the state\u2019s consumer protection statute to cases of cyber- facilitated fraud. Pursuing the case in civil court, the state\u2019s Attorney  General can seek civil remedies such as the repayment of losses or  penalties for wrongdoing or fraud, which could potentially deter future  criminal attempts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governments Have Enacted Various Laws to Address Cybercrime", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state governments and other nations have enacted laws that  apply to cybercrime and the legal recourse or remedies available.

They weigh the cost and impact of the  incident with the time and effort needed to support an investigation and  prosecution. In addition, our work and findings of the Congressional  Research Service related to information sharing have shown that  businesses do not always want to report problems because there is a  perception that their information will be disclosed publicly, which could,  in turn, cause harm to their business. Reasons for not reporting a crime  to law enforcement include the following:    Financial market impacts. The stock and credit markets and bond rating  firms react negatively to security breach announcements, which could  raise the cost of capital to reporting firms. Even firms that are privately  held and are not active in public securities markets can be adversely  affected if banks and other lenders judge them to be more risky than  previously thought.", "Reputation or confidence effects.

According to federal and state law enforcement officials, the  pool of qualified candidates is limited because individuals involved in  investigating or examining cybercrime are highly trained specialists  requiring both law enforcement and technical skills, including knowledge  of various IT hardware and software and forensic tools. According to  Defense Cyber Crime Center officials, once an investigator or examiner  specializes in cybercrime, it can take up to 12 months for those individuals  to become proficient enough to fully manage their own investigations.  Further, according to state officials, state and local law enforcement  agencies do not have the resources needed to hire the investigators with  adequate technical knowledge required to address cybercrime.", "Law enforcement organizations also find it difficult to retain highly skilled  cyberforensic investigators and examiners. According to federal and state  officials, the private sector demands individuals with the same skills and  successfully attracts them away from their government positions with  much higher salaries and better benefits. For example, according to an  Assistant U.S. Attorney, several cybercrime experts, including attorneys,  federal and state law enforcement agents, and cyberforensic examiners,  have left their government positions due to the higher salaries and benefits  offered by the private sector.", "The available pool of experienced federal cybercrime investigators is also  impacted by FBI and Secret Service rotation policies. For example,  according to FBI officials, new FBI agents, not initially assigned to one of  the 15 largest field offices, are required to rotate to one of the these large  offices after 3 years in order to have diversified experiences. According to  FBI headquarters and field agents, when cybercrime investigators rotate  out under this policy, they are not necessarily reassigned to cybercrime  investigations in their new field office, and so their extensive cyber  background is underutilized. In addition, the agents who rotate in to  replace experienced cybercrime investigators may have little or no  cybercrime experience or background. Further, according to FBI officials,  the pool of experienced senior managers is impacted by the FBI\u2019s current  policy that senior field supervisory agents are limited to 5-year terms in  their positions and then most move to seek further career advancement.  This can include the movement of experienced cybercrime investigators  out of senior cybercrime positions. Similarly, according to Secret Service  officials, most Secret Service agents, including those with technical,  cybercrime investigation expertise, rotate to a protective assignment,  which focuses on the protection of the President, Vice President, and  others and not on the investigation of cybercrime. In addition, officials  stated that there is an investigative career track that allows agents to  continue doing investigations, including those related to cybercrime;  however, protective assignments are perceived as higher profile and could  lead to greater career advancement. FBI and Secret Service officials  acknowledged that the rotation policies have at times resulted in these  agencies underutilizing staff with cyber expertise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Keeping Up to Date with Current Technology and Criminal Techniques", "paragraphs": ["The rapid evolution of technology and cybercrime techniques means that  law enforcement agencies must continuously upgrade technical equipment  and software tools. Such equipment and tools are expensive, and agencies\u2019  need for them does not always fall into the typical federal replacement  cycle. For example, in order for investigators to perform cyberforensic  examinations and gather the evidence required to support a prosecution,  the examiners and investigators must, in some cases, store and analyze  huge amounts of digital data. According to federal law enforcement  officials, the amount of data being collected is growing exponentially.  However, according to law enforcement officials, state and local law  enforcement agencies do not always have the resources to obtain the  equipment necessary to analyze large amounts of data.", "Law enforcement organizations also find that maintaining a current  understanding of new criminal techniques and technologies can be  difficult. For example, law enforcement agents are required to extract  forensic data from IT devices that have only been on the market for  months. They also must keep up with innovative criminal techniques and  approaches. For example, techniques for assembling and controlling  botnets are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to trace,  making it difficult to identify certain spamming and phishing schemes. In  addition, criminals are increasing their use of encryption techniques. This  requires law enforcement to continue to research and develop appropriate  countermeasures. Training can help to keep investigators\u2019 skills current,  but relevant courses are limited, costly, and time-consuming, and take  agents away from the cases that they are investigating.", "Federal and state law enforcement organizations are taking steps to  improve their analytic and technical capabilities. For example, the Secret  Service has developed training programs for federal, state, and local law  enforcement and DOD\u2019s Defense Cyber Crime Center has a cyberforensic  training program for DOD investigators and other law enforcement  officials. Further, the FBI\u2019s Cyber Action Teams rapidly provide technical  expertise to cybercrime investigations worldwide, when needed. To  overcome shortfalls in equipment and electronic storage, the FBI is  sponsoring regional computer forensics laboratories to serve the needs of  an entire region\u2019s law enforcement. In addition, public/private  partnerships, like the FBI\u2019s Infragard and National Cyber Forensics  Training Alliance and the Secret Service\u2019s Electronic Crimes Task Forces,  provide ways to share expertise between law enforcement, the private  sector, and academia.

As discussed earlier, cybercriminals  are not hampered by physical proximity or regional, national, or  international borders. Cybercriminals can be physically located in one  nation or state, direct their crime through computers in multiple nations or  states, and store evidence of the crime on computers in yet another nation  or state. This makes it difficult to trace the cybercriminals to their physical  location. In addition, cybercriminals can take steps to remain anonymous,  making it difficult, if not impossible, to attribute a crime to them.", "Similar to efforts addressing traditional crime, efforts to investigate and  prosecute cybercrime are complicated by the multiplicity of laws and  procedures that govern in the various nations and states where victims  may be found, and the conflicting priorities and varying degrees of  expertise of law enforcement authorities in those jurisdictions. Laws used  to address cybercrime differ across states and nations. For example, not  all U.S. states have antispam laws or antispyware laws. In addition, an act  that is illegal in the United States may be legal in another nation or not  directly addressed in the other nation\u2019s laws. Developing countries, for  example, may lack cybercrime laws and enforcement procedures.", "Further, jurisdictional boundaries can limit the actions that federal, state,  and local law enforcement can take to investigate cybercrime that crosses  local, regional, and national borders. For example, state and local officials  may be unable to pursue investigations outside of their jurisdiction, so  when a cybercrime goes beyond their jurisdiction, they may need to rely  upon officials of other jurisdictions to further investigate the crime.  Additionally, extradition between states can be complicated depending on  the laws of the state where the suspect is located and the knowledge of the  states\u2019 law enforcement and judiciary regarding cybercrime. In addition,  the United States does not have extradition arrangements with all nations,  which makes it impossible to extradite a cybercriminal from certain  nations. Extradition from nations having an extradition agreement with  the United States can be complicated or impossible if the nation\u2019s laws do  not make the action illegal or its magistrate is not knowledgeable about  cybercrime. Also, state and local officials are unable to extradite persons  from other nations without federal law enforcement assistance.", "Conflicting priorities also complicate cybercrime investigations and  prosecutions. Cybercrime can occur without physical proximity to the  victim, and thus a cybercriminal can operate without victimizing a citizen  in the jurisdiction or federal judicial district in which the crime originated.  With no negative impact on the citizens in that district, there may be no  incentive for the local citizens to press their law enforcement officers to  investigate the crime. According to state officials, it is difficult to commit  resources to crimes where the victims are outside their state or  jurisdiction, although the suspected cybercriminal may be prosecuted in  the jurisdiction where the victim is located.", "Federal and state law enforcement organizations are taking steps to help  them work in the borderless environment within which cybercriminals  operate. For example, federal, state, and local law enforcement  organizations participate in cybercrime task forces that combine a region\u2019s  law enforcement capabilities to investigate and prosecute cybercrime in  the most advantageous way. To address transnational jurisdiction,  investigation, and prosecution issues, DOJ and the State Department have  established agreements with more than 40 nations through the G-8 High  Tech Crime Working Group to address cybercrime cooperatively. The  Council of Europe\u2019s Cybercrime Convention is a similar international  effort.
