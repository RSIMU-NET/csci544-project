While the pension program is means tested, there is no prohibition on transferring assets prior to applying for benefits. Other means-tested programs, such as Medicaid, conduct a look-back review to determine if an individual has transferred assets at less than fair market value, and if so, may deny benefits for a period of time, known as the penalty period. This control helps ensure that only those in financial need receive benefits. In contrast, VA pension claimants can transfer assets for less than fair market value immediately prior to applying and be approved for benefits. For example, GAO identified a case where a claimant transferred over a million dollars less than 3 months prior to applying and was granted benefits. Also, VA\u0092s process for assessing initial eligibility is inadequate in several key respects. The application form does not ask for some sources of income and assets such as private retirement income, annuities, and trusts. As a result, VA lacks complete information on a claimant\u0092s financial situation. Also, the form does not ask about asset transfers\u0097information VA needs to determine whether these assets should be included when assessing eligibility. In addition, VA does not verify all the information it does request on the form. For example, VA does not routinely request supporting documents, such as bank statements or tax records, unless questions are raised. VA\u0092s fiduciary program, which appoints individuals to manage the financial affairs of beneficiaries who are unable to do so themselves, collects financial information that may affect some pension recipients\u0092 eligibility, but VA pension claims processors do not have access to all this information. Further, guidance on when assets should be included as part of a claimant\u0092s net worth is unclear; and VA claims processors must use their own discretion when assessing eligibility for benefits, which can lead to inconsistent decisions.", "GAO identified over 200 organizations that market financial and estate planning services to help pension claimants with excess assets meet financial eligibility requirements for these benefits. These organizations consist primarily of financial planners and attorneys who offer products such as annuities and trusts. GAO judgmentally selected a nongeneralizable sample of 25 organizations, and GAO investigative staff successfully contacted 19 while posing as a veteran\u0092s son seeking information on these services. All 19 said a claimant can qualify for pension benefits by transferring assets before applying, which is permitted under the program. Two organization representatives said they helped pension claimants with substantial assets, including millionaires, obtain VA\u0092s approval for benefits. About half of the organizations advised repositioning assets into a trust, with a family member as the trustee to direct the funds to pay for the veteran\u0092s expenses. About half also advised placing assets into some type of annuity. Some products and services provided, such as deferred annuities, may not be suitable for the elderly because they may not have access to all their funds for their care within their expected lifetime without facing high withdrawal fees. Also, these products and services may result in ineligibility for Medicaid for a period of time. Among the 19 organizations contacted, the majority charged fees, ranging from a few hundred dollars for benefits counseling to $10,000 for establishment of a trust."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider establishing a look-back and penalty period for pension claimants who transfer assets for less than fair market value prior to applying, similar to other federally supported means-tested programs.

We  interviewed officials from VA headquarters, as well as staff at VA\u2019s three  Pension Management Centers (PMC) to determine how these policies  and procedures are applied. We also reviewed a nongeneralizable  random sample of 85 pension claims that were entered into VA\u2019s  electronic case file system in fiscal year 2010, in which VA had to formally  determine if the claimant met asset thresholds.

To become accredited, an  individual must meet certain requirements set forth in federal law. Claims  processors assess claims at VBA\u2019s three Pension Management Centers  (PMC) in Philadelphia, Penn.; Milwaukee, Wis.; and Saint Paul, Minn. As  part of the pension program, VA provides enhanced pension benefit  amounts to veterans and surviving family members who demonstrate the  need for aid and attendance, or who are considered permanently  housebound. For pension beneficiaries who are deemed unable to  manage their affairs due to mental impairments, VA appoints a fiduciary  to manage the beneficiary\u2019s finances.", "To qualify for pension benefits, claimants\u2019 countable income must not  exceed annual pension limits that are set by statute. These income limits  are also the maximum annual pension payment that a beneficiary may  receive. Such limits may vary based on whether claimants are veterans or  survivors and their family composition, as well as whether claimants need  aid and attendance or are considered housebound. For example, to  qualify for pension benefits in 2012, a veteran with no dependents and  who is in need of Aid and Attendance benefits cannot have income that  exceeds $20,447, while a surviving spouse in similar circumstances  cannot have an income that exceeds $13,138. In determining if a  claimant\u2019s income is below program thresholds, VA includes recurring  sources of income such as the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA)  retirement and disability benefits, but not income from public assistance  programs such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI). VA also allows  some expenses, such as certain unreimbursed medical expenses that  exceed 5 percent of the maximum pension amount the claimant is eligible  for, to be deducted from a claimant\u2019s countable income. The annual  amount pension beneficiaries receive is the difference between their  countable income and the maximum pension amount they would be  eligible for (see table 1).", "VA\u2019s policy manual specifically states that the pension program is not  intended to protect substantial assets or preserve an estate for a  beneficiary\u2019s heirs. In assessing financial eligibility for pension benefits,  VA also considers net worth or the total value of claimants\u2019 assets, such  as bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and any property other  than the claimant\u2019s dwelling, a reasonable lot area, a vehicle, and  personal belongings. There are no thresholds on the value of a  claimant\u2019s assets that are defined in statute. However, according to VA\u2019s  procedures manual, claims processors are generally required to formally  determine if claimants with assets worth over $80,000 have financial  resources that will last a reasonable period of time to pay for their basic  expenses. In making this determination, claims processors consider net  worth, income, expenses, age, and life expectancy to determine if  claimants\u2019 financial resources are sufficient to pay for their expenses  without assistance from VA. Ongoing eligibility for pension recipients who  previously reported any income other than, or in addition to, Social  Security income is also assessed. These recipients must complete an  annual Eligibility Verification Report (EVR), which requests information on  income and assets, that is used to determine if recipients continue to be  financially eligible for the pension program.", "Potential VA pension recipients may also be eligible for other means- tested programs. For example, they may be eligible for Medicaid, a joint  federal-state health care financing program that provides coverage for  long-term care services for certain individuals whose income and  resources do not exceed specific thresholds. Each state administers its  Medicaid program and establishes specific income and resource eligibility  requirements that must fall within federal standards, but we reported in  2007 that in most states, an individual must have $2,000 or less in  countable financial resources to be eligible. Similarly, the SSI program  provides cash benefits to individuals who are age 65 or older, blind, or  disabled, and who have limited income and whose financial resources are  $2,000 or less ($3,000 if the individual lives with their spouse)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Pension Program Design and Management Do Not Ensure Only Those with Financial Need Receive Benefits", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Allows Claimants to Transfer Assets Prior to Applying, Unlike Other Means-Tested Programs", "paragraphs": ["We found several potential vulnerabilities in the VA pension program\u2019s  design, as well as in VA\u2019s policies and procedures, that hinder the  department\u2019s ability to ensure that only those in financial need receive  benefits. More specifically, the program allows claimants to transfer  assets prior to applying for benefits, and VA lacks complete information  on claimants\u2019 finances, relies on self-reported information, and does not  utilize all opportunities for coordination within the agency. Additionally,  guidance that claims processors use may be unclear. Despite being  means-tested, the program currently permits VA pension claimants to  transfer assets and reduce their net worth prior to applying for these  benefits. Federal regulations state that, when evaluating financial  eligibility for pension benefits, assets gifted to someone that does not  reside in the claimant\u2019s household will reduce the claimant\u2019s net worth if  all rights of ownership and control of the assets have been relinquished.  As a result, prior to applying for benefits, claimants can transfer excess  assets to someone outside their household to meet the financial eligibility  criteria for VA pension benefits and be approved, as long as they no  longer retain ownership or control of the assets. For example, we  identified a case involving a pension recipient who transferred over a  million dollars in assets into an irrevocable trust less than 3 months prior  to applying for these benefits. VA was aware of the asset transfer when  this pension claim was approved and did not count the trust as part of the  claimant\u2019s net worth. Although these types of transfers are generally  permitted under law for the pension program, this practice is not  consistent with other federal means-tested programs and weakens the  pension program\u2019s goal of supporting those with financial need.", "In contrast, for Medicaid\u2014another means tested program\u2014federal law  explicitly restricts eligibility for coverage for long term care for certain  individuals who transfer assets for less than fair market value prior to  applying., As a result, when an individual applies for Medicaid  coverage for long-term care, states conduct a look-back\u2014a review to  determine if the applicant transferred assets for less than fair market  value prior to applying. Individuals who transfer assets for less than fair  market value during the 60 months prior to applying may be denied  eligibility for long-term care coverage for a period of time, known as the  penalty period. For example, gifting assets would generally be  considered a transfer of assets at less than fair market value and would  result in a penalty period. Also, under the SSI program, claimants who  transfer assets for less than fair market value prior to applying may  become ineligible for these benefits for up to 36 months.", "An asset transfer at less than fair market value would occur when the claimant gifts or  sells a resource and gets in return an amount that is less than the value of the resource on  the open market at the time of the transfer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Lacks Complete Information on Claimants\u2019 Finances", "paragraphs": ["VA lacks complete information on claimants\u2019 finances because the forms  used to assess financial eligibility do not prompt applicants to report  certain types of income and asset information. While the instructions on  the pension application forms ask claimants to report all income sources  and assets they own, the forms do not provide spaces for claimants to  report some types of income and assets. For example, even though  elderly pension claimants may receive private monthly retirement income,  such as income from a company\u2019s retirement plan, the application forms  do not specifically provide space for claimants to report such income.  According to SSA, in 2009, 9 percent of the aggregate income of those  age 65 and older consisted of private pension income.", "The application forms do provide a space to report other income sources  not specifically itemized on the forms. However, some claims processors  we spoke with said claimants who report an amount in that space do not  usually specify the source of this income, or if this amount represents a  single or a combination of income sources. As a result, they have to  follow up with the claimant to obtain this information, which delays the  processing of these claims.", "Similarly, although the application forms specifically ask claimants to  report assets such as bank accounts, stocks, and real property, the forms  do not ask about other common assets such as annuities and trusts,  which need to be considered when VA assesses claimants\u2019 financial  eligibility. (See figure 1 to view the section of the application form  pertaining to income and assets.) We found cases where claimants did  not report assets that they are not specifically asked to report. For  example, in one case a claimant did not report a trust with assets valued  at about $575,000. In another case, a claimant did not report a trust worth  about $612,000. In contrast, we reviewed several state application forms  for Medicaid long-term care benefits that specifically asked individuals to  report information about annuities and trusts they may own, as well as  retirement income.", "VA\u2019s application forms also do not provide a specific space for claimants  to report asset transfers, even though the instructions on the veterans\u2019  application form ask claimants to disclose this information. Asset transfers  to someone outside the claimant\u2019s household are allowed under the  pension program, as long as the claimant relinquishes ownership and  control of the asset. However, VA still needs to know about any asset  transfers when assessing a claimant\u2019s financial eligibility because,  consistent with VA\u2019s regulations, the department must determine whether  the claimant retains ownership and control of the transferred asset and if  this asset should be counted as part of the claimant\u2019s net worth. Without a  designated space to report this type of information, claimants may not  report asset transfers on the application forms. For example, we saw one  case where a veteran transferred assets worth about $500,000 into an  irrevocable trust 2 weeks prior to applying and did not report this on the  application. VA learned of this asset transfer because the claims  processor inquired about how the claimant\u2019s medical expenses were  being paid. If the claims processor had not identified these assets and  determined that they should be included in the claimant\u2019s net worth,  because the claimant had not relinquished all ownership and control, the  claim could have been approved.

VA does not require claimants to submit  documents that corroborate self-reported financial information with their  application, such as bank statements and tax returns. VA also does not  require receipts to verify some types of claimed deductible expenses,  even though these expenses may be a factor that enables some pension  claimants to qualify for benefits. Without independent verification of self- reported financial information, VA will have difficulty detecting fraudulent  claims. We identified cases where VA found individuals were advised by  third parties to claim expenses they did not incur related to assistance  with everyday living activities. For example, we saw one claim that was  prepared by a financial planner in which $1,700 in monthly caregiver  payments to a daughter were claimed. The claimant subsequently stated  to VA that he did not pay his daughter any caregiver fees. In another  case, a pension recipient claimed an attorney advised him to claim he  was paying his son $1,000 per month for services that were not being  provided in order to be eligible for a higher pension rate. The recipient  subsequently withdrew this claimed medical expense. Most claims  processors we spoke with said they accept self-reported financial  information unless questions arise, and in those cases, supporting  documentation may be requested. In contrast, some state Medicaid  programs and the SSI program require applicants to submit documents  that support some reported financial information, such as bank  statements and tax returns.", "VA also does not make use of existing opportunities to verify self-reported  financial information during the initial eligibility determination. For  example, VA conducts computer matches to verify reported income from  SSA benefits during the initial claims assessment process but is not using  this type of technology to verify the accuracy of other self-reported  financial information. Additional automated systems may be available that  would enable VA to independently verify financial information during the  initial eligibility assessment. For example, while VA performs a data  match with Internal Revenue Service and SSA data to assess ongoing  eligibility, it does not perform this match at the time of the initial claims  assessment. In addition, for the SSI program, SSA recently implemented  the Access to Financial Institutions system that allows the program to  electronically request and receive records from financial institutions and  verify an applicant\u2019s or recipient\u2019s financial information. Similarly,  Medicaid requires states to implement an asset verification system for  assessing applicants\u2019 and recipients\u2019 financial eligibility.", "VA\u2019s efforts to verify ongoing eligibility for pension benefits also have  some shortcomings. Pension recipients who have previously reported  income in addition to, or other than, Social Security income must annually  complete an EVR. However, like the application forms, the EVRs do not  provide spaces for claimants to report private retirement income,  annuities, trusts, or asset transfers, and self-reported financial information  is not independently verified unless the claims processor has questions.  In addition, because not all pension recipients complete an EVR, VA may  not be able to identify potential changes in the financial situation of  recipients that may affect their ongoing eligibility for these benefits.", "Other efforts to verify ongoing eligibility may not be effective in identifying  ineligible pension recipients. VA\u2019s Income Verification Match (IVM)  program uses a computer match to compare income reported to VA by  pension recipients for a given year with SSA earned income data and IRS  unearned income data for that year, to determine if these recipients have  any unreported income. However, there is about a 15-month lag between  when a pension recipient reports income and when the IVM can be  conducted, and the delay may be even longer. For example, in 2011, VA  was completing IVMs for income information that was reported in 2007.  As a result, improper payments may be made to ineligible pension  recipients for at least over a year, but possibly several years, before the  error is detected. In one case we reviewed, a beneficiary, who was  approved for benefits in 2004 and reported $900 in net worth when he  applied, had stocks worth over $162,000 at that time, which was only  identified through the IVM process in 2007. This created an overpayment  of over $18,000 that VA eventually waived. In addition to the IVM not  being conducted in a timely manner, the match does not identify any  assets that do not generate income, such as deferred annuities for which  payments have not begun. Therefore, the IVM would not be effective in  identifying these types of assets. Ultimately, delays in the IVM process  prevent VA from promptly detecting improper pension payments and  increase the magnitude of these payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities for Internal Coordination Are Not Maximized", "paragraphs": ["Opportunities for coordination between VA\u2019s pension and fiduciary  programs to identify ineligible pension recipients are not always  maximized.fiduciary program are pension recipients.

A VA official from one of  the PMCs told us that when claims processors had access to field exam  reports prior to the issuance of the new guidance, cases of asset  transfers or unreported assets were identified from reviews of these  reports, even when there was no prior notification from fiduciary program  staff. In addition, as part of our case file review, we identified cases of  asset transfers or unreported assets that were identified in fiduciary field  exam reports.

For example, VA\u2019s procedures  manual states that the value of any property owned by pension claimants  must be considered when assessing financial eligibility for benefits, but  the manual does not specifically discuss when or under what  circumstance annuities or trusts should count as part of net worth.  According to VA officials, and consistent with VA regulations, the decision  as to whether an asset should be counted in a claimant\u2019s net worth  depends on whether the claimant has ownership and control of the asset.  However, VA has not adequately defined the concept of ownership and  control of assets in either its regulations or internal guidance and policy  documents. As a result, VA cannot ensure that claims processors are  making fully informed eligibility decisions that are consistent with VA  policy.", "Several claims processors we spoke with confirmed that guidance on  assessing net worth is unclear, and that it is difficult to determine when to  count certain assets. For example, one claims processor expressed  uncertainty whether to count trusts established for children residing  outside of a claimant\u2019s household when the funds are being used to pay  for claimant\u2019s expenses, since VA\u2019s regulations do not directly address  these types of cases. A VA official acknowledged that guidance on what  constitutes ownership and control of an asset could be improved. We  were provided local training material from one PMC on when to count  assets in a trust and found that it seemed inconsistent with VA\u2019s  regulations regarding when to count assets. For example, the PMC  training material stated that a claim involving assets transferred into a  trust a claimant cannot access would likely be denied due to excess net  worth. However, as we noted earlier, VA regulations indicate that assets  gifted to someone outside a claimant\u2019s household should not be counted  as part of net worth if ownership and control of the asset has been  relinquished. Also, according to VA officials we spoke with, claims  processors do not have access to VA attorneys who could assist them in  examining trust agreements and other documents to determine if a  claimant has ownership and control of an asset.", "Unclear or disparate guidance about counting assets as part of net worth  may also lead to different decisions in similar cases. For example, we  saw two separate cases in which, just prior to applying, claimants  transferred excess assets into trusts to which they did not have access.  One of the claims was approved, but the other was denied. For the  approved claim, VA determined the claimant did not have ownership and  control of the trust and therefore did not count it in the veteran\u2019s net  worth. For the denied claim, VA also determined that the claimant did not  have access to the trust, but the claim was denied because the claims  processor felt the applicant was attempting to manipulate assets to qualify  for benefits. The denial letter to the claimant explained that VA\u2019s income  programs are not intended to protect substantial assets or build up the  beneficiary\u2019s estate for heirs.", "Further, we found that VA also lacks specific guidance on how to  determine whether or not a claimant\u2019s financial resources are sufficient to  meet their basic needs without the pension benefit. VA\u2019s procedures  manual states that pension claims should be denied if a claimant\u2019s  financial resources are sufficient enough to pay for their living expenses  for a \u201creasonable period of time,\u201d but it does not define this term. As a  result, claims processors must use their own discretion to determine what  period of time is reasonable for claimants to use their assets before  needing the assistance of the VA pension. Among case files we reviewed,  we found inconsistent claims decisions for claimants whose financial  resources would last about the same amount of time and who had similar  life expectancies. For example, two veterans whose net worth was  projected to provide for their needs for 2 years received different  decisions on their claims based on this net worth. In this instance, a 90- year-old with a life expectancy of 4.4 years was denied benefits, while a  94-year-old with a life expectancy of 3.2 years was approved.

In employing this strategy, assets that  VA would count when determining financial eligibility for pension benefits  are converted into monthly income. This monthly income would fall below  program thresholds and enable the claimant to still qualify for the benefits.  About one-third of the organizations recommended strategies that included  the use of both annuities and trusts. For example, one organization we  contacted advised repositioning some excess assets into an irrevocable  trust, with the son as the trustee, and placing remaining excess assets into  a deferred annuity that would not be completely accessible, since most of  the funds could not be withdrawn without a penalty. In addition, several  organization representatives we interviewed also told us they may advise  using caretaker agreements to enable a client to qualify for VA pension  benefits. Organizations told us this strategy generally involves the pension  claimant transferring assets to family members as part of a contract, in  exchange for caretaker services to be provided by these family members  for the remainder of the claimant\u2019s lifetime.", "Some organization representatives we interviewed told us that  transferring assets to qualify for VA pension benefits is advantageous for  elderly pension claimants because it enables them to have more income  to pay for care expenses and remain out of a nursing home for a longer  period of time. For example, representatives from one organization said  the use of immediate income annuities allows pension claimants to  increase their monthly income that, combined with the VA pension, could  help pay for assisted living or in-home care costs. Other financial  planners and attorneys said if claimants do not conduct financial or estate  planning to qualify for the VA pension and instead spend down their  assets prior to applying, the monthly amount of the pension benefit they  eventually receive may be insufficient to pay for their long-term care.  They said that, as a result, these claimants may decide to seek Medicaid  coverage for nursing home care because of their lack of financial  resources, when they could have remained in an assisted living facility or  at home with the aid of the VA pension. Some of these organizations told  us that nursing home care financed by Medicaid is more costly for the  government than if the veteran had received the VA pension benefit and  obtained care in a lower-cost assisted living facility.", "Many organizations we identified also conduct presentations on VA  pension benefits at assisted living or retirement communities to identify  prospective clients. According to attorneys and officials from state attorneys  general offices we spoke with, managers of assisted living facilities or  retirement communities may have an interest in inviting organization  representatives to conduct presentations on VA pension benefits because  these benefits allow them to obtain new residents by making the costs  more affordable. For example, we obtained documentation indicating that  one retirement community paid an organization representative a fee for a  new resident he helped the facility obtain. Another community in another  state paid organization representatives fees to assist residents in  completing the VA pension application."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Products and Services May Adversely Affect Claimants", "paragraphs": ["Some products may not be suitable for elderly veterans because they  may lose access to funds they may need for future expenses, such as  medical care. To help elderly clients become financially eligible for VA  pension benefits, some organizations may sell deferred annuities, which  would make the client unable to access the funds in the annuity during  their expected lifetime without facing high withdrawal fees, according to  some attorneys we spoke with. An elderly advocacy organization  representative we spoke with also noted that elderly individuals are  impoverishing themselves by purchasing these products when they may  need the transferred assets to pay for their long-term care expenses. As  part of our investigative work, one organization provided a financial plan  to qualify for VA pension benefits that included both an immediate annuity  as well as a deferred annuity for an 86-year-old veteran that would  generate payments only after the veteran\u2019s life expectancy.", "Some organizations that assist in transferring assets to qualify people for  VA pension benefits may not consider the implications of these transfers  on eligibility for Medicaid coverage for long-term care. Individuals who  transfer assets to qualify for the VA pension may become ineligible for  Medicaid coverage for long-term care services they may need in the  future. For example, asset transfers that may enable someone to qualify  for the VA pension program, such as gifts to someone not residing in a  claimant\u2019s household, the purchase of deferred annuities, or the  establishment of trusts, may result in a delay in Medicaid eligibility if the  assets were transferred for less than fair market value during the 60- month look-back period. According to several attorneys we spoke with,  some organization representatives are unaware or indifferent to the  adverse effects on Medicaid eligibility of the products and services they  market to qualify for the VA pension. As a result, potential pension  claimants may be unaware the purchase of these products and services  may subsequently delay their eligibility for Medicaid.", "In addition to the potential adverse impact of transferring assets, we  heard concerns that marketing strategies used by some of these  companies may be misleading. According to several attorneys we spoke  with, some organization representatives market their services in a way  that leads potential pension claimants and their family members to  believe they are veterans advocates working for a nonprofit organization,  or are endorsed by VA. As a result, they may fail to realize these  representatives are actually interested in selling financial Products. For  example, some organization representatives may tell attendees during  presentations at assisted living facilities that their services consist of  providing information on VA pension benefits and assisting with the  application, and do not disclose they are insurance agents selling  annuities to help people qualify for these benefits. One elder law attorney  we spoke with said that many attendees at these presentations may have  Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia, and are not in a position to make  decisions about their finances. Therefore, they are vulnerable to being  convinced by these representatives that they must purchase a financial  product to qualify for these benefits.", "Concerns have also been raised that VA\u2019s accreditation of individuals to  assist with applying for VA benefits may have unintended consequences.  According to attorneys and officials in one state, organization  representatives use their VA accreditation to assist in preparing claims as  a marketing tool that generates trust and allows them to attract clients.  Claimants may not understand that this accreditation only means that the  individual is proficient in VA\u2019s policies and procedures to assist in  preparing and submitting VA benefits claims, and does not ensure the  Products and services these individuals are selling are in claimant\u2019s best  interests.", "Finally, some organizations may provide erroneous information to clients,  or fail to follow through on assisting them with submitting the pension  application, which can adversely affect pension claimants. For example,  one veteran said he was told by an organization representative to sell his  home prior to applying for the VA pension and that he did not have to  report the proceeds from the sale on the application. He followed this  advice, but VA identified these assets, which caused him to incur a debt  to VA of $40,000 resulting from a benefit overpayment. Organizations  may also promise assistance with the application process to any  interested pension claimant but, unbeknownst to the claimant, may not  follow through in providing this service if the claimant does not want to  transfer assets. For example, the daughter of a veteran we spoke with,  who sought application assistance from an organization representative,  told us the representative never submitted her father\u2019s pension claim to  VA as promised. She learned of this about a year after she thought the  claim was submitted and had to reapply through a county veterans  service officer. Her father was approved 2 months later but passed away  less than a month after his approval. She believes her father could have  received benefits for a year if the representative had submitted the claim,  and believes he did not do so because she did not want to use his  services to transfer assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs for Services to Transfer Assets Varied, but Some Organizations May Be Charging Prohibited Fees", "paragraphs": ["The costs of services provided by these organizations to assist in  qualifying for VA pension benefits varied, but organizations may be  charging prohibited fees. Among the 19 organizations our investigative  staff contacted for this review, about one-third said they did not charge for  their services to help claimants qualify for VA pension benefits. For  example, financial planners told us that, generally, there are no direct  costs associated with transferring assets into an annuity, but that costs  would be included in the terms of the annuity, such as the commission  earned by the insurance agent. Among organizations that did charge for  services, fees ranged from a few hundred dollars for benefits counseling  to up to $10,000 for the establishment of a trust. Also, although federal  law prohibits charging fees to assist in completing and submitting  applications for VA benefits, representatives from veterans advocacy  groups and some attorneys we spoke with raised concerns that these  organizations may be charging for fees related to the application, or find  ways to circumvent this prohibition, such as by claiming they are charging  for benefits counseling. For example, one organization our investigative  staff contacted charged $850 to have an attorney work on the application  process, a $225 analysis fee, and $1,600 for the establishment of a trust.  Another organization representative indicated he charged a \u201clong-term  planning fee\u201d of $1,200 to be paid prior to services being provided. The  organization representative asked that someone other than the veteran  pay this fee, claiming that only disinterested third parties can be charged  fees but not the veteran. In addition, concerns have been raised that fees  charged may be excessive for the services provided. In July 2011,  California enacted a law generally prohibiting unreasonable fees from  being charged for these services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The VA pension program provides a critical benefit to veterans, many of  whom are elderly, who have only limited financial resources to support  themselves. Current federal law allows veterans to transfer significant  assets prior to applying for a VA pension and still be approved for benefits,  but this arrangement seems to circumvent the intended purpose of the  program and wastes taxpayer dollars. Without stronger controls over asset  transfers, similar to other means-tested programs like Medicaid\u2019s look-back  and penalty period, VA cannot ensure that only those with financial need  receive pension benefits. As a result, VA pension claimants who have  sufficient assets to pay for their expenses can transfer these assets and  qualify for this means-tested benefit. Moreover, because VA\u2019s policies and  procedures for assessing the initial financial eligibility of pension claimants  do not adequately ensure that only veterans and surviving spouses who  meet financial eligibility requirements are granted benefits, the program is  vulnerable to abuse. In particular, claims processors\u2019 reliance on unverified  self-reported information when assessing eligibility means that VA cannot  be assured that it is obtaining all relevant financial information from  claimants, including information on asset transfers, trusts, annuities, and  other forms of retirement income. Without all this information, claims  processors may improperly grant pension benefits to claimants who do not  meet financial eligibility requirements. In addition, while safeguarding  fiduciaries\u2019 personal information is important, the lack of adequate  coordination between VA\u2019s pension and fiduciary programs may result in  missed opportunities to identify financially ineligible pension claimants,  further undermining program integrity. Finally, because VA\u2019s guidance  concerning when assets should be counted as part of a claimant\u2019s net  worth and how to evaluate a claimant\u2019s net worth in determining eligibility  lack sufficient clarity, the program remains vulnerable to inconsistent  interpretation and payments to ineligible individuals. Ultimately, in this era  of constrained financial resources, VA has a responsibility to manage  limited funds wisely, and help ensure continued public support for this  important program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that only those in financial need are granted VA pension  benefits, Congress should consider establishing a look-back and penalty  period for claimants who transfer assets for less than fair market value  prior to applying, similar to other means-tested programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve VA\u2019s ability to ensure that only veterans and surviving  spouses with financial need receive VA pension benefits, the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs should direct the Undersecretary for Benefits to take the  following four actions:  1.  Modify pension application forms, as well as EVR forms, to include  space for claimants or recipients to report asset transfers, and to  specify annuities, trusts, or private retirement income. For assets,  such as annuities and trusts that are reported, forms should also  request related documentation to enable claims processors to  determine if claimants or recipients retain ownership and control of  these assets.  2.  For all claimants, verify financial information during the initial claims  assessment process. This may include requesting supporting  documentation such as bank statements and tax returns, or using  automated databases that can verify financial information.  3.  Strengthen coordination between pension and fiduciary programs to  identify pension claimants or recipients who have transferred or  unreported assets, such as allowing claims processors access to  fiduciary field exam reports for these cases.  4.  Revise the VA procedures manual to better define the concept of  ownership and control to help claims processors determine when  specific types of assets such as annuities and trusts should be  counted as part of net worth, and establish a more specific criteria for  what is considered a reasonable period of time for pension claimants  to use up their financial resources before becoming eligible for  pension benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for  review and comment.

VA noted, however, that conducting this verification would add additional  time to adjudicate pension claims. VA said it expects to complete an  analysis by November 1, 2012 of whether financial information can be  verified without placing undue burdens on claimants and recipients. We  acknowledge that rigorous verification processes can sometimes entail  additional time during the initial claims phase, but we continue to believe  that such verification is an important part of ensuring that VA adequately  balances its stewardship responsibilities with its service activities.  We  support the analysis VA is undertaking.", "Regarding our recommendation to strengthen coordination between the  pension and fiduciary programs, VA concurred and noted that it has  established a workgroup that is developing procedures to further enable  fiduciary program staff to share income information with pension program  staff.", "VA also concurred with our recommendation that the procedures manual  be revised to better define the concept of ownership and control of assets  and to establish a more specific criteria for what is considered a  reasonable period of time for claimants to use their financial resources  before becoming eligible for pension benefits. VA stated that it is drafting  regulations that would address the effect on eligibility of transferring  assets prior to applying for pension benefits. They noted these  regulations would address and clarify the various factors VA uses to  determine whether a claimant\u2019s net worth precludes eligibility for pension  benefits and would provide a more consistent set of rules for adjudicating  claims.

To verify how VA assesses  the net worth of pension claimants, we conducted a review of a  nongeneralizable random sample of 85 of the total of 3,196 fiscal year  2010 pension claim files completed by each of the PMCs that were  entered in VA\u2019s electronic case file system, in which VA had to formally  determine if the claimant\u2019s assets were excessive to be approved for  pension benefits.

And so what I\u2019m trying to share with you, you know, if you  just, you know, take a bite at a time, you know, like the old saying, you can\u2019t eat an  elephant in one bite, we need just a bite of your time.", "You will get through this and you\u2019ll get the money.", "But if we try to jump ahead, you know, I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s never been successful.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. What \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And I hope you understand. I\u2019m just giving you  my expertise and experience in this.", "We do over \u2014 we submit over four hundred apps a month, and everybody gets  the benefit, so we know how to do it, we know how to get it done.", "And nothing is going to be a surprise to you. Everything is going to be here, this  is your option. If you want this, you\u2019ve got to do this.", "And then it\u2019s up for you to decide. But it\u2019s just a matter of getting you to that point  where you have all the facts, so you can make a decision.", "And so the questions you\u2019re asking are all valid, you know, they are all the  questions that we\u2019ll be delving into very deeply. If you need a CPA involved, we have a  CPA on our team. We have our attorney on our team that I use, . He\u2019ll be a part of  all the conversations if we need, so all throughout.", "And none of that is costing you any money, because that\u2019s part of my fee.", "But what I\u2019m saying is, all those questions that you have now, when you are  ready for the answers, we\u2019ll have those conversations. But right now, you\u2019re not ready for  the answers. It\u2019s difficult to understand this, why this, what that?", "All those answers you are going to get from me right now are going to create  more and more questions, and things are going to get so confusing for you.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: This process is already confusing enough, I\u2019ve  got to tell you.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: There are some three hundred to four hundred  thousand applications a month \u2014 I mean, I shouldn\u2019t say a month. The VA has over \u2014  between three hundred and four hundred thousand applications backlogged, sitting there,  because people didn\u2019t do the process right, and it will take them up to two years to get  approved.", "You know, that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 it is difficult. It has to be done a certain way, and I\u2019ll  get you there. I promise, I\u2019ll get you there, but you just have to go through it step-by-step.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. Well, the only other question I have then is the  cost. What is the cost involved?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: If there is any cost, it would be with the  attorney. They charge \u2014 they\u2019ll charge a fee for setting up certain documents, and we\u2019ll  get to that, as well.", "The worst case, let\u2019s say your dad, he has a house, and you\u2019re not able to sell  the house. See, while he\u2019s living in it, they don\u2019t care that he owns a home, but when he\u2019s  out of the house, they consider it an asset.", "We have to \u2014 we\u2019ll have to do something with the house, as well. If you were  planning on selling it, fine.", "If you weren\u2019t planning on selling it, that\u2019s fine, too, but we\u2019ll have to address it.", "The worst case scenario would be about fourteen hundred bucks. That\u2019s a worst  case scenario.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And when you understand what that all entails,  you\u2019ll be like, geez, fourteen hundred bucks, let\u2019s find out tomorrow. That\u2019s another thing,  you know, when you understand everything that you get with that.", "And he\u2019ll make sure everything is done the right way so that the VA can never  come back at you, seeing that the house is protected, your mother is protected, you know.", "I\u2019m just saying, there\u2019s a whole lot to it, and to try to answer it over the phone is  more than tough.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. All right. So there\u2019s no \u2014 that\u2019s just an attorney  fee? I mean, there\u2019s no fee for you?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Exactly.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: There\u2019s no fee for you, at all?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No, not at all.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Does the VA pay you or something?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Hang on a second. Let me do this. I hate to try  to get you \u2014 are you busy during the day?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Ummmm.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Is there like an hour of time that you and I can  get together and get the process started, so I can show you how \u2014 how it all works?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, I mean, probably, but probably not until, you know,  after the holidays.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Then let\u2019s do this. If you have your  schedule, my schedule is tied up until the second week of January, already filled with  seminars and things to \u2014 so people can come and see me. The second week I have at  least two seminars, and I usually have thirty to forty people at each seminar.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And then about half of those people sit down  with me and want to go to the next step.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So if I do two or four presentations, I mean, I\u2019ve  got thirty to fifty appointments during the second week of January. So if you and I can get  together in the first week, I can get you started before all that mess starts.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. Well, I wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be beneficial to go to  one of the seminars?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, the seminar is in .", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: In where?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: In , but really, what I do there is more of  a blanket meeting.", "If you already know you have a situation, you already know you have an interest,  I go over that same information that I go over in the seminar. But the seminar, it\u2019s just  information, and I will be giving that to you face-to-face, and be able to collect the  information and get started on the process.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. Yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t have a lot of questions, you  know, I just want to know what types of Products :  you\u2019re talking about that we would \u2014  where the assets would go, how \u2014 I mean, are we talking about \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It all depends on your dad\u2019s needs. Right now  we don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t know anything about your situation. I don\u2019t know what your costs  are, I don\u2019t know what his expenses, his needs are. I don\u2019t have any idea what the cash  flow management requirements will be \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 this year, next year, five years down the  road. You know, as a financial advisor, you know, I come from the banking industry, where  I worked in the trust department, and my clients were all multi, multi-millionaires. And all I  did for them was identify what their needs were going to be year in and year out, into the  future \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 protecting their assets, so that they knew  that money was going to be there (unintelligible). Like your dad, the last thing he wants to  do is have his nest egg at risk.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: He\u2019s going to need \u2014 he\u2019s going to need  income from it to maybe offset some of the cost of his retirement community, perhaps.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don\u2019t know, you know, I don\u2019t have any  answers, at this point, because I don\u2019t know what his needs are, what your family needs  are, you know, how many kids are there, who all is involved.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I mean, basically, it\u2019s just him. I mean, he\u2019s got his Social  Security, and then, if he qualifies for the VA Pension, he would have that. So I imagine  that would be enough income for him. So it\u2019s just a matter of doing something with the  assets, so he doesn\u2019t lose it. So \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Exactly. And that\u2019s something you and I will  discuss and work on. Are you \u2014 are you handling his affairs now?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So you take care of all of his bills?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So you are the person who understands best,  you know, what your parents, you know, what the family, you know, your father, your  mother, your parents, what their requirements are.", "Now your mother has passed; is that correct?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yes, uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, so we\u2019re just talking about your dad  here.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So here\u2019s \u2014 the VA just increased the payment  to the Veteran, single Veteran, to right around seventeen hundred a month, tax-free, so  it\u2019s a pretty substantial benefit; that\u2019s over twenty thousand dollars a year.", "If you are looking at his \u2014 looking at what his Social Security is \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 you add that, plus his VA, it may cover his  long-term care facility.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh, yeah, his Social Security is twelve hundred, so  you\u2019re talking about somewhere close to almost three thousand dollars a month.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yeah, exactly, so that\u2019s not bad, that\u2019s not bad.  Now it depends on what kind of community he would be looking at, but you know, that\u2019s. .  .", "You know, the hardest part is getting started, and then once you get to a certain  point, you\u2019ll be like, yeah, I get it, I get it, now I understand, this is what we do.", "Let me ask you, is Tuesday the 3rd or is Wednesday the 4th a better day for  you?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, probably Wednesday will be better for me.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And you\u2019re in ?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yes.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. How does 10 a.m. work?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Are you talking about coming down to me or where?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yeah, absolutely, I\u2019d come to you.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: That sounds good, tentatively. I\u2019ve got to check and  make sure that \u2014 I have to check a couple things here, but I mean, it sounds good.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What address is the best place to meet you?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, you know, I\u2019m guessing that it might be just as good  to do it at the office. I\u2019ll tell you what, are you going to be around this afternoon?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yeah, do you want to give me a call back?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, let me give you a call back. Let me check the  schedule and make sure it\u2019s good. I think it would probably be easier just to do this at the  office.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. What city is it?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I\u2019m sorry?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What city is your office in?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: In .", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Near .", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Near , okay, (unintelligible). All right, good.", "Give me a call back just to confirm if 10 a.m. works. If I don\u2019t answer, just leave a  message. I may go out and do some shopping (unintelligible).", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: All right.

This is . Did somebody call this  number?", "VA benefits.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. What can I help you with?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, I\u2019m just trying to figure out my \u2014 this is for my  father.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Uh-huh.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: And, you know, he\u2019s not currently getting benefits. He  gets Social Security.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Right.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: But, you know, I was \u2014 I\u2019m trying to see if maybe he  could qualify for benefits. But the problem is he\u2019s got, you know, some assets, and I\u2019m not  sure, you know, if that precludes him from getting benefits or not. So I wanted to talk to  somebody \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No. No. Is he \u2014 does he need some help  around the house or has he got some medical or physical impairments \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 right now?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah. I mean, he\u2019s 86. I mean, mentally he\u2019s fine. But,  you know, physically he needs a lot of help in just, you know, walking and getting in and  out of bed.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: And, I mean, yeah, he needs help.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sure. If you will \u2014 if you will do me a favor, I\u2019m  going to send you \u2014 do you have an e-mail address?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, not really. But, I mean, I can probably get  something. But what do you need?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I was going to send you a little form, and  if you can just spend a few minutes and fill it out, then I can tell you if your father is  available for benefits or not.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. I mean, I mean, basically I\u2019m assuming he \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I probably could do this \u2014 I could do this over  the phone, too. But right now I\u2019m just going and jumping on a conference call. So I can call  you back and I can ask you the questions I need to ask you, if you want. Maybe in \u2014 I\u2019d  say within a couple of hours I can get back with you.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. Yeah, that might work.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. It is a means-tested and an asset-tested  \u2013 uh, benefit, but \u2013 um, essentially there are legal work-arounds. And if you know, it\u2019s  basically you have to put together a good presentation for the Veterans Administration.  And that\u2019s what we do. We help people um \u2014 position assets and coordinate the  presentation effort to the VA. So there\u2019s really not many kinds \u2014 if, in fact, your father has  lost some of the activities of daily living, then we really can\u2019t get him qualified. So I\u2019ll just \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 make a short explanation like that.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah. And just to kind of make it short, I mean, his  income isn\u2019t the thing, because he\u2019s only getting Social Security. But he\u2019s got assets that  are probably \u2014 between his house and some savings and stuff, he\u2019s probably, you know,  a little bit over $500,000.", "And I\u2019m wondering if that precludes him from qualifying.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No. No, it doesn\u2019t, especially if he\u2019s got a little  bit of uh \u2014 flexibility. How much is the house worth? The house is really not an issue at  all.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, that\u2019s probably about 200,000.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Oh, so you have 300 in other stuff? Okay.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve qualified people with that \u2014 beyond $700,000 worth of liquid assets. So that\u2019s  not the issue. But sometimes the older folks, you know, your father being 82 \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Eighty-six.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Eighty-six, I\u2019m sorry. Sometimes they \u2014 oh,  they\u2019re not \u2014 what would be the word? They\u2019re sometimes control freaks, meaning  sometimes what we have to do is retitle assets. He would still be totally in control of them,  but not under his direct purvey.", "So if he can understand the strategy, he could understand that, you know, he\u2019s  entitled to the benefit. It could be \u2014 he\u2019s single right now?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, yeah. His wife is dead.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. So, you know, basically he performed for  his country. If he was able to get aid and attendance, he would get real close to \u2014  actually, this year is $19,736 per year. And if that means something to him, then we can  help him out. If it doesn\u2019t, then  he\u2019ll just have to go through spend-down and spend it.", "So we can \u2014 we can make it work, but he\u2019s got to be willing to help us. Okay?", "We can\u2019t force people to do something that they\u2019re not wanting to do.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I got it.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. It\u2019s real simple \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: What sorts of things are you talking about? I mean,  where do we put it?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, for instance, do you have power of  attorney for him right now?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, I don\u2019t. But, you know, he\u2019s pretty \u2014 he\u2019s pretty  lucid. I mean, I \u2014 I can probably get it.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, typically speaking, for people that have  had a child or relative assigned a power of attorney, then they\u2019ve kind of realized that, you  know, if something happens, they may need some help. Somebody acting in their financial  capacity if they get in a situation where they can\u2019t perform or somebody to make some  medical decisions for them.", "So at that point in time, they\u2019ve kind of acquiesced to the fact that, you know, at  this point in my life, I need a little bit of help.", "So I was going to say, if he\u2019d already given you power of attorney, then  essentially what he said is, you know, he trusts you.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And if that\u2019s the case, then essentially it\u2019s going  to be that type of a relationship where things may be put into special types of trusts where  he is still \u2014 where you would have a fiduciary responsibility to him. So it\u2019s a contractual  obligation. It\u2019s \u2014 all the money is for the benefit of him, but it\u2019s not under his direct control.", "Now, that\u2019s not necessarily the only way it can be done. There are also what we  call care contracts where essentially he can kind of prepay in a contractual manner for his  future care. It gets it out of his immediate possession and would help qualify for those  types of benefits.", "So there\u2019s a myriad of strategies. I work with an attorney. We\u2019ll make sure it  works for you. But he just has to understand that either he wants to get the benefit or he  doesn\u2019t. If he does, we can make it work. If he doesn\u2019t, then that\u2019s okay, too.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right. Well, I mean \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It\u2019s up to him.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: \u2014 I don\u2019t think he wants to lose his assets. And, you  know, you know, we don\u2019t want him to lose his assets. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest  concern now.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Right. There\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a \u2014 yeah, well, he will  if he needs the care. Then the other issue you have coming up, too, of course, is  sometimes folks that mostly qualify for the benefit will essentially possibly qualify for  Medicaid, too. And what that means is that, yes, I mean, if his expenses go to $6-7-8-9- 10,000 a month, then he will lose his assets unless he does something to protect them. So  we can help out in that regard, too.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It\u2019s \u2014 you really don\u2019t have \u2014 you don\u2019t have  an e-mail address really?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, I can get one for you, yeah. I\u2019m not real computer  \u2014 I\u2019m not a computer guy. That\u2019s all.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Well, I can appreciate that. We probably  \u2014 I\u2019m thinking here \u2014 is this your cell number?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: You wouldn\u2019t be able to print it if I gave it to you  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Do you have something on your web site?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don\u2019t have a \u2014 I don\u2019t have the form  embedded. Let\u2019s just talk in a couple of hours. I\u2019ll ask you the question. You know, I can  tell pretty much right now that I can help you out. It\u2019s just a matter to the extent where you  need to ask your father \u2014 well, probably before you talk to me again. Say, Hey, Dad, you  know, I talked to an accredited VA application guy, and he says that, you know, we can  get you the benefit but there is some strategy involved. And if you want to hear it, fine. If  not, that\u2019s okay, too.", "You know, that\u2019s just really what you need to do with this.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: All right. What do you guys charge for that?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, for the \u2014 there\u2019s two ways. Let\u2019s just  leave it at a thousand \u2014 $1,050, okay?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Just a straight fee?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yeah, $1,050. Of course, what we really want  to do is to be able to \u2013 we can give you the recommendations and turn you loose, and you  go out there on the street and try to implement it.", "But, you know, you probably really want to kind of go through us and let us help  you in the full way. I will send you enough information and the attorney\u2019s information so  that you\u2019ll understand that we really are a full-fledged service organization and can really  help you through this mix.", "And then, you know, once we help you out, you can either go down to the local  VA office and have them fill out the paperwork. Is your father \u2014 is your father in the same  town as you or is he \u2014 where is your father?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, he\u2019s not that far away. About, you know, seven,  eight miles away.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Where \u2014 where are you located?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I\u2019m actually in north .", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Oh, are you? What part?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, are you familiar with  at all?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. I went to  so \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Oh, no kidding.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yeah.

I mean, you know,  my brother might have something that I can \u2014 I can use.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Yeah, because, really, this is a family  discussion. You know, all the kids \u2014 how many kids are there besides you?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Just me and my brother.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: All right. So you guys are really going to need  to put your heads together and say, hey, this makes sense for us or it doesn\u2019t. You know,  dad is going to have to cooperate or he\u2019s not. And, you know, sometimes, to be honest  with you \u2014 I deal with older folks, you know \u2014 they just don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s fanny.

Can you tell me a little bit about  your dad\u2019s situation?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, he\u2019s a World War II veteran.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: He\u2019s 86 years old. Are you there?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What is the nature of his illness?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I\u2019m sorry?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Can you tell me about his illness, please.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, you know, aside from getting old?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yeah.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: He\u2019s having a lot of \u2014 he can\u2019t walk too well.", "He\u2019s got a lot of, you know, joint problems and stuff like that.", "So he can\u2019t \u2014 he needs a lot of help getting in and out of bed, taking baths and  stuff like that.", "He\u2019s also got \u2014 he doesn\u2019t hear very well.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And how old is your dad?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: He\u2019s 86.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: God bless him.", "I guess just wearing out.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Where does he live? Is he living with you or is  he in a facility?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: No, he\u2019s got a place, he\u2019s got a house.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Ok. Are you planning on leaving him at the  house, staying at the house?", "Is he going to have any in-home health care coming in?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, I mean, in-home, I would think, because I mean,  mentally he\u2019s fine.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Have you checked with an in-home health care  agency to come to the house?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, yeah, he\u2019s got people coming in already.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: He does. Okay.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I mean, that\u2019s kind of why I\u2019m \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I see. The reason why I ask those questions is  that in order to get VA benefits, called Aid and Attendance, which is a benefit that the  government will pay up to nineteen fifty per month, tax-free, and the government usually  pays that 9 months out from the time we apply.", "And you get also a retroactive, so it would be 8 months on top of that.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It\u2019s that they need to have something in place  like in-home health care already being used or about to be used, or he lives in an  assisted-living facility or a nursing home.", "And those are key. One of those three things have to be in place or about to be  in place.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: He is getting help already at the house.

What is  coming in per month, as far as income?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: He\u2019s got eleven fifty coming in a month.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Anything else?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, no, because he\u2019s got some \u2014 you know, he owns  his own house.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Right. I\u2019m just asking; I don\u2019t know your  situation.", "But eleven fifty a month in Social Security. No other income is coming in.", "No savings?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: No, he\u2019s got some savings and stuff, but I mean, I\u2019m  concerned, again, he\u2019s going to lose all that.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Right.", "See, how we work \u2014 first of all, I\u2019m accredited by the VA. And what we do is we  plug into the software to see what dad qualifies for.", "And what we plug into the software is money going in, money going out, money  saved, illnesses, what his illness issues are, in other words, what the home health care  agency is doing for dad.", "All of that plays a major role in crunching the numbers to see what dad qualified  for.", "And in most cases, , it\u2019s not a matter of if he qualifies, it\u2019s a matter of how  much.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That\u2019s going to have to be our next  conversation.", "I\u2019m just trying to get a little information to see if I can guide you in the right  direction.", "My question to you regarding the home health care, do you have an idea what  they\u2019re charging you per month?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, you know, it\u2019s probably around a little over two  thousand, maybe twenty-five hundred a month.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. And so here\u2019s what you have, .", "You have more money going out than coming in, as far as income.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So you have a shortfall of about fourteen  hundred dollars, thirteen fifty, a month going out for care.", "And that\u2019s a good thing, when it comes to applying for the VA benefits.", "There\u2019s other factors, I\u2019m just giving you kind of an overview.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And it could be, you know, dad may qualify for  up to the full nineteen fifty a month.", "I don\u2019t care if twenty-five hundred is coming in, and twenty-five hundred is going  out the door, the software, with all of the bells and whistles of what we have to plug into it,  it may kick out that dad needs nineteen fifteen a month.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay, but here\u2019s the problem.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: He may have a shortfall of fourteen hundred.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, but here\u2019s my concern though, is that he\u2019s got \u2014  he owns his own house, and then he\u2019s got like a mutual fund and he\u2019s got some savings.", "And of course, that\u2019s not going to last very long with this negative, you know,  income that he\u2019s got going on.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Correct.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: But how is he going to qualify for anything with those  assets?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, the VA has different scenarios.", "For example, the VA will allow us to do estate planning to reposition the assets  so he can qualify.", "The VA may be able to allow him to keep a certain amount.", "How much money are we talking about in savings or stocks or bonds or mutual  funds total?", "Just off the top of your head. You don\u2019t have to be exact.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s got maybe ninety thousand in savings  and about two hundred \u2014 about a quarter of a million, probably, in mutual funds.", "A little over two fifty, two sixty maybe.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: All right. So if he\u2019s not opposed, there\u2019s like  several scenarios.", "So let\u2019s just talk about money. Those with assets of which we would call your  dad.", "Is he opposed to repositioning the assets to where \u2014 are you the power-of- attorney, ?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Like I say, he\u2019s got his mental facilities, so I\u2019m not.", "I mean, I could be, but I mean, at this point, he\u2019s still able to function for himself.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, your issues here are you have about a  quarter of a million dollars plus cash.", "The government is going to want him to use his money first, if we don\u2019t do estate  planning, which we\u2019re allowed to do, according to the VA parameters.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay, so what does that mean? Where \u2014 what would  you do?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What that means is basically is repositioning  the assets to where \u2013 it may \u2013 and I don\u2019t \u2014 again, the software tells us what we can and  can\u2019t do.", "But I\u2019m just going to give you a \u2014 kind of a hypothetical.", "Uh \u2014 For example, you may be able to reposition, reallocate those funds into a  trust that , Jr. \u2014 if you\u2019re a Jr. \u2013 I\u2019ll just \u2013 , you \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: .", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 would be the trustee of.", "And we\u2019re allowed to apply for VA benefits the day after, by reallocating those  funds, so that dad can qualify.", "And he may get nineteen fifty a month, tax-free, plus retroactive, for the 8 months  waiting.", "So he may get a full check of about almost twenty something thousand dollars,  and the funds thereafter come each month to you tax-free.", "Does he want that? I don\u2019t know.", "Those are some of the scenarios that the software will kick out, and let us know  what we can and can\u2019t do.", "But the bottom line is, if you went to the VA directly and told them \u2014 because  you would have to be forthright, and tell them that you had this money \u2014 they would reject  you immediately, until you spend down to your last fifteen hundred dollars.", "Or there are options that you could do.", "And that\u2019s where an accredited VA claims agent comes in, myself, because we  work with attorneys that do estate planning that are able to do these type of things.", "So those are the questions you want to talk to your dad about, even though he  may have his faculties, and he may be able to make decisions.", "Is he willing to pull the trigger and let you make the decisions? Because that\u2019s  what he may have to do.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Well, I\u2019m just \u2013  COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I\u2019m just giving you one of the scenarios.", "But our niche is that we deal with people with assets, if they are willing to let the  power-of-attorney make those decisions, then we can apply for VA benefits without a  hiccup.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay, all right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So those are the questions that I probably  would talk to my dad about.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: He\u2019s pretty reasonable.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Because quite frankly, there is a gap.", "And dad, who knows, can get worse, and then you may have to put him into a  nursing \u2014 an assisted-living facility, which is twice what you\u2019re paying now.", "Estate, or do you want to spend it down?", "And those are the questions \u2014 those are hard questions to ask.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: The economy.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, and we\u2019re putting out more than, you know, he\u2019s  only got a little bit coming in with the social security. That\u2019s not covering it.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No, that\u2019s right. And what these types of estate  planning devices, that\u2019s allowed, according to the VA, it\u2019s real simple.", "I mean, they make it very clear that the \u2014 by the way, are you the power-of- attorney?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I don\u2019t have a power-of-attorney, but I can probably get  one.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I would do that yesterday. I would \u2014 forget  whether we met each other or not. You need to get that done.", "What I would suggest \u2014 can I make a suggestion?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Go to Office Depot \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yes.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 get a general power-of-attorney in place.", "Have a notary notarize it, which will make it legally binding that day of notary.", "And now you have a power-of-attorney in place, so that if anything happens to  dad, God forbid, he has a stroke and he becomes mentally incapacitated, you\u2019ve already  got something in writing where you can make decisions for him, and you don\u2019t have to go  through the court system.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: That makes sense.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So I would do that immediately. And I would tell  dad. He wouldn\u2019t be opposed to that, would he?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That\u2019s doesn\u2019t change. I mean, he still makes  his own decisions, even with the power-of-attorney in place.", "The power-of-attorney is only in case he does become incapacitated.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. You are basically doing preventive  medicine. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re suggesting here.", "If the software kicks out \u2014 and I don\u2019t know until I get a fact-finder filled out by  you in detail, and it\u2019s an 8-page fact-finder, it takes me about 7 hours with the attorney to  go through all this.", "And we don\u2019t charge to fill out the VA forms.", "We do not charge to represent dad for the VA benefits, but we do charge a flat  rate to do the seven hours, eight hours of due diligence to figure out what is going to be  the right avenue, because they are only going to have one scenario that\u2019s going to fit  dad\u2019s situation, once we get that fact-finder in.", "Because once we get that fact-finder in, the software tells us exactly what we can  and can\u2019t do.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: All right. And how much is that? What\u2019s the cost of that?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Fifteen hundred dollars.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Fifteen hundred, okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: But it\u2019s not a matter of if dad qualifies, it\u2019s a  matter of how much.", "I will tell you, because he\u2019s a living vet, our experience from the software, the  software will kick back between sixteen to nineteen hundred dollars that he would qualify  for, because he\u2019s a living vet,. whereas if it was mom, and dad was dead, the surviving  spouse always gets less.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Now if dad qualifies for the nineteen fifty \u2014 let\u2019s  just use that as an example \u2014 times, ah, he\u2019ll get a check on the ninth month, if we apply  for it yesterday, and got everything in place, he would get a check from the government for  seventeen thousand five hundred fifty dollars, tax-free.", "And then, each month thereafter, he would get nineteen fifty coming in, each  month, tax-free.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Whoa.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That\u2019s how that works. I\u2019m here to tell you, that  for fifteen hundred dollars, you\u2019ll get your money back on the first month that you apply,  basically.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, yeah.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: But once we do what we need to do, and if he\u2019s  not objected \u2014 objecting to the reallocating and repositioning of those funds, because  quite frankly, at 86, I know he has two hundred and fifty thousand in mutual funds, but you  know, that\u2019s a concern to me right there, because of the loss and what\u2019s going on in the  economy.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So is he willing to pull the trigger and get it out  of harm\u2019s way, so that he would get between 4 to 6 percent, and not \u2014 and not at any  risk?", "Because if we do reposition the funds, it\u2019s very likely that it has to be an account  that cannot go backwards.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: All right. So what type of thing are you talking about?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It could be CDs, it could be annuities, but the  point is, it has to be an account that\u2019s protected, that can\u2019t go backwards.", "There\u2019s not an attorney, that I know that\u2019s accredited, that would will take any  case that\u2019s going to be tied into stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, because they can lose  their base, they can lose their principal, they can lose their gains.", "And the attorney signs off on that stuff, when he represents the VA.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. And if he\u2019s putting it into something, and he\u2019s  getting 4 to 6 percent, does that money go to him or where does that go?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: If it stays into the account, it goes to him.", "How it works, basically, , it\u2019s that the power-of-attorney is the decision  maker with dad.", "You become the trustee.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: You are the pivot, you are the person we go to.", "Because everything has to be reallocated out of dad\u2019s name, titled to the trust, so  that  controls it,  cuts the checks.", "Dad\u2019s allowed to keep money in his account, that\u2019s not a question. It\u2019s a question  of how much is he allowed to keep in his account.", "That depends on the software coming back and telling us what he\u2019s allowed to  keep, what he\u2019s not allowed to keep.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Do you follow?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: If I use any of that money for him or for me, I have to  count that as income?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great question. Let\u2019s talk about for him first.", "If you use the money for him \u2014 first of all, the Trust will Dad has what? \u2014 am I  correct by saying he has over two fifty, combined, like three forty?", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Yeah. Well, like I say, he\u2019s got about ninety in savings  and another two \u2014 maybe about two sixty in a mutual fund.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So three fifty he has total.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay, yeah.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So what would happen, in this Trust account,  visualize it as there\u2019s a checkbook access.", "In the checkbook access, you\u2019re able \u2014 you\u2019re going to have up to three fifty,  what\u2019s going to be liquid is going to be roughly about close to a hundred and fifty thousand  dollars, or a hundred thousand minimum.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So that\u2019s for incidentals, for dad\u2019s needs, for  whatever. It doesn\u2019t make a difference.", "I don\u2019t have to know what it\u2019s for.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. But if I use that, does somebody, either I or him,  have to count that as income?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, if he cashes in his \u2013 are these IRAs? Do  you know?", "IRAs, non-401(k)s, non-retirement plans \u2013  GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: \u2014 then, no, you could use them into the  account \u2014, and they could be taxable\u2014 for whatever, it\u2019s not countable as income.", "But if they are IRAs, then you would have to cash in the IRAs and then it would  become income.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: But the other account, when it\u2019s put into the put  and keep account \u2014 let\u2019s say you have three hundred and fifty thousand.", "A hundred to a hundred fifty goes into the checkbook access.", "The other two hundred or whatever goes into a put and keep account earning  four to six percent.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Is that like an annuity or something?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That doesn\u2019t earn any interest. That\u2019s  accessible dollars, liquid dollars, when you need it for emergency.", "The other account will earn 4 to 6 percent.", "So it depends on what you want to put into that other account, and how much  you want to keep liquid.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. Well, the account that\u2019s earning 4 to 6 percent,  what is that in? Is that an annuity or what is that?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It would be an annuity that has accessibility to  it, but it\u2019s tax-free, it\u2019s not being \u2014 it\u2019s not being taxed.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. All right. But I wouldn\u2019t have access to that  money?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: You will have access to that money. Each year  you have access to it, up to 10 percent free withdrawal, with no penalty.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And if \u2014 but that\u2019s why we want to keep some  of that money out in the Trust account checkbook, that is basically accessible, totally  liquid.", "So the software will kick out what we can and can\u2019t do.", "I\u2019m projecting that probably a hundred and fifty of it, up to a hundred and fifty,  could be liquid.", "Now you may not need a hundred and fifty liquid. So the more you put into the  annuity, the more interest you\u2019re going to earn on those funds.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That\u2019s a decision you have to make with dad.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: But from my experience on the software, I\u2019ve  seen between, - a hundred and fifty or a hundred thousand go into the annuity \u2014 checking  account, and the rest goes into the annuity.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh.", "Well, hopefully, you\u2019re talking this VA thing.", "Is that really \u2014 the nineteen or whatever that he would qualify for, is that a  pension or what is that?", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s going to be  considered what is called Aid and Attendance.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It\u2019s aiding him with him attendance for his care,  and that is the home health care.", "Remember, I mentioned that there\u2019s three things that have to be in place in order  for us even to apply for the VA benefits called Aid and Attendance.", "And that he is already getting aid, you know, from a home health care, or  assisted-living or in a nursing home.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Uh-huh. All right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And so we\u2019re applying for specifically that.", "That\u2019s all I deal with.", "I don\u2019t deal with any of the other benefits that the VA has.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. All right, all right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: But you do have some obstacles. You have  some issues that you need to discuss with dad.", "If you\u2019re interested, I believe that it\u2019s a fit.", "It\u2019s not a matter of if he qualifies, it\u2019s a matter of how much. But the computer will  tell us what we can and can\u2019t do.", "And then, if you like, I can e-mail you the fact-finder and the information. There\u2019s  two forms I would send to you that you would send back to me, signed, with a check, and  the address is on the fact-finder.", "If you like, I can e-mail it to you, if you have an e-mail address.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: I\u2019ll tell you what, I want to talk to him about it first.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, great. Just keep us in mind. You have  our number; give us a call.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Okay. I\u2019m trying to think if I have any other questions for  you. I was just trying to write down a couple things here.", "All right, I mean, I guess that\u2019s it.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: The problem that you have right now is that you  have assets.", "We have to definitely \u2014 I know, from experience, that if you have assets, there  may be a strong possibility of repositioning some of those assets.", "And there\u2019s a way to reposition some to the trust and there\u2019s a way to reposition  some to dad, and there\u2019s a way to reposition to .", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: Right, right.", "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That all comes from the software, once it kicks  it out.", "GAO INVESTIGATOR: All right.
