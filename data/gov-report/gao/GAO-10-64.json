As of July 2009, FEMA had received about 25,000 and 22,000 applications for its fiscal years 2007 and 2008 fire grant programs, respectively, and had awarded more than 5,000 grants in both years. GAO was congressionally directed to review the application and award process for these grants. This report addresses the (1) extent to which FEMA has met statutory and program requirements for distributing the grant funds; (2) actions FEMA has taken to provide assistance to grant applicants and involve the fire service community in the grant process; and (3) extent to which FEMA has ensured that its grant process is accessible, clear, and consistent with requirements, including its grant guidance. GAO analyzed relevant laws and interviewed 36 randomly selected grant applicants to obtain their views, but the results are not generalizable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FEMA met seven of eight statutory requirements and two of three FEMA established program requirements for distributing fiscal years 2007 and 2008 grant funds. (GAO used fiscal year 2007 data for two requirements because not all fiscal year 2008 funds had been awarded by July 2009.) For example, FEMA met the statutory requirement that volunteer and combination fire departments (which have both paid and volunteer firefighters) collectively receive at least a minimum of 55 percent of fiscal year 2008 grant funds, and also met the program requirement that volunteer departments receive at least 22 percent. GAO was unable to determine whether FEMA met the statutory requirement that at least 3.5 percent of fiscal year 2008 grant funds be awarded for EMS. FEMA reported that its system is not designed to separately track grants awarded to fire departments for EMS purposes and, therefore, it could not determine if it met this requirement. FEMA reported that while it conducted research to determine that it met this requirement for 1 year, doing so was laborious. Establishing procedures to track awards for EMS purposes would allow FEMA to readily determine if it met statutory requirements. FEMA assists grant applicants by sponsoring workshops and involves representatives of the fire service community in establishing criteria and reviewing applications. Each year, FEMA convenes leaders of nine major fire service organizations to conduct a criteria development meeting to develop the program's criteria and funding priorities. FEMA's peer review process--in which members of the fire service organizations assess grant applications--also helps ensure that the fire service community is involved in the grant process. FEMA officials stated that they strive to provide an even chance for as many fire departments and other organizations as possible to serve on peer review panels. They also stated that they are considering conducting outreach efforts to expand peer review participation, such as announcing opportunities to serve on an upcoming peer review panel at workshops. FEMA has taken actions to ensure that its fire grants award process is accessible and clear to grant applicants--28 of 36 applicants GAO interviewed found the guidance to be clear--but GAO also identified inconsistencies between the stated grant application priorities and the application questions and scoring values. For example, the fiscal year 2008 guidance for the grant that funds the recruitment and retention of firefighters states that continuity--maintaining recruitment and retention efforts beyond the life of the grant--was a priority for grant awards. However, no grant application question addressed this priority and the scoring values did not include it. Thus, it is difficult for FEMA to ensure that grant funds are awarded in accordance with the agency's funding priorities. Further, four of the nine major fire service organizations voiced concerns about feedback FEMA provided to rejected applicants, and 22 of the 36 applicants stated that the feedback was helpful to little or no extent. FEMA officials stated that they could strengthen efforts to improve feedback. Providing specific feedback to rejected applicants could help FEMA strengthen future grant application processes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent decades, the U.S. fire service community has experienced  changes in the responsibilities of firefighters and in local budget  allocations for fire departments. While firefighting has traditionally been  the responsibility of states and local communities, the Congressional  Research Service and others have reported that an increase in emergency  medical services (EMS) provided by firefighters combined with state and  local budget shortfalls in the 1990s led the fire service community to  request financial assistance from the federal government in areas such as  equipment, training, and hiring and recruiting and retaining firefighters.  Consequently, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program is in its  ninth year, with appropriations totaling over $4.8 billion since 2001.  According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), in 2007 an  estimated 1.1 million firefighters from more than 30,000 fire departments  protected communities in the United States; of these firefighters, 72  percent were volunteers. In 2006, an NFPA assessment of the United  States fire service stated that it is likely that in communities with a  population of less than 2,500, 21 percent of fire departments would most  often fail to deliver the national standard of at least four firefighters to  respond to fire calls. In addition, the assessment recorded that an  estimated 60 percent of fire departments did not have enough self- contained breathing apparatuses to equip all firefighters on a shift, and 49  percent of all fire engines were at least 15 years old, which is indicative of  a potential need for replacements. Fire departments are also increasingly  responsible for responding to calls unrelated to fire, such as medical  emergencies. NFPA found that medical aid responses tripled from 1980 to  2007, with 6 percent of calls to fire departments in 2007 due to actual fires.", "Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Grant Programs Directorate\u2019s  (GPD) AFG Program Office, in consultation with the U.S. Fire  Administration (USFA), administers the AFG program and two other  competitive fire grant programs designed to provide assistance to  firefighters\u2014the Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) grant program and the  Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant  program. The purpose of the AFG program is to promote the health and  safety of the public and firefighting personnel against fire and fire-related  hazards. Funding is available for a variety of activities, such as certifying  fire inspectors, acquiring firefighting or personal protective equipment,  modifying firefighter facilities, acquiring firefighting vehicles, and funding  EMS. The FP&S program, which is funded through the appropriation for  the AFG program, is intended to support both fire prevention and safety  activities and firefighter safety research and development (R&D) activities.  The purpose of the SAFER program, which includes grants for hiring  career firefighters and recruiting and retaining volunteer firefighters, is to  increase the number of firefighters to help communities meet industry  minimum standards and attain 24-hour staffing.", "This report responds to the accompanying explanatory statement to the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, which mandates that we review  the application and award process for AFG and SAFER grants. Although  FEMA implements the AFG and FP&S grant programs separately, the two  programs are authorized by the same legislation. Consequently, we also  examined the FP&S grant program in this report. We did not assess the  results achieved by those applicants receiving grants, as this was beyond  the scope of our review. Accordingly, this report addresses the following  questions:  (1) To what extent has FEMA met statutory and program requirements for  distributing the grant funds to a variety of applicants and activities?  (2) What actions has FEMA taken to provide assistance to grant applicants  and involve the fire service community in the grant process?  (3) To what extent has FEMA taken actions to help ensure the fire grant  process and related guidance are accessible, clear, and consistent with  applicable statutory and program requirements?", "To address the first question, we identified relevant statutory requirements  from sections 33 and 34 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of  1974 (called the Fire Act and the SAFER Act, respectively, for purposes of  this report). We also identified relevant program requirements established  in FEMA\u2019s grant guidance for the AFG, SAFER, and FP&S grant programs,  which related to distributing grant funds among different categories of  activities and applicants. We then compared these statutory and program  requirements to FEMA grant award data that stratified awards based on  the type of fire department\u2014volunteer, career, or combination\u2014and  based on the type of activity, such as awards for vehicle acquisitions. We  reviewed FEMA data from fiscal year 2002, which was when FEMA began  maintaining electronic fire grant award data. At the time of our review,  FEMA\u2019s fire grant award data were current as of July 2009, at which time  the agency was in the process of awarding fiscal year 2007 FP&S grants  and fiscal year 2008 AFG and SAFER grants. These years were the latest  for which grants had been awarded at the time of our review and for  which we were able to determine FEMA\u2019s compliance with statutory and  program funding distribution requirements. We analyzed FEMA\u2019s annual  listings of applications and awards for the AFG and FP&S grant programs  from fiscal years 2002 through 2008 and SAFER grant program from fiscal  years 2005 through 2008 to provide descriptive information on a number  of other characteristics, such as the type of community served by the  applicant\u2014urban, suburban, or rural. We also determined the number of  times that departments have applied for and been awarded grants. To  assess the reliability of data provided by FEMA, we reviewed and  discussed the sources of data with agency officials. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To address the second question, we collected and reviewed pertinent  FEMA documents, such as program guidance, as well as observed FEMA\u2019s  fiscal year 2010 criteria development panel process and the fiscal year  2008 FP&S peer review panel process. We analyzed the procedures that  FEMA uses to inform applicants about the fire grant programs, including  the various forms of outreach and the types of assistance that FEMA  provides to applicants. We obtained and reviewed information pertaining  to the selection procedures for peer reviewers, who are to independently  evaluate applications according to established criteria, and analyzed the  training that they receive. We conducted structured interviews with a  nonprobability sample of 36 randomly selected grant applicants that  applied for fiscal year 2008 funding from the AFG and SAFER grant  programs or fiscal year 2007 funding from the FP&S grant program.  Although the results of the interviews are not generalizable, they provided  insights on the perspective of grant applicants. We also conducted  interviews with officials of FEMA, USFA, and nine fire service  organizations.", "To address the third question, we reviewed FEMA\u2019s methods of making its  grant guidance and the application accessible to potential applicants. We  also identified statutory requirements pertaining to fire grant applications  and analyzed FEMA\u2019s fiscal year 2008 grant guidance and application  forms to determine whether they consistently instructed applicants to  submit statutorily required information. In addition, we compared the  grant guidance to the application questions and scoring matrix to  determine the extent to which they were consistent. To determine whether  FEMA\u2019s process for issuing grant guidance had adequate controls, we  obtained and analyzed information regarding approval and issuance of  fiscal years 2007 and 2008 program and application guidance. We  compared the agency\u2019s process for documenting and monitoring the  program guidance approval process with criteria in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. We conducted interviews with  officials from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DHS, and  FEMA to obtain information about the approval and issuance of the  program and application guidance as well as how grant decisions are  announced. We analyzed the type of feedback provided to unsuccessful  grant applicants and determined the circumstances under which they may  appeal FEMA\u2019s grant decisions. During our structured interviews with a  nonprobability sample of 36 randomly selected fire grant applicants, we  obtained their views regarding feedback that FEMA provided. To assess  the reliability of data provided by DHS and FEMA on the fire grant  applicants, review criteria, and award procedures, we reviewed and  discussed the sources of data with agency officials.

The Fire Act  requires FEMA to convene an annual meeting of individuals who are  members of national fire service organizations for the purpose of  recommending criteria for awarding grants for the next fiscal year. The  act also requires FEMA, in consultation with national fire service  organizations, to appoint fire service personnel to conduct a peer review  of the grant applications, the results of which FEMA is to consider in  awarding the grants. The Fire Act also contains specific grant application  requirements. In particular, AFG and FP&S grant applicants are statutorily  required to provide information demonstrating financial need; an analysis  of costs and benefits resulting from the assistance; a list of other sources  of federal funding received by the applicant to avoid duplicative funding;  and an agreement by the applicant to provide information during the grant  period to the National Fire Incident Reporting System, which represents  the world\u2019s largest national, annual database of fire incident information.

There are two types of SAFER grants: hiring grants, which are  open to career, volunteer, and combination fire departments, and  recruitment and retention grants, which are open to volunteer and  combination fire departments, or to state or local organizations that  represent the interests of volunteer firefighters. Hiring grants are subject  to specific cost-sharing requirements between the federal government and  the grantee, with the federal share decreasing over the 4-year grant  period. Furthermore, the grantee is required to commit to retaining any  firefighter hired through grant funds for at least 1 year after federal  funding ends, amounting to a 5-year service commitment. The statutory  cost-share and service commitment requirements applicable to SAFER  hiring grants do not apply to SAFER recruitment and retention grants.", "SAFER grants, like AFG and FP&S grants, are awarded on a competitive  basis through a peer review process. The SAFER Act is also similar to the  Fire Act in requiring grant applications to include certain types of  information. In addition to any information FEMA may require applicants  to submit, the statute requires applicants to provide assurances regarding  diversity in hiring; to explain their inability to address the need without  federal assistance; and to specify long-term retention plans after federal  funding ends, including, for hiring grants, how the applicant plans to meet  the statute\u2019s 5-year service commitment. A hiring grant applicant is also  required to discuss what it will do to ensure that its department does not  discriminate against firefighters who engage in volunteer activities in  another jurisdiction during off-duty hours. The SAFER Act has a  statutory sunset of 10 years from the date of enactment, such that the  agency\u2019s authority to make SAFER grants will elapse on November 24,  2013.

When panelists arrive at orientation, they are required to sign  and submit a statement declaring that they have no known or apparent  conflicts of interest as well as a nondisclosure form agreeing to keep the  results of the review confidential. The panelists are then divided into  groups of four at different tables. FEMA instructs the panelists not to  review applications if they know the applicant or if the applicant is from  their state. In the event that a potential conflict of interest arises, FEMA  replaces the entire batch of applications provided to the table of panelists  with a new batch. FEMA also instructs the panelists not to share applicant  information with any panelists other than those seated at their table.

Once the orientation is completed, the panelists individually read  and score the narrative section of the applications as well as responses to  other parts of the application, based on the applicable evaluation criteria.  For example, for fiscal year 2008 AFG applications, panelists provided  numerical scores on the basis of four evaluation factors stated in their  score sheets, which were (1) project description, (2) cost/benefit of the  proposed project, (3) financial need, and (4) effect of the proposed project  on daily operations.", "After each panelist at the table scores an application, the panelists discuss  any differences of opinion and the merits or limitations of the application.  Orientation facilitators inform panelists that the aim of the table  discussion is not to arrive at a consensus, but rather to discuss each  application as it pertains to each of the evaluation elements. If panelists  are unable to reconcile any large scoring disparity (defined as 10 points or  greater), they bring the dispute to the attention of a panel chair member  who is responsible for ensuring that panelists document their discussion  and indicate the scoring disparity on their scoring sheets. Panelists may  amend their individual scores or choose to keep them unchanged on their  evaluation sheets. FEMA files all of the panelists\u2019 evaluation sheets for  each application, including the panelists\u2019 comments and recommendations  to reduce the funding amount, reject, or award, with the applications.

FEMA also sends letters to subgroups within the  organizations that represent minorities to receive nominations to help  diversify the panel. According to a program specialist responsible for  administering the AFG and SAFER grant programs, while FEMA does not  verify whether the organizations\u2019 nominees are qualified to attend the  panel, it asks for the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of self-nominees or of those nominated by  members of Congress. The official explained that in selecting the peer  review panelists, FEMA considers availability to attend, racial diversity,  and the ratio of new-to-repeat panelists. In fiscal year 2008, 285 people  served on the AFG panel, 47 served on the SAFER panel, and 160 served  on the FP&S panel. The official stated that FEMA considers panelists new  if they have not participated in that particular grant program panel review,  regardless of prior experience as a peer reviewer for another grant  program. Although FEMA selects both new and returning panelists to  review applications in any or all three grant categories, it tries to limit  returning panelists to no more than one-third of the total panel  composition.

Rather, FEMA  relies on the nine major fire service organizations for nominations of new  panelists. AFG Program Office officials stated that while they strive to  provide an even chance to as many fire departments and other  organizations as possible to serve on peer review panels, representatives  of departments that are invited sometimes fail to appear to serve on the  panel without informing FEMA. Therefore, officials have invited some  departments multiple times because they have proven to be reliable and  good reviewers. They acknowledged that although FEMA does not  currently limit the number of times that a department can send  representatives to serve on the panels, establishing such a limit could  expand opportunities for other departments to participate in the peer  review process. In addition, they also stated that they are considering  conducting outreach efforts to expand peer review participation, such as  announcing opportunities to serve on an upcoming peer review panel at  workshops.

The statute requires each applicant to (1) provide  assurances regarding diversity in hiring, (2) explain its inability to address  the need without federal assistance, and (3) specify long-term retention  plans after federal funding ends. With respect to the latter requirement,  SAFER hiring grant applicants are to specifically discuss how they plan to  meet the statute\u2019s 5-year service commitment (i.e., 1-year of service for  SAFER-funded firefighters after the 4-year funding period ends).

Based upon these statutes, we identified a total of eight statutory  requirements that established specific percentages or dollar amounts  designating how FEMA was to distribute funds among different grant  applicants and activities. We also identified three relevant program  requirements established in FEMA\u2019s grant guidance for the AFG, SAFER  and Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) grant programs, which related to  distributing grant funds among different categories of activities and  applicants. We then compared these statutory and program requirements  to FEMA grant award data that stratified awards based on the type of fire  department: volunteer, career, or combination\u2014and based on the type of  activity, such as awards for vehicle acquisitions. FEMA began maintaining  electronic fire grant award data in fiscal year 2002.

We analyzed  the information regarding FEMA\u2019s procedures for selecting peer  reviewers; the training that panelists receive before reviewing  applications; and the measures FEMA takes to ensure that peer review  panelists maintain independence, safeguard against any conflict of  interest, and adhere to restrictions related to confidentiality. We analyzed  peer review guidance and other AFG Program Office documents, such as  the criteria development reports and panel application evaluation sheets,  to determine the process through which peer reviewers score grant  applications. We collected and analyzed information pertaining to the  technical review process and observed the fiscal year 2008 FP&S subject  matter specialists\u2019 portion of the technical review to determine how FEMA  incorporates scores from the technical reviewers and makes final award  decisions.", "To evaluate the extent to which FEMA has taken actions to help ensure  that the fire grant process and related guidance are accessible, clear, and  consistent with applicable statutory and program requirements, we  reviewed FEMA\u2019s methods of publishing grant guidance online and the  online applications. We also identified statutory requirements pertaining to  information applicants are required to submit in their fire grant  applications and analyzed FEMA\u2019s fiscal year 2008 grant guidance and  application forms to determine whether they consistently instructed  applicants to submit the statutorily required information. We obtained and  analyzed FEMA AFG Program Office documents, such as the scoring  matrix and documents describing the prescreening process. We analyzed  and compared the fire grant programs\u2019 funding priorities contained in  fiscal year 2008 AFG and SAFER grant guidance and 2007 FP&S grant  guidance with the application questions and the scoring matrix to  determine the extent to which they were consistent based on criteria from  the National Procurement Fraud Task Force. Through  our analysis of grant program documents for fiscal years 2007 and 2008  and our interviews with officials from the Office of Management and  Budget, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and FEMA, we  obtained obtain information about the approval and issuance of the  program and application guidance as well as how grant decisions are  announced. We analyzed the procedures that FEMA uses to announce  grant decisions and the type of feedback it provides to unsuccessful  applicants and determined the circumstances under which applicants may  appeal FEMA\u2019s grant decisions. We compared the views of a  nonprobability sample of 36 randomly selected fire grant applicants  regarding feedback to unsuccessful candidates, and reviewed the National  Academy of Public Administration 2007 assessment of the AFG program.", "From June 22 through June 29, 2009, we conducted structured interviews  by phone with fire chiefs and other officials knowledgeable about the fire  grants program from a nonprobability sample of 36 randomly selected fire  grant applicants that did or did not receive fiscal year 2008 funding for the  AFG and SAFER grants and fiscal year 2007 funding for the FP&S grants.  We obtained their perspectives on the application and award process. The  sample included fire grant applicants across the continental United States  and Alaska. We obtained a list of the universe of applicants from FEMA for  the respective fiscal years, from which we randomly selected fire  departments within seven grant categories: (1) awarded AFG applicant,   (2) turned down AFG applicant following the peer review panel process,  (3) turned down AFG applicant following the initial electronic screening  process, (4) awarded FP&S applicant, (5) turned down FP&S applicant  following the peer review panel process, (6) awarded SAFER applicant,  and (7) turned down SAFER applicant following the peer review panel  process. We conducted two pretest interviews in person with  representatives of fire departments in South Carolina and Pennsylvania to  further refine our questions. An independent GAO methodologist reviewed  our questionnaire to identify and revise potentially biased questions.  Although we are not able to generalize the results of the nonprobability  sample to the general population of applicants, the questionnaire allowed  for a series of open-ended and close-ended responses on the grant  application and award process, including questions on the perceived  fairness and objectivity of the grant programs. Because of the scope of our  work, we reviewed the fire grant programs\u2019 application and award  process, but did not assess the extent to which FEMA measures its  performance in implementing these fire grant programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2009 through October  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. To assess the  reliability of data provided by DHS and FEMA on the fire grant applicants,  review criteria, and award procedures, we reviewed and discussed the  sources of data with agency officials.

For example, for the AFG and SAFER grant programs, the AFG Program  Office creates a scoring formula (following the criteria development  panel\u2019s scoring matrix), which is then entered into a computerized system  by FEMA\u2019s Information Technology Office. Through this formula, each  application is scored and ranked electronically. For the AFG program, if  an application for a project has a high-dollar item or activity that was  ranked as a low priority, that item or activity may have adversely affected  the scoring and thus may have taken the application out of the competitive  range for peer review. FEMA officials stated that because more than  21,000 AFG applications are submitted every year and the AFG Program  Office does not have the resources to review all of the applications, the  number of applications it submits for peer review is the number of  applications with the highest scores whose cumulative funding requests  total 200 percent of the appropriated funding. In other words, AFG grants  that go to peer review can total no more than twice the dollar value of the  available grant amount.", "SAFER applications also undergo an automated scoring and ranking  process; however, FEMA submits all of them for peer review (1,314  applications for fiscal year 2008). Applications that best address the  funding priorities score higher than applications that do not.

Because of the smaller size of the  FP&S program and the more technical and academic nature of some FP&S  requests, the AFG Program Office manually screens for eligibility all  applications submitted for the two FP&S activities, which are fire  prevention and safety grants and R&D grants. Both the applicants and the  projects are screened for eligibility based on statutory and programmatic  eligibility criteria, and those found ineligible are removed from further  consideration before the peer review process. For example, for-profit  applicants and projects requesting fire suppression equipment or fire  vehicles are considered ineligible. According to an AFG Program Office  section chief, out of 2,637 FP&S applications submitted for fiscal year 2008  funding, 170 applications were considered ineligible before the peer  review panel process and another 16 applications were found ineligible  during the peer review and therefore were not scored."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peer Review Process", "paragraphs": ["Peer review panel participants are fire service professionals who are  members of one or more of the nine major fire service organizations.
