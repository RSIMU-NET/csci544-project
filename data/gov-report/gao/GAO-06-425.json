In 2000, FCC recorded about 2,200 junk fax complaints; in 2005, it recorded over 46,000. Using its procedures to review the complaints, FCC's Enforcement Bureau (EB) issued 261 citations (i.e., warnings) from 2000 through 2005. EB has ordered six companies to pay forfeitures for continuing to violate the junk fax rules after receiving a citation. The six forfeitures totaled over $6.9 million, none of which has been collected by the Department of Justice for various reasons. EB officials cited competing demands, resource constraints, and the rising sophistication of junk faxers in hiding their identities as hindrances to enforcement. An emphasis on customer service, an effort to document consumers' complaints, and an attempt to target enforcement resources efficiently are the strengths of FCC's procedures; however, inefficient data management, resulting in time-consuming manual data entry, data errors, and--most important--the exclusion of the majority of complaints from decisions about investigations and enforcement, are weaknesses. FCC's guidance to consumers does not provide them with all of the information they need to support FCC's enforcement efforts. FCC faces management challenges in carrying out its junk fax responsibilities. The commission has no clearly articulated long-term or annual goals for junk fax monitoring and enforcement, and it is not analyzing the junk fax data. Without analysis, FCC cannot explore the need for, or implement, changes to its rules, procedures, or consumer guidance that might help deter junk fax violations or give consumers a better understanding of the junk fax rules. Most important, without performance goals and measures and without analysis of complaint and enforcement data, it is not possible to explore the effectiveness of current enforcement measures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For more than a decade, it has generally been illegal to send unsolicited  facsimile (fax) advertisements, commonly known as \u201cjunk faxes,\u201d to  consumers and businesses. This type of advertising burdens consumers  and businesses because they incur costs associated with receiving the fax  (paper and toner) as well as cause disruptions to their fax operations. The  Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) prohibited a variety  of telemarketing practices, including the faxing of advertisements without  the recipient\u2019s prior express permission. In 1992, the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) established rules for receiving junk  fax complaints and taking enforcement actions. In July 2005, Congress  enacted the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 (2005 Act), which amended  certain provisions of TCPA. Specifically, the 2005 Act clarified an  \u201cestablished business relationship\u201d exception, required specific opt-out  procedures for consumers and businesses, and required FCC to report  annually to Congress on junk fax complaints and enforcement actions. FCC  is to adopt new rules implementing these changes by April 5, 2006.", "The 2005 Act required GAO to report to Congress on FCC\u2019s enforcement of  the junk fax laws. Accordingly, we answered the following questions in this  report: (1) What procedures has FCC established for taking action on junk  fax complaints\u2014including procedures for receipt, acknowledgment,  investigation, and enforcement\u2014and to what extent has it taken such  action? (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of FCC\u2019s junk fax  procedures? and (3) What challenges do FCC face in carrying out its junk  fax responsibilities? In addition, we provide in appendix I of this report  information on enforcement measures and penalties that have been  established to protect consumers from other types of unsolicited  advertising.", "To assess FCC\u2019s procedures, implementation, and strengths and  weaknesses, we reviewed the applicable statutes and FCC rules pertaining  to junk fax enforcement. We interviewed FCC officials responsible for  receiving junk fax complaints and taking enforcement actions. We obtained  FCC data on junk fax complaints and enforcement actions and reviewed  portions of the complaint database and enforcement spreadsheet. Although  we discuss limitations to the complaint data in the report, we determined  that these data were sufficiently reliable for us to present overall trends  and approximate figures. To identify challenges, we compared FCC\u2019s  enforcement efforts with recognized performance management practices  and reviewed applicable FCC performance goals, measures, and data  analysis. Finally, we reviewed other statutes relevant to protecting  consumers from unsolicited advertisements. We conducted our work from  November 2005 through March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. See appendix II for a more detailed  explanation of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1991, Congress enacted TCPA to address a growing number of telephone  marketing calls and certain telemarketing practices thought to be an  invasion of consumer privacy and, in some cases, costly to consumers.  Provisions of this law generally prohibit anyone from faxing unsolicited  advertisements, or \u201cjunk faxes,\u201d to consumers or businesses. An  unsolicited advertisement under TCPA was defined as \u201cany material  advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or  services which is transmitted to any person without that person\u2019s prior  express invitation or permission.\u201d", "In addition, there are three distinct enforcement mechanisms for violations  of the junk fax provisions. First, persons or entities that believe they have  been sent a fax in violation of the act have a private right of action\u2014that is,  they can sue the fax advertiser in an appropriate court for damages and/or  injunctive relief. Second, a state attorney general (or another official or  agency designated by the state) may bring a civil lawsuit for damages  and/or injunctive relief when a case involves a pattern or practice of  violations. Third, FCC is authorized to assess and enforce a \u201cforfeiture\u201d  against those who violate the junk fax provisions\u2014that is, a monetary penalty against the faxer for violating the junk fax rules. Appendix I  provides a brief overview of how unsolicited advertisements sent via  telephone, the Internet, and cellular telephones are regulated and enforced. \u201c\u2026a prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary two-way communication between a  person or entity and a residential subscriber with or without an exchange of consideration,  on the basis of an inquiry, application, purchase or transaction by the residential subscriber  regarding products or services offered by such person or entity, which relationship has not  been previously terminated by either party.\u201d", "In July 2003, FCC revised many of its telemarketing and fax advertising  rules under TCPA. In part, the commission reversed its prior conclusion  about an EBR, stating that its existence alone does not constitute the  express permission required by TCPA. Instead, the commission concluded  that a fax advertiser must first obtain written permission, including the  recipient\u2019s signature, before a fax can be sent. This requirement for written  permission was stayed by FCC pending reconsideration and, to date, has  not taken effect.", "Congress has now settled the question of whether prior written consent is  explicitly required with the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005. The act  (1) amends TCPA and codifies the EBR by expressly permitting businesses  or entities to fax unsolicited advertisements to those with whom they have  an EBR and (2) provides that prior permission may be in writing or  otherwise. The act does, however, impose new disclosure and opt-out  requirements on advertisers. Businesses or entities sending fax  advertisements must now include on the first page of the ad an opt-out  notice, the date and time the fax was sent, the registered name of the  company sending the fax, and the telephone number of the company  sending the fax or the sending fax machine\u2019s telephone number. The  opt-out notice should clearly state that the recipient may opt out of any  future faxes and provide clear instructions for doing so. The opt-out  telephone number must be domestic and free of charge to the recipient.", "Some businesses and individuals contract with fax broadcaster (also  known as \u201cfax blasters\u201d) companies that transmit mass fax advertisements  for others. This practice is legitimate if the fax broadcaster complies with  the junk fax rules. In some instances, however, fax broadcasters fax  unsolicited advertisements to parties that have no EBR with the advertising  company. According to Verizon officials in an FCC filing, fax broadcasters  often use automatic dialers on outbound fax servers to send large volumes  of faxes in a short time, often in the middle of the night. Furthermore, their  dialing lists may include primary residential telephone numbers as well as  fax numbers. For example, according to these officials, one fax  broadcaster transmitted 10,600 calls over Verizon\u2019s network within 10  minutes.", "Two FCC bureaus\u2014CGB and EB\u2014are primarily responsible for developing  and implementing rules and procedures to collect and analyze junk fax  complaints and for conducting investigations and enforcement, among  their other responsibilities. CGB develops and implements FCC\u2019s consumer  policies. CGB also addresses consumers\u2019 informal inquiries and works to  mediate and resolve complaints under FCC\u2019s jurisdiction. These include  complaints about the commission\u2019s regulated entities, including common  carrier, broadcast, wireless, satellite, and cable companies; complaints  about unauthorized changes in telecommunications providers (slamming); complaints about unwanted e-mail messages on wireless devices such as  mobile telephones (spamming); and six types of TCPA-related complaints,  including junk faxes, violations of the do-not-call list, and time-of-day  violations (marketing between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m).", "EB is responsible for enforcing TCPA\u2019s provisions and the commission\u2019s  rules and orders. EB handles three major areas of enforcement: local  competition, public safety and homeland security, and consumer  protection. Enforcement officials said that they follow FCC\u2019s guidance on  how to prioritize these responsibilities, and that these priorities can change  as required by circumstances. EB\u2019s Telecommunications Consumers  Division is responsible for considering junk fax complaints for  investigation and enforcement.", "EB uses several procedures to select complaints for investigation and  possible enforcement. EB\u2019s formal enforcement actions consist of several  sequential steps. First, EB issues a citation, which notifies the faxer of the  complaint(s) against it and informs the faxer that its alleged activity is  illegal. The citation also states that further such activity could make the  faxer subject to a forfeiture action. If FCC receives additional complaints  against the faxer for violations of the junk fax rules and substantiates the  complaints, EB may pursue the forfeiture action. This could lead to the  involvement of the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is responsible for  collection.

For junk fax complaints, CGB staff accept the complaints;  enter information into the database; and scan the materials submitted with  the complaints, including copies of the alleged junk faxes. CGB staff mail a  letter to the majority of complainants acknowledging FCC\u2019s receipt of their  complaint. The letter states that FCC does not resolve individual  complaints and cannot award monetary or other damages directly to the  complainant. The letter also states that the complainant has the right to  take private legal action against any junk fax violator.", "In 2000, FCC recorded about 2,200 complaints; in 2005, that number had  grown to more than 46,000. Since 2002, FCC has reported quarterly on the  number of consumer complaints received, consolidating all six types of  TCPA complaints into one category. As a result, the number of junk fax  complaints has never been separately reported. Using CGB data, we found  that within the specific category of TCPA complaints, junk faxes  represented over 85 percent of the complaints logged in 2005. In fact, when  looking at all types of reported consumer complaints, junk fax complaints  have ranked as the second most frequently reported since 2003\u2014second  only to complaints about indecency and obscenity in radio and television  broadcasting. Appendix II lists the number of complaints reported  publicly by FCC, by type, from 2003 through 2005 and details the  percentage of the TCPA complaints that are junk fax complaints.", "Both individual consumers and businesses can report junk fax complaints  to the commission by e-mail, postal mail, fax, telephone, or the Internet  (using an on-line complaint form\u2014Form 475\u2014that appears on FCC\u2019s Web  site). FCC documents both the type of complainant (individual consumer  or business) and the method of reporting (e-mail, postal mail, fax,  telephone, or the Internet). Figure 2 shows the number of junk fax  complaints that businesses and individuals reported through various  methods from 2003 through 2005. As the figures indicate, the number of  junk fax complaints reported by businesses dropped in 2005, but the  number of complaints reported by individuals increased, bringing the total  for both groups significantly higher in 2005 than in prior years. Additionally,  the number of complaints reported using the on-line complaint form has  increased, especially for individual consumers. In 2005, about half of all  junk fax complaints were reported via the Internet.", "In their junk fax complaints to FCC, individuals and businesses often  described the adverse effects of junk faxes. We looked at hundreds of  complainant comments received from September through December 2005  and found complaints that cited the costs of toner and paper, the disruption  of business activities during junk fax transmissions, and interruptions to  personal lives. For example, the complainants expressed frustration about  calls coming in the middle of the night and waking them up or causing  panic. FCC has recently addressed this issue. Some complainants noted  problems with the opt-out number\u2014that is, the telephone number that they  should be able to call to stop receiving the faxes. For example, the opt-out  number did not work, was always busy, or was connected to a prerecorded  message. According to some complainants, calling the opt-out number  seemed to increase the number of junk faxes they received. Additionally,  some complainants expressed frustration with the commission\u2019s response  to their prior complaints.", "Some complainants described junk faxes they had received as unbelievable  or potentially fraudulent. Among the frequently cited topics were hot  stocks, cheap vacations, low-interest mortgages, and low-cost health care.  We asked FCC officials whether they believed fraud was an issue with junk  faxes. They said that, although enforcement related to fraud falls outside of  FCC\u2019s jurisdiction, some of the faxes advertising stock tips could be  fraudulent and come under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC). Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff, whom we also  asked about fraud in connection with junk faxes, said they believed it was a  concern and they cited travel and mortgage offers. FTC staff also  mentioned pump-and-dump marketing schemes, which they also noted  would come under SEC\u2019s jurisdiction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau Has Generally Issued a Limited Number of Citations Each Year since 2000 and Has Rarely Issued Forfeiture Orders", "paragraphs": ["FCC\u2019s EB, established in November 1999, is responsible for investigating  and determining the appropriate enforcement action for all types of TCPA  complaints, including junk fax complaints. Currently, EB dedicates 11 staff  (9 full-time analysts and 2 part-time attorneys) to work on junk fax  enforcement. According to EB officials, the bureau\u2019s overall staffing levels  have remained relatively stable over the years. As a result, the staffing level  for junk fax enforcement has remained about the same over the past 5  years, even though the number of junk fax complaints has rapidly  increased.", "Because of the large number of complaints and limited resources, EB does  not investigate each junk fax complaint. Instead, EB officials said, they try  to identify and take enforcement action against the major alleged violators  and repeat offenders who, they believe, have had the greatest impact on  consumers. EB defines a major alleged violator as a company, carrier, or  individual that has sent a large number of junk faxes to complainants over a  given period of time; it defines a repeat offender as a company, carrier, or  individual that continues to violate the junk fax rules after receiving a  citation from the commission.", "To identify major alleged violators, the EB analysts responsible for  responding to junk fax complaints first review CGB\u2019s complaint database to  identify those complaints with an attached fax. EB officials said they use  only complaints with attached faxes because they contain the best  evidence for starting an investigation. The analysts then transfer  information from the complaint and the fax into an enforcement  spreadsheet. Periodically, the EB analysts sort the information in the  enforcement spreadsheet to align matching telephone numbers and  identify those that are repeated most often. According to enforcement  officials, the most frequently repeated telephone numbers are indicative of  the major alleged violators that are creating the most widespread problems  for consumers. In addition to using EB\u2019s spreadsheet to prioritize which  complaints receive enforcement action, EB will also initiate enforcement  action on the basis of complaints received from other sources, such as  congressional offices, FCC commissioners, or state attorneys general. In  the past year, about half of the citations issued by EB were based, at least in  part, on referrals from outside sources\u2014the majority of these outside  sources were Members of Congress.", "The next step in the investigation is for the EB analysts to identify the  major alleged violators associated with the most frequently repeated  telephone numbers. Finding their names and addresses involves contacting  carriers to learn who was paying for the telephone numbers from which the  alleged junk faxes were sent on the dates the faxes were sent. Waiting for  this information from the carriers can take several days. According to  enforcement officials, identifying and locating major alleged violators is the  most challenging aspect of junk fax enforcement. They said that obtaining  this information is becoming increasingly more challenging because  violators have become more adept at hiding their identity. As a result, the  officials said, the analysts have to spend more time on each investigation.", "Once a major alleged violator is identified, the analysts can decide whether  to begin the formal, two-step enforcement process of citation and possible  forfeiture action. EB officials said they consider the citation to be their  most efficient enforcement action because many, perhaps the majority, of  the violators are unaware that their activities are illegal and could lead to  monetary forfeitures. As a result, the officials said, most violators that  receive a citation do cease their junk fax activities. However, EB officials  could not provide data to support this assertion.", "EB officials have issued a limited number of citations over the past 6 years,  and the annual number did not change substantially, except in 2002. As  table 1 indicates, FCC issued 261 citations covering 1,456 junk fax  complaints from 2000 through 2005. EB officials cited competing demands,  personnel reductions, and the increasing skill of violators in concealing  their identity as reasons for the limited number of citations issued.", "EB officials also noted that in 2005 the average number of complaints that  each citation covered increased. They believe this demonstrates EB has  successfully targeted the major alleged violators. However, as shown in  table 1, the percentage of the total annual number of complaints resulting  in a citation has been less than 1 percent since 2003.", "To identify repeat violators, EB analysts enter citation information into  their enforcement spreadsheet, including the telephone numbers of the  citation recipients, and search the information in the spreadsheet to  identify any complaints sent after the citation date against these recipients.  If any such complaints are found, the analysts decide whether to take the  second formal enforcement step\u2014a forfeiture action\u2014which begins with  the issuance of a notice of apparent liability. This notice informs the alleged  repeat violator that its actions make it liable for forfeiture of a specific  dollar amount. The notice must  be issued within 1 year of the alleged violation(s) that forms the basis  for the notice;  identify each specific statute, rule, order, term, or condition that  allegedly has been violated;   explain how the alleged repeat offender\u2019s activities have violated the  junk fax rules and the dates of the violations; and   specify the amount of the proposed monetary forfeiture.", "According to EB officials, their enforcement efforts are hampered by the  requirement that a notice of apparent liability be issued within 1 year of an  alleged repeat violation. For example, FCC\u2019s notice of apparent liability  against Fax.Com, Inc., stated that although FCC received some consumers\u2019  correspondences and related declarations detailing additional unsolicited  advertisements received from Fax.Com, FCC was unable to include these  violations in the forfeiture action because they were beyond the 1-year  statute of limitations. This statute of limitations is problematic, they said,  because it takes time, after identifying a repeat violation, to prepare the  notice and obtain a sworn statement from the complainant verifying that  there was no EBR with the sender of the fax. FTC staff said that they have a  statute of limitations of at least 5 years to enforce various telemarketing  rules by seeking civil penalties, and they agreed with FCC that a 1-year  statute of limitations was restrictive.", "Within a reasonable period of time, usually within 30 days of receiving the  notice, the alleged repeat offender must either pay the proposed forfeiture  in full or file a written response requesting that the proposed forfeiture be  rescinded or be reduced. If the proposed forfeiture penalty is not paid in  full in response to the notice, the commission, upon considering all  relevant information available to it, will issue an order (1) canceling or  reducing the proposed forfeiture or requiring that it be paid in full and (2)  stating the date by which the forfeiture must be paid. If the recipient of the  order fails to pay the fine within 30 days from the date it is due, EB staff  will refer the case to the commission\u2019s Office of General Counsel (OGC).", "If the recipient ignores OGC\u2019s request for payment, the commission refers  the forfeiture order to DOJ for collection.", "EB officials stated that they have identified eight repeat offenders from the  261 citations issued from 2000 through 2005, and that they have pursued  forfeiture actions against all of the repeat offenders they have identified.  Six of the eight repeat offenders have received forfeiture orders, as detailed  in table 2. The amounts of the monetary forfeitures have increased, but no  forfeitures have been collected to date. For various reasons, five of the six  forfeitures will never be collected. The sixth forfeiture order accounts for  about 78 percent of the fines FCC has levied.", "Two additional enforcement actions were taken in early 2006, outside the  scope of our review. The remaining two forfeiture actions that EB began  are against Elf Painting and Wallpaper (Elf) and First Choice Healthcare,  Inc. (First Choice). FCC issued a notice of apparent liability to Elf in  December 2004 for continuing to send junk faxes after receiving a citation  in February 2003. The notice proposed a penalty of $22,500 for five specific  violations of the junk fax rules. A final forfeiture order issuing a fine of  $22,500 was released by FCC against Elf on March 10, 2006. In February  2006, FCC issued a notice of apparent liability against First Choice,  proposing a fine of $776,500 against the company for sending at least 98  unsolicited fax advertisements after receiving a citation in July 2004."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FCC\u2019s Procedures Have Emphasized Customer Service and Documentation, but Enforcement Is Hampered by Multiple Factors", "paragraphs": ["The strengths of FCC\u2019s junk fax procedures are that CGB has emphasized  both customer service and documentation of consumers\u2019 complaints;  however, these processes are resource-intensive and susceptible to error.

FCC also staffs two consumer  centers to handle consumer inquiries and provide junk fax guidance. This  guidance is located in several places, including FCC\u2019s Web page, a  consumer fact sheet, and the Internet consumer complaint form (Form  475). The letter that FCC sends in response to complaints further advises  consumers of their legal options for addressing their complaints.", "CGB consolidates and maintains information about complaints in its  database, together with any attachments. According to CGB officials, the  database has improved CGB\u2019s coding and counting of TCPA complaints.  However, entering complaint information into the database is  time-consuming. Data from complaints reported by postal mail, e-mail, fax,  and telephone must be entered manually, while data reported on FCC\u2019s  Internet complaint form (Form 475) can be electronically transferred from  the form to the database. However, CGB staff still have to review the  complaint summary from the consumer\u2019s complaint (by opening a text box  from the Form 475) to determine what type of TCPA violation is being  reported. As figure 3 shows, the form includes a text box that asks the  complainant, among other things, to describe the type of violation. CGB  staff then have to analyze the consumer\u2019s comment and manually code the  type of TCPA violation into the database.", "Besides being time-consuming, CGB\u2019s data entry processes may cause  errors in the database, despite the periodic supervisory review that CGB  officials told us takes place. For example, errors can occur in coding  complaints, matching complaints with associated attachments, and dating  complaints. These problems may, to an unknown extent, affect the  reliability of CGB\u2019s complaint counts. They also may impact the quality of  the report that FCC is now required to provide to Congress on the number  of junk fax complaints received each year. Given the large numbers of  complaints, we do believe that overall trends can be reported, but the  specific numbers may not be accurate.", "Errors in coding complaints can occur if the complainant\u2019s comments on  the Form 475 do not provide CGB staff with sufficient information to  determine what type of violation should be coded in the database, or if the  CGB staff simply miscode a comment. In a cursory review of 2005  complaint data, we found several instances in which an Internet complaint  was miscoded. For example, CGB\u2019s database incorrectly identified one  Internet complaint as a junk fax complaint, even though the complainant  was asking for assistance in having charges removed that resulted from  unsolicited advertisements sent as text messages to the complainant\u2019s  cellular telephone.", "Errors may also occur in matching complaints submitted by telephone,  e-mail, or the Internet with the associated faxes sent to FCC separately by  postal mail.

For example, the database does not contain separate  fields for the names of the businesses or individuals that may have sent the  junk faxes or for their telephone numbers. Most of this information, if  included in the complaint, has been entered into a comment field manually  by CGB staff or transferred electronically from a text box on the Form 475.  To find the most frequently reported businesses or individuals (major  alleged violators), EB staff would have to use the \u201cFind\u201d feature to search  the comment fields for one name or telephone number at a time.", "Because CGB\u2019s database does not contain the data fields that EB needs for  enforcement, EB has developed a separate spreadsheet that contains the  requisite data fields and allows the data to be searched and sorted to  support EB\u2019s enforcement activities.

For 2005, about 60 percent of the  complaints\u2014including almost all of the complaints reported via the  Internet\u2014did not have an attachment and, therefore, under EB\u2019s practice,  would not have been included in EB\u2019s enforcement spreadsheet. As a  result, EB would not have included these complaints in its searches for  major alleged violators or repeat offenders or considered them in its  decisions about investigation or enforcement.", "With the majority of reported complaints excluded from EB\u2019s review, the  chances of identifying repeat offenders\u2014those who have already received  a citation or a notice of apparent liability from FCC but have continued to  send junk faxes\u2014are more limited. We searched CGB\u2019s 2005 complaint  data for selected company names and telephone numbers from issued  citations, using the \u201cFind\u201d feature, and found several complaints alleging  violations by citation recipients dated after the citations were issued.  However, none of these complaints had an attachment, and we did not find  these repeat offenders when we searched EB\u2019s spreadsheet. In addition, we  found six complaints of violations by Elf Painting and Wallpaper that  postdated the notice of apparent liability issued to this firm in December  2004. The most recent complaint was dated November 2005. However,  these complaints were all reported via the Internet and lacked an  attachment; therefore, like the 2005 complaints we found against the other  citation recipients, they may not have been found in a search of EB\u2019s  spreadsheet.", "Compounding this problem is FCC\u2019s consumer guidance on submitting junk  fax complaints. Some of this guidance encourage consumers to send in the  junk faxes they have received. However, none of the guidance state that  without a fax, EB analysts do not review a complaint, include it in their  investigations, consider it for enforcement action, or include it in their  searches for repeat offenders. \u201cIf you have received unsolicited faxes, you are encouraged to contact the FCC regarding  the incident(s). You may need to provide documentation in support of your complaint, such  as copies of the fax(es) you received.\u2026Your complaint should include:...a copy of the fax  advertisement, if possible, or confirmation that you have retained a copy of the fax.\u2026\u201d", "By contrast, the form for reporting complaints via the Internet says nothing  about sending in a copy of the fax to FCC and does not tell complainants  how to do so. As shown in figure 2, the Form 475 is designed for consumers  to report a wide variety of telephone complaints. As a result, much of the  information the form provides, as well as the information it seeks from  consumers, does not apply to junk fax complaints. Only the last section of  the form applies to junk fax complaints.", "Our review of a portion of CGB\u2019s 2005 complaint data revealed that several  consumers who reported junk fax complaints via the Internet were  frustrated because they could not attach the faxes they had received to the  form and could not find any guidance on how to send the faxes to FCC. For  example, some consumers said they had kept copies of the faxes but did  not know how to send them to FCC. Other consumers asked FCC to  contact them to let them know how to send the faxes.", "Both CGB and EB officials said they do not explicitly state that a fax is  needed for enforcement because they do not want to discourage  consumers who no longer have the fax from sending in a complaint. In  some instances, consumers who received a junk fax may not have kept the  fax. In addition, CGB officials said the Form 475 asks for all of the  information from the fax that is useful for EB to consider for possible  investigatory action or to issue a citation, such as the telephone number of  the company or individual that sent the fax and the \u201copt-out\u201d numbers  provided on the fax. However, enforcement officials will not see this  information because, under current practice, they are only looking for  complaints that have an attached fax to transfer to the EB spreadsheet,  regardless of how complete the information is on the Form 475."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FCC Faces Management Challenges in Carrying Out Its Junk Fax Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (GPRA) to require federal agencies to take specific steps to improve their  performance. In general, GPRA sets forth recognized performance  management practices that agencies can apply in carrying out their  governmental responsibilities. These practices include establishing  long-term strategic goals and annual goals, measuring performance in  meeting these goals, and reporting publicly on the agency\u2019s progress.  These performance management practices are critical in helping an agency  determine how well it is achieving intended outcomes. FCC does not  appear to be applying this model to its junk fax monitoring and  enforcement activities and, therefore, lacks an important tool for assessing  and reporting its progress.", "The agency has not indicated, for example, whether its focus is to decrease  the number of junk fax complaints received, increase the number of formal  enforcement actions, or improve consumer guidance on how to stop junk  faxes. FCC\u2019s strategic goal includes a target for reducing the amount of  time it takes to respond to consumer complaints; however, this goal may be  encouraging FCC to shift its focus from monitoring and enforcement to  customer service. CGB officials maintained, for example, that they  generally send a letter to complainants within 2 to 3 days acknowledging  that FCC has received their complaint. While this letter provides  complainants with information on alternative enforcement mechanisms  under the law\u2014that is, their private right of action and a civil action  brought by their state attorney general\u2014it does not seek additional  information from them, if needed, to pursue an FCC enforcement action.  Furthermore, once CGB has responded to a complaint with the  acknowledgment letter, it codes the complaint as a closed case for CGB  purposes, meaning that these data can be purged from the database after  2 years. As a result, these data are no longer available for use in identifying  major alleged violators and repeat offenders or for identifying and  monitoring trends in complaints and assessing the effects of enforcement  actions.", "FCC is not using the information on junk fax complaints that it collects to  measure its performance in carrying out its junk fax responsibilities.  Although CGB allocates considerable staff and other resources to entering  complaint data into its database, FCC is not analyzing these data and using  the results of its analyses to set priorities and allocate resources. For  example, it is not monitoring the number of junk fax complaints recorded  each year. Thus, FCC\u2019s quarterly reports identify the total number of TCPA  complaints, but do not break out the total for each of the six types of TCPA  complaints. As a result, the quarterly reports mask the magnitude of the  junk fax problem, which, as our analysis indicates, accounts for about 85  percent of all TCPA complaints received in 2005. In addition, the reports do  not indicate that junk fax complaints are the second most frequently  recorded type of consumer complaint overall. Without analyzing the data it  collects to determine the relative frequency of junk fax and other types of  complaints, FCC is limited in its ability to determine whether its staff and  other resources are appropriately aligned to address the problems  consumers are experiencing.", "Additionally, FCC is not analyzing the nature of the principal types of junk  fax problems complainants are reporting. This information appears in a  comment field, where CGB staff enter comments provided by  complainants, but the information cannot be analyzed electronically. As a  result, FCC may not be able to fully address concerns such as the  percentages of complainants who reported that they were continuing to  receive junk faxes after calling the opt-out number or who were receiving  junk faxes in the middle of the night. Furthermore, FCC cannot identify and  monitor trends in complaints and enforcement and, therefore, cannot  target its resources to complainants\u2019 greatest concerns or evaluate its own  performance in addressing those concerns. Having information on the  nature and frequency of problems with opt-out numbers and FCC\u2019s success  in addressing these problems is particularly important because Congress,  in the 2005 Act, required the opt-out number to protect consumers from  repeated unwanted faxes. FCC officials stated that these issues will be  addressed once the new junk fax rules are implemented.", "Without analysis, FCC cannot explore the need for, or implement, changes  to its rules, procedures, or consumer guidance that might help deter junk  fax violations or give consumers a better understanding of the junk fax  rules. We found, for example, from our review of comments in CGB\u2019s  database from 2005, that many complainants seemed to believe the  National Do-Not-Call Registry applies to fax numbers as well as their home  telephone numbers. Repeatedly, complainants reported that they had asked  to have their fax numbers placed on this list, and they did not understand  why they were still receiving junk faxes. FTC, together with FCC,  implemented this list in 2003 to protect consumers from unwanted  telemarketing calls. FTC staff explained that the list does not apply to fax  numbers\u2014that is, telemarketers must consult this list before placing  covered calls to consumers, but senders of fax advertisements are not  required to consult the list before faxing. FTC has provided guidance to  consumers that fax numbers are not covered under the National  Do-Not-Call Registry. Despite the many comments in CGB\u2019s database  indicative of complainants\u2019 misunderstanding, FCC has not considered this  issue in a rulemaking context or revised all of its guidance to clarify  whether the National Do-Not-Call Registry is applicable to fax advertising.", "Most important, without establishing performance goals and measures and  without analyzing complaint and enforcement data, it is not possible to  explore the effectiveness of current enforcement measures. Without first  gaining an understanding of the effectiveness of current enforcement  measures, it is similarly not possible to determine whether additional  enforcement measures are necessary to protect consumers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Consumer frustration with junk faxes is evident in the rapidly increasing  number of complaints and in the time that consumers are willing to take to  seek relief from this type of unsolicited advertising.

However,  despite collecting thousands of junk fax complaints, including the  information submitted with them, FCC has taken formal enforcement  actions against relatively few junk faxers. More important, FCC is simply  not considering the majority of complaints or any of the information  contained in those complaints when making decisions about investigations  and enforcement.", "We acknowledge that FCC cannot be expected to take enforcement action  against every junk fax complaint received. The growth in complaints,  together with limited resources, would make such an effort both  impossible and impractical. However, FCC has put in place data collection  and management processes that contain clear inefficiencies and limit its  ability to target major alleged violators and repeat offenders. Overall, there  has been limited collaboration between CGB and EB to ensure that FCC\u2019s  data processes are efficient, make the fullest use of the data collected, and  fully support the needs of EB.", "FCC is not making use of performance management tools to improve its  junk fax enforcement. There are no goals or measures of success for  handling complaints or for investigating them and taking enforcement  action. More fundamentally, FCC has not done the analysis that would help  it to establish such goals and measures. Without analyzing the complaint  data, FCC does not know if it could be doing more to better target its  limited resources to address the concerns of consumers, such as seeking  out faxers that may be providing fake opt-out numbers or providing clearer  guidance to consumers on the impact of time restrictions and the National  Do-Not-Call Registry on junk fax concerns. FCC also has not established  what it needs to do to be able to completely and accurately report the  number of complaints it has received in carrying out its junk fax  responsibilities as required under the 2005 Act. Because FCC\u2019s junk fax  enforcement efforts have data management issues, lack data analysis, and  lack performance goals and measures, it is not possible to determine  whether any additional enforcement measures would better protect  consumers and businesses from receiving junk faxes. FCC simply cannot  say whether its junk fax enforcement efforts are successful in combating  junk fax advertising.

Because this impacts the number of  complaints that FCC takes into consideration when searching for major  alleged violators and repeat offenders, we recommend that the Chairman  of the Federal Communications Commission direct staff to take the  following two actions:  Revise consumer complaint guidance to make it clear to consumers that  they need to include a copy of the fax in order to make it possible for  any investigation or enforcement action to take place. This includes  revising the wording of the Consumer Fact Sheet, the Internet complaint  form (Form 475), the consumer center script, and any other junk fax  guidance provided to consumers.", "Revise the Form 475 so that it includes clear instructions for  complainants on how to submit a copy of the fax. This may include  developing procedures and instructions to let consumers know how to  electronically attach a scanned copy of the fax so that it accompanies  their complaint form.", "FCC\u2019s current data collection and management processes contain  inefficiencies and adversely affect FCC\u2019s procedures for targeting major  alleged violators and repeat offenders. To begin to address these problems,  we recommend that FCC take the following action:  Direct consumer and enforcement staff to develop data management  strategies to (1) make the consumer complaint database more usable for  FCC\u2019s staff and (2) mitigate the amount of time spent on manual data  entry, as well as possible errors, resulting from this manual data entry.  For example, these efforts could include, but not be limited to, revising  the Form 475 so that consumers identify through checked boxes, or  another similar method, the type of complaint they are filing. This could  enhance accuracy and improve staff efficiency by eliminating the need  for FCC staff to read a text box to identify the type of complaint and  then enter that information into the database. In addition, staff should  develop strategies that would enable enforcement staff to search all  consumer complaint information contained in the database to identify  major and repeat violators.", "Finally, FCC should introduce recognized performance management  practices into its operations in order to improve the performance of its junk  fax enforcement efforts. Toward this effort, FCC should take the following  three actions:  Establish goals and performance measures for receiving,  acknowledging, investigating, and taking enforcement actions on junk  fax complaints.", "Use the information in the complaint database to analyze the nature and  scope of the complaints.

For example, FCC officials stated staff  have been working to implement a new data management system that will  in part consolidate all inquiry and complaint data into a new database by  May 2006. FCC officials said this new database will identify possible  duplicate complaint records and increase the efficiency of processing junk  fax inquiries and complaints.

FCC believes that  the number of complaints transferred to EB\u2019s spreadsheet for review,  although only a portion of the total number of complaints received, is large  enough to identify the major alleged violators and repeat offenders. We  reiterate that EB\u2019s spreadsheet contains less than half of the total number  of junk fax complaints received and contains almost none of the Internet  complaints. FCC has done no analysis to determine whether the complaints  that have been excluded from enforcement consideration involve the same  entities they have identified as major alleged violators. Moreover, searching  for repeat offenders (junk fax violators that have already been warned by  FCC to cease their activities) using a subset of the complaints received is  not as effective since even one additional violation makes the entity subject  to further enforcement action, including monetary forfeiture.", "Since FCC is beginning to explore changes to its database to eliminate the  need for a separate EB spreadsheet, as previously noted, it is possible for  FCC to also explore changes to the database that would improve EB\u2019s  ability to analyze all complaint data to better identify the major alleged  violators, as we have recommended.

Together, the two laws impose limitations on  both unsolicited telephone marketing calls and any other calls to a paging  service, cellular telephone service, other radio common carrier service, or  any service for which the person being called would be charged for the call.  Under TCPA rules, a \u201ccall\u201d includes text messaging if the messaging is sent  to a telephone number rather than an e-mail account. Electronic messages  can be sent to mobile devices using a variety of methods. The type of  technology used to send the electronic message determines how the  electronic message is regulated.", "The CAN-SPAM Act required that FCC adopt rules to protect consumers  from receiving unsolicited mobile service commercial messages. Under  the act, a mobile service commercial message is a commercial e-mail  message that is transmitted directly to a wireless device that is utilized by a  subscriber of commercial mobile service in connection with that service.  The act defines an e-mail message as a message having a unique e-mail  address that includes a reference to an Internet domain. FCC issued rules  in August 2004.", "FCC adopted a general prohibition on sending commercial messages to any  address referencing an Internet domain name associated with wireless  subscriber message services. To assist the senders of such messages in  identifying those subscribers, FCC requires commercial radio service  providers to submit those names to the commission, for inclusion on a  public list. FCC pursues violations of both CAN-SPAM and TCPA as it  relates to wireless devices under its general enforcement authority.", "As part of our study, we considered whether additional enforcement  measures might be necessary to protect consumers from junk faxes, and  whether establishing junk fax penalties and enforcement actions for repeat  violators or abusive violations similar to the criminal penalties under  CAN-SPAM would have a greater deterrent effect. As explained in the letter  of this report, without FCC establishing performance goals and measures  and analyzing complaint and enforcement data, it is not possible to explore  the effectiveness of current enforcement measures. Without first gaining an  understanding of the effectiveness of current enforcement measures, it is  similarly not possible to determine whether additional enforcement  measures are necessary to protect consumers. We did, however, ask federal  government officials, representatives of the state attorneys general,  consumer advocates, and business associations for their opinions  regarding whether additional enforcement measures are currently  necessary to enforce junk fax violations. Those with whom we spoke  generally did not believe that additional measures were necessary at this  time and did not support imposing criminal sanctions on junk fax violators  similar to those imposed on spammers under CAN-SPAM. A few of those  with whom we spoke thought that the role of the telephone companies  might be expanded, similar to the role of ISPs under the CAN-SPAM Act, so  that telephone companies could bring suit against junk faxers using their  networks."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 required GAO to report to Congress  on FCC\u2019s enforcement of the junk fax laws. Accordingly, we answered the  following questions: (1) What procedures have FCC established for taking  action on junk fax complaints\u2014including receipt, acknowledgment,  investigation, and enforcement\u2014and to what extent has it taken such  action? (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of FCC\u2019s junk fax  procedures? and (3) What challenges do FCC face in carrying out its junk  fax responsibilities?", "To determine FCC\u2019s procedures for taking action on junk fax complaints,  we reviewed provisions of TCPA as well as FCC\u2019s rules and procedures for  implementing the provisions of the act. We interviewed officials from FCC\u2019s  Consumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB)\u2014whose responsibilities  include developing FCC rules and accepting and acknowledging  complaints\u2014and FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau\u2014whose responsibilities  include junk fax enforcement. Additionally, we reviewed FCC\u2019s guidance to  complainants for submitting junk fax complaints as well as FCC\u2019s  procedures for receiving and documenting these complaints. Finally, we  obtained and reviewed FCC\u2019s procedures for determining which  complaints would receive further investigative and enforcement actions.", "To determine the extent to which FCC has taken action on junk fax  complaints, we obtained and analyzed FCC\u2019s database for documenting  junk fax complaints and the spreadsheet used for determining investigatory  and enforcement actions. We obtained summary data on the number of  complaints received from 2000 through 2005, by source and method. We  also obtained detailed information on the amount of formal enforcement  actions taken against junk faxers since the formation of FCC\u2019s  Enforcement Bureau. Further, to determine the type of concerns expressed  by consumers and businesses, we reviewed some individual consumer and  business comments submitted to FCC as part of the junk fax complaints  and contained in FCC\u2019s database.", "To assess the reliability of FCC\u2019s complaint data, we interviewed FCC  officials responsible for the database regarding data entry and control  procedures and reviewed existing documentation about the system. We  conducted limited electronic tests on 2005 data to determine missing data  and duplicative complaint identification numbers; these tests revealed only  minor problems. We also conducted manual reviews to identify any  discrepancies in the database. For example, we reviewed a portion of the  comment fields in the database and found that some complaints that were  coded as junk fax complaints should not have been. Since this type of  review requires reading the comments for each complaint entered, which is  resource-intensive, we did not review all of the comments to determine the  extent of this problem. CGB officials acknowledged limitations of the data,  including reliability problems in previous years of tracking complaint  information, possible inaccuracies in coding, and continual changes to  more recent data as additional complaints are added. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable to present overall trends and  approximate figures. Specifically, we report only overall complaint  numbers for 2000 through 2002, and approximate numbers at a more  detailed level for complaints from 2003 through 2005.", "To determine the strengths and weaknesses of FCC\u2019s junk fax procedures,  we analyzed these procedures, including those used to determine which  junk fax complaints would be considered for further investigatory and  enforcement actions. In addition, we reviewed business and consumer  comments submitted to FCC during junk fax rulemaking and  reconsideration of existing rules. We also analyzed all junk fax consumer  complaint guidance provided by FCC to determine if the guidance was  consistent with the enforcement procedures.", "To determine the challenges FCC faces in carrying out its junk fax  responsibilities, we reviewed provisions of the Government Performance  and Results Act of 1993, as well as documents and records used by FCC to  establish goals and performance measures\u2014that is, budget justifications,  performance summaries, and strategic plans. We also reviewed FCC\u2019s  quarterly complaint reports to determine the level of analysis being  conducted on junk fax complaints.", "Finally, we used existing statutes and regulations to provide information on  additional enforcement measures and penalties that have been established  to protect consumers from other types of unsolicited advertising. We  interviewed FTC staff, representatives from the National Association of  Attorney\u2019s General, and representatives from industry groups to obtain  more information on different enforcement rules and actions.", "We conducted our work from November 2005 through March 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
