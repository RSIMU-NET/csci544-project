From October 8, 2013, to April 1, 2015, FCC received 48 RDAs and no informal or formal complaints. FCC has undertaken numerous efforts to inform the public about CVAA's protections and remedies by, for example, hosting seminars and webinars and publishing consumer guides on accessibility issues. However, GAO found FCC's efforts do not always align with key practices for conducting public outreach. In particular, FCC has not evaluated the effectiveness of its public outreach efforts. Without such an evaluation, FCC does not know the program's effectiveness in informing the public of the protections and remedies available under CVAA and thus cannot reasonably assure the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the outreach program. Evaluating the outreach efforts would also enable FCC to determine whether current resources allocated to the outreach program are appropriate or need adjustment.", "FCC has taken limited actions to ensure industry compliance with CVAA's recordkeeping provisions and does not know the extent to which industry is fully complying with the requirements to make products and services accessible. FCC established the Recordkeeping Compliance Certification and Contact Information Registry to help ensure industry compliance with recordkeeping requirements. Companies subject to any CVAA accessibility requirement must submit an annual certification to FCC that they are maintaining records of their efforts to make their products accessible through the Registry. FCC could not say whether industry is complying with CVAA accessibility requirements because FCC lacks an objective measure for making this determination. However, developing a measure might not be cost effective given that FCC has received no informal or formal complaints asserting non-compliance with these requirements. In FCC's 2014 biennial report to Congress, FCC based its determination of industry compliance on public comments and industry association reports.", "Stakeholders GAO surveyed and interviewed generally reported that CVAA's recordkeeping obligations have not affected the development and deployment of new communications technologies. Specifically, GAO estimated that between 59 and 70 percent of companies view CVAA's recordkeeping requirements as having had no effect on their development and deployment of new communications technologies. Overall, industry associations and disability advocates GAO interviewed generally agreed that accessibility improved since the passage of CVAA. Industry associations highlighted a number of association-led efforts to bring industry and consumers together to ensure that the needs of disabled consumers are being addressed.

This report presents information on (1)  the extent to which FCC established complaint and enforcement  procedures within the time frames required by CVAA and conducted  public outreach, (2) the actions FCC has taken to ensure industry  compliance with CVAA\u2019s recordkeeping provisions and to determine the  level of industry compliance with accessibility requirements, and (3)  stakeholders\u2019 views on the effect of CVAA\u2019s recordkeeping obligations on the development and deployment of new communications technologies.We did not assess the effectiveness of CVAA\u2019s enforcement provisions  and FCC\u2019s enforcement procedures to ensure compliance with CVAA  because FCC had not taken any enforcement actions at the time of our  review.", "To determine whether FCC established complaint and enforcement  procedures within the required time frames of CVAA, we reviewed the  Section 717 provisions related to those procedures and compared them  with FCC\u2019s implementing actions. Specifically, we reviewed the  procedures FCC publically released in its October 2011 Report and Order  and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, those procedures  published as final rules in December 2011 in the Federal Register, and the final rules codified in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R).To determine what information FCC provides to the public about filing  accessibility complaints, we reviewed its Consumer Help Center web  page ( ), which FCC had  redesigned and opened during the course of our review. The Consumer  Help Center instructs the public in how to seek FCC\u2019s assistance and file  complaints not only on accessibility issues, but also on other issues  related to TV, phone, internet, radio, and emergency communications. To  determine FCC\u2019s efforts to inform the public about the availability of the  clearinghouse and the protections and remedies available under sections  255, 716, and 718,http://ach.fcc.gov/;  Clearinghouse of Information, which can be found at  October 2012 and October 2014 biennial reports to Congress; online  Consumer Help Center; and AccessInfo@fcc.gov e-mails that update  public subscribers on accessibility and disability issues. In addition, we  reviewed FCC\u2019s October 2011 Report and Order and Further Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking and other FCC documents to determine whether  FCC established the Accessibility Clearinghouse within the time frames  required by CVAA. We assessed FCC\u2019s public outreach efforts against  the key practices for consumer education planning identified in our  November 2007 report.education campaign, we convened an expert panel composed of 14  senior management-level experts in strategic communications. We  selected these experts, who represented private, public, and academic   we reviewed the contents of FCC\u2019s Accessibility   To identify the key practices of a consumer  institutions, based on their experience overseeing a strategic  communications or social marketing campaign or other relevant expertise.", "To determine the actions FCC has taken to ensure industry compliance  with CVAA\u2019s recordkeeping and annual certification obligations, we  reviewed FCC\u2019s October 2011 Report and Order and Further Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking, October 2012 and October 2014 biennial reports  to Congress; and interviewed officials from FCC\u2019s Consumer and  Governmental Affairs Bureau and Enforcement Bureau. We also  assessed FCC\u2019s efforts for determining the level of industry compliance  with Sections 255, 716, and 718 by analyzing FCC\u2019s assessments in its  biennial reports to Congress, analyzing data (covering January 2013 to  April 2015) from the Recordkeeping Compliance Certification and Contact  Information Registry to determine the number of distinct companies  certifying their compliance with CVAA, and interviewing Consumer and  Governmental Affairs Bureau officials.", "To determine the telecommunications industry\u2019s views on the effect of  CVAA\u2019s certification and recordkeeping obligations on the development  and deployment of new communications technologies, we conducted a  web-based survey. We drew a stratified random sample of 355  companies from the population of 3,549 companies that had submitted  recordkeeping certifications to FCC as of December 5, 2014. To obtain  these 355 companies, we divided the companies into those that had  identified themselves as only being subject to the product accessibility  requirements of Section 255 of the Communications Act, and those  subject to the product accessibility requirements of Sections 716 and 718  of the Communications Act. Companies that submitted a certification to  FCC without identifying themselves by a section were excluded from the  sample. Additionally, because oftentimes the same person served as the  contact person for multiple companies, we took a systematic sample  within each stratum to ensure that no one respondent received more than  four surveys from us. With this probability sample, each member of the  study population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that  probability could be computed for any member. Each sample element  was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all  the members of the population, including those who were not selected. To  ensure that our survey questions were clear and logical and that  respondents could answer the questions without undue burden, we pre- tested our questionnaire with five companies. We interviewed pretest  companies that varied in company size, accessibility requirement section,  and equipment manufacturing or service provision. We administered the  survey from February 2015 through March 2015. We received 173  responses, for a 49 percent response rate. Because we followed a  probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one  of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95  percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. All percentage estimates from the survey have margins of error at  the 95 percent confidence level of plus or minus 14 percentage points or  less, unless otherwise noted.", "In addition to sampling errors, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may also introduce other types of errors, commonly referred to as  non-sampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question  is interpreted, in the sources of information available to respondents, or in  how the data were entered into a database or were analyzed can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. With this survey, we  took a number of steps to minimize these non-sampling errors. For  example, our staff with subject matter expertise designed the  questionnaire in collaboration with our survey specialists. As noted  earlier, the questionnaire was pretested to ensure that the questions were  relevant and clearly stated. When the data were analyzed, a second  independent GAO analyst independently verified the analysis programs to  ensure the accuracy of the code and the appropriateness of the methods  used for the computer-generated analysis. Since this was a web-based  survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the electronic  questionnaire, thereby eliminating the need to have the data keyed into a  database, thus avoiding a source of data entry error.", "In addition, as shown in table 2, we interviewed representatives from 15  organizations to obtain their views of FCC\u2019s action to implement the  provisions of CVAA and CVAA\u2019s effect on increasing the accessibility for  people with disabilities. We selected organizations that had submitted two  or more comments in reply to FCC\u2019s solicitation of public comments on  proposed rules, regulations, and biennial report drafts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Copy of Survey to Certifying Companies", "paragraphs": ["The questions we asked in our survey of certifying officers of companies  subject to the reporting requirements of Section 717 of the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended by Title I of the 21st Century  Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, P.L. 111-260  (CVAA) are shown below.
