In 2000, the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act amended the act to better protect boxers' economic well-being and enhance the integrity of the sport. However, reports of problems continue, including permanent and sometimes fatal injuries, economic exploitation, and corruption. GAO was asked to (1) identify fundamental elements considered important to protect professional boxers and enhance the integrity of the sport; (2) assess the extent to which provisions of the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, as amended (the act), cover these elements and determine whether selected state and tribal boxing commissions have documentation indicating compliance with the act's provisions; (3) determine whether selected states and tribes have provisions that cover additional elements; and (4) identify federal actions taken under the act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on GAO's review of congressional testimonies and national studies dating from 1994 through 2002, GAO identified 15 fundamental elements that are considered important to protect boxers' health, safety, and economic well-being and to enhance the integrity of the sport. The act addresses 10 of the 15 fundamental elements that GAO identified. The 8 (of 46) state and 2 (of 8) tribal boxing commissions that GAO selected for review accounted for 49 percent of the fights in 2001 and varied in the extent to which they had documentation indicating compliance with the 10 provisions of the act related to the fundamental elements. For example, all 10 commissions had documentation indicating compliance at least 75 percent of the time for 3 provisions--requiring prefight medical exams, disclosure of purses and payments, and registration of boxers--but only 2 commissions had documentation indicating compliance at least 75 percent of the time for a provision prohibiting conflicts of interest. Commissions either gave no reason for the lack of documentation, cited privacy or liability concerns, or said they were unaware of the federal provision. The eight states and two tribes that GAO reviewed vary in the extent to which they adopted additional provisions that cover elements not covered by the act's provisions. The number of such provisions ranges from 10 (California) to 4 (Missouri). For example, the states have provisions requiring the filing of postfight medical reports, uniform boxing and scoring rules, and boxing commission officials' knowledge of the sport. Federal actions taken under the act have been limited. The Department of Justice said it has not exercised its authority to prosecute cases because none have been referred to it by federal law enforcement authorities. Furthermore it noted that violations under the act are misdemeanors, and it generally applies its resources to prosecuting felonies. The Federal Trade Commission periodically checks the Web sites of the organizations that sanction professional boxing events to see whether they have posted the information that they are required to make available to the public and has found them to be adequate. Legislation was recently introduced to significantly amend the act by, among other things, creating a new organization within the Department of Labor that would provide oversight and enforcement of boxing laws. This new federal organization is intended to facilitate more uniform enforcement of federal requirements aimed at enhancing boxers' health, safety, and general interests as well as the integrity of the sport. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission provided only technical comments on our report. The Association of Boxing Commissions and five state and tribal commissions had concerns about the lack of existing federal enforcement and the economic impact of any additional federal requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress has recognized that boxing is the only major professional sport in  the United States without a central regulatory authority that establishes  and enforces uniform rules, business practices, and ethical standards.  There is no other major professional sport in which the rules and  regulations\u2014and their enforcement\u2014vary so widely. As a result, the sport  has been plagued with reports of permanent and sometimes fatal injuries,  the economic exploitation of boxers, and corruption. The Association of  Boxing Commissions, a 15-year-old nonprofit organization representing 46  state and 8 tribal boxing commissions located throughout the United  States, promotes uniform health and safety provisions for professional  boxing, but has no enforcement authority over its members, and its  effectiveness in regulating boxing depends on mutual cooperation.", "In 1996, because the states and tribes, which are primarily responsible for  establishing provisions to regulate professional boxing, were not uniformly  protecting the health and safety of professional boxers, Congress enacted  the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996. This act established minimum  health and safety standards and licensing provisions, along with  enforcement responsibilities and penalties for violations. In 2000, Congress  amended the 1996 act by passing the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act,  which established provisions to protect boxers from economic exploitation  and to enhance the integrity of the sport.", "The 1996 act, as amended (the act), authorizes the Department of Justice to  investigate and prosecute violations of the law and it provides for state and  civil remedies as well as federal criminal prosecution. Within the  Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is responsible  for investigating violations of the law. Generally, the U.S. Attorneys are  responsible for prosecuting violations of laws. The act further provides that  organizations sanctioning boxing matches annually provide certain  information to the Federal Trade Commission or otherwise make such  information available to the public through the Internet. The Federal Trade  Commission is required to make the information provided to it available to  the public.", "This report responds to your request that we review current efforts to  protect the health, safety, and economic well-being of professional boxers  and to enhance the integrity of the sport. As agreed with your office, we  addressed the following questions:   What fundamental elements are considered important to address major  health and safety, economic, and integrity problems facing professional  boxing?", "To what extent do the act\u2019s provisions cover these elements, and to what  extent do selected state and tribal boxing commissions have  documentation indicating compliance with the act\u2019s provisions?", "To what extent have the selected states and tribes adopted provisions  that cover fundamental elements that are not covered in the act?", "What actions have the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade  Commission taken under the act?", "To identify the fundamental elements that are considered important to  address major health and safety, economic, and integrity problems facing  professional boxing, we reviewed congressional testimony and studies on  professional boxing conducted by a task force of the National Association  of Attorneys General, the Department of Health and Human Services, and  the Department of Labor. From these sources, which documented  problems in the boxing industry and recommended actions to address  them, we identified major problems facing the sport and consolidated the  recommendations into 15 fundamental elements that are considered  important in helping to provide an adequate level of health, safety, and  economic protection to boxers and enhance the integrity of the sport. We  discussed these elements with the Association of Boxing Commissions,  which agreed that the elements could help provide the desired protection  and enhancement.", "To assess the extent to which the act covers the elements we identified, we  analyzed the act\u2019s provisions and determined how many address the  fundamental elements, either fully or partially. To assess the extent to  which selected state and tribal boxing commissions have documented their  compliance with the act\u2019s provisions, we selected 8 of the 46 state boxing  commissions and 2 of the 8 tribal boxing commissions for review. These 10  commissions accounted for 383, or 49 percent, of the 777 professional  boxing events held in the United States in 2001. (See app. I for a listing of  the professional boxing events held by state and tribal commissions in  2001.) At 2 state (Indiana and Michigan) and the 2 tribal (Miccosukee and  Mohegan Sun) commissions, we reviewed the case files for all professional  boxing events held in 2001, the most recent year for which we could obtain  complete information, and at the remaining commissions, we randomly  selected a sample of case files for review. From our reviews of these case  files, we determined the extent to which each of the 8 state and 2 tribal  boxing commissions had documentation indicating compliance in 2001  with provisions in the act that related to the fundamental elements. We did  not independently verify that the provisions were met. Our findings for  these 10 commissions cannot be generalized to all 46 state and 8 tribal  boxing commissions.", "To assess the extent to which selected states and tribes have provisions  that cover fundamental elements in addition to those covered in the act, we  reviewed the boxing provisions of the eight states and two tribes and  identified fundamental elements that do not appear in the act. We  confirmed with the boxing commissions of these states and tribes that they  agreed with our analysis of their provisions. We did not assess the extent to  which the states and tribes had implemented or enforced the provisions  that cover the additional fundamental elements.", "To determine what actions the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade  Commission have taken under the act, we asked Justice officials whether  they had initiated any civil enforcement proceedings or criminal  prosecutions of potential violators of the act in the eight states and two  tribal jurisdictions covered by our review. We also reviewed the  department\u2019s central case management system for possible cases  prosecuted during fiscal years 1996 through 2002.

Neurological testing may be needed to detect such injury.  Furthermore, because injuries may occur during training and sparring as  well as during boxing events, monitoring during training was  recommended, and health and life insurance may be needed before and  after as well as during events. In some instances, the treatment a fighter  receives in the initial minutes after an injury determines whether the fighter  recovers or sustains permanent damage or death. Having an ambulance  and qualified medical personnel on-site, rather than on call, can be critical.  Enforcement of suspensions imposed by boxing commissions in other  states is important to prevent injured boxers from trying to fight outside  the states in which they are registered before their injuries have healed.", "The four elements that could help to protect boxers\u2019 economic interests  would   require pension plans for boxers,  require full disclosure of purses and payments,   require minimum uniform contractual terms between boxers and   prohibit conflicts of interest.", "Without a union to represent their economic interests, boxers have often  been exploited, and although the sport has generated enormous wealth for  others, many professional boxers have been left penniless. Comprehensive  pension plans for boxers are almost nonexistent, and boxers have  sometimes been left to pay trainers out of their share of the fight purse  when the financial responsibilities of promoters and managers were not  disclosed in advance. Conflicts of interest between promoters and  managers and long-term contracts with promoters have also disadvantaged  boxers.", "The 5 elements that could help to correct problems affecting the integrity  of the sport would   require registration and training for judges, referees, and others;   prevent sanctioning organizations from exercising undue influence in  the selection of judges;   establish uniform boxing and scoring rules;   require reviews of sanctioning organizations\u2019 rankings of boxers; and   require knowledge of the sport for commission officials.", "Reports of unqualified officials, last-minute changes in the procedures for  selecting judges, nonstandard boxing and scoring rules, fraudulent  rankings that have resulted in injury and even death for weaker boxers, and  political appointments to boxing commissions have undermined the  integrity of the sport.", "Table 1 sets forth the 15 elements we identified.

USBA  would be responsible for providing oversight, administering the federal  boxing laws, and issuing minimum standards to protect the health, safety,  and general interests of professional boxers.

In some instances, the Miccosukee and Pennsylvania boxing  commissions noted that it would be difficult for them to implement certain  elements because of personnel and budgetary constraints or because of  their limited jurisdiction.

We  confirmed with the boxing commissions of these states and tribes that they  agreed with our analysis of their provisions, and we asked these officials  why their state or tribe had not enacted provisions covering additional  fundamental elements. Our findings for these selected states and tribes  cannot be generalized to all 46 states and eight tribes. We did not assess the  extent to which the states and tribes had implemented or enforced the  provisions that cover additional fundamental elements.", "To determine what actions the Department of Justice and FTC have taken  under the act, we determined the role that each is assigned under the act.  We then met with Justice officials to identify whether any investigations or  prosecutions had been conducted under the act in the jurisdictions of the  eight state and two tribal commissions in 2001. In addition, we reviewed  Justice\u2019s central case management system for possible cases prosecuted  during fiscal years 1996 through 2002. We also met with FTC officials to  determine whether they had received consumer complaints related to the  boxing industry. Furthermore, to determine that the sanctioning  organizations were making the required information available to the public,  we reviewed the Internet Web sites of 14 sanctioning organizations.", "We performed our work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards from September 2002 through July 2003 in Washington,  D.C., and at the following state or tribal boxing commission locations:  California State Athletic Commission, Sacramento, California; Florida State  Athletic Commission, Tallahassee, Florida; Indiana Boxing Commission,  Indianapolis, Indiana; Michigan Bureau of Commercial Services, Lansing,  Michigan; Missouri Office of Athletics, Jefferson City, Missouri; Nevada  Athletic Commission, Las Vegas, Nevada; Pennsylvania Athletic  Commission, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Texas Boxing and Wrestling  Program, Austin, Texas; Miccosukee Athletic Commission, Miami, Florida;  and the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Commission Athletic Unit, Uncasville,  Connecticut."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Association of Boxing Commissions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Missouri Office of Athletics", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Miccosukee Athletic Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Commission Athletic Unit", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contacts and Contributors", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contributors", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
