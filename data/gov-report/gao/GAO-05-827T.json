The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and federal policy established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the focal point for coordinating activities to protect the computer systems that support our nation's critical infrastructures. GAO was asked to summarize previous work, focusing on (1) DHS's responsibilities for cybersecurity-related critical infrastructure protection (CIP), (2) the status of the department's efforts to fulfill these responsibilities, (3) the challenges it faces in fulfilling its cybersecurity responsibilities, and (4) recommendations GAO has made to improve cybersecurity of our nation's critical infrastructure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As the focal point for CIP, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has many cybersecurity-related roles and responsibilities that GAO identified in law and policy. DHS established the National Cyber Security Division to take the lead in addressing the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures. While DHS has initiated multiple efforts to fulfill its responsibilities, it has not fully addressed any of the 13 responsibilities, and much work remains ahead. For example, the department established the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team as a public/private partnership to make cybersecurity a coordinated national effort, and it established forums to build greater trust and information sharing among federal officials with information security responsibilities and law enforcement entities. However, DHS has not yet developed national cyber threat and vulnerability assessments or government/industry contingency recovery plans for cybersecurity, including a plan for recovering key Internet functions. DHS faces a number of challenges that have impeded its ability to fulfill its cybersecurity-related CIP responsibilities. These key challenges include achieving organizational stability, increasing awareness about cybersecurity roles and capabilities, establishing effective partnerships with stakeholders, and achieving two-way information sharing with these stakeholders. In its strategic plan for cybersecurity, DHS identifies steps that can begin to address the challenges. However, until it confronts and resolves these underlying challenges and implements its plans, DHS will have difficulty achieving significant results in strengthening the cybersecurity of our critical infrastructures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, GAO has made a series of recommendations to enhance the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures that if effectively implemented could greatly improve our nation's cybersecurity posture."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to join in today\u2019s hearing on  challenges in protecting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures from  cybersecurity threats.

In  recent years, the sophistication and effectiveness of cyberattacks  have steadily advanced. These attacks often take advantage of flaws  in software code, circumvent signature-based tools that commonly  identify and prevent known threats, and use social engineering  techniques designed to trick the unsuspecting user into divulging  sensitive information or propagating attacks. These attacks are  becoming increasingly automated with the use of botnets\u2014 compromised computers that can be remotely controlled by  attackers to automatically launch attacks. Bots (short for robots)  have become a key automation tool used to speed the infection of  vulnerable systems.", "Government officials are increasingly concerned about attacks from  individuals and groups with malicious intent, such as crime,  terrorism, foreign intelligence-gathering, and acts of war. As greater  amounts of money are transferred through computer systems, as  more sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence  communities increasingly rely on commercially available  information technology, the likelihood increases that information  attacks will threaten vital national interests.", "Recent attacks and threats have further underscored the need to  bolster the cybersecurity of our government\u2019s and our nation\u2019s  computer systems and, more importantly, of the critical operations  and infrastructures they support.  Recent examples of attacks  include the following:   In March 2005, security consultants within the electric industry  reported that hackers were targeting the U.S. electric power grid  and had gained access to U.S. utilities\u2019 electronic control  systems. Computer security specialists reported that, in a few  cases, these intrusions had \u201ccaused an impact.\u201d While officials  stated that hackers had not caused serious damage to the  systems that feed the nation\u2019s power grid, the constant threat of  intrusion has heightened concerns that electric companies may  not have adequately fortified their defenses against a potential  catastrophic strike.", "In January 2005, a major university reported that a hacker had  broken into a database containing 32,000 student and employee  Social Security numbers, potentially compromising their  identities and finances. In similar incidents during 2003 and 2004,  it was reported that hackers had attacked the systems of other  universities, exposing the personal information of over 1.8  million people.", "In June 2003, the U.S. government issued a warning concerning a  virus that specifically targeted financial institutions. Experts said  the BugBear.b virus was programmed to determine whether a  victim had used an e-mail address for any of the roughly 1,300  financial institutions listed in the virus\u2019s code. If a match was  found, the software attempted to collect and document user  input by logging keystrokes and then provided this information  to a hacker, who could use it in attempts to break into the banks\u2019  networks.", "In November 2002, a British computer administrator was  indicted on charges that he accessed and damaged 98 computers  in 14 states between March 2001 and March 2002, causing some  $900,000 in damage. These networks belonged to the Department  of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  and private companies. The indictment alleges that the attacker  was able to gain administrative privileges on military computers,  copy password files, and delete critical system files. The attacks  rendered the networks of the Earle Naval Weapons Station in  New Jersey and the Military District of Washington inoperable.", "In May 2005, we reported that federal agencies are facing a set of  emerging cybersecurity threats that are the result of increasingly  sophisticated methods of attack and the blending of once distinct  types of attack into more complex and damaging forms. Examples  of these threats include spam (unsolicited commercial e-mail),  phishing (fraudulent messages used to obtain personal or sensitive  data), and spyware (software that monitors user activity without the  user\u2019s knowledge or consent). Spam consumes significant resources  and is used as a delivery mechanism for other types of cyberattacks;  phishing can lead to identity theft, loss of sensitive information, and  reduced trust and use of electronic government services; and  spyware can capture and release sensitive data, make unauthorized  changes, and decrease system performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Responsibilities for Cybersecurity in Support of Critical Infrastructure Protection Are Many and Varied", "paragraphs": ["Federal law and policies call for critical infrastructure protection  (CIP) activities that are intended to enhance the cyber and physical  security of both the public and private infrastructures that are  essential to national security, national economic security, and  national public health and safety. Federal policy designates certain  federal agencies as lead federal points of contact for the critical  infrastructure sectors and assigns them responsibility for  infrastructure protection activities in their assigned sectors and for  coordination with other relevant federal agencies, state and local  governments, and the private sector to carry out related  responsibilities (see app. 1). In addition, federal policy establishes  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the focal point for  the security of cyberspace\u2014including analysis, warning,  information sharing, vulnerability reduction, mitigation, and  recovery efforts for public and private critical infrastructure  information systems. To accomplish this mission, DHS is to work  with other federal agencies, state and local governments, and the  private sector.", "Among the many CIP responsibilities established for DHS and  identified in federal law and policy are 13 key cybersecurity-related  responsibilities. These include general CIP responsibilities that have  a cyber element (such as developing national plans, building  partnerships, and improving information sharing) as well as  responsibilities that relate to the five priorities established by the  National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. The five priorities are  (1) developing and enhancing national cyber analysis and warning,  (2) reducing cyberspace threats and vulnerabilities, (3) promoting  awareness of and training in security issues, (4) securing  governments\u2019 cyberspace, and (5) strengthening national security  and international cyberspace security cooperation. Table 1 provides  a description of each of these responsibilities.", "In June 2003, DHS established the National Cyber Security Division  (NCSD), under its Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection Directorate, to serve as a national focal point for  addressing cybersecurity issues and to coordinate implementation  of the cybersecurity strategy. NCSD also serves as the government  lead on a public/private partnership supporting the U.S. Computer  Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) and as the lead for federal  government incident response. NCSD is headed by the Office of the  Director and includes a cybersecurity partnership program as well  as four branches: US-CERT Operations, Law Enforcement and  Intelligence, Outreach and Awareness, and Strategic Initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Initiated Efforts That Begin to Address Its Responsibilities, but More Work Remains", "paragraphs": ["DHS has initiated efforts that begin to address each of its 13 key  responsibilities for cybersecurity; however, the extent of progress  varies among these responsibilities, and more work remains to be  done on each. For example, DHS (1) has recently issued an interim  plan for infrastructure protection that includes cybersecurity plans,  (2) is supporting a national cyber analysis and warning capability  through its role in US-CERT, and (3) has established forums to build  greater trust and to encourage information sharing among federal  officials with information security responsibilities and among  various law enforcement entities. However, DHS has not yet  developed a national cyber threat assessment and sector  vulnerability assessments\u2014or the identification of cross-sector  interdependencies\u2014that are called for in the cyberspace strategy.  The importance of such assessments is illustrated in our recent  reports on vulnerabilities in infrastructure control systems and in  wireless networks. Further, the department has not yet developed  and exercised government and government/industry contingency  recovery plans for cybersecurity, including a plan for recovering key  Internet functions. The department also continues to have  difficulties in developing partnerships, as called for in federal policy,  with other federal agencies, state and local governments, and the  private sector. Without such partnerships, it is difficult to develop  the trusted, two-way information sharing that is essential to  improving homeland security.", "Table 2 provides an overview of the steps that DHS has taken  related to each of its 13 key responsibilities and identifies the steps  that remain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Continues to Face Challenges in Establishing Itself as a National Focal Point for Cyberspace Security", "paragraphs": ["DHS faces a number of challenges that have impeded its ability to  fulfill its cyber CIP responsibilities. Key challenges include  achieving organizational stability, gaining organizational authority,  overcoming hiring and contracting issues, increasing awareness  about cybersecurity roles and capabilities, establishing effective  partnerships with stakeholders (other federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector), achieving two-way information  sharing with these stakeholders, and providing and demonstrating  the value DHS can provide.", "Organizational stability: Over the last year, multiple senior DHS  cybersecurity officials\u2014including the NCSD Director, the Deputy  Director responsible for Outreach and Awareness, and the Director  of the US-CERT Control Systems Security Center, the Under  Secretary for the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection  Directorate and the Assistant Secretary responsible for the  Information Protection Office\u2014have left the department.  Infrastructure sector officials stated that the lack of stable  leadership has diminished NCSD\u2019s ability to maintain trusted  relationships with its infrastructure partners and has hindered its  ability to adequately plan and execute activities. According to one  private-sector representative, the importance of organizational  stability in fostering strong partnerships cannot be over emphasized.", "Organizational authority: NCSD does not have the organizational  authority it needs to effectively serve as a national focal point for  cybersecurity. Accordingly, its officials lack the authority to  represent and commit DHS to efforts with the private sector.   Infrastructure and cybersecurity officials, including the chairman of  the sector coordinators and representatives of the cybersecurity  industry, have expressed concern that the cybersecurity division\u2019s  relatively low position within the DHS organization hinders its  ability to accomplish cybersecurity-related goals. NCSD\u2019s lack of  authority has led to some missteps, including DHS\u2019s cancellation of  an important cyber event without explanation and its taking almost  a year to issue formal responses to private sector recommendations  that resulted from selected National Cyber Security Summit task  forces\u2014even though responses were drafted within months.", "A congressional subcommittee also expressed concern that DHS\u2019s  cybersecurity office lacks the authority to effectively fulfill its role.  In 2004 and again in 2005, the subcommittee proposed legislation to  elevate the head of the cybersecurity office to an assistant secretary  position. Among other benefits, the subcommittee reported that  such a change could    provide more focus and authority for DHS\u2019s cybersecurity mission,     allow higher level input into national policy decisions, and     provide a single visible point of contact within the federal  government for improving interactions with the private sector.", "To try to address these concerns, DHS recently announced that it  would elevate responsibility for cybersecurity to an assistant  secretary position.", "Hiring and contracting:  Ineffective DHS management processes  have impeded the department\u2019s ability to hire employees and  maintain contracts. We recently reported that since DHS\u2019s inception,  its leadership has provided a foundation for maintaining critical  operations while it undergoes transformation. However, in  managing its transformation, we noted that the department still  needed to overcome a number of significant challenges, including  addressing systemic problems in human capital and acquisition  systems. Federal and nonfederal officials expressed concerns about  its hiring and contracting processes. For example, an NCSD official  reported that the division has had difficulty in hiring personnel to fill  vacant positions. These officials stated that once they found  qualified candidates, some candidates decided not to apply and  another one withdrew his acceptance because he felt that DHS\u2019s  hiring process had taken too long. In addition, a cybersecurity  division official stated that there had been times when DHS did not  renew NCSD contracts in a timely manner, requiring that key  contractors work without pay until approvals could be completed  and payments could be made. In other cases, NCSD was denied  services from a vendor because the department had repeatedly  failed to pay this vendor for its services. External stakeholders,  including an ISAC representative, also noted that NCSD is hampered  by how long it takes DHS to award a contract.", "Awareness of DHS roles and capabilities: Many infrastructure  stakeholders are not yet aware of DHS\u2019s cybersecurity roles and  capabilities. Department of Energy critical infrastructure officials  stated that the roles and responsibilities of DHS and the sector- specific agencies need to be better clarified in order to improve  coordination. In addition, during a regional cyber exercise, private- sector and state and local government officials reported that the  mission of NCSD and the capabilities that DHS could provide during  a serious cyber-threat were not clear to them. NCSD\u2019s manager of  cyber analysis and warning operations acknowledged that the  organization has not done an adequate job reaching out to the  private sector regarding the department\u2019s role and capabilities.", "Effective partnerships: NCSD is responsible for leveraging the  assets of key stakeholders, including other federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector, in order to facilitate effective  protection of cyber assets. The ability to develop partnerships  greatly enhances the agency\u2019s ability to identify, assess, and reduce  cyber threats and vulnerabilities, establish strategic analytical  capabilities, provide incident response, enhance government  cybersecurity, and improve international efforts. According to one  infrastructure sector representative, effective partnerships require  building relationships with mutually developed goals; shared  benefits and responsibilities; and tangible, measurable results.  However, this individual reported that DHS has not typically  adopted these principles in pursuing partnerships with the private  sector, which dramatically diminishes cybersecurity gains that  government and industry could otherwise achieve. For example, it  has often informed the infrastructure sectors about government  initiatives or sought input after most key decisions have been made.  Also, the department has not demonstrated that it recognizes the  value of leveraging existing private sector mechanisms, such as  information-sharing entities and processes that are already in place  and working. In addition, the instability of NCSD\u2019s leadership  positions to date has led to problems in developing partnerships.  Representatives from two ISACs reported that turnover at the  cybersecurity division has hindered partnership efforts.  Additionally, IT sector representatives stated that NCSD needs  continuity of leadership, regular communications, and trusted  policies and procedures in order to build the partnerships that will  allow the private sector to share information.", "Information sharing: We recently identified information sharing in  support of homeland security as a high-risk area, and we noted that  establishing an effective two-way exchange of information to help  detect, prevent, and mitigate potential terrorist attacks requires an  extraordinary level of cooperation and perseverance among federal,  state, and local governments and the private sector. However, such  effective communications are not yet in place in support of our  nation\u2019s cybersecurity. Representatives from critical infrastructure  sectors stated that entities within their respective sectors still do not  openly share cybersecurity information with DHS. As we have  reported in the past, much of the concern is that the potential  release of sensitive information could increase the threat to an  entity. In addition, sector representatives stated that when  information is shared, it is not clear whether the information will be  shared with other entities\u2014such as other federal entities, state and  local entities, law enforcement, or various regulators\u2014and how it  will be used or protected from disclosure. Representatives from the  banking and finance sector stated that the protection provided by  the Critical Infrastructure Information Act and the subsequently  established Protected Critical Infrastructure Information Program is  not clear and has not overcome the trust barrier. Sector  representatives have expressed concerns that DHS is not effectively  communicating information to them. According to one  infrastructure representative, DHS has not matched private sector  efforts to share valuable information with a corresponding level of  trusted information sharing. An official from the water sector noted  that when representatives called DHS to inquire about a potential  terrorist threat, they were told that DHS could not share any  information and that they should \u201cwatch the news.\u201d", "Providing value: According to sector representatives, even when  organizations within their sectors have shared information with  NCSD, the entities do not consistently receive useful information in  return. They noted that without a clear benefit, they are unlikely to  pursue further information sharing with DHS. Federal officials also  noted problems in identifying the value that DHS provides.  According to Department of Energy officials, the department does  not always provide analysis or reports based on the information that  agencies provide. Federal and nonfederal officials also stated that  most of US-CERT\u2019s alerts have not been useful because they lack  essential details or are based on already available information.  Further, Treasury officials stated that US-CERT needed to provide  relevant and timely feedback regarding the incidents that are  reported to it.", "Clearly, these challenges are not mutually exclusive. That is,  addressing challenges in organizational stability and authority will  help NCSD build the credibility it needs in order to establish  effective partnerships and achieve two-way information sharing.  Similarly, effective partnerships and ongoing information sharing  with its stakeholders will allow DHS to better demonstrate the value  it can add.", "DHS has identified steps in its strategic plan for cybersecurity that  can begin to address these challenges. Specifically, it has  established goals and plans for improving human capital  management that should help stabilize the organization. Further, the  department has developed plans for communicating with  stakeholders that are intended to increase awareness of its roles and  capabilities and to encourage information sharing. Also, it has  established plans for developing effective partnerships and  improving analytical and watch and warning capabilities that could  help build partnerships and begin to demonstrate added value.  However, until it begins to address these underlying challenges,  DHS cannot achieve significant results in coordinating cybersecurity  activities, and our nation will lack the effective focal point it needs  to better ensure the security of cyberspace for public and private  critical infrastructure systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of GAO Recommendations Should Enhance Cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructures", "paragraphs": ["Over the last several years, we have made a series of  recommendations to enhance the cybersecurity of critical  infrastructures, focusing on the need to (1) develop a strategic  analysis and warning capability for identifying potential  cyberattacks, (2) protect infrastructure control systems, (3) enhance  public/private information sharing, and (4) conduct important threat  and vulnerability assessments and address other challenges to  effective cybersecurity. These recommendations are summarized  below.", "Strategic Analysis and Warnings:  In 2001, we reported on the  analysis and warnings efforts within DHS\u2019s predecessor, the  National Infrastructure Protection Center, and identified several  challenges that were impeding the development of an effective  strategic analysis and warning capability. We reported that a  generally accepted methodology for analyzing strategic cyber-based  threats did not exist. Specifically, there was no standard  terminology, no standard set of factors to consider, and no  established thresholds for determining the sophistication of attack  techniques. We also reported that the Center did not have the  industry-specific data on factors such as critical systems  components, known vulnerabilities, and interdependencies.", "We therefore recommended that the responsible executive-branch  officials and agencies establish a capability for strategic analysis of  computer-based threats, including developing a methodology,  acquiring expertise, and obtaining infrastructure data. However,  officials have taken little action to establish this capability, and  therefore our recommendations remain open today.", "Control Systems: In March 2004, we reported that several  factors\u2014including the adoption of standardized technologies with  known vulnerabilities and the increased connectivity of control  systems to other systems\u2014contributed to an escalation of the risk  of cyber-attacks against control systems. We recommended that  DHS develop and implement a strategy for coordinating with the  private sector and with other government agencies to improve  control system security, including an approach for coordinating the  various ongoing efforts to secure control systems. DHS concurred  with our recommendation and, in December 2004, issued a high- level national strategy for control systems security. This strategy  includes, among other things, goals to create a capability to respond  to attacks on control systems and to mitigate vulnerabilities, bridge  industry and government efforts, and develop control systems  security awareness. However, the strategy does not yet include  underlying details and milestones for completing activities.", "Information Sharing:  In July 2004, we recommended actions to  improve the effectiveness of DHS\u2019s information-sharing efforts. We  recommended that officials within the Information Analysis and  Infrastructure Protection Directorate (1) proceed with and establish  milestones for developing an information-sharing plan and              (2) develop appropriate DHS policies and procedures for interacting  with ISACs, sector coordinators (groups or individuals designated to  represent their respective infrastructure sectors\u2019 CIP activities), and  sector-specific agencies and for coordination and information  sharing within the Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection Directorate and other DHS components. These  recommendations remain open today. Moreover, we recently  designated establishing appropriate and effective information- sharing mechanisms to improve homeland security as a new high- risk area. We reported that the ability to share security-related  information can unify the efforts of federal, state, and local  government agencies and the private sector in preventing or  minimizing terrorist attacks.", "Threat and Vulnerability Assessments and Other Challenges:   Most recently, in May 2005, we reported that while DHS has made  progress in planning and coordinating efforts to enhance  cybersecurity, much more work remains to be done to fulfill its  basic responsibilities\u2014including conducting important threat and  vulnerability assessments and recovery plans. Further, we reported  that DHS faces key challenges in building its credibility as a stable,  authoritative, and capable organization and in leveraging  private/public assets and information in order to clearly  demonstrate the value it can provide. We made recommendations to  strengthen the department\u2019s ability to implement key cybersecurity  responsibilities by prioritizing and completing critical activities and  resolving underlying challenges.", "We recently met with DHS\u2019s acting director for cybersecurity who  told us that DHS agreed with our findings and has initiated plans to  address our recommendations. He acknowledged that DHS has not  adequately leveraged their public and private stakeholders in a  prioritized manner and it plans to begin its prioritized approach by  focusing stakeholders on information sharing, preparedness, and  recovery. He also added that NCSD is attempting to prioritize its  major activities consistent with the secretary\u2019s vision of risk  management and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan  approach.", "In summary, as our nation has become increasingly dependent on  timely, reliable information, it has also become increasingly  vulnerable to attacks on the information infrastructure that supports  the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures (including the energy, banking  and finance, transportation, telecommunications, and drinking  water infrastructures). Federal law and policy acknowledge this by  establishing DHS as the focal point for coordinating cybersecurity  plans and initiatives with other federal agencies, state and local  governments, and private industry. DHS has made progress in  planning and coordinating efforts to enhance cybersecurity, but  much more work remains to be done for the department to fulfill its  basic responsibilities\u2014including conducting important threat and  vulnerability assessments and recovery plans.", "As DHS strives to fulfill its mission, it faces key challenges in  building its credibility as a stable, authoritative, and capable  organization and in leveraging private and public assets and  information in order to clearly demonstrate the value it can provide.  Until it overcomes the many challenges it faces and completes  critical activities, DHS cannot effectively function as the  cybersecurity focal point intended by law and national policy. As  such, there is increased risk that large portions of our national  infrastructure are either unaware of key areas of cybersecurity risks  or unprepared to effectively address cyber emergencies. Over the  last several years, we have made a series of recommendations to  enhance the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures. These include  (1) developing a strategic analysis and warning capability for  identifying potential cyberattacks, (2) protecting infrastructure  control systems, (3) enhancing public/private information sharing,  and (4) conducting important threat and vulnerability assessments  and address other challenges to effective cybersecurity.
