In  mandating this transition, Congress\u2019s intent was to control Medicare costs  by giving hospitals financial incentives to deliver services more efficiently  and reduce unnecessary use of inpatient services by paying hospitals a  predetermined amount. However, for some small rural hospitals, the  Medicare payments they received under the IPPS were not sufficient to  cover their reported costs for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries,  resulting in increased financial distress for these hospitals. In response,  Congress created rural payment designations that, among other things,  can provide hospitals with additional payments on top of what CMS pays  through the IPPS. There are currently five Medicare rural payment  designations.", "One such designation\u2014the Medicare-dependent hospital (MDH)  program\u2014was created in 1989 as a temporary program providing a  financial benefit for eligible hospitals\u2014in general, small, rural hospitals  with large shares of Medicare patients. Congress has extended the  program on several occasions, most recently through 2022. To be  eligible for the MDH program, hospitals must have at least 60 percent of  inpatient days or discharges involving Medicare patients, have 100 or  fewer beds, and be located in a rural area, though hospitals can also be  eligible if they are located in a state without any rural areas and meet  other specified criteria. Some, though not all, MDHs receive additional  payment above what they are paid under the IPPS. CMS determines the  amount of these additional MDH payments using each hospital\u2019s historical  cost data. In fiscal year 2018, CMS estimated that the MDH program paid  approximately $119 million in additional payments to MDHs.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included a provision for us to review  MDH program criteria. This report describes  1.  how the MDH designation differs from the other rural hospital  2.  the extent to which the number of MDHs and other select MDH  metrics have changed over time.", "To describe how the MDH designation differs from the other rural hospital  designations, we reviewed CMS documentation, such as CMS  regulations that specify how payments are to be made under the  designations and which hospitals are eligible to receive them. We also  identified the number of rural hospitals that have each designation. To  identify the universe of rural hospitals, we used the CMS IPPS Impact  File. We then used the Provider Specific File (PSF) to identify the  number of hospitals that had each of the five rural payment designations  and, where possible, calculated the median amounts of additional  payment received under each designation using Medicare Cost Reports  (MCR) in fiscal year 2017\u2014the most recent year for which consistent data  were available at the time of our analysis. We also interviewed relevant  CMS officials and representatives from a non-generalizable set of  stakeholder groups, such as groups that represent hospitals, health care  providers, and beneficiaries. Additionally, we interviewed researchers in  the field of rural health policy.", "To describe changes in the number and selected metrics of MDHs from  fiscal year 2011 through 2017, we calculated the number of MDHs and  the distribution of additional payments for MDHs in each year using CMS  IPPS Impact Files, PSF, and MCR data. Using these data sources, we  then calculated three standard industry financial and operational metrics  for MDHs as compared to all rural hospitals and all hospitals in  aggregate. The first metric is the median proportion of total Medicare  payments\u2014referred to as revenue\u2014the hospitals received from providing  inpatient and outpatient care to Medicare beneficiaries. The second  metric is hospitals\u2019 profit margins\u2014a profitability measure calculated as  the amount of revenue the hospital received minus reported costs,  divided by the amount of revenue received. We calculated profit margins  specific to Medicare revenue and costs (Medicare profit margins) but also  for revenue and costs beyond Medicare (total facility profit margins),  including payments for treating non-Medicare (including privately insured)  patients. We calculated Medicare and total facility profit margins at the  hospital level using hospital-reported costs and revenues from the MCRs, and reported the median margins for each hospital group. Third, we  calculated hospitals\u2019 degree of Medicare dependence using three  separate definitions, or measures, of dependence: (1) the amount of  revenue the hospital received from Medicare as a share of all the revenue  the hospital received for inpatient and outpatient services (total care  revenue), (2) the share of inpatient days of care the hospital provides that  are attributed to Medicare beneficiaries, and (3) the share of inpatient  discharges that are attributed to Medicare beneficiaries. We separately  analyzed data for MDHs that were eligible for the MDH program based on  data from the 1980s. We identified these MDHs using data from Medicare  Administrative Contractors\u2014third party entities that administer Medicare  program payments.", "We also used regression models to estimate the relationship between  MDH program criteria and the three definitions of Medicare dependence  using data from the MCR, PSF, and CMS IPPS Impact Files. We also  separately estimated the relationship between total facility profit margin  (without additional MDH payment) and MDH program criteria. Each model  held certain hospital and market factors constant, including hospital  ownership status, distance to the nearest 100-bed hospital, and  percentage of population 65 and older. We assessed the reliability of  each of the data sets we used for these analyses by interviewing CMS  officials, reviewing related documentation, and performing data checks.  On the basis of these steps, we concluded that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.

If the payment based on the HSR is higher than what the MDH  would have otherwise received under IPPS, the MDH receives an  additional payment. In this case, the MDH additional payment is  calculated as 75 percent of the difference between the HSR and the IPPS  amount. If the IPPS amount were higher than the HSR, the MDH would  receive no additional payment. (See fig. 1.)", "Hospitals with an MDH designation are also eligible to receive other  benefits. For example, MDHs are eligible for a separate additional  payment if the hospital experiences at least a 5 percent decline in  inpatient volume due to circumstances beyond its control.

(For detailed information on the five rural payment  designations, see app. II.)", "Eligibility Criteria. The MDH designation differs from the other  designations in terms of eligibility criteria. As noted earlier, MDHs must  have at least 60 percent of their inpatient days or discharges attributed to  Medicare patients, must be small and, with few exceptions, rural. In  contrast, both the SCH and CAH designations require hospitals to be  remote rural hospitals (i.e., located a specified distance from the nearest  hospital). Similarly, LVAs are generally required to be more than 15  miles from the nearest hospital. Rural hospital designations also differ in  terms of eligibility criteria related to bed size. CAH-designated hospitals  are required to have 25 inpatient beds or fewer, while MDHs must have  100 beds or fewer. RRCs must have at least 275 beds or meet other  criteria, such as serving a high proportion of remote patients, among  other things.", "Financial Benefit. The MDH designation has a relatively small financial  benefit compared to most of the other rural hospital designations, and the  benefit only applies to costs associated with inpatient services. MDHs  generally can only receive 75 percent of the difference between payment  based on their HSR and the payment they would have otherwise received  based on the IPPS rate as an additional payment added to their IPPS rate  payment. In contrast, the SCH and CAH designations have both  inpatient and outpatient payment benefits. Hospitals with an SCH  designation can receive an additional payment added to their IPPS rate  payment equal to 100 percent of the difference between payment based  on the HSR and what the hospital would otherwise receive as payment  based on the IPPS rate, as well as a 7.1 percent addition to their  outpatient payments. The CAH designation results in the highest  financial benefit by generally providing 101 percent of the hospital\u2019s  reported costs in the current year for both inpatient and outpatient  Medicare services. LVAs generally can receive up to 25 percent in  additional payments, and while RRCs receive no direct financial benefit,  they are exempt from certain requirements related to geographic  reclassification (as are SCHs).", "Legislative Permanence. Unlike all but one other rural payment  designation, the MDH program is a temporary program and must be  extended periodically by Congress in order to continue. Historically, the  extension by Congress has sometimes occurred after the program has  expired and as a result there were temporary lapses in payments to MDH  designated hospitals. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included a  provision to extend the MDH program through fiscal year 2022. The only  other designation that must be extended is the LVA designation. In 2010,  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act temporarily expanded the  LVA designation eligibility criteria to include hospitals with a higher  volume of discharges and located closer to other hospitals than in  previous years. These expanded eligibility criteria have been amended  and extended through fiscal year 2022. If Congress does not extend the  expanded eligibility criteria beyond fiscal year 2022, the LVA designation  will return to the narrower eligibility criteria that were in place prior to the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "Relative size and overlap. Of the 2,204 rural hospitals in fiscal year  2017, a relatively small share of these hospitals were MDHs. (See fig.  2.)

Of the five designations, three\u2014CAHs,  MDHs, and SCHs\u2014are exclusive to each other, meaning a hospital can  only have one of the three designations at any time. Hospitals designated  as MDHs and SCHs may also be designated as LVAs, RRCs, or both.  Approximately 75 percent of MDHs and 81 percent of SCHs had at least  one concurrent designation in fiscal year 2017; in contrast, none of the  CAHs received a secondary designation because CAHs are not eligible to  receive other designations.

For example, we previously reported that 16 MDHs closed  between 2013 and 2017. Moreover, our review of Medicare  Administrative Contractor documentation found that some MDHs became  ineligible for the program due to no longer meeting eligibility criteria.

We found that rural hospitals with fewer beds were associated with  higher Medicare shares of inpatient days and discharges, holding all other  factors constant.  This indicates that by targeting smaller, rural hospitals  in its eligibility criteria, the MDH program is targeting hospitals that are  Medicare-dependent defined in terms of inpatient volume. At the same  time, rural hospitals with fewer beds generally received a smaller share of  their total care revenue from Medicare compared with other hospitals.
