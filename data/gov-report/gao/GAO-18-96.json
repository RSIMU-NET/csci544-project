In addition to these companies and to  obtain the perspectives of companies that have different types of licenses  and are in different stages of the licensing process, we also interviewed  representatives from (1) a company that indicated it is working with FAA  on a launch license application, (2) a licensed spaceport, and (3) an  airport in the launch site licensing process. Furthermore, to obtain the  perspective of an industry association that represents a range of  commercial space companies\u2014including commercial spaceflight  developers, operators, and spaceports\u2014we interviewed a representative  from the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, an association representing  the commercial space industry. Within FAA, we interviewed officials in  offices that FAA identified as being involved in commercial space  transportation issues, including the Office of the Administrator, the Office  of Commercial Space Transportation, the Air Traffic Organization, and the  Office of Airports. We also received written answers to our questions from  FAA\u2019s Office of Aviation Safety. To obtain perspectives from the  Department of Transportation (DOT), we interviewed officials from the  Office of the Secretary of Transportation. In addition, we interviewed a  former DOT official who served in a senior position when the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation was transferred to FAA in 1995.  Because there is no formal plan to move the office, stakeholders\u2019  perspectives are based on what they perceive could occur as a result of a  move.

For this prior work, we  developed these key merger and transformation practices by convening a  forum to identify and discuss useful practices and lessons learned from  major private and public sector organizational mergers, acquisitions, and  transformations; interviewing knowledgeable officials; reviewing relevant  literature and agency documentation; and reviewing the status of high risk  issues. To identify key questions that federal agencies should consider  when evaluating whether to consolidate physical infrastructure or  management functions, we reviewed prior GAO work that identified and  reviewed relevant literature on public sector consolidations produced by  academic institutions, professional associations, think tanks, news  outlets, and various other organizations, and reviewed examples of  agency consolidations.

Executive Order 12465  designated DOT as the lead federal agency for enabling private-sector  launch capability. The Office of Commercial Space Transportation and  its responsibilities, which were originally within the Office of the Secretary  of Transportation, were transferred to FAA in 1995.", "The U.S. commercial space launch industry has achieved several  milestones since 1984. For example, in recent years SpaceX, a  commercial space launch company, has successfully tested reusable  elements of expendable launch vehicles and landed them back on land  and on an off-shore landing vessel called a drone ship. In addition, the  industry is changing with the emergence of some suborbital launch  vehicles that are capable of being launched into space more than once  and can enable space tourism. For example, Blue Origin has  successfully launched and landed the vehicle it intends to use in the  future for space tourism. By adding an expendable upper stage,  suborbital vehicles can also be used to transport small satellites to orbit.  Furthermore, although licensed launches historically took place at federal  launch sites such as Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, launch  sites now can be private spaceports or FAA-licensed launch sites. One  launch site is co-located at an airport that has scheduled commercial  airline flights and other spaceports are used for general aviation. As of  August 2017, there were 10 licensed launch sites in the United States.", "The Office of Commercial Space Transportation works with other FAA  lines of business such as:  the Air Traffic Organization on integrating licensed launches and  permitted activities in the national airspace,  the Office of Airports regarding airports that seek to be or already are  licensed launch sites, and  the Office of Aviation Safety on launch vehicles that follow aircraft  rules and can be used for commercial space activities.", "In fiscal year 2017, the Office of Commercial Space Transportation had  104 full-time equivalent positions and an operations budget of $19.8  million\u2014an increase of 20 full-time equivalent positions and $2 million  over fiscal year 2016. FAA has a staff of over 40,000 people and a budget  of $16.4 billion in fiscal year 2017. According to the Office of Commercial  Space Transportation, its workload has increased significantly in recent  years, particularly regarding pre-application consultations for launch and  launch site licenses.", "The Office of the Secretary of Transportation has offices that are  responsible for policy, legal, and government affairs among other issues.", "In 1987, the House Appropriations Committee recommended that DOT  perform a comprehensive organization and management study of the  Office of Commercial Space Transportation with the objectives of  eliminating duplication of activities carried out by offices within the Office  of the Secretary and DOT modal administrations, and determining  potential areas for streamlining operations. In 1991, DOT asked the  National Academy of Public Administration to analyze and evaluate the  key organizational and management issues facing the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation which at that time was located in the  Office of the Secretary of Transportation. The report considered  organizational options for the office including establishing an independent  regulatory office, merging the office into an existing operating  administration such as FAA, transferring this office to bureau status in  DOT, or creating a new operating administration in DOT. According to the  report, three of the study\u2019s five panel members stated that they believed  that the office should be removed from the Office of the Secretary of  Transportation and established as an operating administration because  its mission was inconsistent with the broad and cross-cutting  organizations within the Secretary\u2019s Office that are focused on policy,  budget, and administrative issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Cited Various Perspectives on Moving the Office of Commercial Space Transportation", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from the commercial space launch companies and  spaceports we spoke to described both potential advantages and  disadvantages of moving the office, but most of them favored moving the  office.

Representatives from a commercial space launch  company also said that rather than working with various FAA offices, they  would like there to be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for commercial space launch  issues and a senior official in the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation indicated the office\u2019s original purpose was to fulfill that  role. Some company representatives further explained that although  they generally work with the Office of Commercial Space Transportation  on licensing issues and with the Air Traffic Organization on airspace  access, in some cases, the lines of responsibility between the two offices  are not clearly defined. Furthermore, a spaceport official said that in  addition to working with the Office of Commercial Space Transportation  he also needs to work with FAA\u2019s Office of Airports, which reviews the  effects of spaceports on airports, among other responsibilities.", "In discussing these issues with the senior official involved in the Air Traffic  Organization\u2019s emerging technologies integration efforts, the official said  that although there is overlap and a need for more communication  between the Office of Commercial Space Transportation and the Air  Traffic Organization, coordination between the two offices is improving.  He also said that later this year or early next year, FAA plans to start an  aviation rulemaking advisory committee that will help to determine  airspace access priorities for all national airspace users. Similarly, an  official from the Office of Airports said the office is developing standard  operating procedures and a memorandum of understanding with the  Office of Commercial Space Transportation to resolve issues. A  spaceport official who has been working on a launch site operator\u2019s  license application for several years confirmed that coordination among  various FAA offices on commercial space launch issues has significantly  improved during the last 6 months.", "Furthermore, several FAA senior officials said that moving the office could  make it more difficult for FAA offices to coordinate on commercial space  activities. For example, a senior official involved in the Air Traffic  Organization\u2019s emerging technologies integration efforts said that  although such a move may increase the visibility of the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation, it would not necessarily improve  airspace integration. In addition, written responses to our questions from  the Office of Aviation Safety indicated that their ability to interact with the  Office of Commercial Space Transportation at an internal agency level  may be less cumbersome than having to go through the additional  communication protocols at the level of the Office of the Secretary of  Transportation. Similarly, officials from the Office of Airports indicated that  coordinating airspace review is an inherently FAA function that uses the  experience and knowledge of subject matter experts located within the  FAA, and that moving the commercial space office to the Office of the  Secretary of Transportation could affect the efficiency of these reviews.  Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation also said that  even if the commercial space transportation office were moved to their  office, they would still need to work with FAA on airspace access issues  and that they would not necessarily favor the industry regarding airspace  issues.", "Moreover, FAA officials we interviewed said they are working on  improving commercial space coordination through various working  groups, particularly through the Commercial Space Transportation  Executive Working Group that was formed earlier this year to coordinate  on commercial space issues. This group is chaired by the official directing  commercial space integration in the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation and is comprised of executives from across the agency,  including the Air Traffic Organization, the Office of Airports, and the Office  of Aviation Safety. According to the group\u2019s chairman, this group was  formed to formalize coordination on commercial space launch issues  across the agency because there was confusion among commercial  space stakeholders and across the agency, and commercial space  launch companies were hearing different things from different FAA lines  of business. The group\u2019s chairman said that the Executive Working Group  reports to FAA\u2019s New Entrants Board, a group formed to provide status  updates on activities and events as well as decide how to move forward  on specific initiatives associated with new entrants to the airspace such  as drones and commercial space launch vehicles and is comprised of the  principal leaders of FAA lines of business working on these issues. An  FAA senior official told us that he believes commercial space coordination  issues will be resolved as launches become more routine. In addition, the  Air Traffic Organization has formed an Emerging Technologies Integration  Office to focus on integrating commercial space operations and  unmanned aircraft system activities within the national airspace system. A  senior official in that office said that for decades, the Air Traffic  Organization was focused on airplanes and that any deviation in airplane  flow was viewed as an impediment, but that his office\u2019s goal is to shift the  understanding within the organization from an airplane-only focus to the  idea that several types of vehicles can use the national airspace system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Operations", "paragraphs": ["A representative from one commercial space launch company said that  an advantage of moving the Office of Commercial Space Transportation  and thereby making space transportation its own mode, is that it could  facilitate a more \u201clevel playing field\u201d for space activities operating in and  through the national airspace system. The representative noted that the  Air Traffic Organization is a much larger office than the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation and is focused on aviation safety  which is regulated differently than space activities. As a result, the  representative said that companies perceive an unequal playing field  between these two offices and the risk of negative effects if aviation  standards are imposed on space, including airspace closures during  launch and reentry. According to the representative, because of the Air  Traffic Organization\u2019s lack of familiarity with space launch operations and  the mechanics of placing a spacecraft into orbit or on a trajectory to  another celestial body, the office has suggested launch times be limited to  certain times of day and certain days of the month as dictated by the  amount of air traffic. The representative said that the Air Traffic  Organization\u2019s proposed approach is \u201cuntenable\u201d for commercial space  launches because launch times are dictated by orbital mechanics and  that the Air Traffic Organization has imposed airspace restrictions during  the holidays that have required launches to be rescheduled. A  representative from another commercial space launch company said that  an unequal playing field between these two offices results in the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation not having the practical authority  commensurate with its responsibility. According to this representative, the  impact of this mismatch results in confusion over authority and negatively  affects when commercial space companies are able to launch as well as  excessive time and volume of airspace closed during a launch. A  representative from a third company said that there are multiple variables  to consider about moving the office. The representative said that while  moving the Office of Commercial Space Transportation to the Office of  the Secretary of Transportation would provide it with much more visibility,  the office may still be at a disadvantage when it disagrees with larger  offices in the FAA. In addition, the representative said that most launch  companies would still have to work with FAA on air traffic control issues  as well as hybrid vehicles and experimental aircraft licenses. Moreover,  a representative from the Commercial Spaceflight Federation said that  although the association does not have a consensus position on moving  the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, its members are  concerned that the Air Traffic Organization is attempting to treat the  rapidly developing area of commercial space similarly to how it treats the  mature commercial aviation industry.", "In response to these comments, an Air Traffic Organization official told us  that the airspace is restricted to commercial space launches for about 15  days per year during the holidays because a launch can affect hundreds  of flights and that they prefer that launches occur when there are fewer effects on the national airspace system, for example, at night. However,  an official said that the Air Traffic Organization has only denied one  launch request over the last 5 years. An Air Traffic Organization official  also said that they do not regulate the commercial space launch industry  and focus on providing safe access to the airspace by all users of the  national airspace system. In addition, an official involved with commercial  space integration in the Office of Commercial Space Transportation and a  spaceport representative told us they expect that technology will allow for  more efficient use of the national airspace in the future by reducing the  amount of time that the airspace will need to be shut down for launches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Some stakeholders said that moving the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation could help accelerate the pace of updating regulations to  reflect new technology, which they said was proceeding too slowly. A  senior official in the Office of Commercial Space Transportation said that  instead of competing with other FAA offices for rulemaking approval  within the agency, moving the Office of Commercial Space Transportation  to the Office of the Secretary might give the commercial space office a  higher priority with regard to rulemaking. However, officials from the  Office of the Secretary of Transportation also said that the regulatory  rulemakings are not allocated by office but are set according to the  priorities of each administration, so moving the office would not  necessarily affect regulatory reform efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resources", "paragraphs": ["According to some stakeholders and a senior official in the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation, moving the office out of FAA could  give commercial space launch issues a higher profile and more resources  because FAA is focused on aviation as opposed to commercial space.  One stakeholder also said moving the office out of FAA would make the  office a priority as an independent organization within DOT. Furthermore,  a senior official in the Office of Commercial Space Transportation said  that the office has reached the limits of what it can accomplish with  existing resources, policies, and authorities, and that moving the office  could enable industry growth. In addition, a company representative  said that the primary possible advantage of moving the office would be to  have an Assistant Secretary for Commercial Space Transportation who  would be in a leadership position to represent the growing industry  directly to the Secretary of Transportation. However, officials from the  Office of the Secretary of Transportation said that it is uncertain whether  the Office of Commercial Space Transportation would receive more  resources if it were moved to the Secretary\u2019s office.

In addition, a senior FAA official said  that it would make sense to move the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation\u2019s promotion duties out of FAA because of an inherent  conflict with the office being both a promoter and a regulator. Officials  from the Office of the Secretary said transferring the policy and promotion  aspects of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation\u2019s work to the  Secretary\u2019s office, but not the launch licensing responsibilities, is one of  various options regarding the office but that they have not advanced a  specific proposal. A senior official in the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation said there is no specific office within the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation that promotes the industry and that the  office\u2019s promotional functions are part of its overall responsibilities, so  moving only the promotional responsibilities would not be feasible.", "A former DOT official who served in a senior position when the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation was transferred to FAA in 1995 noted  that one reason the office was moved was because of the belief that the  Office of the Secretary of Transportation should not be involved in  programmatic activities that belong in the operating agencies. However,  in 2014, Congress moved a programmatic office, the Research and  Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), to the Office of the  Secretary of Transportation. This former DOT official also said that the  Office of Commercial Space Transportation would benefit from the  technological and engineering support available within FAA.", "Finally, representatives from commercial space launch companies and an  FAA official had different perspectives on whether the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation would or should be its own modal  agency within DOT or part of the Office of the Secretary of  Transportation. For example, a company representative who favored  moving the office said that commercial space could easily be considered  its own transportation mode and not as part of aviation. Another  company\u2019s representative expected that the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, if it were moved out of FAA, would start out as its own  modal agency. A third stakeholder suggested that eventually space  transportation will become its own independent mode of transportation  such as air, sea, rail, and roads and that moving the Office of Commercial  Space Transportation out of the FAA is an inevitable first step in that  direction. A senior official from the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation said that moving the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation would be a step toward considering commercial space  transportation as a mode similar to rail or highway transportation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Steps Can Be Taken through DOT\u2019s Rulemaking Process to Move the Office of Commercial Space Transportation", "paragraphs": ["All or part of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation can be  transferred back to the Secretary\u2019s office through a rulemaking process  as was used in 1995 to amend the existing DOT delegation regulation.

We have  previously found that implementing large-scale change management  initiatives, such as mergers and organizational transformations, are not  simple endeavors and require the concentrated efforts of both leadership  and employees to realize intended synergies and to accomplish new  organizational goals. We have found that mergers and transformations  that incorporate strategic human capital management approaches will  help to sustain agency efforts and improve the efficiency, effectiveness,  and accountability of the federal government. These key merger and  transformation practices include focusing on a key set of principles and  priorities at the outset of the transformation, setting implementation goals  and a timeline to build momentum and show progress, and establishing a  communication plan. Questions to consider when evaluating  consolidation proposals include (1) What are the goals of the  consolidation? and (2) What will be the likely costs and benefits of the  consolidation?", "Based on these key practices and considerations, DOT and FAA, for  example, would need to determine the purpose of moving the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation and the costs and benefits of such a  move. Furthermore, to ensure employee and management support, DOT  and FAA would need to obtain the buy-in of various FAA offices involved  in commercial space launch issues such as the Air Traffic Organization.  In addition, to assess the costs of the transformation, DOT and FAA  would need to determine the costs of any additional support that would be  needed by moving to the Office of the Secretary such as legal and  administrative support. Moreover, DOT could consider the risk of  unintended consequences of moving the office such as incurring  additional costs. In addition, a spaceport representative told us that he is  more concerned about the execution of moving the office than its  placement. The representative said that although conceptually moving the  office to the Office of the Secretary of Transportation could bring it more  visibility and resources, the move would be futile if it is executed poorly.  Therefore, if a decision were made to move the office, an implementation  plan would be needed, consistent with our key mergers and  transformation practices. Implementing a large-scale organizational  transformation requires the concentrated efforts of both leadership and  employees to accomplish new organizational goals. Agencies should  have an implementation plan that includes essential change-management practices such as active, engaged  leadership of executives at the highest possible levels; a dedicated implementation team that can be held accountable for a strategy for capturing best practices, measuring progress toward the  established goals of the consolidation, retaining key talent, and  assessing and mitigating risk, among others.", "Table 1 of appendix I lists the key practices and implementation steps  that we have previously identified for mergers and organizational  transformations.
