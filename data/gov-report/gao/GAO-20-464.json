These representatives may review small business subcontracting plans and provide recommendations for improving small business participation. When an agency is awarding a contract that includes a subcontracting plan, contracting officers are required to notify these representatives of the opportunity to review the proposed contract. Without taking steps to ensure these opportunities are provided, agencies may not receive and benefit from suggestions for increasing small business participation.", "For 14 of the 26 contracts, contracting officers did not ensure contractors submitted required subcontracting reports. After a contract is awarded, contracting officers must review reports contractors submit that describe their progress towards meeting approved small business subcontracting goals. In some cases, contracting officers accepted reports with subcontracting goals different from those in the approved subcontracting plans, with no documentation explaining the difference. Without complete and accurate information about a contractor's subcontracting goals, an agency cannot adequately assess a contractor's performance in meeting its subcontracting plan responsibilities.", "The Small Business Administration (SBA) encourages agency compliance with small business subcontracting plan requirements by providing training to contracting officers and contractors, and by conducting reviews. For instance, SBA Commercial Market Representatives conduct compliance reviews to evaluate a large prime contractor's compliance with subcontracting program procedures and goal achievement. However, SBA could not provide documentation or information on almost all compliance reviews conducted in fiscal years 2016\u20132018. SBA has developed new procedures for conducting compliance reviews, but as of mid-March 2020, had yet to fully implement them. SBA has conducted fiscal year 2019 compliance reviews that reflect a first phase of their new procedures. SBA has draft guidance on the new compliance review process, including some specific information regarding what Commercial Market Representatives are to record as part of the compliance review. SBA has begun to conduct compliance reviews in accordance with the guidance, but does not have clearly documented and maintained records for the first phase of these reviews. Without consistent, clear documentation and records that will be maintained going forward, SBA's ability to track contractor compliance and agency oversight efforts will be limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 10 recommendations for ensuring procedures for PCR reviews are followed, contractor subcontracting reports are monitored and reviewed for accuracy, and SBA compliance reviews are clearly documented and maintained.

Specifically, all nine contracts lacked  explanations of the discrepancies in the ISR or other documentation we  reviewed. We discuss the nine contracts in more detail below:", "NASA: Contracting officers accepted multiple ISRs with errors or  unexplained conflicting information for three NASA contracts. In one  of the three contracts, awarded in fiscal year 2017 for $3.8 million, the  contractor combined small business subcontracting goals (listed as  whole dollars and percent of total subcontracting dollars) from two  different subcontracting plans associated with the contract into one  ISR. However, the dollar amount reported in the ISR as the  subcontracting goal\u2014about $177,000\u2014reflected the small business  goal from only one of the subcontracting plans, rather than the two  subcontracting plans, which would have been a total of about  $309,000. As a result, the actual percentage of subcontracting to  small businesses of total subcontracting and of the total amount of the  contract value was incorrect. In the second contract, awarded in 2016  for $4.6 million with a planned small business subcontracting total of  about $2 million, the contractor listed an overall small business  subcontracting goal different from the approved subcontracting goal in  three ISRs, and there was no documentation explaining the  difference. For the third contract, awarded in fiscal year 2016 for  $45.2 million with a planned small business subcontracting goal of 10  percent of total subcontracting dollars, the contractor listed this goal  incorrectly in two ISRs. According to a NASA official, at the time of our  review, the contracting officer was working with the contractor to  correct the error.", "DLA: For one contract awarded in 2017 for $34.1 million with a  planned subcontracting total of about $11 million, a DLA contracting  officer accepted a September 2019 ISR that listed the small business  goal at 90 percent of the total subcontracting dollars for the contract  instead of the 87.4 percent (base) or 87.6 percent (option years) in the  contract addendum. The actual cumulative subcontracting percentage  reported in the ISR was 88.1 percent, which met the goal in the  addendum, but not the 90 percent goal in the accepted September  2019 ISR. We could not identify any information in the ISR explaining  the conflicting information. Additionally, when calculating the amount  of cumulative dollars awarded to small business concerns, the  contractor appeared to have excluded about $54,000 in  subcontracting, which was included in a separate line item in the ISR  for women-owned small business concerns. As a result, we were  unable to determine whether this contractor had been meeting its  small business goal. For a second contract also awarded in 2017 for  $74.9 million with a planned subcontracting total of about $23 million,  the contractor reported the approved small business goal of 96  percent of total subcontracting dollars in the March 2018 and  September 2018 reports. However, in March 2019 and September  2019 ISR submissions for this contract, the contractor reported a  small business goal of 98.5 percent and 74.8 percent, respectively.  We found no documentation explaining why the contractor reported  goals in the 2019 ISRs that were different from the approved 96  percent goal.", "Navy: For one Navy contract, which was awarded for $13.5 million in  fiscal year 2018 with a planned subcontracting total of $2.7 million, the  contracting officer notified the contractor in the September 2018 and  March 2019 ISRs that the small disadvantaged business goal of 0  percent of total subcontracting dollars in these submissions did not  match the 25 percent goal in the approved subcontracting plan. The  contractor corrected the error and the contracting officer accepted the  revised reports. In the September 2019 submission, the contractor  once again reported that particular goal as 0 percent, but the  contracting officer did not note the recurring error in this submission.  For another contract, awarded for $16.6 million in fiscal year 2016  with a planned subcontracting total of about $5.9 million, the March  2016 ISR listed a small business goal of 693 percent (the goal in the  approved subcontracting plan was 69.3 percent) of total  subcontracting dollars. The contracting officer did not address the  incorrect percentage. Moreover, in the September 2016 submission,  the goal was reduced to 61.8 percent, which was less than the goal in  the approved subcontracting plan. There was no explanation for the  discrepancies in either submission.", "GSA: For one GSA Public Building Service contract, which was  awarded in fiscal year 2018 for $7.5 million, we found discrepancies  between the goals listed in multiple accepted ISRs and the approved  subcontracting plan. This contract involved janitorial services  performed at two locations. Each location had a different approved  small business goal\u201496 percent and 87 percent of total  subcontracting dollars. However, the contractor reported only one  small business goal in the three ISRs submitted for September 2018,  March 2019, and September 2019, and this reported goal varied from  89 to 97 percent in the three ISRs. According to a GSA official, the  contractor submitted one ISR in each reporting period to convey the  combined progress toward meeting its subcontracting goals for both  locations, but the small business goal the contractor reported in each  ISR did not accurately reflect the combined goals for both locations.  The GSA official told us the combined goal the contractor should have  reported for this contract was about 91 percent. According to the GSA  official, these submissions contained data entry errors by the  contractor, perhaps due to the contractor not knowing how to properly  report its subcontracting data. For one GSA Federal Acquisition  Service contract awarded in fiscal year 2017 for $3.6 million, we found  a discrepancy between the small business goal reported in multiple  ISR submissions\u20145 percent of total subcontracting dollars\u2014and the  25 percent goal of total subcontracting dollars in the approved  subcontracting plan, and we notified the agency of the discrepancy.

However, based on our review of the  limited documentation provided, SBA lacks specific guidance in its SOP  on how CMRs should maintain information for compliance reviews they  conduct. SBA has draft guidance on the new compliance review process,  including some specific information regarding what CMRs are to record  as part of the compliance review. However, SBA does not have clearly  documented and maintained records on the first phase of these  compliance reviews."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Requirements for small business subcontracting plans in certain contracts  enhance opportunities for small businesses to participate in federal  contracting. However, weaknesses in selected agencies\u2019 oversight of  subcontracting plans\u2014such as not following all procedures and not  reviewing contractor submissions for errors or omissions\u2014can reduce  those opportunities and limit agencies\u2019 knowledge about the extent to  which contractors fulfill obligations to small businesses. The frequency  with which issues arose in our sample suggests agencies can do more to  improve oversight. For contracts we reviewed which used checklists or  memorandums to document the PCR review process, we found that  those contracts generally demonstrated compliance with the requirement  for the opportunity for a PCR review. Taking steps to ensure that  contracting officers provide PCRs the opportunity to review contracts with  subcontracting plans would help agencies identify subcontracting  opportunities and benefit from suggestions for increasing small business  participation. In turn, such efforts could help agencies achieve their small  business subcontracting goals.", "Similarly, improved monitoring of submitted contractor reports on  subcontracting activities would identify errors in the submissions and  increase agencies\u2019 ability to assess contractor performance. Without  complete and accurate information on a contractor\u2019s subcontracting  goals, agencies cannot adequately assess a contractor\u2019s performance in  meeting its subcontracting plan responsibilities. Given the many  responsibilities of contracting officers, steps to ensure that contractor  report submissions on meeting subcontracting goals are accurate would  assist agencies\u2019 oversight efforts.", "SBA also has opportunities to significantly enhance oversight related to  its subcontracting program. It lacks documentation for almost all  compliance reviews conducted in three of the four fiscal years from 2016  through 2019, has not fully implemented revisions to the compliance  review process, and has not yet developed procedures for ensuring clear  and consistent records of all compliance reviews are documented and  maintained. By having clear and consistent documentation for compliance  reviews and maintaining those records, SBA would better position itself to  track contractor compliance for contracts it reviews and would be able to  use this information to inform subsequent reviews. Additionally,  contracting agencies would be able to leverage the information from SBA  for their own reviews of contractor performance and subcontracting plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Agency Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of 10 recommendations to five agencies (three to  DLA, one to GSA, two to NASA, three to Navy, and one to SBA):  The Director of DLA should include a step for the opportunity for PCR  review of the proposed contract and subcontracting plan in agency  procedures and memorandums, and develop a mechanism for  documenting whether the opportunity for PCR review was provided.

We also reviewed  requirements for contractor submissions on subcontracting activity related  to subcontracting plans, and corresponding agency oversight  requirements for the submissions. We reviewed documentation on  agency training for contracting officers related to subcontracting plans  and requirements. We judgmentally selected two military agencies\u2014the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the Department of the Navy  (Navy)\u2014and two civilian agencies\u2014the General Services Administration  (GSA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014 to review based on our analysis of Federal Procurement Data System- Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data and other factors. More specifically,  we selected the agencies because they (1) included a mix of military and  civilian agencies, (2) had relatively high dollar amounts of federal  contracts awarded in fiscal years 2016\u20132018, and (3) included a range of  performance related to subcontracting based on SBA\u2019s annual  procurement scorecard.", "We also reviewed documentation for a nongeneralizable sample of 32  contracts\u2014eight per agency\u2014awarded in fiscal years 2016\u20132018 across  the four agencies. We randomly selected these 32 contracts from a set of  contracts that met several criteria. Specifically, the criteria were contracts  with dollar amounts above $1.5 million, that had a mix of subcontracting  plans (individual, commercial, and comprehensive) or reasons for not  including subcontracting plans in a contract (such as no subcontracting  possibilities for the contract or the contract not requiring a subcontracting  plan), and a mix of their current status at the time of our selection  (completed or active). We selected contracts as follows:", "We first randomly selected six contracts per agency (total of 24) that  had a small business subcontracting plan at the time of award. To do  this, we used a random number generator for the universe of  contracts meeting the above criteria and selected contracts in the  order of the random number generator, but skipped a contract if it was  too similar to already-selected contracts (for example, same type of  subcontracting plan or similar dollar amount).", "We then selected another set of contracts\u2014two per agency (total of  eight)\u2014that seemed to meet criteria for requiring small business  subcontracting plans, such as exceeding the dollar threshold, but  were coded in FPDS-NG as not having a plan in place.", "We also obtained reports on contractor submissions on small business  subcontracting activity, where applicable, and agency reviews of the  submissions from the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System  (eSRS). Specifically, we searched eSRS for any contractor-submitted  individual subcontracting reports (ISR) or summary subcontract reports  (SSR), where applicable, for each contract with a subcontracting plan and  reviewed the reports along with agency contracting officer comments,  approvals, or rejections related to the reports. If we were unable to locate  any ISRs or SSRs in eSRS, we asked the procuring agency to provide  copies of the reports. We also requested agency documentation for any  actions contracting officers took, if applicable, for each contract where the  contractor had not met the small business subcontracting goal. We also  interviewed officials from each agency about their efforts related to  oversight of small business subcontracting plans and these contractor  submissions.", "We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by reviewing available  documentation and prior GAO data reliability assessments and by  electronically testing for missing data, outliers, and inconsistent coding.  We found the data to be reliable for the purposes of selecting agencies  and contracts to review.

We  found the information in eSRS to be reliable for purposes of assessing the  extent to which agencies conduct oversight related to contractor  submission reports in the system.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed documentation on several  types of SBA reviews, including compliance reviews, related to contractor  compliance with and agencies\u2019 oversight of subcontracting plans.  Specifically, we reviewed documentation on reviews SBA conducted  related to its subcontracting program during fiscal years 2016\u20132019. We  also reviewed SBA\u2019s standard operating procedures for the  subcontracting program, documentation on processes implementing the  new procedures, and documentation on SBA training programs for the  small business subcontracting program.
