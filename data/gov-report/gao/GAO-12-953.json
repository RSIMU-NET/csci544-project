To assist trade-displaced workers, Labor administers the TAA for Workers program, which provides income support, job training, and other benefits. The Trade Globalization and Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, made substantial changes to the TAA program, such as extending eligibility to workers in the service sector and increasing benefits levels. The Act also required GAO to report on the operation and effectiveness of those changes. Specifically, GAO examined (1) the challenges Labor faced in implementing the 2009 legislation, (2) selected state officials' assessment of the 2009 legislation's effect on participants and state and local administrators, and (3) the extent to which participants received program benefits and services established by the 2009 legislation and achieved employment outcomes. GAO interviewed officials at Labor and in six states, selected for having a high level of TAA activity and geographic diversity. GAO also reviewed Labor's internal controls for investigating petitions, which are filed on behalf of workers and are the starting point for determining their TAA eligibility. GAO analyzed participant data on specific benefits and services received and employment outcomes, as available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor (Labor) was challenged to process the substantial increase in petitions filed for the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers program after related legislation was enacted in 2009. Labor initially had insufficient capacity to handle this increased workload, leading to processing delays and data recording errors. For example, in the quarter after the 2009 legislation took effect, Labor took an average of 153 days to process a petition\u2014nearly four times the statutory limit. Labor responded with corrective action, including hiring new staff and adding additional quality control steps for processing petitions. Partly as a result of these efforts, processing times fell substantially. Moreover, GAO found that Labor's petition investigation process, as of June 2012, generally conformed to best practices for internal controls.", "According to selected state officials, virtually all of the 2009 changes benefited participants, and some also helped administrators serve participants. Officials in all six states GAO interviewed expressed the view that both participants and administrators benefited from the simplified and extended training enrollment deadline. Some officials said the new deadline was easier for eligible workers to understand and provided administrators with more time to advise participants on their training and employment options. Moreover, officials said participants who enrolled in training benefited from other program changes, including increased training funds, the option to attend training part-time, and a longer period for income support. Some state officials said that the additional weeks of income support allowed participants to consider longer-term training options, such as health care programs.", "Over 107,000 participants received benefits and services as established by the 2009 law, but little is yet known about their employment outcomes. Nationally, all the participants received case management and reemployment services and about half enrolled in training, most commonly occupational skills training. Less than 8 percent of participants used other benefits. Little is known about employment outcomes because nearly two-thirds of the participants were still enrolled as of September 30, 2011, and employment and earnings information was often not available for those who had exited the program. While this information will eventually be available, other factors, including the overall state of the economy, affect these outcomes so isolating the effects of the 2009 legislative changes would be difficult."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

The U.S. manufacturing sector was particularly  hard hit by the recession, losing 17 percent of its workforce and reaching  its lowest employment level since 1941. Further, while international trade  has benefited Americans in a number of ways, it has also contributed to  layoffs in a range of industries. Since such trade-displaced workers tend  to be older, less-educated, and have fewer transferable skills than other  displaced workers, they often have difficulty finding jobs in other  industries without additional training.", "The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers program, which is  administered by the Department of Labor (Labor), is the nation\u2019s primary  program assisting workers who have been adversely affected by  international trade, providing income support, job training, and other  benefits. Since the TAA program was first established at Labor by the Trade Act of 1974, it has been amended a number of times. In August  2002, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002 added  several new benefits to the program. In February of 2009, the program  was reauthorized and substantially amended and expanded by the Trade  and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009, which was a part of  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The legislation changed  a number of program elements, such as expanding eligibility to additional  types of workers, extending the benefit period of income support,  increasing the level of assistance provided for payment for qualified  health plan premiums, and more than doubling the amount of training  funding available. To accommodate both the cost of these program  enhancements and higher program demand driven by the recession,  Congress increased the overall funding level for the program by about  $859 million, bringing funding to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2010.", "Although these changes were set to expire on December 31, 2010, the  Omnibus Trade Act of 2010 generally extended them through February  12, 2011. ,  After that date, the program reverted to the pre-expansion  provisions until October 21, 2011, when the Trade Adjustment Assistance  Extension Act of 2011 was signed into law. This law reauthorized TAA  and reinstated most of the 2009 program provisions, such as the eligibility  for service sector workers. However, some benefit levels, such as the  level of assistance provided for paying for health plan premiums, were  reduced. The expanded provisions of the 2011 law are set to expire on  December 31, 2013.", "The 2009 Act mandated that GAO report on the operation and  effectiveness of the changes made by that Act no later than the end of  fiscal year 2012.

What effect do selected state government officials say the 2009  legislative changes had on participants and on state and local  administrators?  3.  To what extent have participants received TAA benefits and services  as established by the 2009 legislation and what is known about their  employment outcomes?", "To answer the first question, we interviewed officials at Labor to learn  how the agency was affected by the legislative changes, such as the  expanded eligibility criteria. We analyzed available data on TAA petitions,  which are submitted to Labor on behalf of a group of workers for Labor\u2019s  determination of the workers\u2019 eligibility to potentially receive TAA benefits.  We also compared determination data for a nongeneralizable number of  TAA petitions with determination letters published by Labor. In addition,  we reviewed the internal controls for the petition investigation process.  We also conducted an on-site review of seven case files. For the second  question, we interviewed state government officials from six states:  Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and  Texas. These states were selected because they had a high fiscal year  2010 training fund allocation, a high volume of TAA certifications, and  geographic diversity. We also spoke with select local government officials  in three of these states (Michigan, North Carolina, and Oregon). Through  these interviews, we learned how selected state and local officials viewed  key amendments\u2019 effects on participants and on their administration of the  program.

Previously, the deadline for enrolling in training was  the later of 8 weeks after TAA certification or 16 weeks after  separation from employment.

Participants enrolled in full-time training  who have exhausted their unemployment insurance may receive a  continuation of income support equal to their final unemployment  insurance benefit. The 2009 legislation provided that participants may  receive up to 130 weeks of income support, up from 104 weeks under  the prior law. For participants who require remedial or prerequisite  courses, the maximum level of income support increased from 130 to  156 weeks. Income support was extended in part to enable workers to  participate in longer training programs.", "Training. Under the 2009 program, participants have additional  training opportunities beyond those that were available under the  2002 program.

The 2009 legislation increased the income  eligibility threshold and maximum wage supplement benefit for some  older workers. TAA participants 50 years or older who secure a new,  lower paying job than their previous trade-impacted job may be  eligible to receive wage supplements. The 2009 legislation  eliminated the requirement that such workers find employment within  26 weeks of being laid off. It also allowed older workers receiving the  wage supplement to participate in full-time training if employed at  least 20 hours per week. Workers employed on a full-time basis who  were not enrolled in training maintained their eligibility for wage  supplements.", "Job search and relocation allowances.

As  depicted in figure 2, the number of petitions the agency received in the  third quarter of fiscal year 2009, when the law took effect in May 2009,  was more than triple the number received the previous quarter. Multiple  factors contributed to this increase. According to agency officials, the  increase in petitions was caused by the 2009 legislation\u2019s expansion of  eligibility to new categories of workers as well as the economic recession,  which may have increased trade-related layoffs. Another cause for the  spike in petitions is that in the months before the law took effect, Labor  allowed petitioners to withdraw and then resubmit petitions after the 2009  legislation took effect, so they could take advantage of the new,  enhanced benefit levels. As a result, an agency official estimated that  roughly 500 petitions were withdrawn before May 18, 2009, and then  resubmitted after the law took effect.", "According to Labor officials, the 2009 legislation generally made it more  challenging to determine TAA eligibility. As described earlier, the law  expanded the number of categories for which petitions could be certified.  Agency officials told us that this expansion complicated investigators\u2019  efforts because petitions needed to be evaluated against a greater  number of eligibility criteria than before. Further, some of the new  categories presented additional challenges. According to Labor officials,  the firms identified in service-related petitions tended to be more  dispersed geographically than manufacturing firms, making it more  difficult to evaluate certain service-related petitions. For example, in  cases where the work that was shifted abroad was performed by workers  in multiple locations, it may be difficult to determine exactly which workers  had been affected. In addition, some officials said that investigating  petitions in which workers produce finished articles that contain foreign  components, such as tubes used in televisions, proved challenging. Labor  said these petitions often require contact with foreign firms, which can  present communication challenges\u2014for example, due to differences in  currencies and time zones. Further, they noted the absence of any legal  requirement for foreign companies to comply with Labor\u2019s data requests.  In contrast to these challenges, Labor officials told us that the 2009  legislation made some investigations easier. Previously, TAA eligibility  standards were different for nations that did and did not have a free trade  agreement or preferential trade relationship with the United States. The  2009 legislation eliminated this difference, making it more straightforward  to investigate shifts in production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor\u2019s Processing Timeliness Adversely Affected by Increased Petition Volume and Initial Staff Shortage", "paragraphs": ["Labor initially had insufficient capacity to handle its increased workload,  and thus, lagged in processing petitions.

The quarter after the 2009 legislation took effect,  on average, Labor took 153 days to process a petition\u2014nearly four times  as long as the statutory limit (see fig. 3). Multiple factors contributed to the  lag, including an increased volume of petitions, initial staff shortages and  turnover, and the need for staff to become familiar with the new  provisions of the 2009 legislation. An official noted that initially, hiring  proved challenging because the 2009 legislation did not authorize funds  for implementation. As a result, Labor paid for new hires through the  agency\u2019s general management funds. Most new staff members were  hired in July 2009, approximately 2 months after the law took effect.", "During our review of TAA data and petition case files, we discovered that  Labor mislabeled the basis for several certifications in its records,  suggesting that data reported to Congress may contain inaccuracies.  These errors were likely caused by the high volume of petitions that  required processing, staff shortages and turnover, and gaps in internal  controls. Moreover, as described earlier, the number of categories by  which petitions could be certified more than doubled after the 2009  legislation. Labor told us that investigators\u2019 unfamiliarity with these new  categories may have also contributed to errors. In one instance, Labor  certified a petition based on imports of goods, but the staff member who  entered this information into the information technology system  inaccurately recorded the eligibility category as imports of services. In  another case, Labor officials acknowledged that a certification based on  imports of goods was improperly documented as imports of services in  the petition case file itself. Among other gaps in internal controls, we  found that a single staff member was responsible for recording the reason  for each certification in Labor\u2019s information technology system. The errors  we found do not necessarily indicate that petitions were wrongly  determined, and we did not examine whether any individual  determinations were correct. However, the errors indicate that some  petitions were mislabeled after they were certified.

As a result,  officials said the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance reached its peak  operating capacity in January 2010, approximately 8 months after the  2009 legislation took effect. Labor\u2019s efforts to increase staff were  hampered by frequent employee turnover. According to Labor officials,  many staff hired on a temporary basis left the agency when they found  permanent positions elsewhere, diminishing Labor\u2019s overall capacity to  process petitions.", "In tandem with its efforts to increase capacity, Labor took steps to  enhance its internal controls by adding quality controls to its petition  investigation process. As shown in figure 4, Labor incorporated these  controls over approximately 2 years. In December 2009, for example,  Labor began requiring a senior investigator to review each petition case  file before and after the determination was reached to ensure the file  included appropriate documentation. Previously, petitions were subject to  a single review by the certifying officer. Second, in May 2010, the agency  created a checklist that specified standard operating procedures and  accuracy checks for investigations. The final version of this checklist,  established in the spring of 2011, has specific targets for data entry  accuracy, timeliness of investigations, customer outreach, and more.  Finally, in the fall of 2011, Labor began quarterly tests to gauge how often  these targets were reached. In the first quarter that tests were conducted,  Labor told us that investigators met the quality control targets 87 percent  of the time on average, slightly below the agency\u2019s internal goal of 90  percent.", "It took some time for the benefits of increased staffing and improved  quality controls to take effect. By the end of fiscal year 2010, petition  processing times had fallen substantially, although by this time the  number of petitions Labor received had declined. Moreover, in June 2012,  we reviewed Labor\u2019s petition investigation process and found that it  generally conformed to best practices for internal controls.", "Further, in September 2012, Labor conducted an internal audit to  determine how often the basis for a certification was improperly recorded  in either the petition case file or the agency\u2019s information technology  system. This review covered the period from May 18, 2009, until May 31,  2010, when Labor introduced additional quality control steps. Through an  audit of 351 randomly selected petitions, Labor estimated the error rate to  be 1.4 percent, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.  According to Labor, this audit suggests that errors were more likely to be  present in the information technology system than in the petition case file  itself. Labor concluded that this low percentage of error had a minimal  impact on the petition data reported in its 2010 annual report to Congress.
