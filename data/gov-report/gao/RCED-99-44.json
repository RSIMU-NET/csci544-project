Typically, the cost to implement these options grows as the sophistication of the technology and speed increase.", "Since 1975, most federal funding for high-speed rail development in the United States has been focused on making infrastructure improvements to Amtrak\u2019s Northeast corridor. However, high-speed rail corridors across the United States may have access to federal funds through the High-Speed Rail program, the Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment program, the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing program, and the finance provisions under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA) program.

TIFIA requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish criteria for selecting projects and includes general selection criteria such as whether a project is creditworthy and nationally or regionally significant and whether the use of federal funds would expedite implementing the project.", "The three credit instruments under TIFIA\u2014secured loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit\u2014can be used to fund up to one-third of the costs of a project. A secured loan would typically provide the project\u2019s sponsors with an infusion of capital needed to help pay for construction costs. The loan would have to be payable, in whole or in part, from some form of dedicated revenue and would typically be subordinate to other project debt. In general, TIFIA loans are contingent on the receipt of an investment-grade rating for a project\u2019s senior debt. This measure helps ensure that the project is creditworthy. The second type of instrument, loan guarantees, involves a pledge by the Secretary to pay all or part of the principal of and interest on a loan or other debt obligation of the project. A loan guarantee would help a project obtain capital by providing added security to the debt. Finally, a line of credit is an agreement made by the Secretary to provide a project with a secured loan, if needed, during a project\u2019s initial 10-year operating period.", "One project that plans to use very-high-speed French train a grande vitesse (TGV) technology and obtain TIFIA funding is FOX.

Trains could reach speeds of up to 200 mph, and the system would have no ground-level pedestrian or vehicle crossings. To help design, construct, and operate the system, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) entered into a system franchise agreement in 1996 with the FOX consortium.

However, according to FOX\u2019s engineer, the $2 billion range reflects whether track for the various alignments must be elevated to cross roads and rivers and the degree to which the alignments can use existing rights-of-way. In general, the $8 billion estimate assumes an alignment from Miami to Orlando that traverses urban areas on the east coast, using a significant amount of elevated track to avoid over 100 grade crossings and cross several rivers. In contrast, the $6 billion estimate assumes a more westerly alignment that requires less elevated track and uses more state-owned rights-of-way along interstate highway corridors.", "To develop more precise estimates over the next 2 years, FOX engineers will take field measurements to either validate or adjust the earlier conceptual estimates, according to FOX\u2019s engineer.

The project\u2019s sponsors anticipate that the bonds will have a 30- to 35-year maturity, with an interest rate of 6.67 percent. A third source of debt financing would be private-sector financing for most of the train equipment. Sponsors are considering using either a lease or private bonds. The train equipment would secure the debt, and repayment of the debt would have the first claim on system revenues available after the project pays its annual operating costs. Finally, the fourth source of debt financing would be a $2 billion federal loan secured by a junior lien on the net system revenues. A junior lien means that the federal government would have the last claim on revenues and would be repaid after the project pays the annual operating costs, train equipment debt service, a portion of FOX\u2019s return on equity, and system infrastructure bondholders.", "The remaining funds will come from equity contributions made by the state and FOX, project balances, and interest earned on those balances.

To do this, sponsors must demonstrate that the state legislature will support a $70 million yearly funding commitment for 40 years and that the ridership estimates and revenue projections are valid.

Instead, these bonds will be backed by operating revenues, which can fluctuate each year depending on the success of the system. On the basis of a 1998 FOX ridership study, the project\u2019s sponsors forecast that system revenues will be sufficient to repay the principal and interest on $3.3 billion in system infrastructure bonds. The sponsors are confident that bond-rating agencies will accept the revenue estimates and are planning to provide them with the cost, ridership, and revenue information needed to assess the bonds\u2019 creditworthiness and to thereafter issue a bond rating. FDOT\u2019s financial manager for the project does not anticipate issuing state or system infrastructure bonds until cost estimates are more precise and the amount of bonds needed is better known.

Of the three, Fitch\u2019s officials had the most knowledge of the project. Fitch officials told us that, in general, bond-rating agencies have little or no experience reviewing high-speed rail projects, but when asked to rate the project\u2019s proposed bonds, they will focus on the reliability of the ridership estimates and other important factors in assessing the project\u2019s revenue projections.

However, Fitch officials said it was too early to make any definitive statement about potential bond ratings for the project.", "In addition to the ridership estimates, another factor that may affect the rating for the system infrastructure bonds is the order in which the project will pay its obligations. According to the November 1996 agreement between FOX and FDOT, the project must first cover its operating costs, principal and interest payments for the debt-financed train equipment and pay the FOX consortium a partial return on its investment before it pays back system infrastructure bond investors. This agreement subordinates the system infrastructure bondholders\u2019 claims on revenues and thereby makes the bonds less secure. FDOT\u2019s financial manager for the project stated that this agreement may make the system infrastructure bonds riskier to potential investors and therefore more difficult to sell.

The conference report noted the national significance of the FOX project and suggested that the Department favorably review the project\u2019s request for TIFIA funds as long as it meets the program\u2019s criteria. The project\u2019s sponsors intend to apply for a TIFIA loan as soon as the Department begins soliciting project applications. The sponsors anticipate a favorable preliminary decision by the Department by fall 1999.

The regulations and selection criteria will affect the FOX project. For example, during a September 1998 outreach session on the TIFIA program, an official from the Department said that TIFIA funds may not be forthcoming for projects that have not completed the environmental review process. If this criterion is part of the Department\u2019s TIFIA regulations, the FOX project would be unable to receive a commitment for TIFIA capital assistance until it completes its environmental review, projected for the end of 2000. In addition, TIFIA requires that a project\u2019s sponsors provide a preliminary rating letter from at least one bond-rating agency indicating that the project\u2019s senior obligations have the potential to achieve an investment-grade rating. An investment-grade rating indicates a relatively low probability of default. Until the project develops firmer cost and financing estimates for bond-rating agencies to review, a preliminary rating for the FOX project may not be forthcoming. Furthermore, TIFIA requires that, when selecting projects, the Department consider the amount it must obligate to fund the credit assistance. As discussed later in this report, providing the FOX project with the full $2 billion loan would require the Department to obligate a significant amount of the program\u2019s available funding and would limit the funds that the Department has available to fund other projects through TIFIA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lower Ridership May Affect the Project\u2019s Financing", "paragraphs": ["The FOX project\u2019s sponsors forecast that the system will carry 8.26 million passengers in 2010.

On the basis of our review of an independent report on the ridership forecasts, actual average airfare data from the Department, the Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s (FRA) estimates of induced travel\u2014new travel made solely because a transportation system exists\u2014and our interviews of airline industry officials, we concluded that the FOX ridership forecast is too high because some of the assumptions used to prepare the ridership studies were optimistic. Using alternative scenarios based on less optimistic assumptions could produce a ridership estimate of 5.59 million or lower in 2010. Table 2 summarizes the results of our analysis of how less optimistic assumptions about the air transfer market, lower airfares, and induced or new travel could reduce total ridership estimates for the FOX system.", "First, the ridership forecasts for the FOX project assume that nearly 1.5 million passengers will be supplied to the FOX system by airlines operating in Florida markets. The assumption is that some airlines with hubs in Miami and Orlando will establish code-share agreements with FOX, thereby transferring short-haul intrastate air passengers to FOX so the airlines can maximize revenues on long-haul flights. For example, the ridership forecasts assume that through a code-share agreement, passengers flying to Miami or Orlando could transfer to the FOX system to reach another Florida destination in the high-speed rail corridor. An independent review of the ridership forecasts completed by Wilbur Smith Associates found that this assumption was unverified, and questioned the entire forecast of passengers transferring through airline agreements. In addition, officials from American Airlines, Delta Airlines, the Air Transport Association, and the Miami International Airport told us that airlines would not be interested in establishing a code-share agreement with a competitor such as high-speed rail. Accordingly, they contended that the forecast for passenger transfers through code-share agreements was unsupported. Without passengers from the air connect market, the FOX ridership forecast is reduced by about 1.47 million passengers. (See table 2.)", "Second, the FOX ridership forecasts assume that some air passengers will choose FOX instead of air travel in local air markets. To divert these passengers, FOX\u2019s fares must be comparable with airfares. However, average 1997 airfares actually charged were generally lower than the fares assumed by the FOX ridership forecasts. This assumption could lead to an overestimate of the number of travelers who would use FOX instead of flying. The actual airfares charged by airlines in 1997 were, in some cases, 21 percent less than the airfares assumed in the ridership forecasts. For example, in the Fort Lauderdale-to-Orlando market, the ridership forecasts assumed an average one-way airfare of between $62 and $66, while the actual average airfare according to the Department\u2019s data, was $52. In addition, FOX\u2019s forecast assumed that airfares would remain constant in real terms from 1997 through 2010. However, officials from one major airline stated that they would likely reduce fares in response to the introduction of high-speed rail service. Furthermore, the Department has found that over the past few years, established airlines have responded to the entry of a new competitor by selling large numbers of seats at low fares.", "In preparing their ridership estimates, both KPMG Peat Marwick and SYSTRA developed alternative scenarios that were based on lower airfares. KPMG Peat Marwick found that a 20-percent decrease in assumed airfares would reduce total high-speed rail ridership by 60,000 passengers, while SYSTRA found a 20-percent reduction in airfares would lead to 761,000 fewer high-speed rail passengers. We used these numbers to reflect the effect of more conservative assumptions on ridership.

The consensus estimate\u2014an average of the two forecasts\u2014projects that 16 percent of the total riders will be induced travelers. However, Wilbur Smith Associates expressed concern about the amount of induced travel that the FOX system will actually produce. In addition, a 1997 FRA report noted that estimates of new demand are controversial because little historical information exists; defining and quantifying such demand is methodologically difficult. The FRA study assumed that the new or induced demand generated by high-speed rail service would equal 10 percent of the traffic diverted from local air and automobile travel. Using FRA\u2019s assumption for induced traffic, KPMG Peat Marwick\u2019s estimate would be reduced by 298,000 passengers, while SYSTRA\u2019s estimate would be reduced by 1.26 million passengers.

In its independent review report, Wilbur Smith Associates stated that the ability of a new high-speed rail system to cause travelers to choose it rather than to travel by automobile has not yet been proven in the United States. The report stated that while the level of diversion forecast by FOX could occur, lesser rates of diversion from private automobiles are also possible, which would result in lower ridership.

During this phase, the project\u2019s sponsors will refine the project\u2019s concept, identify proposed alignments, refine capital cost estimates, and develop finance plans. Prior to January 31, 1999, FDOT and FOX must jointly assess the prospects for successful system development and decide whether they should continue the project and enter the certification phase. If they decide to terminate the project, a November 1996 agreement requires FDOT to reimburse FOX for eligible costs incurred through the preliminary phase, or about $5.59 million. If the sponsors choose to proceed beyond the preliminary phase and complete remaining tasks on schedule, construction could begin in 2001. According to the current schedule, the construction of the Miami-to-Orlando segment would take about 4 years, and revenue operations on that segment would begin in 2005. Revenue operations on the Orlando-to-Tampa segment would begin in 2006.", "The project\u2019s sponsors face many challenges in keeping the project on schedule. The environmental review could pose a significant challenge to the FOX project\u2019s schedule. According to the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s (FHWA) Florida Assistant Division Administrator, whose office has overall responsibility for this federal environmental review process, the environmental impact statement for this project will be among the largest in scope and the most complex the office has undertaken. The 320-mile FOX system could have an impact on wetlands, encroach on the habitats of threatened and endangered species, cause noise pollution, and adversely affect the region\u2019s water quality. The project\u2019s sponsors must study these and other impacts and, where necessary, develop plans to mitigate them. For example, if the project has a significant impact on wetlands, the project\u2019s sponsors will have to create new or improve existing wetlands. Depending on the proposed alignment, preliminary estimates by FOX show that mitigation plans may be needed for over 700 acres of wetlands affected by the project\u2019s construction. Construction cannot proceed until sponsors obtain a wetlands permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. To resolve these issues, FDOT must coordinate efforts among at least 15 state and federal agencies. Both FHWA and FDOT officials stated that the project is on schedule, and they are confident that they will complete the entire environmental review process in 2.6 years\u2014by January 2001. Our previous work has found that the average time for completing complex FHWA-led environmental reviews for projects affecting wetlands was over 5 years.", "The availability of TIFIA funding could also affect the FOX project\u2019s schedule. FDOT officials have stated that they cannot build the project, as currently proposed, without the federal loan. The project\u2019s sponsors plan to obtain a preliminary TIFIA funding decision in the fall of 1999\u2014about 2 years prior to construction. However, as of January 1999, the Department had not issued the regulations for implementing the TIFIA program. According to a Department official, TIFIA\u2019s regulations could preclude the Department from making construction funding commitments to projects that have not completed the environmental review process. If the FOX project cannot secure a TIFIA funding commitment until its environmental review is completed, the project\u2019s ability to secure bond financing could also be delayed. These financing delays could delay the construction schedule.", "The project\u2019s sponsors must also secure the state legislature\u2019s timely approval of several pieces of legislation needed to begin construction. FDOT expects to introduce the legislation in spring 2000, when it will also request that the legislature approve the $70 million per year, 40-year funding commitment for the project. If approved, the proposed legislation would provide FOX with an exclusive right to develop high-speed rail in Florida, limit the project sponsors\u2019 liability in the event of an accident, and streamline and clarify the project certification process. FDOT expects the legislation to pass easily. However, should the legislation encounter difficulties or be held up by opponents to the project, the project could be delayed.", "Finally, FOX officials stated that a delay in the issuance of new federal high-speed rail safety standards could affect the project\u2019s schedule. In February 1997, FOX petitioned FRA to develop a rule establishing safety standards for the FOX system. The project\u2019s sponsors requested the rule because FRA\u2019s safety regulations did not address a system with trains traveling at speeds of up to 200 mph. In December 1997, FRA issued a proposed rule containing a draft of the new safety standards for the FOX system. Having received public comments, FRA is now drafting the final rule. FRA officials stated that they are strongly committed to completing the final rule for the FOX system in a timely manner. However, they also stated that they have a large workload of other pressing safety issues to address, including some required by the Congress, and therefore have no timetable for issuing the final rule. Since the final rule may affect the design and cost of the trains, track, and other infrastructure, the project\u2019s sponsors believe they need a final rule before they can arrange financing for the project. FRA officials disagree and believe the proposed rule serves as an excellent basis for financing the project because it addresses key elements of FOX\u2019s petition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Funding FOX Would Constrain the Department\u2019s New Financing Program", "paragraphs": ["Enacted in June 1998, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act established a new transportation infrastructure financing program.

Appendix II shows the locations of these corridors. Ten of the corridors will use an incremental approach to high-speed rail, which provides gradual speed increases by making incremental improvements to existing rail infrastructure or equipment. In contrast, the California corridor is considering the development of a new high-speed rail system that may use technologies similar to those of FOX or even more advanced technology capable of reaching speeds up to 310 mph. The preliminary cost estimates of these systems range from $315 million to $29 billion. Like FOX, most of these corridors are developing their finance plans. Unlike FOX, however, most of the corridors have not determined their funding sources.

As a result of making this loan, the Department could provide at least one-half of the funding available for subsidy costs under TIFIA to this one project. However, the project\u2019s sponsors are at least 2 years from developing the information needed to determine whether the project is economically viable. Currently, there is great uncertainty about whether (1) the project can be built for the $6.3 billion that the project\u2019s most recent finance plan assumes; (2) the project\u2019s sponsors can secure the needed funds to complete the project\u2019s financing; (3) the estimated ridership levels are accurate and, thus, whether the project will be able to generate sufficient revenues to repay the bonds and federal loan; and (4) the sponsors can complete the complex environmental review and mitigation process in time for construction to begin by 2001.", "Similar to the FOX project, other large transportation projects applying for TIFIA funding will face challenges in developing accurate capital cost estimates, securing financing for those costs, generating sufficient revenues needed to repay project debt, and minimizing impacts on the environment. Some of these projects also have the potential to require most of TIFIA\u2019s funds, which would constrain the TIFIA funding available to other projects. Therefore, the Department must make informed decisions on each project\u2019s technical merits and must obtain and evaluate detailed information on the projects\u2019 costs, financing plans, revenue projections, and environmental impacts. As of January 1999, the Department was still developing regulations for the TIFIA program; therefore, the extent to which the Department will require this type of information is unclear.

Overall, the Department\u2019s officials generally agreed with the report\u2019s findings and conclusions, while officials from Florida stated that the report was thorough. Officials from the Department and FDOT had specific comments on the report\u2019s (1) analyses of the FOX project\u2019s ridership forecast, (2) recommendations, (3) discussion of the impacts of a loan to the FOX project through the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, and (4) discussion of the time frames for completing the FOX project\u2019s environmental review.", "With regard to our analysis of the FOX project\u2019s ridership forecast, FRA officials stated that we should adopt a less pessimistic stance on certain aspects of the project\u2019s ridership forecast. Specifically, the FRA officials stated that it was too early to expect the airlines to enter into code-sharing agreements with the FOX system; therefore, our ridership analysis should not entirely dismiss the forecast number of passengers that these agreements could generate. The FDOT officials also affirmed their forecast\u2019s assumption that airlines will establish code-sharing agreements with FOX and therefore transfer a substantial number of air passengers to the FOX rail system. As a result, they stated that our ridership analysis should include these passengers.", "The FDOT officials also disagreed with our assertion that the airfares used in their ridership forecast overstated the cost of air travel within Florida. They noted that their forecast accurately reflected the fares paid by passengers and cited first quarter 1998 airfare statistics that airlines reported to the Department as evidence. Accordingly, they contend that we should not reduce our ridership estimate on the basis of the assumption of lower airfares.", "The FDOT officials further stated that our estimate of new, or induced, ridership was too low. They stated that their estimate was based on the state\u2019s intercity travel surveys, surveys that they contend are more precise than FRA\u2019s estimates used in our report.", "As a final point on ridership, FRA officials stated that our report implied that FOX\u2019s fares must always be lower than the airlines\u2019 fares in order to remain competitive. The officials stated that this assumption was too simplistic because FOX\u2019s ridership would not solely be based on ticket prices. They noted that the FOX system could also attract passengers because it will have a higher quality of service and shorter trip times. The FRA officials further questioned whether the airlines could maintain low airfares over the long term and thereby remain competitive with FOX.", "In responding to these comments on ridership, we recognize that making estimates of how many people will use a high-speed rail system, where none previously existed, is more an art than a science. The assumptions used can significantly affect the forecast level of ridership. We have developed a ridership forecast that is based on alternative scenarios that use less optimistic\u2014but still quite plausible\u2014 assumptions. Our first alternative scenario evaluates whether the airlines, in a highly competitive Florida air market, would willingly give up their passengers to a new competitor\u2014FOX. We acknowledge that FOX and some airlines might establish code-sharing agreements in the future and that FOX officials have cited positive statements made to them by at least one major airline to this effect. However, FOX officials could not provide us with any documentation showing that such agreements were likely. In addition, our discussions with two major airlines, the Air Transport Association, and the Miami airport found little, if any, airline interest in establishing code-sharing agreements with FOX. Wilbur Smith Associates also questioned the viability of these potential agreements. On the basis of this evidence, we made no changes to our ridership analysis with regard to the possibility of ridership resulting from code-share agreements.", "Our second alternative scenario evaluates whether the FOX ridership forecast assumed airfares consistent with what the major airlines reported to the Department. Using data from the first quarter of 1998, the FDOT officials stated that Florida airfares are comparable to proposed FOX fares, thus potentially enhancing FOX\u2019s competitive position with the airlines. This contrasts with our use of 1997 average reported airfares that are, in some cases, 21 percent lower than the ones FOX used in its ridership forecast. We used the average airfares for all of 1997 in reviewing the FOX forecast because (1) it is the same year as that for other data used throughout the FOX forecast and (2) a yearly average provides a more constant picture of the air market than a single quarter. Accordingly, we made no changes to our ridership analysis with regard to the level of airfares.", "Our third alternative scenario assessed the project\u2019s assumptions regarding induced demand. The FDOT officials\u2019 suggestion that we use their assumption regarding induced demand rather than FRA\u2019s assumption highlights the uncertainty in making estimates of induced demand. Forecasting induced ridership is a subject of great uncertainty and controversy, since induced demand attempts to predict how many people will use a system simply because it provides a new service. The FDOT officials said that their assumption was more accurate than FRA\u2019s. However, FRA has reported that because of the uncertainty in forecasting induced demand, high-speed rail proponents should use caution when preparing such estimates. We agree and therefore have not revised our analysis to reflect the higher FOX assumption.", "In addition, the FRA officials presented no evidence to support their assertion that the airlines may not be able to sustain lower airfares over the long term in competition with FOX. The experience of Southwest Airlines supports just the opposite conclusion. Southwest Airlines has established significant market shares in new markets while charging low fares and has sustained these markets in the long term. Nonetheless, we agree with the FRA officials\u2019 comment that FOX could have a competitive advantage over the airlines because it may provide better service and faster trip times in some markets. Since the FOX forecast already assumed this service differential in its ridership assumptions and we did not question them, no change to our ridership analysis is needed.", "Regarding our recommendations, officials from the Department stated they did not plan to independently verify information on the costs, financing, revenue estimates, and environmental impacts of projects applying for TIFIA program funds. They said that the Department would rely on the financial markets in the private sector to analyze these factors rather than on the Department to conduct its own independent analysis. They also stated that since the Department is responsible for completing the environmental review process, it did not need to independently validate the results of environmental reviews.", "In regard to these comments, we agree that the Department cannot independently evaluate its own environmental document. As a result, we have changed our recommendation to reflect the importance of having the environmental review process completed before the Department provides substantial TIFIA funds to a project. However, we disagree with the assertion that the financial markets\u2019 assessment of a project\u2019s costs, financing, and revenue estimates will provide the independent evaluation that we call for in our recommendation. The financial markets\u2019 input, generally in the form of a bond rating, is important information that the Department can use to supplement its equally important engineering, financial, and transportation planning expertise. However, the Department must produce an independent assessment of the merits of projects seeking TIFIA funds. This is particularly important because the Department has the expertise to compare, for example, a highway project to a rail or transit project that might apply for TIFIA funds. As of January 1999, the Department had not yet determined which of its agencies will have the lead responsibility for performing such evaluations. Therefore, our recommendation is targeted to the Secretary of Transportation, who can ensure that the Department uses its analytical expertise as a basis for awarding federal funds.", "Regarding a potential federal loan to the FOX project, the FDOT officials disagreed with our assertion that by funding the FOX project, the TIFIA program would use over half of its available funding. The officials stated that the subsidy rate that the Department used for the Alameda Corridor project\u2014a freight rail improvement project in Southern California\u2014was conservative and we should not use it to estimate the subsidy cost of a federal loan to the FOX project. The FDOT officials believe that the subsidy rates for TIFIA-funded projects would be less than 10 percent rather than the 14.7 percent used for the Alameda Corridor.", "The FDOT officials\u2019 questioning our use of the subsidy level for the Alameda Corridor project\u2019s loan as a model for TIFIA-funded projects is not based on evidence from OMB or the bond rating agencies we contacted. These groups will play critical roles in determining FOX\u2019s loan subsidy amount. OMB officials believe that the 14.7-percent subsidy cost for the Alameda Corridor was accurate. In addition, both OMB and bond-rating agency officials we contacted stated that a federal loan to FOX is riskier than the loan to the Alameda Corridor because the loan repayment is premised on unproven revenues from future ridership. In contrast, the loan repayment for the Alameda Corridor comes from proven cargo revenues from one of the nation\u2019s largest ports.", "In terms of the environmental review process, officials from both FHWA and Florida expressed confidence that the project will complete the environmental review process on schedule. The Florida officials stated that our skepticism of their projected date for completing the environmental review process is unwarranted.
