They are designed by groups of parents, teachers, school administrators, other members of the community, and private corporations. Also, charter schools can operate with considerable autonomy from external controls such as district, state, and union requirements. Charter schools get this autonomy in areas such as curriculum, instruction, budget, and personnel in exchange for being held accountable for student performance.

We reviewed these documents for most of the 83 approved or proposed charter schools we identified as of May 1994; these schools were in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Minnesota (see app. I for a list of the 83 charter schools).

Charter schools may be exempt from most local and state rules, hire their own staff, determine their own curriculum, receive funding directly from the state, and control their own budgets. In contrast, traditional public schools are subject to substantial external controls, such as local, state, and federal requirements, which limit their authority over curriculum and personnel decisions. Federal, state, and local funding for traditional public schools usually flows through the district, and individual schools often have little control over their budgets.", "Between 1991 and 1994, 11 states enacted legislation authorizing charter schools to achieve a variety of purposes, including encouraging innovative teaching, promoting performance-based accountability, expanding choices in the types of public schools available, creating new professional opportunities for teachers, improving student learning, and promoting community involvement.", "The federal government has also acted on behalf of charter schools. Two major pieces of federal education legislation passed in 1994 include provisions on charter schools. The Improving America\u2019s Schools Act, which reauthorized and amended the ESEA of 1965, includes a new federal grant program to support the design and implementation of charter schools (see app. II for a description of this program). The Improving America\u2019s Schools Act also specifies the conversion of a school to charter school status as a possible corrective action that a school district can require of a school that has been identified for school improvement.

Some charter schools target specific student populations, including students at risk of school failure, dropouts, limited English proficient students, noncollege-bound students, or home-schooled students.

The availability of multiple approval options could result in more autonomous charter schools because applicants could seek the least restrictive situation.

Accurate judgments may be difficult in schools that opened before their assessment methods were developed. Second, will charter schools report data by race, sex, or socioeconomic status so that the performance of specific student groups can be assessed? No state laws require charter schools to do so; some include no reporting requirements; and most leave the type of reporting to local discretion (see table 7).

(a) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds that (1) enhancement of parent and student choices among public schools can assist in promoting comprehensive educational reform and give more students the opportunity to learn to challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards, if sufficiently diverse and high-quality choices, and genuine opportunities to take advantage of such choices, are available to all students; (2) useful examples of such choices can come from States and communities that experiment with methods of offering teachers and other educators, parents, and other members of the public the opportunity to design and implement new public schools and to transform existing public schools; (3) charter schools are a mechanism for testing a variety of educational approaches and should, therefore, be exempted from restrictive rules and regulations if the leadership of such schools commits to attaining specific and ambitious educational results for educationally disadvantaged students consistent with challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards for all students; (4) charter schools, as such schools have been implemented in a few States, can embody the necessary mixture of enhanced choice, exemption from restrictive regulations, and a focus on learning gains; (5) charter schools, including charter schools that are schools-within-schools, can help reduce school size, which reduction can have a significant effect on student achievement; (6) the Federal Government should test, evaluate, and disseminate information on a variety of charter schools models in order to help demonstrate the benefits of this promising education reform; and (7) there is a strong documented need for cash flow assistance to charter schools that are starting up, because State and local operating revenue streams are not immediately available. (b) PURPOSE.--It is the purpose of this part to increase national understanding of the charter schools model by-- (1) providing financial assistance for the design and initial implementation of charter schools; and (2) evaluating the effects of such schools, including the effects on students, student achievement, staff, and parents.", "SEC. 10302. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. (a) IN GENERAL.--The Secretary may award grants to State educational agencies having applications approved pursuant to section 10303 to enable such agencies to conduct a charter school grant program in accordance with this part.
