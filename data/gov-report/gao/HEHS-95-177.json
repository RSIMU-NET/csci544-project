One strategy for combating such discrimination has been to focus on the employment practices of the tens of thousands of contractors who do business with the federal government each year.", "While several federal agencies promote equal opportunity in the workplace, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the Department of Labor (DOL) is charged with ensuring that federal contractors, subcontractors, and federally assisted construction contractors actively seek to provide equal opportunity in their employment practices. With almost 200,000 federal contracts and federally assisted construction projects currently under its purview, OFCCP is responsible for ensuring that the businesses holding these contracts are taking affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunity and are not discriminating on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, national origin, disability, or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.", "Because of your concerns about how the federal government structures the enforcement of equal opportunity laws, you asked us to provide information on (1) how OFCCP fulfills its mission and responsibilities; (2) how OFCCP\u2019s resources have changed in recent years; and (3) whether the procedure OFCCP uses to select contractors for review, which entails aggregating data on racial minorities, could mask discrimination against specific minority groups.", "To do our work, we interviewed OFCCP officials in the national office and reviewed the agency\u2019s policies, procedures, and other relevant documents. We did our work between September 1994 and July 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1941, President Roosevelt ordered all federal agencies to include in their wartime contracts a provision prohibiting contractors from discriminating against any worker because of race, color, creed, or national origin. President Johnson expanded this principle in 1965 when he issued Executive Order 11246, which required federal contractors and subcontractors, and federally assisted construction contractors, to refrain from discrimination and to take affirmative action to provide equal employment opportunity to all employees and job applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In the early 1970s, equal employment responsibilities were expanded by statute to persons with disabilities and certain disabled and Vietnam era veterans. (See app. I for more information on the legal authorities for OFCCP.)", "Established in 1966, OFCCP has seen its role evolve over time. Initially, OFCCP served as a policy-making body; using a small nationwide staff, it concentrated primarily on coordinating and monitoring enforcement, while the actual day-to-day enforcement responsibilities were scattered among other federal agencies. In 1978, enforcement responsibilities were transferred from the various federal agencies to OFCCP in order to consolidate activities and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the investigations. Since then, OFCCP has been primarily responsible for ensuring the compliance of federal contractors, subcontractors, and federally assisted construction contractors with their affirmative action and equal opportunity responsibilities.", "Today, OFCCP operates with a budget of about $59 million and is authorized for 825 full-time-equivalent (FTE) staff positions. OFCCP\u2019s national office in Washington, D.C., directs the nationwide enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws and regulations among federal contractors. Field staff in OFCCP\u2019s 10 regional offices and 57 district and area offices conduct the actual enforcement activities. These include reviewing federal contractors\u2019 compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, conducting investigations of individual complaints, and providing technical support to federal contractors.", "While OFCCP monitors the employment practices of federal contractors, OFCCP is actually one of several federal agencies responsible for enforcing equal opportunity laws and regulations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, investigates charges of employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. EEOC also is responsible for investigating discrimination charges in employment based on age, unequal pay, and physical and mental disabilities. There is some overlap in activities of these agencies, and EEOC and OFCCP operate under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and coordination regulations to minimize any duplication of effort. For example, under the MOU, individual complaints to OFCCP alleging discrimination under title VII are referred to EEOC. Under the coordination regulations, OFCCP acts as EEOC\u2019s agent in investigating charges of discrimination brought by certain persons with disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OFCCP\u2019s Enforcement Strategy Focuses on Compliance Reviews", "paragraphs": ["In carrying out its mission and responsibilities, OFCCP focuses most of its resources on compliance reviews (see fig. 1). Through this mechanism, which includes a desk audit and a site visit in most cases, OFCCP analyzes a contractor\u2019s hiring and employment practices. OFCCP seeks to determine if these practices comply with laws that it enforces. In most of its reviews OFCCP identifies violations, many of which are considered major. Regardless of the exact nature of the violation, OFCCP\u2019s policy is to work with the contractor to resolve the case rather than to impose sanctions, such as canceling the federal contract. In addition to compliance reviews, OFCCP conducts complaint investigations and provides compliance support, such as technical assistance to help federal contractors understand the regulatory requirements and review process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Desk Audits and Site Visits Included in Most Compliance Reviews", "paragraphs": ["A compliance review, which often takes between 3 and 6 months to complete, usually consists of two phases: a desk audit and a site visit. The desk audit is a systematic review of documents and materials that the contractor under review provides, explaining its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunities. As part of the desk audit, compliance officers compare the representation of women and individual minority groups in the contractor\u2019s workforce with that of the workforces of similar federal contractors in the area, and examine the contractor\u2019s affirmative action plan. Next, OFCCP usually conducts an on-site review at the contractor\u2019s establishment. During this phase, compliance officers investigate potential violations identified in the desk audit, verify the contractor\u2019s activities to implement its affirmative action program, and obtain information needed to work with the contractor to resolve any violations. Activities include inspecting the contractor\u2019s facilities and reviewing its personnel files (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractor Violations Identified and Resolved in Most Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Compliance reviews tend to uncover violations in the vast majority of cases. OFCCP identified violations in 74 percent of its completed compliance reviews in fiscal year 1994 (see table 1), and OFCCP classified these violations as either major or minor. In 73 percent of the reviews in which violations were identified, OFCCP resolved them with conciliation agreements. Conciliation agreements are used for major violations. Many conciliation agreements address violations such as a contractor\u2019s failure to complete a workforce utilization analysis or to correct for problems with its past performances. Some agreements do address outright discrimination, such as one case in which a compliance review uncovered a pattern of discrimination against African American applicants who had been denied jobs at a facility.", "In addition to the actual conciliation agreement, OFCCP may require the contractor to provide financial compensation to the individual victims of discrimination. For example, in fiscal year 1994, OFCCP reached 553 financial agreements valued at $39.6 million, and, in the case of the discrimination previously cited, the company agreed to pay over $630,000 in back wages to the 32 qualified applicants who had been denied jobs. OFCCP resolved the remaining compliance reviews with letters of commitment, which are used for minor violations such as the need to make technical corrections to a contractor\u2019s affirmative action plan.", "While OFCCP emphasizes bringing contractors into compliance with the employment laws rather than penalizing them for not complying, OFCCP may recommend enforcement proceedings\u2014that is, legal actions\u2014if a contractor fails to resolve discrimination or affirmative action violations. Seventy-five cases were referred for enforcement in fiscal year 1994, and in one such case OFCCP found that a contractor discriminated in compensating a class of minorities and women. The contractor refused to conciliate, and OFCCP then recommended the case for enforcement.", "After an administrative hearing, the Secretary of Labor may order that a contract be suspended or cancelled, and the contractor may be debarred from doing business with the federal government. Debarments, however, are rare, with five contractors debarred in fiscal year 1994. In two of these cases, the contractors did not honor their conciliation agreements by failing to recruit and hire women, and by filing false reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complaint Investigations and Compliance Support Also Provided", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement resources not devoted to compliance reviews are used for complaint investigations and other support activities. OFCCP dedicates about 11 percent of its enforcement hours to investigating specific complaints of employment discrimination.

In fiscal year 1994, OFCCP completed 802 complaint investigations and found violations in 19 percent of the cases.", "OFCCP devoted the remainder of its enforcement resources\u2014about 10 percent\u2014to various support activities. Staff give technical assistance, such as advising contractors on how to meet their equal employment opportunity obligations. OFCCP provides this assistance by answering individual questions and sponsoring seminars on OFCCP policies and regulations.

By fiscal year 1994, OFCCP\u2019s budget had decreased by 9 percent in real dollars (see table 2).", "As OFCCP\u2019s budget decreased in real terms, so did the size of its staff. From fiscal year 1989 to fiscal year 1994, OFCCP\u2019s total FTE staff decreased by 15 percent, from 970 to 820 (see fig. 3). Moreover, the actual number of compliance officers working at OFCCP decreased by 33 percent and has been below the authorized level since fiscal year 1990, primarily because of attrition and hiring freezes.", "During this time the number of completed compliance reviews decreased by 33 percent, from 6,232 to 4,179. OFCCP officials explained that part of this decline was due to the decrease in OFCCP\u2019s funding and staff levels, as well as a changing emphasis from reviewing a single establishment to undertaking more labor intensive lengthy reviews such as corporate management reviews and construction mega-project reviews.", "The number of complaint investigations, in which OFCCP reacts to specific complaints filed by a person or persons, also decreased by 39 percent during this period. This drop, from 1,321 to 802 (see fig. 4), was due in large part to a reduction in the number of complaints actually received by OFCCP, according to OFCCP officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OFCCP\u2019s Use of Aggregated Data Could Overlook Discrimination", "paragraphs": ["One of the procedures OFCCP uses to initially identify contractors for compliance reviews may not lead to appropriate targeting of contractors. Because OFCCP aggregates data pertaining to all minority groups in a company during its initial selection stages, rather than focusing on data pertaining to each minority group separately, it could overlook companies that discriminate against one or more particular minority groups.", "Contractors are required to report on the race, ethnicity, and sex of their workforce in each of nine occupational categories. OFCCP then uses these data as part of its process to determine which contractors should be targeted for compliance reviews. This includes comparing the percentage of all minorities and the percentage of women in a contractor\u2019s workforce to that of all other federal contractors in similar industries and geographic areas. In completing these comparisons, OFCCP combines the data pertaining to all minorities because, according to OFCCP officials, the aggregated data provide a large enough number of observations for a statistically valid analysis.", "Aggregated data may conceal possible discrimination against specific minority groups. For example, if 30 percent of a contractor\u2019s workforce is composed of minorities, and this percentage mirrors the average minority employment for all similar federal contractors in the area, then the contractor is not as likely to be targeted for review. However, assume that all 30 percent of the contractor\u2019s minority workforce are Hispanic when the workforces of similar federal contractors in the area are 15 percent Hispanic and 15 percent African American. While this imbalance in the racial composition of the contractor\u2019s workforce indicates that the contractor may be discriminating against African Americans, under OFCCP\u2019s current practice of aggregating the data, the contractor may not be identified for a compliance review. OFCCP officials acknowledge that this type of discrimination could occur and that some areas have large enough minority populations for statistically valid analyses.

At the same time, OFCCP has continued its practice of aggregating data when initially selecting contractors for compliance reviews, which may be inappropriate.

The average utilization rate is derived by first comparing the contractor\u2019s percentage of minorities (or women) employed in each of the nine occupational categories to the average employment of minorities (or women) for all federal contractors in the specified industry and geographic area. These nine values are then averaged to arrive at one number that is used as the average utilization value.
