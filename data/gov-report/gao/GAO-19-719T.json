OFCCP has taken steps to develop a new web portal for collecting those plans annually, but has not yet obtained Office of Management and Budget approval for the collection or launched the portal. GAO also found OFCCP's oversight was limited by a lack of timely staff training. OFCCP has taken steps to implement a new training curriculum, but has not yet implemented its new learning management system that will help ensure timely and regular training.", "In 2017, GAO found that EEOC had not consistently captured information on industry codes, which limits EEOC's ability to identify trends by industry sector and conduct sector-related analyses. EEOC has not yet completed development of its Employer Master List that will include industry codes. GAO also found that OFCCP's methodology for identifying equal employment disparities by industry might not accurately identify industries at greatest risk of noncompliance with affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements.

The number of relevant grant programs could be higher because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the three agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potentially faith-based organizations (FBO). Of the 117 potential FBOs, nine DOJ grantees were FBOs certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. All three agencies required grantees seeking an exemption to self-certify that they were eligible for the exemption, but the agencies' processes for reviewing and approving exemption requests varied.

However, the agency has not taken  action to fully implement our other three recommendations that focus on  improving enforcement and compliance.", "With regard to the recommendations that have not been fully  implemented, OFCCP has taken action to date as described below.", "Focus compliance evaluations on greatest violation risk. We found  the process OFCCP used to select contractors for compliance  evaluations could not ensure that contractors with the highest risk of  noncompliance were being selected. OFCCP\u2019s selection process was  nonrandom and did not produce a generalizable sample of contractors for  evaluation. As a result, OFCCP was unable to draw conclusions about  noncompliance risk in the overall federal contractor population. While the  selection process included consideration of a number of neutrally applied  factors, such as alphabetical order, employee count at the establishment,  contract value, or contract expiration date, OFCCP was not able to  identify which of these factors, or any factors, are associated with risk of  noncompliance. Thus, OFCCP was unable to quantify the extent to which  federal contractors in its jurisdiction are noncompliant, and did not have  reasonable assurance that it was focusing its efforts on those contractors  at greatest risk of not following equal employment opportunity or  affirmative action requirements. Because OFCCP only conducts  evaluations about 2 percent of federal contractor establishments in its  jurisdiction, without an effective risk-based contractor selection process,  OFCCP may be missing opportunities to evaluate whether there is a  significant segment of contractors who may be more likely to violate  nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements, leaving workers  potentially vulnerable.", "OFCCP has taken steps to improve its contractor selection process, but  has not fully implemented either this 2016 recommendation or a related  recommendation we made in 2017 that it assess the quality of its  proposed methods to incorporate consideration of disparities by industry  before selecting contractors for compliance evaluation. Beginning in fiscal  year 2020, contractors will be able to apply to the Voluntary Enterprise- wide Review Program (VERP), which aims to remove top-performing  contractor participants from the pool of contractors scheduled for  compliance evaluations. OFCCP also recently implemented a new  scheduling list (the list of contractor establishments selected for  evaluation) methodology based on research on closed cases from the  previous five years (2014-2018). Thirty-three percent of the new  scheduling list was comprised entirely of contractor establishments from  the three industries with the highest rates of violation based on this  sample of closed cases. However, the scheduling lists of the previous 5  years included nonrandom selections of contractor establishments that  included a number of neutrally applied factors. If OFCCP\u2019s goal is to  prioritize contractors at highest risk of noncompliance, this new  scheduling methodology may not achieve this, because contractors  selected will be weighted towards prior neutrally applied selection factors,  such as employee count, in addition to violation risk. Further, while VERP  may remove some compliant contractors from the scheduling list pool,  without overwhelming volunteer participation, it will do little to help identify  those most likely to violate. Consequently, it remains unclear whether  contractors with the highest risk of not following equal employment  opportunity and affirmative action requirements will be selected for  compliance reviews.", "Monitor affirmative action programs. In 2016 OFCCP relied  significantly on voluntary compliance by federal contractors, and this  approach could not ensure that contractors were complying with basic  requirements like developing and maintaining an AAP. By signing a  qualifying federal contract, covered contractors are required to develop an  AAP within 120 days of contract commencement and update it annually.  However, OFCCP had no process for ensuring that the tens of thousands  of establishments that had signed a qualifying federal contract do so.", "OFCCP has taken steps towards implementing a mechanism to monitor  AAPs but has not fully implemented this recommendation. In 2018  OFCCP contracted with an information technology vendor to develop a  web-based portal to allow contractors to upload their AAPs electronically  for convenience, increased compliance, and for OFCCP review and  resource prioritization. Officials anticipate delivery of the portal by the  close of fiscal year 2019. Simultaneously, according to officials, OFCCP  has developed the necessary information collection request to obtain  approval from OMB to collect all contractors\u2019 AAPs annually. The agency  anticipates that OMB approval will be timely to align with completion of  the AAP portal.", "Facilitate timely compliance officer training. In 2016, we found that  OFCCP may not be providing timely training for new compliance officers.  According to OFCCP officials, budget constraints had made it difficult to  hold timely centralized training for new compliance officers. In half of the  regions we visited, compliance officers or management officials we spoke  with noted that this training was not provided in a timely manner after new  officers are hired. For example, one compliance officer told us they  worked for 8 months before receiving formal training. In one district office,  compliance officers we spoke with explained that the lack of uniform,  timely training made compliance officers feel unprepared when they  began their job. Further, without providing timely training to new  compliance officers, OFCCP cannot ensure consistency in its  enforcement efforts across its offices.", "OFCCP has taken steps to improve its training program, but has not fully  implemented this recommendation. In 2018, OFCCP retained an expert  consultant to assess its national training program and standardize its  training development and evaluation process. The assessment was  completed in 2019 and a plan of action was created to address any  program gaps, according to agency officials. Officials reported that the  plan of action was fully implemented in fiscal year 2019 and OFCCP  obtained a 5 year International Association for Continuing Education and  Training (IACET) accreditation for its program. OFCCP officials told us  they are developing a learning management system that will allow new  compliance officers easy access to training soon after the hiring.

EEOC\u2019s inability to analyze charge  data by industry limits EEOC\u2019s ability to identify trends by industry sector  and conduct sector-related analyses that could be used to more  effectively to focus its limited enforcement resources and outreach  activities. EEOC has taken some action towards addressing missing  industry code data, but has not taken actions sufficient to fully implement  this recommendation. As part of an effort to overhaul its data system,  EEOC has begun developing an Employer Master List that will provide a  source of employer information, including industry codes, but EEOC told  us that it has not yet completed this effort.

In our November  2017 report, we found that OFCCP did not analyze data on closed  evaluations to understand the root causes of delays in its compliance  review process that may be straining its resources and inhibiting  OFCCP\u2019s efforts to identify potential discrimination. This evaluation could  help OFCCP determine whether changes are needed in its own internal  policies and processes, as well as guide OFCCP\u2019s selection of improved  methods for obtaining complete, accurate, and timely documentation from  federal contractors. OFCCP has taken actions but it does not fully  address this recommendation. In June 2019, OFCCP officials reported  that OFCCP\u2019s procedures outlined in the Active Case Enforcement  Directive (DIR 2011-01) caused delays in case closures, but it does not  indicate that this conclusion resulted from the recommended analysis of  internal process data from closed evaluations.

In its agency  response to our November 2017 report, OFCCP officials reported that the  agency was exploring the use of U.S. Census Bureau and administrative  data to refine its selection process to focus on industries with a greater  likelihood of noncompliance. OFCCP has taken some action, but has not  fully implemented this recommendation. In January 2019, DOL officials  reported that DOL had revised its scheduling methodology to include  industries with the highest rates of violations. OFCCP published the  scheduling list in March 2019 and its field offices started scheduling cases  in May 2019. OFCCP stated it will continue to monitor results from this  revised scheduling methodology to determine its effectiveness. It will be  important for OFCCP to refine these methods based on its experiences  with them. This new process is a step toward focusing efforts on  industries at greater risk of potential noncompliance with  nondiscrimination or affirmative action requirements.", "Evaluate establishment-based approach to compliance evaluations.  In our November 2017 report, we found that OFCCP had made no  changes to its establishment-based approach since OFCCP was founded  in 1965. However, OFCCP officials acknowledged the changing nature of  a company\u2019s work can involve multiple locations and corresponding  changes in the scope of hiring and recruitment. OFCCP has taken some  action, but has not fully addressed this recommendation. In fiscal year  2019, OFCCP evaluated its current approach for identifying  subcontractors for review. OFCCP stated that the current approach does  not reliably include subcontractors in the pool from which contractors are  scheduled because there is no government or public database that  captures the complete universe of subcontractors and other important  data.
