To do so, GAO reviewed 32 18F projects and 13 USDS projects that were underway or completed as of August 2015 and surveyed agencies about these projects; reviewed 18F and USDS in key performance measurement and project prioritization practices; reviewed 25 agencies' efforts to establish digital service teams; and reviewed documentation from four agencies, which were chosen based on their progress made in establishing digital service teams."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The General Service Administration's (GSA) 18F and Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) U.S. Digital Service (USDS) have provided a variety of services to agencies supporting their information technology (IT) efforts.

In addition, USDS provided assistance on 13 projects across 11 agencies and generally provided consulting services, including quality assurance, problem identification and recommendations, and software engineering. Further, according to GAO's survey, managers were generally satisfied with the services they received from 18F and USDS on these projects (see table).", "Source: GAO survey of agency project managers that engaged with 18F and U.S. Digital Service. | GAO-16-602", "Both 18F and USDS have partially implemented practices to identify and help agencies address problems with IT projects. Specifically, 18F has developed several outcome-oriented goals and related performance measures, as well as procedures for prioritizing projects; however, not all of its goals are outcome-oriented and it has not yet fully measured program performance. Similarly, USDS has developed goals, but they are not all outcome-oriented and it has established performance measures for only one of its goals. USDS has also measured progress for just one goal. Until 18F and USDS fully implement these practices, it will be difficult to hold the programs accountable for results.", "Agencies are beginning to establish digital service teams. Of the 25 agencies included in the President's proposed funding for agency digital service teams, OMB has established charters with 6 agencies for their digital service teams. In addition, according to the Deputy USDS Administrator, USDS expects to establish charters with an additional 2 agencies by the end of the fiscal year\u2014the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration. For the remaining 16 agencies, as of April 2016, 8 agencies reported that they plan to establish digital service teams but have yet to establish charters with USDS. The other 9 agencies reported that they do not plan to establish digital service teams by September 2016 and most noted that it was because they did not receive requested funding to do so. Further, of the 4 agencies GAO selected to review, only 1 has defined the relationship between its digital service team and the agency Chief Information Officer (CIO). This is due, in part, to the fact that USDS policy does not describe the expected relationship between CIOs and these teams. Until OMB updates its policy and ensures that the responsibilities between the CIOs and digital services teams are clearly defined, it is unclear whether CIOs will be able to fulfill their statutory responsibilities with respect to IT management of the projects undertaken by the digital service teams."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations to GSA and two recommendations to OMB to improve goals and performance measurement.

In addition, we removed 1 project that  was terminated without substantial work performed by 18F and 2  projects that, as of March 2016, had not yet been initiated.", "Regarding USDS, we removed 2 projects that did not use USDS staff  (e.g., projects that used staff from 18F or an agency digital service  team), and 1 project that did not have an agency customer. We also  consolidated 2 projects into 1 project because the customer agency  considered them to be a single project. The final 32 18F projects and  associated 18 agencies, as well as the final 13 USDS projects and  associated 11 agencies are identified in appendix II.", "We administered a data collection instrument to each of the selected  projects about the services they received from 18F and USDS, and the  extent to which the projects were associated with major IT investments.  We then analyzed information obtained from the completed data  collection instruments describing the services they received from 18F and  USDS. We also reviewed information obtained from 18F and USDS  regarding key projects that did not have agency customers.", "Additionally, we conducted a web-based survey of the agency managers  of selected 18F and USDS projects. We designed a draft questionnaire in  close collaboration with our survey specialist. We also conducted pretests  with officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), and GSA. From these pretests, we  made revisions as necessary to reduce the likelihood of overall and item  non-response as well as reporting errors on our questions.", "We sent the survey via e-mail to the managers of the selected 32 18F  and 13 USDS projects from January 12, 2016, through February 18,  2016. Log-in information was e-mailed to all contacts. We contacted  project managers by telephone and e-mailed those who had not  completed the questionnaire at multiple points during the data collection  period. We closed the survey on March 31, 2016. We received a  completed questionnaire from the managers of 35 of the 43 selected  projects (81 percent)\u201427 of the 32 selected 18F projects (84 percent)  and 10 of the 13 selected USDS projects (77 percent).", "Because we surveyed all of the project managers and therefore did not  conduct any sampling for our survey, our data are not subject to sampling  errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may  introduce non-sampling errors. For example, differences in how a  particular question is interpreted, the sources of information available to  respondents, or the types of people who do not respond to a question can  introduce errors into the survey results. We included steps in both the  data collection and data analysis stages to minimize such non-sampling  errors. Our analysts resolved difficulties that respondents had in  completing our survey. Although the survey responses cannot be used to  generalize the opinions and satisfaction of all customers that receive  services from 18F and USDS programs, the responses provide data for  our defined population.", "In our questionnaire we asked the managers of all projects to identify the  extent to which they are satisfied or dissatisfied with the services provided  by 18F and USDS programs. To determine the extent to which both  programs are providing satisfactory services to its customers, we  described the results on a 5-point satisfaction scale, where 5 is \u201cvery  satisfied\u201d and 1 is \u201cvery dissatisfied.\u201d", "To obtain additional narrative and supporting context, survey respondents  were given multiple opportunities to provide additional open-ended  comments throughout our survey. Using these open-ended responses,  we conducted a content analysis in order to identify common factors.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed federal laws and guidance  on performance measurement, and GAO\u2019s guidance on investment  management. We then identified the following practices relevant to  entities that provide IT services:", "Define outcome-oriented goals and measure performance.", "According to federal law and our previous work, outcome-oriented  goals and performance measures are vital to assess the actual  results, effects, or impact of a program or activity compared to its  mission.", "Establish and implement procedures for prioritizing IT projects.", "According to GAO\u2019s guidance on investment management,  establishing procedures, to include criteria, for prioritizing projects can  help organizations consistently select projects based on their  contributions to the strategic goals of the organization.", "We analyzed 18F and USDS policies, procedures, plans, and practices  and compared them to the identified areas.", "To address our third objective, we administered a data collection  instrument on plans to establish digital service teams to the 25 agencies  with funding proposed in the President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2016.  Additionally, we reviewed USDS\u2019s plans\u2014to include interviews with  USDS officials\u2014for providing assistance to agencies that planned to  establish a digital service team in fiscal year 2016.", "In addition, we selected four agencies as case studies to determine the  extent to which agencies had documented the relationships between  digital service teams and agency Chief Information Officers (CIO). To  choose these agencies, we identified the three agencies that had  established a charter with USDS as of January 2016\u2014the Departments of  Defense, Homeland Security, and State. We also selected the  Department of Veterans Affairs because, as of January 2016, it had the  most staff of any agency digital service team.", "For these agencies, we evaluated the extent to which agency policies and  procedures, including digital service team charters, clearly defined  responsibilities and authorities governing the relationships between the  CIO and other agency organizations that use IT (in the case of this report,  the other agency organizations that use IT were the agency digital service  teams). Further, we conducted interviews with the CIOs of the  Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and State, as well as the  Veterans Affairs Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of  Information and Technology. We also shared our analysis with OMB  officials to review, comment, and provide additional information.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to August 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
