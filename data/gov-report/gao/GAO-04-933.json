According to its fiscal year 2002 Comprehensive Building Plan, the Kennedy Center will need an additional $57 million in federal appropriations from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2008 to complete its planned capital projects. The Kennedy Center has completed many of the capital projects identified in the Comprehensive Building Plan and has many more ongoing. However, we do not expect the Center to be able to complete all of the capital projects identified in the plan by fiscal year 2008. This is in part because the Kennedy Center reprioritized the sequence of its planned projects to minimize disruptions to its patrons. Several of the projects that will likely not be completed include components, such as the installation of sprinklers, that are important in meeting the Kennedy Center's goal of bringing the facility into compliance with current life safety codes. However, the Comprehensive Building Plan does not discuss changes to its prioritization of projects or the impact of those changes on completing its planned renovations. In addition, the updates to the plan do not include information on the status of projects identified in earlier plans or provide budget information for individual projects. As a result, the Comprehensive Building Plan is of limited use for understanding the Kennedy Center's progress in completing its planned renovations. Operations and maintenance costs for the plaza project, including two new buildings, could range from $6 million to $11 million annually, in current dollars, based on data from a survey of museum facility management practices and Kennedy Center data. The Kennedy Center expects to request additional annual federal appropriations for these costs. However, because the project is currently in the early planning phase, the operations and maintenance estimate could change as designs are finalized.

The Kennedy Center, open every day of the  year, is visited by nearly 5 million people annually. By 1990, the Kennedy  Center suffered from severe deterioration and a backlog of capital repairs.  Responsibility for managing the Kennedy Center was shared between the  National Park Service and the Kennedy Center itself. Officials from both  agencies acknowledged that the Center had reached a seriously  deteriorated state due to the lack of a clear mandate as to which agency  was responsible for identifying and completing capital repairs and  alterations.", "In 1994, Congress transferred responsibility for the management of the  Kennedy Center facility from the National Park Service to the Kennedy  Center. At that time, Congress also required the Kennedy Center to  develop, and annually update, a comprehensive building needs plan. In  response, the Kennedy Center developed a Comprehensive Building Plan in  1995 that included an assessment of the facility and identified the capital  projects it believed were necessary to restore the Center to the standards  of a presidential memorial and bring it into compliance with current life  safety and accessibility codes. The Kennedy Center has been gradually  renovating the Center since 1995. Among other improvements, the Center  has renovated its two largest theaters, replaced the roof, installed a new  fire alarm system and improved its building systems, such as its heating  and air-conditioning and plumbing systems.", "The Kennedy Center is also working with the U.S. Department of  Transportation and organizations within the District of Columbia to  develop a new public plaza adjacent to the current facility, improving road  and pedestrian access. The plaza project includes two new buildings  located on the plaza to provide additional office, classroom, and rehearsal  space and house permanent and rotating exhibits on the history of  performing arts. These buildings will be constructed with private  donations, but the Center expects to fund the operations and maintenance  (O&M) of the buildings with federal appropriations.", "To assist the subcommittee in its oversight role and in making future  funding decisions related to the Center and plaza building project, our  report discusses (1) how much the Kennedy Center has received in federal  appropriations for capital improvement projects for fiscal years 1995  through 2004, (2) the status of the Comprehensive Building Plan and its  updates, and (3) the potential impact of the Kennedy Center\u2019s proposed  plaza project on the need for future federal funds to pay for the cost of  operating and maintaining the new buildings and plaza.", "To determine the amount of federal appropriations the Kennedy Center  requested and received for capital improvement projects for fiscal years  1995 through 2004, we reviewed the Kennedy Center\u2019s Comprehensive  Building Plan and its updates; its budget justifications and audited financial  statements; and federal authorization and appropriation laws. To determine  the status of the Kennedy Center\u2019s Comprehensive Building Plan and its  updates we toured the Kennedy Center facility; obtained a status of the  projects, including costs, from Kennedy Center officials and its financial  system; and discussed the projects with Kennedy Center officials. To  determine the potential impact of the Center\u2019s proposed plaza project on  the need for future federal funds, we calculated the potential O&M costs  based on museum survey data of facility management practices and the  Kennedy Center\u2019s projected O&M rates. We discussed with Kennedy Center  officials how these rates were determined, and we verified with the agency  that conducted the survey that the museum rates provided were accurate.  We researched building industry sources for estimates of O&M rates and  determined that the Kennedy Center\u2019s projected rates were reasonable  given the currently available information. We also determined that project  status and cost data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our review.

The Center houses four major theaters  and several smaller theaters, five public halls or galleries, educational  facilities, rehearsal spaces, offices, and meeting rooms in about 1.1 million  square feet of space. The Kennedy Center also has a recently expanded  parking garage. The Center is open 365 days a year, and nearly 5 million  people visit it annually to attend performances or tour the facility.", "In 1972, the National Park Service, within the Department of Interior,  assumed responsibility for services related to the nonperforming arts  functions of the Kennedy Center facility, whereas the Kennedy Center  Board of Trustees (Board) retained responsibility for all performing arts  activities. Under this dual management, the Kennedy Center facility  suffered from severe deterioration and a backlog of capital repairs in part  because responsibility for identifying and completing capital repairs and  improvements at the Center was unclear. As a result, legislation was  enacted in 1990 that directed the National Park Service and the Board to  enter into a cooperative agreement setting forth their responsibilities  relating to maintenance, repair, and alteration of the Center. However, after  the parties were ultimately unable to agree on a methodology to enter into  the cooperative agreement, which would have been the foundation of a  capital improvement plan, legislation was enacted in 1994 that gave the  Board sole responsibility for carrying out capital improvement projects at  the Kennedy Center facility. A purpose of the legislation was to provide  autonomy for the overall management of the Kennedy Center, which  included better control over its capital projects and bringing the Kennedy  Center building from a state of deterioration to a condition of excellence.  The legislation further required the Board to develop and annually update a  comprehensive building needs plan.", "In response to the legislation, the Kennedy Center developed a  Comprehensive Building Plan (Building Plan) in 1995 to detail the existing  condition of the Kennedy Center facility and planned renovations. The  goals of the renovations were to address accessibility and life safety code  deficiencies, such as the installation of sprinklers throughout the Center,  replace inefficient building systems, and improve visitor services. The  original Building Plan anticipated that the capital projects at the Kennedy  Center would be completed in two stages. Projects in the first stage\u2014fiscal  years 1995 through 1999\u2014would address critical issues to protect the  building from water intrusion, provide critical security and life safety  measures, and provide improved accessibility. Projects undertaken in the  second stage\u2014fiscal years 2000 through 2009\u2014would eliminate the  backlog of deferred capital repair projects. However, the Kennedy Center  changed its approach to renovating the Center. Rather than undertaking  broad-scale projects that could disrupt the entire Center, the Kennedy  Center has taken certain areas or theaters out of service and performed all  of the necessary renovations in a particular area at one time. For example,  rather than installing a new sprinkler system throughout the entire Center,  which would have closed multiple theaters simultaneously, the Center is  installing sprinklers in each theater as it is renovated. Thus, only one  theater is closed at a time. According to Center officials, this approach  minimizes the disruptions to ongoing operations in other areas of the  Kennedy Center. When the Opera House was renovated, for example, it was  closed for almost a year but performances continued in all of the other  theaters.", "The Kennedy Center receives federal funding annually for capital  improvement projects based on its Building Plan. In fiscal year 2004, the  Kennedy Center received approximately $16 million in federal funds for  capital improvement projects. Revenue generated by performances at the  Center are used for costs associated with the performances and are not  used for capital projects in the Building Plan.", "In addition to federally funded projects, the Building Plan also discusses  other major projects that are being funded with private donations or other  nonfederal funding sources, including the recent garage expansion and the  proposed plaza project adjacent to the Kennedy Center facility. The plaza  project, which will connect the Center to the National Mall, will relocate  roadways to improve transportation and pedestrian accessibility to and  from the Kennedy Center and surrounding streets. It will include a central  fountain that runs from 23rd Street NW to the Kennedy Center, a pedestrian walkway, and a connection to the waterfront. In addition, the plaza will  include two proposed buildings with about 200,000 gross square feet each,  located on opposite sides of the central fountain (see fig. 1). The Kennedy  Center plans for one building to house an exhibition devoted to the history  of performing arts in America, include office space for the Kennedy Center  staff, and be used as an education center for the performing arts. The other  building will be used as rehearsal space for the Washington National Opera  and the Kennedy Center and include some additional office space for  Kennedy Center staff. These buildings will be constructed with private  donations, and upon completion, the Kennedy Center Board will own,  operate, and maintain the buildings and green space established on the  plaza. In fiscal year 2003, the Center received a pledge of $100 million to be  used toward the construction of the planned plaza buildings. According to  Kennedy Center officials, they are in the preliminary stages of designing  and estimating the cost of the new buildings. Construction of the plaza  project is expected to begin in fiscal year 2010, pending federal funding,  and the Kennedy Center is expected to begin occupying the buildings in  fiscal year 2013.", "The 1994 legislation that gave the Kennedy Center responsibility for capital  projects also authorized the Board to carry out the day-to-day operations  and maintenance activities for the Kennedy Center facility. Operations and  maintenance funds are used to cover expenses for utilities, security, daily  cleaning, and maintenance, among other things. In fiscal years 2003 and  2004, the Kennedy Center received about $16 million in federal  appropriations each year for the operations and maintenance of the current  facility. Federal appropriations are not used for performance-related  expenses. The Kennedy Center\u2019s total operating expenses in fiscal year  2003 were about $118 million.

(see table 1).", "As shown in table 1, the Kennedy Center requested approximately $9  million annually for capital projects for fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year  1998. The Center generally received what it requested in each of these  years, but the actual funding available was reduced in some of these years  due to a rescission of budget authority. In fiscal year 1997, additional  appropriations were provided to the Kennedy Center to address  antiterrorism requirements. In fiscal year 1999, the Kennedy Center  requested and received $20 million in federal appropriations for capital  projects, an increase from the $9 million it originally anticipated receiving  in its initial 1995 Building Plan. This increase in funding was given to the  Kennedy Center to address several critical projects over a 3-year period.   Center officials requested the increased funding on the basis of studies  conducted by its architecture and engineering consultants, who concluded  an increase in \u201cup front\u201d funding could lead to overall cost savings on the  Kennedy Center renovation in the long term. For fiscal years 2002 through  2004, the Kennedy Center gradually reduced its annual funding request  from $20 million; however, the total requested funding for these years was  about $17 million more than was anticipated in the initial 1995 Building  Plan.", "The Kennedy Center uses its Building Plan to communicate to Congress its  planned capital improvement projects and to provide budget estimates for  carrying out these projects. The Kennedy Center further describes its  planned capital projects and requests federal appropriations for these  projects in its annual budget justifications to Congress. Both the Building  Plan and budget justifications present budget estimates for broad  categories of projects, such as interior repair, accessibility, and egress, but  they do not include budget information for specific projects. Unlike the  General Services Administration, the Kennedy Center receives a lump sum  appropriation for capital projects, and the appropriations are not dedicated  to specific projects.

To  minimize disruptions to the Center\u2019s operations and patrons, the Kennedy  Center changed its original approach of doing critical life safety projects by  the end of fiscal year 1999 to renovating the Center a particular area at a  time. For example, the recent renovation of the Opera House included all  necessary projects in the theater, such as the removal of asbestos, the  installation of a sprinkler system, and the installation of new wall  coverings. This approach is less disruptive to the operations of the  Kennedy Center; however, many of the life safety projects that the initial  Building Plan anticipated would be completed by the late 1990s, although  currently ongoing, will not be completed until fiscal year 2006.

Building industry data is available for  the average O&M cost for office space. However, the current plaza project  plan indicates that a combination of office, museum quality exhibition  space, and rehearsal space will be included in the proposed buildings.  Given the combination of the different types of space in the proposed  buildings, we estimated potential O&M costs per square foot for the  proposed project on the basis of (1) O&M costs for the current Kennedy  Center building, (2) a 2002 museum benchmarking survey of facility  management practices, and (3) Kennedy Center officials\u2019 estimates. Using  these sources, estimates for the potential O&M costs of the buildings were  developed as follows:  Kennedy Center officials determined that the minimum potential rate  for O&M would be based on the rate for the current building. The Center  currently pays about $15 a gross square foot for O&M, based on the size  of the current facility (1.1 million gross square feet).", "Kennedy Center officials provided O&M data for six Washington, D.C.,  museums based on a 2002 museum benchmarking survey of facility  management practices conducted by Facility Management Services Ltd.,  a consulting practice specializing in facility management. The survey  obtained information on the costs per square foot of space for five  categories of O&M services\u2014janitorial, utilities, building maintenance,  exterior grounds maintenance, and building security\u2014for each of the  six museums. The O&M costs per square foot of space for each of these  categories varied widely among the museums. For example, building  maintenance costs ranged from $3.38 to $22.88 per square foot of space.  Building maintenance costs can vary depending on the type of building  materials used to construct the building and the type of equipment  inside the building. Similarly, building security costs ranged from $2.66  to $23.43 per square foot of space. Factors that could affect building  security costs include the value of the museum\u2019s contents (e.g., fine art)  and the location of the facility. Because the proposed new plaza  buildings are still in the early planning phase and many factors,  including the size of the proposed buildings and the types of building  materials used, could change before designs are finalized, we estimated  the potential O&M rate for the proposed buildings by averaging the  aggregate O&M costs for the six museums. This resulted in an O&M rate  of $28 per gross square foot.", "Kennedy Center officials also estimated the potential O&M rate for the  proposed buildings using the museum data described above, and  adjusted the data based on such factors as the size of the other  museums relative to the proposed new buildings and plaza, estimates  from the Kennedy Center\u2019s current janitorial provider, and the difference  in security levels needed at the two proposed buildings. In addition,  Kennedy Center officials discounted the information from the museums  with the highest and lowest O&M costs and projected O&M costs on the  basis of data from the other four museums. As a result, Kennedy Center  officials estimated that the average O&M rate for the two buildings  could be $20 per gross square foot.", "On the basis of the potential O&M rates\u2014$15, $20, and $28 per gross square  foot\u2014and the current proposed size of the two new buildings\u2014a total of  about 402,000 gross square feet--we calculate that total O&M for the new  plaza and buildings could range from $6 million to $11 million annually, in  current dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Could Substantially Affect Actual O&M Costs", "paragraphs": ["The plaza and buildings project is in the early stages of the planning phase,  and many factors could affect the actual O&M costs. Some of the factors  that will affect O&M costs are within the control of the Kennedy Center,  and others are not.", "Examples of factors within the Kennedy Center\u2019s control that may affect  O&M costs are as follows:   The current plaza proposal includes a large fountain located above a  roadway that connects the Kennedy Center to the National Mall.  Fountains are expensive to maintain, and locating the fountain above a  roadway could present additional security risks from the traffic below,  which may increase security costs.", "The size of the plaza and buildings has not yet been finalized. A  reduction or increase in the size of the plaza and buildings would have a  direct affect on O&M costs.", "The selection of building materials, such as the current plan to use a  large amount of glass on the outside of the buildings, will affect O&M  costs. Buildings with a large amount of glass on the outside are more  expensive to cool due to the heat that is absorbed by the glass. In  addition, glass is more expensive to clean than other materials, such as  brick.", "The plaza and buildings project is not expected to be occupied until 2013,  and economic factors that are not within the Kennedy Center\u2019s control may  affect actual O&M costs. For example, utility and labor rates have generally  increased at a higher rate than the rate of inflation. It is difficult to  anticipate these rates so far in the future. Furthermore, the actual O&M  costs may not be known until the buildings are in operation for at least one  annual cycle of using the plaza and for heating and cooling the new  buildings. At the end of that cycle, the Kennedy Center\u2019s appropriations  request should be based on the actual O&M costs it incurred.", "As discussed earlier in this report, Congress currently funds Kennedy  Center capital improvement projects not related to performances. Given  the current precedent of providing funding for capital improvement  projects at the Center, Congress may also be expected to provide additional  funds in the future for capital improvement costs associated with the plaza  project."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The requirement to develop and annually update a Comprehensive Building  Plan was intended to help improve management of the Kennedy Center\u2019s  capital projects and, over the long term, help reduce the public costs of  operating and maintaining the facility. The current plan anticipated that  projects addressing life safety and accessibility issues\u2014needed to meet  current codes\u2014would be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.  However, it is unlikely the Kennedy Center\u2019s Building Plan will be fully  implemented by 2008, including life safety projects in some areas. This is  due, in part, to changes in the sequence of its planned projects.  Furthermore, the current Building Plan has not been updated since  December 2002, and it does not provide individual project budgets or  prioritize capital projects; thus, it is unclear which projects might be  delayed or not implemented due to budget constraints. It is also not  possible to determine from the Building Plan if individual projects are  completed within project budget estimates. Including this information in its  annual Building Plan, as well as the progress that has been made in  renovating the Center and in meeting life safety and accessibility codes,  would make the Kennedy Center\u2019s use of federal funds to carry out its  capital renovations more transparent and make the Kennedy Center more  accountable for the use of federal funds.

Kennedy Center officials  also provided technical comments that have been incorporated throughout  the report, as appropriate.", "The letter also emphasized that the Comprehensive Building Plan is  primarily a management tool and that other reports are the vehicles for  keeping Congress informed of the Center\u2019s progress in its renovation  program. As part of our work, we reviewed the reports to the Operations  Committee and a monthly report to OMB. While some of the information  we are recommending be included in the Comprehensive Building Plan is  provided in these reports, other recommended project information is not.  For example, neither report provides information on project prioritization  or projects planned for the future. The project information that is provided  is not presented in a format that allows stakeholders to easily track the  overall progress of the Kennedy Center renovations or specific capital  projects from the building plan. It also appears that this information is not  being conveyed to all congressional stakeholders. We believe that having  project specific information available in one document that is provided to  the stakeholders annually, as described in our recommendation, will help  congressional decision makers and other stakeholders oversee the capital  projects at the Kennedy Center.", "In addition, the letter did not agree with how we counted the projects  identified in the Comprehensive Building Plan. However, it stated that the  Comprehensive Building Plan has not been consistent in how it has  identified projects and that the most recent plan lists design and  implementation as two separate projects, while the earlier plans listed  them as one project. As we noted in our report, the Comprehensive  Building Plan does not clearly explain how projects are restructured or  reported in different updates. Since our objective was to compare the  actual projects undertaken with those reported in the Comprehensive  Building Plan, we have identified and numbered the projects as listed in the  plan and its updates to the plan. We understand the Kennedy Center\u2019s  concern that how the projects are counted can change the reported  percentage of projects completed. Thus, we have deleted the reference to  the percentage of projects completed as an indication of the Kennedy  Center\u2019s progress in implementing the Comprehensive Building Plan and  only report actual numbers of projects. We believe that if the Kennedy  Center implements our recommendation and provides more clear project  information, this type of analysis should be possible in the future.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 5 days from the  report date.

Kennedy  Center for the Performing Arts (Center) requested and received for capital  projects for fiscal years 1995 to 2004, we reviewed the Kennedy Center\u2019s  annual budget justification to Congress and Comprehensive Building Plan  and its updates; federal authorization and appropriation laws; and the  Kennedy Center\u2019s audited financial statements. The Kennedy Center\u2019s  budget justifications to Congress contain the Kennedy Center\u2019s request for  federal funding for its capital repairs and rehabilitation. We compared the  amount the Kennedy Center requested with the actual appropriations the  Kennedy Center received from fiscal year 1995 through 2004, taking into  account rescissions to budget authority. We also compared the amounts of  the appropriations identified in the law with the amounts identified in the  Kennedy Center\u2019s audited financial statements and verified rescission  amounts with Kennedy Center officials. Finally, we relied on the Kennedy  Center\u2019s 2002 Comprehensive Building Plan to determine the amount of  federal appropriations the Center expects to request through fiscal year  2008. We also reviewed the budget justifications and Building Plans to  determine why changes were made to the Kennedy Center\u2019s funding  request.", "To determine the status of the Kennedy Center\u2019s Comprehensive Building  Plan and its updates, we reviewed the initial 1995 Comprehensive Building  Plan and subsequent updates to the plan. We developed a list of capital  projects the Kennedy Center reported it was planning to complete. We  discussed with Kennedy Center officials the project status and cost  information for these projects and other projects that it had completed  with federal funds appropriated for capital projects since fiscal year 1995.  We reviewed the Kennedy Center\u2019s annual financial statements and  supporting capital project schedules. We determined that the information  provided for project costs appeared reasonable based on the annual capital  expenditures and capital projects in progress listed in the financial  statements. We toured the Kennedy Center and visually saw many of the  projects listed in the Building Plan. We also interviewed the Kennedy  Center\u2019s external auditor to determine what testing was performed on  internal controls over federal expenditures. Thus, we determined that  project status and cost data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  review. Finally, we compared the information the Kennedy Center provided  on the status of the capital projects in the Building Plan and its updates and  capital appropriations received since fiscal year 1995 to evaluate the  likelihood that the plan would be fully implemented as planned by the end  of fiscal year 2008. We did not evaluate whether individual capital projects  were completed within their original budgets or on schedule.", "To determine the potential impact of the Center\u2019s proposed plaza project on  the need for future federal funds, we calculated the potential operations  and maintenance (O&M) costs based on data from a survey of museum  facility management practices and the Kennedy Center\u2019s projected O&M  rates. Kennedy Center officials provided data for five categories of O&M  expenses for six Washington, D.C., museums based on a 2002 museum  benchmarking survey of facility management practices conducted by  Facility Management Services Ltd. Since one of the buildings in the  proposed plaza project will contain space that the Center officials said  would be maintained at the same level as a museum, we agreed that it was  appropriate to use museums in Washington, D.C., to estimate the potential  O&M costs. We estimated the potential O&M rate for the proposed plaza  project by averaging the aggregate O&M costs for the six museums. We  used the average O&M costs to develop our estimate because the proposed  plaza project is still in the early planning phase and many factors, including  the size of the buildings, could change before designs are finalized. The  Kennedy Center officials\u2019 projections were based on its current O&M costs  and the O&M cost data for six museums in Washington, D.C., described  above. Kennedy Center officials believe that the new buildings will cost at  least as much to maintain and operate per square foot as the current  Center. They could not identify any category of O&M expenses they  believed would be less expensive to operate than the current building. The  Center officials said they disregarded the information from the museums  with the highest and lowest O&M costs and projected O&M costs on the  basis of data from the other four museums. According to the officials, they  adjusted the rates for the different categories that make up the O&M costs,  based on a number of factors, such as the size of the other museums  relative to the proposed new plaza project. For example, the Center  officials said they increased the expected cost of grounds maintenance  over the other museums because the proposed plaza project includes a  large fountain, which will be expensive to maintain. In addition, because  the plaza will be suspended over a roadway, all of the plants will have to be  in containers, which will also increase operations and maintenance costs.  Since there are a wide variety of types of proposed space in the buildings,  ranging from museum space to rehearsal rooms, the Kennedy Center  officials said they averaged rates based on the different types of space. We  independently researched building industry groups\u2019 rates, including the  Building Owners and Managers Association and the International Facility  Management Association, but did not identify any O&M rates that would  have been appropriate to use for the type of space planned for the  proposed plaza buildings. We discussed the methodology used in  conducting the museum survey with Facility Management Services Ltd and  discussed the measures incorporated into the survey to maximize accuracy  of the data. We determined that the data on O&M costs for the six  Washington, D.C., area museums is reliable for purposes of this report and  that the Kennedy Center\u2019s estimated rates were rational given the currently  available information.", "We conducted our work from January 2004 through July 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Kennedy Center Capital Projects", "paragraphs": ["The following tables show the cost or expected cost of the Kennedy  Center\u2019s capital projects as identified in its Comprehensive Building Plan  and its updates.
