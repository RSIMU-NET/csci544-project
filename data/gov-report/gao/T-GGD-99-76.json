These requirements, of which there are nearly 140, range across income taxes, excise taxes, and information reporting. (For a complete list see tables I.4, I.5, and I.6 in app. I.)

Also, businesses must complete Form 4562 to claim deductions for depreciation and amortization of business assets or to make the election to immediately expense the cost of certain property.

Although business officials and tax experts we have interviewed for past work identified considerable anecdotal examples of such compliance costs, the businesses told us that they did not routinely need, nor did they keep, information on these costs. A reason may be that business tax compliance strategies are usually not done in isolation of other business operations.

Now that IRS is to be structured along taxpayer lines, its information systems need to reflect the new environment. They should provide managers and employees with convenient access to reliable up-to-date information on all relevant transactions between taxpayers and IRS. For example, the type of information we sought presumably would be the type that managers would need to know about small business taxpayers and understand their problems\u2014including the source of the problems. If this kind of information about small businesses is not readily available or in a form suitable for analysis, it will be more difficult for unit managers to devise effective strategies to target resources and improve service. several delinquencies have occurred. Confusion may result over what has been paid and what remains due. Such confusion may be particularly difficult to resolve if IRS and the taxpayer are corresponding over a protracted period. Also, interest on any tax liability due would continue to accrue and could eventually come to equal or exceed the amount owed.", "Employment tax situations like this illustrate how fragmented account information can make it difficult for IRS to work with taxpayers to resolve their problems and can frustrate taxpayers seeking to settle their account by paying the taxes owed.

IRS expects to develop a way of linking a customer identifier to the case information in 35 of its most important information systems.

Nor will it be easy or inexpensive to put in place. As with IRS\u2019 initiative to make its information systems Year 2000 compliant, the workaround will affect a large number of systems and involve many steps to program, implement, and validate. Nevertheless, IRS may not have a choice as it will remain hamstrung in its efforts to assist taxpayers in complying with tax laws until its systems are replaced. without adequate systems, IRS was forced to use ad hoc programming and substantial manual intervention to overcome pervasive internal control and systems weaknesses. However, these costly and time-consuming efforts could not be duplicated for fiscal year 1998 due to IRS\u2019 loss of key Chief Financial Officer staff who were managing the preparation of its administrative financial statements.
