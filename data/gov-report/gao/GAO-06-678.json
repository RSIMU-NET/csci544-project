Industry observers noted that increased restatements were an expected byproduct of the greater focus on the quality of financial reporting by company management, audit committees, external auditors, and regulators. GAO also observed the following trends: (1) cost- or expense-related reasons accounted for 38 percent of the restatements, including lease accounting issues, followed in frequency by revenue recognition issues; and (2) most restatements (58 percent) were prompted by an internal party such as management or internal auditors. In the wake of increased restatements, SEC standardized disclosure requirements by requiring companies to file a specific item on the Form 8-K when a company's previously reported financials should no longer be relied upon. However, between August 2004-September 2005, about 21 percent of the companies GAO identified as restating did not appear to file the proper disclosure when they announced their intention to restate. These companies continued to announce intentions to restate previous financial statements results in a variety of other formats. Although representing about 0.4 percent of the market capitalization of the major exchanges, which was $17 trillion in 2005, the market capitalization of companies announcing restatements between July 2002 and September 2005 decreased $63 billion when adjusted for market movements ($43 billion unadjusted) in the days around the initial restatement announcement. Researchers generally agree that restatements can negatively affect overall investor confidence, but it is unclear what effects restatements had on confidence in 2002-2005. Some researchers noted that investors might have grown less sensitive to the announcements. Others postulated that investors had more difficulty discerning whether restatements represented a response to aggressive or abusive accounting practices, complex accounting standards, remediation of past accounting deficiencies, or technical adjustments. Although researchers generally agree that restatements can have a negative effect on investor confidence, the surveys, indexes, and other proxies for investor confidence that GAO reviewed did not indicate definitively whether investor confidence increased or decrease since 2002. As was the case in the 2002 report, a significant portion of SEC's enforcement activities involved accounting- and auditing-related issues. Enforcement cases involving financial fraud- and issuer-reporting issues ranged from about 23 percent of total actions taken to almost 30 percent in 2005. Of the actions resolved between March 1, 2002, and September 30, 2005, about 90 percent were brought against public companies or their directors, officers, and employees, or related parties; the other 10 percent involved accounting firms and individuals involved in the external audits of these companies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This reissued report reflects the appropriate conversions for foreign companies and  amends our market capitalization calculations and impact analysis.

Federal securities laws help to protect the investing public by  requiring public companies to disclose financial and other information.  SEC was established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange  Act) to operationalize and enforce securities laws and oversee the integrity  and stability of the market for publicly traded securities. SEC is the primary  federal agency involved in accounting requirements for publicly traded  companies. Under Section 108 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, SEC has  recognized the accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting  Standards Board (FASB)\u2014generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP)\u2014as \u201dgenerally accepted\u201d for the purposes of the federal securities  laws. SEC reviews and comments on registrant filings and issues  interpretive guidance and staff accounting bulletins on accounting matters.", "To issue securities for trading on an exchange, a public company must  register the securities offering with SEC, and to register, the company must  meet requirements set by the Exchange Act, as amended, including the  periodic disclosure of financial and other information important to  investors. The regulatory structure of U.S. markets is premised on a  concept of corporate governance that makes officers and directors of a  public company responsible for ensuring that the company\u2019s financial  statements fully and accurately describe its financial condition and the  results of its activities. Company financial information is publicly disclosed  in financial statements that are to be prepared in accordance with  standards set by FASB and guidance issued by SEC. The integrity of these  financial statements is essential if they are to be useful to investors and  other stakeholders.", "In addition to the requirements and standards previously discussed, the  securities acts and subsequent law set requirements for annual audits of  the financial statements by registered public accounting firms to help  ensure the integrity of financial statements. The applicable standards under  these laws require that auditors plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of  material misstatement. An audit includes an examination, on a test basis, of  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements; an assessment of the accounting principles used and  significant estimates made by management; and an evaluation of the  overall financial statement presentation. The purpose of the auditor\u2019s  report is to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of  the company, the results of its operations, and its cash flows, in conformity  with U.S. GAAP.", "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act reinforces principles and strengthens  requirements (established in previous law), including measures for  improving the accuracy, reliability, and transparency of corporate financial  reporting. Specifically, Section 302 requires that the chief executive officer  (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) must certify for each annual and  quarterly report filed with SEC that they have reviewed the report; the  report does not contain untrue statements or omissions of a material fact;  and the financial information in the report is fairly presented. In addition,  Section 404 requires company management to annually (1) assess its  internal control over financial reporting and report the results to SEC and  (2) have a registered public accounting firm attest to and report on  management\u2019s assessment of effectiveness of internal control over  financial reporting. While larger public companies have implemented  Section 404, most companies with less than $75 million in public float\u2014 about 60 percent of all public companies\u2014have yet to complete this  process. (See app. IV for further discussion of the act.)", "To oversee the auditing of publicly traded companies, the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act established PCAOB, a private-sector nonprofit organization. Subject to  SEC oversight, PCAOB sets standards for, registers, and inspects the  independent public accounting firms that audit public companies and has  the authority to conduct investigations and disciplinary proceedings and  impose sanctions for violations of law or PCAOB rules and standards.  Specifically, Section 105 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act granted PCAOB broad  investigative and disciplinary authority over registered public accounting  firms and persons associated with such firms. In May 2004, SEC approved  PCAOB\u2019s rules implementing this authority. According to the rules, PCAOB  staff may conduct investigations concerning any acts or practices, or  omissions to act, by registered public accounting firms and persons  associated with such firms, or both, that may violate any provision of the  act, PCAOB rules, the provisions of the securities laws relating to the  preparation and issuance of audit reports and the obligations and liabilities  of accountants with respect thereto, including SEC rules issued under the  act, or professional standards. Furthermore, PCAOB\u2019s rules require  registered public accounting firms and their associated persons to  cooperate with PCAOB investigations, including producing documents and  providing testimony.

In addition, of the  1,390 announced restatements we identified, the percentage of large  companies announcing restatements has continued to grow since 2002.While large and small companies restate their financial results for varying  reasons, change in cost- or expense-related items, which includes lease  accounting issues, was the most frequently cited reason for restating. While  both internal and external parties could prompt restatements, internal  parties such as company management or internal auditors prompted the  majority of restatement announcements. Finally, we found that, despite  SEC\u2019s efforts to create a more transparent mechanism for disclosing  restatements through revisions to Form 8-K, some companies had not  properly filed such disclosures and continued to announce intentions to  restate previous financial statements results in a variety of other formats."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Number of Restatement Announcements Grew since 2002, as Did the Number of Listed Companies Restating", "paragraphs": ["The number of annual announcements of financial restatements generally  increased, from 314 in 2002 to 523 in 2005 (through September)\u2014an  increase of approximately 67 percent (see fig. 2).

The researchers used somewhat different search  methodologies to identify companies that restate previously reported  financial information and included slightly different criteria for inclusion  but arrived at similar conclusions. The Huron Consulting Group (HCG)  identified 1,067 financial statement restatements from 2002 to 2004 and  noted that the increase was significant from 2003 to 2004. Also, Glass,  Lewis & Co.

Likewise, the average market capitalization of a company announcing a  restatement (for which we had data) has grown from under $3 billion (with  a median of $277 million) in the latter half of 2002 to over $10 billion (with a  median of $682 million) through September 2005.

Cost- or expense-related issues  surpassed revenue recognition issues as the most frequently identified  cause of restatements primarily because of a large number of  announcements made in early 2005 to correct accounting for leases by the  retail/restaurant industry and tax-related issues. For example, 135 public  companies announced restatements involving issues solely related to  accounting for leases in 2005 after SEC chief accountant\u2019s February 7, 2005,  letter regarding the treatment of certain leases and leasehold  improvements.

In the remaining 18 percent of the announcements (compared with 35  percent in our 2002 report), we were not able to determine who prompted  the restatement because the announcement or SEC filing did not clearly  state who discovered the misstatement of the company\u2019s prior financial  results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While SEC Revised Its Forms to Make Disclosures of Certain Restatements More Uniform, Many Companies Continue to File in Other Formats", "paragraphs": ["SEC has revised Form 8-K, in part, to make information on financial  restatements more uniform and apparent to investors, but many companies  appeared to have filed potentially deficient filings. In addition, conflicting  instructions and guidance resulted in some companies disclosing similar  financial information in varying degrees and formats. In a 2003 report  required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, SEC proposed to address the lack of  uniformity by amending several of its periodic disclosure forms\u2014 essentially to make issuers\u2019 public notification of financial information  uniform. Specifically, in its report, SEC proposed to amend Form 8-K to  add a specific line item for public companies to disclose what was restated  and why.", "In March 2004, consistent with its proposal in the 2003 report, SEC  amended Form 8-K to, among other things, add a new line item (Item 4.02),  which requires public companies to file the Form 8-K (Item 4.02) within 4  business days if management or the company\u2019s independent auditors  determine that previously issued financial statements should not be relied  upon. This alerts investors to potentially important company events that  may impact their investment decision. This change became effective  August 23, 2004. This change to Form 8-K included a limited safe harbor for  failure to timely file an 8-K in certain situations, including in a situation in  which the company makes the determination the financial statements may  not be relied upon, but not in a situation when the independent auditor  makes such a determination.", "In November 2004, SEC issued additional guidance to address questions  concerning the revised disclosures. This \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d  guidance states that a Form 8-K is required for Item 4.01 (Change in  Accountant) and Item 4.02 events, even if a periodic report such as a Form  10-K or 10-Q disclosing such information is filed during the 4 business days  following the event. The amended forms and the amended rules do not  make this Form 8-K filing requirement clear, and instead indicate that the  filing of a Form 8-K may not be required if previously reported.

It  appears that these companies either failed to disclose the announced  restatement at all or disclosed it in a Form 10-K or 10-Q or an amended  form. The remaining 77 companies filed a Form 8-K disclosing their  restatement, but under items other than the required 4.02\u2014such as 2.02  (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or 8.01 (Other Events).  Furthermore, we found that the companies filing these potentially deficient  filings included a mix of large and small companies. For example, over one- third of the 111 companies we identified were large companies (as  measured by market capitalization, asset size, or revenue). Moreover, a  study by Glass Lewis found that about one-third of companies restating in  calendar year 2005 did not file a Form 8-K (Item 4.02) to notify investors, or  the public in general, about such a corporate event."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Market Capitalization of Restating Companies Decreased by Billions in the Days Surrounding Restatement Announcements, but Was Less Severe Than in Our Prior Report", "paragraphs": ["We estimated that\u2014from the trading day before through the trading day  after an initial restatement announcement\u2014stock prices of the restating  companies decreased by an average of almost 2 percent, compared with an  average decline of nearly 10 percent in our 2002 report.

These declines, while potentially  significant for the investors involved, if realized, represented about 0.2  percent of the total market capitalization of the three securities exchanges,  which was about $17 trillion in 2005. The reasons for restatements also  appear to have affected the severity of the impact on market capitalization,  with restatements for reasons that could involve financial reporting fraud  or other unspecified causes resulting in the most severe size-adjusted  market reaction on average. However, revenue issues continued to have a  sizeable impact and, in a change from our previous report, cost- or  expense-related restatements had the greatest impact in dollar terms  because there are more of them.

But, when the losses were  adjusted for general movements in the overall market, the market  capitalization of the restating companies decreased an estimated $36  billion.", "In our prior report, we found that the immediate impact was an average  decline in stock price of nearly 10 percent and a decline, both adjusted and  unadjusted, in market capitalization of around $100 billion. Thus, in total,  the immediate impact for July 2002\u20132005 appeared to be less severe. The  smaller average decline in stock price (a 2 percent decline compared with a  nearly 10 percent decline) suggested that the market\u2019s reaction for each  company, on average, was not as severe. On an annual basis, and when not  adjusted for market movements, in the current report the average annual  decline was $5.4 billion, compared with $18.2 billion, in our 2002 report.  However, when market-adjusted, the average decline was $11.2 billion over  the analysis period for this report, compared with an average $17.4 billion  decline for the period covered in our prior report. The increased severity of  the market-adjusted immediate impact on market capitalization likely  reflected the more negative reaction to a restatement announcement given  the generally positive overall market movement during the 2003\u20132005 period, and could also reflect the fact that more, larger companies  announced restatements in the July 2002\u20132005 period.", "The immediate impact on the market capitalization of restating companies,  while potentially large for the investors involved, if realized, generally was  less than 0.2 percent of the total market capitalization of companies listed  on NYSE, Nasdaq, and Amex for a given year during 2002\u20132005, ranging in  magnitude from 0.01 percent to 0.14 percent (see table 4). That the  immediate impact\u2014as a percentage of total market capitalization\u2014would  appear relatively small is not surprising, considering the short trading day  interval that we analyzed.

Later in this report, we examine losses over longer periods,  as well as the effects of restatements on overall market confidence.", "While our analysis generally showed declines in market capitalization, the  results for the second half of 2002 were positive and can be explained in  large part by the influence of two large companies\u2014Tyco International Ltd.

In the cases of Tyco and AOL, both of which involved revenue  recognition issues, the restatement announcements came weeks or months  after initial news of potential accounting fraud and errors surfaced, and so  the market had likely already anticipated these announcements and  factored the information into the companies\u2019 stock prices well before the  restatement announcement. Over the 3 trading days surrounding the  announcement dates that we identified, Tyco\u2019s market capitalization  increased by around $2.8 billion and AOL\u2019s market capitalization increased  by around $1.6 billion.", "We also conducted a separate analysis of the immediate impact of  restatement announcements for the 329 announcements that we were  unable to analyze in the primary event study.

We were able to gather  sufficient data to analyze 242 of the 329 announcements (114  announcements made by listed companies and 128 announcements made  by unlisted companies). We estimated that, on average, these restatement  announcements resulted in an average decline in market capitalization of  1.5 percent from the trading day before the announcement through the  trading day after the announcement, reflecting an unadjusted decline of  about $3.7 billion in addition to the nearly $18 billion decline estimated in  the primary event study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons That Could Involve Reporting Fraud or Other Unspecified Issues, and Revenue Recognition Issues Continued to Significantly Impact Market Capitalization; but Cost or Expense Issues Produced Greater Dollar Losses", "paragraphs": ["Announcements made for reasons that could involve financial reporting  fraud or other unspecified causes, which we classified in the Other  category, as well as restructuring and revenue recognition-related issues,  had the largest negative impact on market capitalization when adjusted for  the size of a restating company (see fig. 6); however, when measured in  dollars, cost- or expense-related restatement announcements accounted  for more of the immediate decline in market capitalization than each of the  other reasons, over our analysis period. These results are different from  the findings in our earlier report, suggesting that the nature of the market  response to restatements may have changed in some respects.

To assess the immediate market impact  of a given type of restatement on a restating company\u2019s market  capitalization, we computed the ratio of the estimated change in the  company\u2019s market capitalization to the company\u2019s total market  capitalization over the 3 trading days surrounding the announcement of a  restatement. We then averaged these impacts for each reason.", "While restatement announcements involving related-party transactions,  which can revolve around revenue issues, appeared to have the largest  negative impact, this result was not statistically different from zero. This  category accounted for a relatively small number of restatements, and the  results were heavily influenced by three announcements that had sizeable  market reactions.", "In contrast to our previous report, in which positive responses to two large  restatements attributed to restructuring, asset impairment, and inventory  issues led to market gains in that category, restatements made for these  reasons in 2002\u20132005 represented about 29 percent of the market-adjusted  market capitalization losses. These reasons accounted for about 11 percent  of the cases we analyzed, and the median size of a company restating for  these reasons was $504 million.", "The effect of restatements announced for revenue recognition issues on  market capitalization initially appeared weaker than in our previous report.  Restatements involving revenue recognition accounted for almost 20  percent of the cases, but only around 10 percent of the market-adjusted  market capitalization losses. The median size of a company restating for  this reason was $321 million; thus it appears that companies announcing  restatements for revenue recognition reasons tended to be smaller.  However, when adjusted by the size of the restating company, restatement  announcements involving revenue recognition issues (more than many  other reasons) resulted in an average loss that represented a larger  percentage of a restating company\u2019s market capitalization.", "Cost- or expense-related restatements had a greater effect on market  capitalization than in our previous report, and were distinguished from  restatements for other reasons in three ways. First by dollars, cost- or  expense-related restatement announcements accounted for more of the  immediate declines in market capitalization than other reasons over our  analysis period. More specifically, cost- or expense-related restatement  announcements accounted for $15.2 billion, or about 42 percent, of the  $36.5 billion in total losses (market-adjusted) over our analysis period. This  decline was driven in large part by the January 9, 2004, restatement  announcements by Shell Transport and Trading Company, plc, and Royal  Dutch Petroleum Company, which represented a decline in estimated  market capitalization attributed to the cost- or expense category of over $4  billion. Second, when measured by median market capitalization,  companies announcing restatements involving cost or expense issues were  the largest. The median size of a company restating for cost or expense reasons was $632 million. Furthermore, of the 1,061 cases analyzed, cost or  expense was the most frequently cited reason for restating (38 percent).", "Finally, the market did not perceive all restatements negatively. We found  that announcements involving the acquisition and merger category\u2014with a  median company size of $318 million\u2014resulted in an overall increase of  over $1.5 billion in market capitalization. The positive results are in  significant contrast to our previous report, in which we attributed more  than $19 billion in market capitalization decline to this category."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restatement Announcements Continued to Have Some Longer-Term Impact on the Market Capitalization of Restating Companies", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of restatement announcements showed mixed results over  intermediate and longer periods, but these announcements overall tended  to have some longer-term impacts. On a market-adjusted basis, from 20  trading days before through 20 trading days after a restatement  announcement (the intermediate impact), we estimated that the stock  prices of restating companies declined by nearly 2 percent on average, and  their market capitalization declined by over $78 billion in aggregate;  whereas, on an unadjusted basis, the market capitalization of restating  companies decreased around $5 billion (see table 5). This suggests that  the reaction was more negative than expected given the movement in the  overall market.", "On a market-adjusted basis, from 60 trading days before through 60 trading  days after the announcement (the longer-term impact), we estimated that  the stock prices of restating companies decreased by less than 2 percent on  average and their market capitalization decreased by over $126 billion in  aggregate (see table 6). Unadjusted, the longer-term impact was an increase  of about $34 billion in the market capitalization of restating companies. In  our 2002 report, we estimated that the unadjusted market capitalization of  restating companies that we analyzed decreased by close to $240 billion  from 60 trading days before through 60 trading days after the  announcement. This large difference may be the result of the generally  positive overall market movement during 2003\u20132005, an increased number  of restatements that the market did not view negatively, or the possibility  that the financial markets have grown increasingly less sensitive to  restatement announcements since 2002.", "As we considered longer event time frames, this increased the possibility  that other factors and events may have affected a restating company\u2019s  stock price. Nevertheless, expanding the event window beyond the  immediate trading days around the restatement announcement date  allowed us to assess the longer-term impact of restatement  announcements. The longer time frame also allowed us to capture any  impact from earlier company announcements, which may have signaled  restatements (for example, a company\u2019s CFO departing a company  suddenly, its outside audit firm resigning, or the notice of an internal or  SEC investigation at the company). With such events, investors may sense  that more negative news is forthcoming and drive the company\u2019s stock  price lower. For example, speculation about potential accounting problems  at AOL first appeared publicly in mid-July 2002 in The Washington Post;  however, it was not until mid-August that the company announced that it  would restate. Our immediate impact analysis around the August 14, 2002,  announcement date revealed a sizeable positive impact. However, our  intermediate impact analysis showed that the market reacted negatively to  the release of the news over this event window.", "Finally, our analysis only attempts to control for overall market  movements, and so for these longer periods we cannot adjust for other  factors such as company-specific news unrelated to the restatement. For  example, several weeks after announcing a restatement a company could  win a lucrative contract or be the target of an acquisition, both of which  would likely have a positive impact on its stock price. We subsumed the  impacts of any additional, unrelated events that occurred during this time  period, which would attribute them to the restatement announcement.

For example, some researchers have noted that, since  2002, investors may have had more difficulty discerning whether a  restatement represented a response to aggressive or abusive accounting  practices, constituted remediation of past accounting deficiencies, or  merely represented technical adjustments.

For example, some analysts have suggested that  investors may not have been able to discern whether restatements since  2002 represented a response to: aggressive or abusive accounting practices,  the complexity of accounting standards, the remediation of past  accounting deficiencies, or just technical adjustments.", "Some analysts indicated that the increase in the restatements is a serious  problem with negative consequences on investor confidence. Other  analysts have said that restatements might have minimal (or positive)  effects on confidence if investors saw them as a remediation of accounting  problems existing prior to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  recognizing some restatements as the expected byproduct of a greater  focus on the quality of financial reporting by management, audit  committees, external auditors, and regulators since 2002.

In that vein, others noted that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the  collapse of Arthur Andersen, and perceived litigation risks have  encouraged more conservative approaches that resulted in restatements to  correct small errors or technical adjustments that likely were irrelevant to  investors. Some believed that at least a portion of the restatements since  2002 have resulted from excessive complexity in accounting principles or  the second-guessing of legitimate judgment calls that did not appear  relevant to the valuations of the companies involved.

The  major reasons cited for the decline were (1) the price of energy, including  gas and oil; (2) the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries; (3) the federal  budget deficit; (4) the situation in Iraq; and (5) the economic impact of  Hurricane Katrina and other storms. While some of these reasons reflect  current events, others consistently were viewed as less important than  accounting issues in the 2002, 2003, and 2004 surveys.

Although the indexes do not all  move in the same direction over time, or even approximately so, the  indexes generally show a small improvement in institutional investor  confidence over the value for June 2002, but a slight decline in individual  investor confidence with one exception. Some of the Yale indexes show  pronounced volatility in short-term confidence. In fact, there were periods  during 2003, 2004, and 2005, where some measures of confidence declined  significantly before rebounding in 2006. Although these confidence indexes  did not directly measure the impact of restatements on investor  confidence, they illustrate the difficulty in attempting to gauge general  confidence in the market and how different classes of investors can  interpret and respond to events in different ways.", "As in 2002, we focused on the three indexes that most directly measured  investor confidence. The first Yale index is the One-Year Confidence Index,  which indicated that institutional investor confidence fluctuated between  June 2002 and May 2006, but ended higher than 2002 levels. During the  same periods, individual investor confidence also fluctuated, but continued  to trend downward. This implies a divergence in opinion between  individual and institutional investors, but it is unclear what this difference  means for overall confidence in the stock market and how restatements  affect confidence. These findings do appear to suggest that developments  during 2004 and 2005 had some longer-term negative effect on individual  investors\u2019 confidence, but that any negative effect on institutional  investors\u2019 confidence was temporary.", "The second Yale index is the Buy on Dip Confidence Index, which suggests  confidence has been virtually unaffected despite fluctuations in both  directions from 2004 to 2005. Since the period immediately after  September 11, 2001, and the beginning of the Enron scandal, a few months  later individual and institutional confidence that the stock market would  rise the day after a sharp fall has diverged, with institutional dropping and  individual confidence rising somewhat. However, between December 2003  and May 2006, institutional investor confidence increased from 57 to 68  percent, somewhat above its June 2002 value (62 percent), while individual  investor confidence fluctuated up and down but eventually settled just 1  percentage point below its June 2002 value.

Despite remaining low since October 2002, when the  market reached its lowest point in 6 years, confidence has shown a distinct  increase for both individual and institutional investors. Specifically, by May  2006 this index showed an improvement from June 2002 values, with a 43  percent and a 17 percent increase for institutional and individual investors,  respectively. However, confidence in the probability that a catastrophic  stock market crash would not occur in the United States may provide very  little insight into whether market participants are confident in the  reliability of financial information transmitted to investors, because not  even the accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002 triggered a major collapse in  market valuations.

Accounting-related  violations identified included fraud, lying to auditors, filing misleading  information with SEC, and failing to maintain proper books and records.  Investigations can lead to SEC-prompted administrative or federal civil  court actions. Depending on the type of proceeding, SEC can seek  sanctions that include injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement,  cease-and-desist orders, suspensions of registration, bars from appearing  before the Commission, and bars from participating as an officer or  director of a public company. As previously reported, most enforcement  actions are settled, with respondents generally consenting to the entry of  civil, judicial, or administrative orders without admitting or denying the  allegations against them. We found this to be true of the auditing- and  accounting-related cases we reviewed as well. For a more detailed  discussion of SEC\u2019s enforcement process, see appendix VII.", "About 90 percent of the more than 750 actions resolved between March  2002 and September 2005 were brought against companies or their  directors, officers, employees, or other parties. Another 10 percent  involved audit firms and individuals associated with firms, including audit  managers, partners, and engagement auditors. In the cases involving public  companies and their officials and related persons, we found that SEC has  taken a variety of actions against a wide range of officials and employees.  Historically, SEC was reluctant to seek civil monetary penalties against  companies in financial fraud cases because such costs would be passed  along to shareholders who had already suffered as a result of the violations.  In the AAERs reviewed from March 2002 to September 2005, we found that  SEC started to take increasingly aggressive actions against public  companies, including the levy of millions of dollars in civil money penalties  in 2003 and 2004. However, SEC\u2019s position on civil money penalties against  public companies continued to evolve. In January 2006, SEC outlined its  position on this issue when it announced the filing of two settled actions  against McAfee, Inc. and Applix, Inc. In one case the company paid a civil  money penalty and in the other, the company did not. According to the  release, SEC thought it was important to \u201cprovide the maximum possible  degree of clarity, consistency, and predictability in explaining the way that  its corporate penalty authority will be exercised.\u201d The release discussed  how the Sarbanes-Oxley Act changed the ultimate disposition of penalties,  because SEC can now take penalties paid by individuals and entities in  enforcement actions and add them to disgorgements for the benefit of  victims through the Fair Funds provision. Under this provision, civil  money penalties that SEC collects no longer go to the Department of  Treasury; instead, they can be used to help compensate victims for the  losses they experienced, which would include harmed shareholders.", "The Commission announced that it planned to more closely review actions  involving civil money penalties against public companies and laid out the  principles it planned to follow in making such determinations. The  overarching principle appears to be that corporate penalties are an  essential part of an aggressive and comprehensive enforcement program.  In addition, SEC\u2019s view of the appropriateness of the penalty against  corporations versus the individuals who actually commit the violations is  to be based on two considerations. First, SEC considers whether the  corporation received a direct benefit as a result of the violations (e.g., the  violation resulted in reduced expenses or higher revenues). Second, the  degree to which the penalty will recompensate or further harm injured  shareholders. Other factors, SEC will consider are:  the need to deter the particular type of offense,  the extent of the injury to innocent parties,  whether complicity in the violation is widespread throughout the   the level of intent on the part of perpetrators,  the degree of difficulty in detecting the particular type of offense,  the presence or lack of remedial steps by the corporation, and  the extent of cooperation with the Commission and other law  In our 2002 report, we also noted that Congress, market participants, and  others, had questioned the lack of severity of many of the sanctions given  the level of investor harm. At least one SEC official, at the time, felt that  because monetary penalties are often paid by officer and director  insurance policies, or are considered insignificant in relation to the  violation, SEC should pursue more officer and director bars. However, the  test for imposing officer and director bars was viewed as too restrictive.  Since that time, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act changed the threshold for seeking  officer and director bars by amending the securities acts\u2019 requirement from  \u201csubstantial unfitness\u201d to \u201cunfitness,\u201d thereby making it easier for SEC to  pursue officer and director bars. From March 2002 through September  2005, SEC obtained officer and director bars against hundreds of officials.  Specifically, SEC resolved charges against hundreds of CFOs or chief  accounting officers and CEOs with securities fraud or issuer reporting  violations between March 2002 and December 2005. See appendixes IX, XI,  and XII for a summary of the actions taken by SEC in three of the six cases  we analyzed.", "SEC may also bring an enforcement action against other individuals such  as officers and principals who are not part of top management (other  participants and responsible parties). In the AAERs we reviewed, SEC  charged such individuals with accounting-related violations that resulted in  injunctions, civil monetary penalties, disgorgements, cease-and-desist  orders; and officer and director bars. For example, SEC and in some cases  the Department of Justice, have filed suit against several senior officers at  public companies\u2014including chairmen, chief operating officers,  controllers, directors, vice presidents, and clients. These executives have  been charged with securities law violations such as fraud, reporting  violations, record-keeping violations, and insider trading.", "Although the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provided PCAOB enforcement authority  over registered public accounting firms and their associated persons  (which we discuss below), SEC continues to have the authority to bring  actions against accounting firms. In addition to investigating violations of  the securities laws, Enforcement investigates improper professional  conduct by accountants and other professionals who appear before SEC,  and the agency may pursue administrative disciplinary proceedings against  these professionals under SEC\u2019s Rules of Practice 102(e). If SEC finds that  securities laws have been violated or improper professional conduct has  occurred, it can prohibit professionals from appearing before SEC  temporarily or permanently. A licensed accountant engages in improper  professional conduct if he or she intentionally or knowingly violates an  applicable professional standard or engages in either of the two types of  negligent conduct defined under the rule.

Given the new regulatory and oversight structure, and the current  operating environment, it is unclear if and when the current trend toward  increasing restatements will subside. The number of restatements may  continue to increase in the immediate future, as new areas of scrutiny (for  example, small public company implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  internal control requirements and hedge accounting rules), by SEC and  others, may trigger future restatements similar to the trends experienced  after the focus on accounting for leases or income taxes in early 2005.  Currently, approximately 60 percent of public companies\u2014generally  smaller public companies\u2014have yet to fully implement the internal control  requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could also impact the  number of restatements.

These views, in part, are  supported by some investor confidence data and research including that,  while investor confidence seems to have increased, investors often are  unable to decipher the reason for the restatement; restatements may be  viewed in various ways by investors, depending on whether they believe  that the trend is part of a \u201ccleansing process\u201d (i.e., public companies  strengthening their internal controls), or whether they merely reflect  technical adjustments for compliance.", "SEC improved disclosure of restatement announcements in 2004 by  requiring additional information on Form 8-K. However, some public  companies continue to announce restatements that result in non-reliance  on prior financial statements outside of the required Form 8-K (Item 4.02)  filing process. That is, about 17 percent of companies announcing  restatements that resulted in non-reliance between August 2004 and  September 2005 failed to disclose this information under the appropriate  item or failed to file an 8-K at all. While most filed the information under an  item other than 4.02 in the Form 8-K, some appeared to have disclosed the  information in a Form 10-K or 10-Q, which raises questions inconsistencies  between the Form 8-K instructions versus staff questions-and-answers  discussion concerning filing requirements under Item 4.02. The result of the  potential noncompliance is that some companies continue to restate  without consistently informing investors and the general public that such  restatements have occurred and that previously issued financial statements  should not be relied upon\u2014which raises concerns about compliance with  SEC\u2019s revised Form 8-K disclosure requirements and the ongoing  transparency and consistency of public disclosures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To better enable SEC to enforce its regulations and improve the  consistency and transparency of information provided to investors about  financial restatements, we recommend that SEC take specific actions to  improve oversight and compliance of disclosures of certain restatements.  First, SEC should direct the head of the Division of Corporation Finance to  investigate the instances of potential noncompliance we, and Glass Lewis,  identified, and take appropriate corrective action against any companies  determined to have filed a deficient filing. Second, SEC should harmonize  existing instructions and guidance concerning Item 4.02 by amending the  instructions to Form 8-K and other relevant periodic filings to clearly state  that an Item 4.02 disclosure on Form 8-K is required for all determinations  of non-reliance on previously issued financial statements (Item 4.02),  irrespective of whether such information has been disclosed on a periodic  report or elsewhere."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Chairmen of SEC and PCAOB, for  their review and comment.
