In view of the federal government\u0092s role in promoting the health and welfare of children, the Congress is currently considering a number of proposals aimed in part at increasing the physical activity of youth. To assist the Congress as it considers options for increasing physical activity among students, GAO was asked to review (1) the status of opportunities for elementary and secondary school students to participate in school-based physical education or sports activities; and (2) what challenges schools face in providing physical education and sports opportunities. To conduct this study, GAO reviewed federal survey data; interviewed state, district, and school officials in selected states, as well as federal officials and others with relevant expertise; reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; and reviewed studies on the benefits of physical education and sports for students.", "GAO makes no recommendations in this report.

Specifically, the percentage of schools that offered PE at least 3 days a week decreased from 2000 to 2006, but the percentage of schools that required students in each grade to take some PE increased during the same period. For example, the estimated percentage of schools that required PE in ninth grade increased from 13 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2006. Moreover, states, districts, and schools appear to have increased emphasis on the quality of PE programs, such as helping students develop lifelong fitness skills, according to national data and GAO interviews. Data on high school students show that participation in PE varies by grade level but not by gender or across racial groups. In addition, most state, district, and school officials GAO interviewed said opportunities to participate in interscholastic sports have increased, particularly for girls, and that many schools have responded to increased demand by adding new sports teams over the last few years.", "Schools GAO visited cited several challenges to providing PE and sports opportunities but have found ways to alleviate some of the challenges associated with sports. In particular, school officials said that budget cuts and inadequate facilities have affected their ability to provide PE opportunities. For example, officials from one school district GAO visited reported reducing PE instruction time because of limited funding for instructors. Other schools, such as one where the gym doubled as the cafeteria, lack dedicated space to use for PE. In addition, school officials reported challenges in providing sports opportunities, as issues related to transportation, facilities, and staffing have been compounded by budgetary constraints. For example, officials from some schools said funding to transport students to outside facilities for practices or games was limited. Other school officials cited difficulty in attracting quality coaches because of low pay and the large amount of time involved. Even so, some schools have mitigated some challenges related to sports by relying heavily on outside funding sources such as booster clubs and gate receipts and leveraging community facilities. Additionally, some schools charge student fees for sports activities, which may be a barrier for lower-income students. However, many schools waive such fees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the past 30 years, the rate of childhood obesity has increased  considerably, almost tripling for children aged 6 to 11 years. Along with  this increase, the rate of childhood health problems commonly associated  with obesity, such as hypertension and type II diabetes, has also risen,  leading some policy makers to rank childhood obesity as a critical health  threat. In a 2005 report, we highlighted expert views that increasing  physical activity is the most important strategy in any program aimed at  preventing or reducing childhood obesity. In addition to its positive health  benefits, research on physical activity among children also suggests a  strong correlation between children\u2019s fitness and their academic  performance, as measured by grades in core subjects and scores on  standardized tests. Moreover, some experts contend that physical activity  provides both personal and social benefits, including the development of  leadership skills and increased self-esteem. The Department of Health  and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  state that children aged 6 to 17 years should get at least 60 minutes of  physical activity each day, but the agency acknowledges that most  children do not attain this recommended level.", "Schools are uniquely positioned to be an access point for students to  engage in physical activity through physical education classes and sports  teams.

Toward that  end, CDC promotes the National Association for Sports and Physical  Education\u2019s (NASPE) guidelines for physical education, which  recommend that schools provide 150 minutes per week of physical  education instruction to elementary school students and 225 minutes per  week to middle and high school students.

National data show that a higher percentage of middle schools offered  daily PE than did elementary or high schools. Schools we visited differed  widely in the amount of PE instruction time offered to their students. For  example, only 3 out of 13 schools we visited offered daily PE or its  instructional equivalent. These 3 schools had longer school days, which  officials said made it easier to fit PE into the daily schedule. Among the 4  elementary schools we visited, 1 provided all students a daily 60-minute  PE class, while another provided students just one 30-minute PE class  per week.", "At the same time, the estimated percentage of schools that required  students to take some PE increased at each grade level from 2000 to  2006, particularly for grades at the middle and high school levels,  according to SHPPS data (see fig. 2). For example, the estimated  percentage of schools that required ninth grade students to take PE  increased from 13 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2006.", "Although the amount of PE instruction time has decreased, emphasis on  the quality of PE programs appears to have increased, according to  SHPPS data and comments from officials we interviewed. The  percentage of states that required or encouraged districts or schools to  follow NASPE-based PE standards\u2014such as competency in motor skills  and promotion of responsible personal and social behavior\u2014increased  from 59 percent in 2000 to 76 percent in 2006. In 2006, an estimated 65  percent of schools adopted such standards. District and school officials  with whom we spoke said PE curricula now focus less on traditional  sports in favor of helping students develop lifelong skills. For instance,  three schools we visited offered outdoor adventure-based activities that  helped students develop problem solving and teamwork skills. At one  middle school we visited, PE staff members taught students how to  measure their body mass index and other indicators of fitness. In addition,  some school and district officials we interviewed said offering students  options may increase student participation in PE. For example, officials at  one high school we visited said that each semester students could select  two to three different sports or fitness activities from a range of options\u2014 such as flag football, tennis, or soccer\u2014to fulfill their PE requirement.  School officials noted that students were more engaged in PE because  the options were designed to motivate students across a range of athletic  abilities and interests.

However, some schools allow exemptions for a range of  reasons. According to 2006 SHPPS data, state, district, and school  policies most commonly allowed student exemptions due to long-term  physical or medical disability. Our previous work has shown that students  with disabilities generally attend PE class about the same amount of time  as students without disabilities. In addition, according to 2006 SHPPS  data, most states required schools to implement measures to meet the  PE needs of students with long-term disabilities.

For example, several schools we visited have  added lacrosse and badminton programs as student interest in these  sports has increased. Furthermore, officials from each of the four states  we visited said they had added new sports programs to their statewide  interscholastic competition schedules in response to increased demand.  In particular, many officials we interviewed said opportunities for girls to  participate in school sports have increased over time, due primarily to the  addition of new interscholastic sports teams for girls. For example, one  state official we interviewed noted that while only 49 high schools in the  state offered girls\u2019 soccer in 1986, about 300 high schools offered it in  2010. In addition to interscholastic sports, SHPPS data show that an  estimated 50 percent of elementary schools, 49 percent of middle  schools, and 45 percent of high schools offered intramural or physical  activity clubs in 2006.

Specifically, officials from several of the districts and schools  we visited said budget cuts have affected their ability to hire PE teachers,  maintain appropriate class sizes, and purchase sufficient equipment. In  one district we visited, officials told us that many PE teachers have been  laid off, and some schools in the district have been forced to share a part- time PE instructor. As a result, elementary school PE instruction in the  district has been reduced to as little as 30 minutes every 2-3 weeks, and  a district official told us most elementary and middle schools in the district  are not meeting state requirements for PE instruction. At two elementary  schools we visited, PE instructors expressed a desire to conduct PE  instruction on a daily basis, but cited limited funding as a barrier. Some  schools have also seen increased class sizes as a result of budget cuts.  In some cases, budget cuts have affected the availability and quality of  equipment as well. A PE teacher at one school has stopped including  several sports, such as golf, in her PE classes because the supply of  equipment no longer matches the class size. In the context of limited  funding, some state, district, and school officials expressed the belief that  the greater emphasis on assessments for reading and math, as required   has shifted priorities away  under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001,from PE. In one district we visited, an official said this focus on academic  assessments had led his district to reduce the amount of PE it offers  students.", "Officials at 9 of the 13 schools we visited told us that a lack of adequate  facilities is also a major challenge in providing physical education. For  example, because some schools do not have adequate indoor space,  they may conduct several PE classes in the gymnasium simultaneously,  or use alternative space for their activities. According to SHPPS data, an  estimated 54.9 percent of elementary schools, 37.8 percent of middle  schools, and 25.3 percent of high schools used a cafeteria, auditorium, or  other multipurpose room for indoor physical education in 2006. During our  site visits, we observed several PE classes sharing space and saw  multipurpose facilities being used as gymnasiums. For example, at one  school we visited, the gymnasium also served as the cafeteria. The time it  takes to prepare for, serve, and clean up from lunch limits the school\u2019s  ability to schedule PE classes.", "Several school officials told us they have worked hard to stretch the  limited funding they receive for PE instruction. Some schools partially rely  on federal grant money to help maintain and augment PE opportunities.

In particular, budget cuts have affected transportation and  facilities. Some schools have also struggled to find coaches for their  school sports teams.", "Because interscholastic sports games may involve travel and some  teams practice off-site, schools often need to provide transportation for  athletes. Many school and district officials we spoke with stated that,  because of budget constraints, they had a difficult time providing  transportation to facilitate student participation in after-school sports  activities. According to SHPPS data, an estimated 29 percent of the  schools that offered interscholastic sports in 2006 also provided  transportation home for participating students, up from 21 percent in  2000. For schools that offered intramural activities, an estimated 31  percent of middle schools and 28 percent of high schools provided  transportation home for students. Some school officials told us that  transportation costs, including costs associated with maintenance and  fuel, are a large part of their school\u2019s athletic budget. To help reduce  transportation costs, some schools charge students a fee for  transportation, enlisting parents to provide carpools, or sharing buses with  other athletic teams to transport students to and from athletic events.", "Several school officials we spoke with stated that budget cuts and space  constraints have affected their ability to provide adequate facilities and  equipment for sports opportunities. Some smaller schools do not have  access to baseball or football fields or other facilities for team sports. In  addition, some schools use off-site locations for practices and events due  to the lack of space or adequate facilities. Furthermore, some schools,  particularly schools in densely populated communities, lack the necessary  space to expand their facilities. Moreover, officials at one school we  visited said they were prohibited from building new athletic fields or  expanding because of land use restrictions. To mitigate some of these  challenges, several schools we visited have developed partnerships with  local businesses, colleges, nonprofits, or community recreational centers  to use their facilities for various sports programs. For example, several  schools have agreements to use community athletic fields and other  facilities for baseball, football, soccer, and swimming programs. In  addition to space constraints, some school officials cited aging or  insufficient equipment as a challenge to providing sports opportunities.  For example, an official from one school told us the school had to  implement a selection policy for the football program, in which some  students were cut from the team, because demand exceeded the number  of uniforms and helmets available for players. School officials also cited  the upkeep and maintenance of fields as a challenge given budget  constraints.", "Some state, district, and other officials cited finding quality coaches as a  challenge to providing sports opportunities. Specifically, some officials  told us that fewer faculty members have been coaching sports teams in  recent years. Officials attribute this decline to the low pay and increased  time commitments that are often required to coach a sport. In one state  we visited, an official said over 60 percent of the coaches in the state  were considered \u201cwalk-on coaches\u201d who were not otherwise a part of the  school community. Some officials said that non-faculty coaches may be  less accessible to students. In addition, some schools may have a difficult  time finding coaches for specific sports. For example, one school official  reported difficulty finding cheerleading coaches given the specialized  training needed to coach a cheerleading squad.", "Schools have mitigated some of the budgetary challenges related to  providing sports opportunities by relying heavily on outside funding  sources or charging fees for certain sports activities. Some school  officials we interviewed said their athletics funding depended primarily on  community support or the tax base of their district, both of which fluctuate  with the economy. For example, one district we visited had strong  community support and a high economic tax base. During our site visit,  we observed that schools in this district had numerous and high-quality  facilities and one official mentioned that even the district\u2019s middle schools  had swimming pools. The official added that the tax base has remained  steady, and the district has not experienced some of the challenges that  other school districts face in providing PE and sports opportunities for its  students. However, other schools we visited reported relying heavily on  booster clubs, gate receipts, private donations, and fundraising to fund  their local sports programs. For example, one school official told us that  the school relies heavily on ticket sales from sporting events that may  total as much as $60,000 a year to maintain and fund its sports programs.  Also, some schools with very strong community support benefit from  community fundraising efforts.", "In addition, some school districts have implemented \u201cpay-to-play\u201d  arrangements, in which students are charged a fee to participate in  school sports activities. Specifically, according to SHPPS data, the  percentage of schools that require students to pay an activity fee to  participate in interscholastic sports was an estimated 33 percent in 2006,  which did not differ significantly from the 2000 estimate of 29 percent.addition, the percentage of schools with intramural activities or physical  activity clubs that required students to pay a fee for these activities  increased from an estimated 23 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2006.  However, in two states we visited, officials told us that pay-to-play  arrangements are prohibited in their states. Some officials expressed  concern that pay-to-play arrangements may negatively impact student  participation by serving as a barrier to lower-income students.

Although it appears  schools increasingly acknowledge the benefits of PE by requiring  students to take classes, they have reduced the amount of time spent on  PE instruction. Opportunities to play school sports, however, appear to be  on the rise. While such a trend is encouraging, school-based sports  should augment, rather than replace, the experiences and skills acquired  in PE, which reaches beyond student athletes to the general student  population. A number of challenges inhibit further expansion of school- based PE and sports. At a time when states and districts are operating  under severe fiscal constraints, acquiring resources to provide additional  opportunities is difficult. Although some districts and schools have  developed approaches to partially offset the challenges associated with  providing sports opportunities, challenges associated with providing PE  remain unresolved. Identifying practical ways to increase students\u2019  physical activity may be difficult, but the need to address childhood  obesity\u2014and the opportunity to shore up such efforts in the school  context\u2014serves as a compelling starting point for addressing obesity- related health issues and their associated costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the report to the Departments of Education and  Health and Human Services for review and comment.
