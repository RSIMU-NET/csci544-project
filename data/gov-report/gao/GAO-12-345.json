In response to a mandate, GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD (1) examined its headquarters resources for efficiencies and (2) has complete and reliable headquarters information available for use in making efficiency decisions. For this review, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD\u0092s headquarters resources and information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken some steps to examine its headquarters resources for efficiencies, but additional opportunities for cost savings may exist by further consolidating organizations and centralizing functions. For purposes of the Secretary of Defense\u0092s efficiency initiative, DOD components were asked to focus in particular on headquarters and administrative functions, support activities, and other overhead in their portfolios. DOD\u0092s fiscal year 2012 budget request included several efficiencies related to headquarters organizations or personnel. GAO found that these efficiencies generally fell into two categories: (1) consolidating or eliminating organizations based on geographic proximity or span of control and (2) centralizing overlapping functions and services. The DOD efficiencies that GAO reviewed to reduce headquarters resources are expected by DOD to save about $2.9 billion through fiscal year 2016, less than 2 percent of the $178 billion in savings DOD projected departmentwide. GAO\u0092s work indicates that DOD may be able to find additional efficiencies by further examining opportunities to consolidate organizations or centralize functions at headquarters. DOD may not have identified all areas where reductions in headquarters personnel and operating costs could be achieved because the department was working quickly to identify savings in the fiscal year 2012 budget and used a top-down approach that identified several targets of opportunity to reduce costs, including headquarters organizations, but left limited time for a detailed data-driven analysis. In February 2012, DOD proposed $61 billion in additional savings over fiscal years 2013 to 2017, but provided limited information as to what portions of these savings were specific to headquarters. Without systematic efforts to reexamine its headquarters resources on a more comprehensive basis, DOD may miss opportunities to shift resources away from overhead.", "An underlying challenge facing DOD is that it does not have complete and reliable headquarters information available for use in making efficiency assessments and decisions. According to GAO\u0092s internal control standards, an agency must have relevant, reliable, and timely information in order to run and control its operations. DOD Instruction 5100.73 guides the identification and reporting of headquarters information. However, GAO found that this instruction is outdated and does not identify all headquarters organizations, such as component command headquarters at U.S. Africa Command and certain Marine Corps headquarters. Also, although some of the services and functions performed by contractors could be considered as headquarters activities, the instruction does not address the tracking of contractors that perform these functions. DOD has delayed updating the instruction to allow time for components to adjust to the statutory changes enacted by Congress in 2009 that created new headquarters reporting requirements. According to DOD officials, ever-changing statutory reporting requirements have contributed to DOD\u0092s failure to report to Congress about the numbers of headquarters personnel. As the department did not have reliable headquarters data, DOD compiled related information from other sources to inform its 2010 efficiency initiative. Because of the short timelines given to identify efficiencies and limitations on the sharing of information, this information was not validated before decisions were made. As a result, some of the information used to identify headquarters-related efficiencies was inaccurate and some adjustments in resource allocations will have to be made during implementation to achieve planned savings. Looking to the future, until DOD has updated its instruction to ensure that it has complete and reliable headquarters data, the department will not have the information it needs, which could affect its efforts to direct resources to its main priorities during future budget deliberations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD continue to examine opportunities to consolidate organizations and centralize functions and services and revise DOD Instruction 5100.73 to include all headquarters organizations, specify how contractors performing headquarters functions will be identified and included in reporting, clarify how components are to compile information needed to respond to headquarters reporting requirements, and establish time frames for implementing these actions.

In 2010, the Secretary of Defense also directed  DOD to undertake a departmentwide initiative to assess how the  department is staffed, organized, and operated, with the goal of reducing  excess overhead costs and reinvesting these savings toward sustainment  of DOD\u2019s current force structure and modernizing its weapons portfolio.

Additional headquarters- related efficiencies may be identified by further examining opportunities to  consolidate organizations or centralize functions. To ensure that  appropriate levels of resources are applied to overhead, it is critical for  DOD to have complete and reliable information to use to inform its  decision-making and prioritize its resources.

It further  stated that shortcomings in the instruction have limited impact on the  management of the department. As we noted in our report, the purpose of  the instruction is to establish a system to identify and manage the number  and size of major DOD headquarters activities, and the guidance does  address statutory limitations. However, the instruction certainly has  implications for the management of the department that extend beyond  the need to comply with relevant statutory limits. For example, the  instruction directs the department to take certain steps, including  maintaining an approved list of major DOD headquarters activities, in  order to provide a framework for implementing the DOD policy that major  DOD headquarters activities shall be organized and staffed in a manner  that permits the effective accomplishment of assigned responsibilities with  a minimum number of personnel. Additionally, the department expressed  concerns about revising the definition of major DOD headquarters  activities in DOD Instruction 5100.73 because there are references to that  definition in statute. However, we did not recommend that the department  revise the definition. As noted by the department, section 194 of Title 10  of the United States Code sets out limitations on military and civilian  personnel involved in management headquarters activities or  management headquarters support activities of the defense agencies and  the DOD field activities. The statute specifies that the terms \u201cmanagement  headquarters activities\u201d and \u201cmanagement headquarters support  activities\u201d are to be defined as those terms were defined in the January 7,  1985, version of DOD Directive 5100.73. Our recommendation is not  aimed at revisions to the definition; rather, as explained in our report, the  recommendation is based on the fact that the list of major DOD  headquarters activities found in enclosure 4 of the instruction is outdated.  As such, we disagree with the assertion that updating the guidance  consistent with our recommendations would in any way threaten the  \u201cfoundational basis\u201d prescribed by Title 10 or require statutory relief.  Furthermore, we note that in addition to the administrative change from  directive to instruction in 2009 mentioned by the department, other  revisions have been made to the guidance since 1985, including changes  made in 1999 revising the way the definitions of management  headquarters activities, management headquarters support activities, and  other terminology are presented.", "With regard to specifying how contractors performing major DOD  headquarters activity functions will be identified and included in  headquarters reporting, DOD stated that it submitted a plan to the  congressional defense committees in November 2011 for its Inventory of  Contracts for Services that established both near-term and long-term  actions needed to improve overall visibility and accountability of all  contracted services, including those performed in support of major DOD  headquarters activities. This plan and subsequent guidance issued in  December 2011 describe the steps being taken to account for the level of  effort of contracted support, based on the activity requiring the service.  DOD also noted that aligning contract support with the requiring activity,  as opposed to contracting activity, will ensure that the department can  reflect contractor full-time equivalents, based on direct labor hours  collected from contractors, supporting major DOD headquarters activities.  While we support DOD efforts to improve visibility and accountability of  contracted services, particularly those supporting major DOD  headquarters activities, as noted in our report, DOD does not anticipate  complete reporting on contractor manpower data until 2016. We continue  to believe that DOD should make it a priority to obtain better data on its  contracted services and personnel to enable it to make more informed  management decisions, ensure departmentwide goals and objectives are  achieved, and have the resources to achieve desired outcomes, which  could include reducing overhead.", "With regard to clarifying how components are to compile information  needed to respond to the reporting requirements for major DOD  headquarters activity of Section 1109 of the fiscal year 2010 National  Defense Authorization Act, DOD stated that it has incorporated this  requirement into the Defense Manpower Requirements Report. The  department stated that the DOD components reported aggregate civilian  and military data for inclusion in the fiscal year 2012 Defense Manpower  Requirements Report that will be included in the fiscal year 2013 report  as well. The department also stated that a more accurate reflection of  major DOD headquarters activity data is being incorporated into the  annual Inherently Governmental and Commercial Activities Inventory.
