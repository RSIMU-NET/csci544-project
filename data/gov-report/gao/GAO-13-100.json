GAO reviewed relevant federal and state statutes, regulations, and policy statements, and interviewed officials from CMS and four states selected on the basis of their share of dual-eligible beneficiaries and use of managed care (Arizona, California, Minnesota, and North Carolina).

Within Medicare, enrollment in managed care through the Medicare Advantage (MA) program must always be voluntary, whereas state Medicaid programs can require enrollment in managed care in certain situations. For example, Arizona requires nearly all beneficiaries, including dual-eligible beneficiaries, to enroll in managed care, but in North Carolina all beneficiaries are in FFS. In addition, Medicare and state Medicaid programs require managed care plans to meet certain provider network requirements to ensure beneficiaries have adequate access to covered services. For example, MA plans in rural counties must have at least one primary care provider per 1,000 beneficiaries. Subject to federal parameters, states establish network requirements for their Medicaid programs. For example, in California every plan must have at least one primary care provider per 2,000 beneficiaries. Finally, Medicare and Medicaid also have different appeals processes that do not align with each other. The Medicare appeals process has up to five levels of review for decisions to deny, reduce, or terminate services, with certain differences between FFS and MA. In Medicaid, states can structure appeals processes within federal parameters. States must establish a Medicaid appeals process that provides access to a state fair hearing and Medicaid managed care plans must provide beneficiaries with the right to appeal to the plan, though states can determine the sequence of these appeals. For example, Arizona requires beneficiaries to appeal to the managed care plan first, while a beneficiary in Minnesota may go directly to a state fair hearing without an initial appeal to the managed care plan.", "Both the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers the Medicare program and oversees states' operation of Medicaid programs, and states took a range of compliance and enforcement actions to help ensure that MA and Medicaid managed care organizations complied with their consumer protection requirements. Between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012, CMS took 546 compliance actions against MA organizations on the issues GAO identified as generally related to consumer protections of particular importance to dual-eligible beneficiaries. Compliance actions included notices, warning letters, and requests for corrective action plans (CAP). During the same period, CMS took 22 enforcement actions against MA organizations, including the imposition of 17 civil money penalties--nearly all for late or inaccurate marketing materials. For five serious violations, CMS suspended enrollment into the MA plan and suspended the MA plan's ability to market to beneficiaries. Similarly, states used notices, letters, fines, and CAPs to improve Medicaid managed care plan compliance with Medicaid consumer protection requirements. During the same period, Arizona, California, and Minnesota required managed care plans to undertake 91 corrective action plans, 52 percent of which related to problems with plans' appeals and grievances processes.", "In commenting on a draft of the report, the Department of Health and Human Services noted that the report was an accurate assessment of the programs we reviewed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 9.9 million low-income seniors and persons with disabilities were  enrolled in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2010.

In  fiscal year 2008, dual-eligible beneficiaries accounted for about   17 percent of the Medicare population but 29 percent of Medicare  spending, and 16 percent of the Medicaid population but about   35 percent of Medicaid spending. Health care spending for dual-eligible  beneficiaries in 2010 exceeded $300 billion.", "Both Medicare and Medicaid can be provided in a fee-for-service (FFS) or  managed care payment system. Under FFS, healthcare providers are  paid on a per-service basis. Under managed care, either the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers  Medicare, or the state Medicaid agency contracts with managed care  organizations to provide covered health care services in return for a fixed  monthly payment per enrollee. Under Medicare managed care, private  organizations offer health plans through the Medicare Advantage  program. These plans are referred to as Medicare Advantage, or MA,  plans.", "Whether within the context of FFS, managed care, or both, dual-eligible  beneficiaries navigate both the Medicare and Medicaid programs to  access services. Under Medicare, dual-eligible beneficiaries have access  to coverage for most acute care services, such as care provided by  physicians or inpatient hospitals, postacute skilled nursing facility (SNF)  care, and prescription drugs. Under state Medicaid programs, dual- eligible beneficiaries who qualify also have access to coverage for long- term nursing facility care and home- and community-based services.  These beneficiaries may also qualify for payment of Medicare premiums  and cost sharing.", "Both the Medicare and Medicaid programs have consumer protection  requirements to help ensure that beneficiaries have access to health care  providers and services covered under the programs. Such protections  generally apply to all beneficiaries, but some are of particular importance  to dual-eligible beneficiaries. Dual-eligible beneficiaries may have a  greater need for health care services because of increased physical and  mental health needs. Further, dual-eligible beneficiaries, because they  are in both programs, face navigating the different requirements in the  two separate programs. For instance, a dual-eligible beneficiary who  wants to appeal a denial of benefits must first determine which program  denied the benefit, because the entity to which he or she needs to appeal  and the time frames they have for making that appeal may differ  depending on whether the service was covered by Medicare or Medicaid,  or which program has primary responsibility for payment.", "To integrate benefits more effectively under the Medicare and Medicaid  programs, and to improve the coordination between the federal  government and states to ensure that dual-eligible beneficiaries get  access to the items and services to which they are entitled, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Federal Coordinated  Health Care Office (also known as the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination  Office) within CMS.oversees the design and operation of state Medicaid programs. Goals for  the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office include increasing dual- eligible beneficiaries\u2019 understanding of and satisfaction with coverage  under Medicare and Medicaid and aligning the requirements between the  two programs. To support these efforts, CMS is working with states to  develop demonstrations to integrate Medicare and Medicaid for dual- eligible beneficiaries. Key objectives are to improve beneficiary  experience in accessing care, improve quality, eliminate cost shifting  between Medicare and Medicaid, and achieve cost savings for states and  CMS. Twenty-six states have proposed demonstrations to integrate the  care of dual-eligible beneficiaries, starting in either 2013 or 2014.", "CMS administers the Medicare program as well as  As CMS\u2019s integrated care demonstrations proceed, you were interested in  understanding the requirements related to consumer protections of  particular importance to dual-eligible beneficiaries.

We identified and  defined six such categories: enrollment choice, continuity of care,  provider networks, marketing, scope of home health and nursing facility  services, and appeals. With respect to continuity of care, provider  networks, and marketing, we reviewed those requirements only with  respect to their application in managed care. We reviewed relevant  federal statutes, regulations, and policy statements and interviewed  federal officials to describe requirements in Medicare FFS, Medicare  Advantage, Medicaid FFS, and Medicaid managed care plans.", "We also selected four states for review to provide illustrative examples of  the variation in consumer protection requirements among state Medicaid  programs. We chose the four states to achieve a range in terms of the  share of dual-eligible beneficiaries in each state\u2019s Medicaid population  and each state\u2019s overall use of managed care within Medicaid. The four  states we selected were Arizona, California, Minnesota, and North  Carolina. (See app. I for information on each state\u2019s Medicaid program.)

The length of the  coverage depends on the stability of the beneficiary and the nature of the  medical condition. Minnesota also has continuity of care requirements.  For newly enrolled dually eligible seniors, managed care plans must  cover medically necessary services that an out-of-network provider, a  different plan, or the state agency authorized before the dual-eligible  beneficiary enrolled with the managed care plan. However, the plan is  allowed to require that the dual-eligible beneficiary receive the services  from an in-network provider if that would not create an undue hardship on  the dual-eligible beneficiary and the services are clinically appropriate.  Arizona requires that managed care plans employ transition coordinators  to ensure continuity of care, and beneficiaries in the state\u2019s long-term  care program receive additional case management for help navigating  their care options, including planning, coordinating and facilitating access  to services.", "Medicare and state Medicaid programs require managed care plans to  meet certain provider network standards. In order to limit beneficiaries to  a network of providers, MA organizations must meet a number of  requirements, including maintaining and monitoring a network of  appropriate providers, under contract, that is sufficient to provide  adequate access to covered services to meet the needs of enrolled  beneficiaries. Federal guidelines establish minimum network adequacy  requirements that vary depending on a county\u2019s geographic designation,  such as whether the county is urban or rural. MA organizations must  contract with sufficient numbers of certain types of provider specialists per  1,000 Medicare beneficiaries in a county. For example, MA plans  operating in rural counties must have at least one full-time equivalent  (FTE) primary care provider per 1,000 beneficiaries. Additionally, MA  organizations must demonstrate that their network meets geographic  requirements related to the time and distance it takes beneficiaries to  travel to providers. For example, in rural counties, MA organizations must  also ensure that 90 percent of beneficiaries can access primary care  providers within 40 minutes and 30 miles of travel. MA organizations must  also ensure that the networks include a minimum number of specialists  and specialty facilities, such as at least one cardiologist and one skilled  nursing facility per 1,000 beneficiaries.", "States must ensure, through contracts, that Medicaid managed care  plans demonstrate that they have the capacity to serve expected  enrollment in the service area in accordance with state standards. For  example, plans must submit documentation to the state that they offer an  appropriate range of preventive, primary care, and specialty services, and  maintain a network of providers that is sufficient in number, mix, and  geographic distribution to meet the needs of the enrollees.", "Unlike Medicare, however, federal Medicaid laws and regulations do not  establish minimum provider network requirements and instead generally  require states to set the standards for access to care. Accordingly,  subject to the terms and conditions of a waiver, if applicable, states may  establish requirements that define the minimum number and types of  providers in a network, and time and distance requirements between  beneficiaries and primary care providers, as well as other network  adequacy requirements. For example, Medicaid managed care plans in  California must maintain a provider to beneficiary ratio of one FTE  primary care physician for every 2,000 beneficiaries and one FTE  physician from any specialty for every 1,200 beneficiaries. In some  counties, managed care plans must also ensure that primary care  physicians are located within 30 minutes or 10 miles of beneficiaries\u2019  residences, unless the state approves an alternative time and distance  standard. In addition to time and distance standards, Arizona requires  managed care plans to contract with a specific number of providers, as  determined by the state, which varies by each area that the plan serves.  Arizona also defines time frames for beneficiaries to be able to access  some services. For example, Arizona Medicaid managed care plans must  provide beneficiaries with access to emergency primary care services  within 24 hours, urgent primary care services within 2 days, and routine  primary care services within 21 days. Plans must include a minimum  number of other types of providers\u2014such as dentists, pharmacists,  home- and community-based services providers, and behavioral health  facilities\u2014in their networks as well.", "Medicare and Medicaid each have requirements regarding the marketing  materials managed care organizations send out to beneficiaries. MA  organizations are required to comply with a variety of federal  requirements for marketing materials that are intended to promote  enrollment in a specific health plan. For example, organizations generally  must submit marketing materials to CMS for review prior to sending to  beneficiaries. Materials must provide an adequate written description of  the plan\u2019s benefits and services and comply with formatting requirements,  such as a minimum font size. In addition, MA organizations must translate  materials into any non-English language that is the primary language of at  least 5 percent of individuals in the plan\u2019s service area.", "Medicaid managed care plans are required to comply with both federal  and state requirements for marketing materials. For example, Medicaid  managed care plans must obtain state approval before distributing  marketing materials. Federal requirements also mandate that materials  must be written in an easily understood language and format, though  requirements for format are not precisely defined. In addition, plans must  make information, including Medicaid marketing materials, available in  each prevalent language spoken by enrollees and potential enrollees in  the plan\u2019s service area. Subject to the terms and conditions of a waiver,  if applicable, states may further define requirements for readability and  material translation, while other states may prohibit marketing altogether.  For example, marketing materials in California must be translated when a  threshold number of beneficiaries whose primary language is not English  live in a managed care plan\u2019s service area or in the same or adjacent zip  codes, among other circumstances. Additionally, all Medicaid marketing  materials in California must be written at no higher than the sixth-grade  reading level and be approved by the state Medicaid agency.

Within broad federal parameters, such as  requiring that beneficiaries need daily, inpatient nursing facility services  that are ordered by a physician, states may impose additional  requirements when defining coverage for this benefit.beneficiaries in North Carolina, must show they meet the requirements to  be in a nursing facility by demonstrating some qualifying conditions.  Qualifying conditions may include, among other things, (1) the need for  services that require a registered nurse a minimum of 8 hours a day and  other personnel working under the supervision of a licensed nurse, (2) the  need for restorative nursing to maintain or restore maximum function or  prevent deterioration in individuals with progressive disabilities as much  as possible, or (3) the need for a specialized therapeutic diet. In Arizona,  the acute care program covers nursing facility services for a limited  amount of time (90 days) if hospitalization will occur otherwise or the  treatment cannot be administered safely in a less restrictive setting, such  as at home. Medicaid beneficiaries in the long-term care program in  Arizona have longer-term nursing facility benefits. Beneficiaries qualify for  the long-term-care program when they have a functional or medical  condition that impairs functioning to the extent that the individual would be  deemed at immediate risk of institutionalization. Impairments may include,  among other things, requiring nursing care, daily nurse supervision,  regular medical monitoring, or presenting impairments with cognitive  functioning or self-care with ADLs.", "Beneficiaries must meet different requirements to qualify for home health  services under Medicare and Medicaid.

Beneficiaries in  Medicaid managed care plans must have the ability to appeal a  termination, suspension, or reduction of a benefit to the plan as well as  have access to a state fair hearing. States determine whether  beneficiaries must first exhaust their appeal to their Medicaid managed  care plans before they may request a state fair hearing. During these  appeals, benefits generally must continue in certain circumstances.  Benefits generally must continue until a final agency decision is made if  the beneficiary is mailed a notice of action and files an appeal before the  date of the action.
