In 1992, DOD estimated that such improvements to its logistics operations could save as much as $28 billion by fiscal year 1997.

First, under the CIM initiative, DOD planned to invest more than $1 billion to develop a depot maintenance standard system. However this would achieve less than 2.3 percent in reduced operational costs over a 10-year period. Such incremental improvement is significantly less than the order-of-magnitude improvements DOD has said could be achieved through the reengineering of business processes. Second, by postponing reengineering efforts until after developing the standard system, DOD may make it more difficult to reengineer in the future by increasing the risks of entrenching inefficient and ineffective work processes.", "Our review of DOD\u2019s materiel management systems effort showed that the Department itself abandoned the migration strategy for this logistics area after it realized that the original goal for achieving a standard suite of integrated systems would require significantly more time and money than originally anticipated. For example, it would take as long as 2 years and as much as $100 million more than originally estimated to develop and deploy the Stock Control System\u2014an application that would assist in requisition, receipt, and inventory processing. After spending over $700 million to migrate materiel management standard systems, there were no dramatic improvements in materiel management business processes; there were numerous development, scheduling, and contracting problems; and only one application of the Stock Control System had been deployed. That application was delivered basically untested, did not meet user functional requirements, and required much rework, debugging, and testing on the user\u2019s part.", "Our review of Defense\u2019s transportation migration efforts found that the current migration strategy in the transportation area will not ensure improvements are made that Defense recognizes are critical to the transportation function. A number of studies since 1950 have found that Defense traffic management processes are fragmented and inefficient, reflecting the conflicts and duplication inherent in a traffic management organizational structure consisting of multiple transportation agencies, each with separate service and modal responsibilities. In a 1994 DOD report, Reengineering the Defense Transportation System: The \u201cOught To Be\u201d Defense Transportation System of the Year 2010, Defense officials maintained that nothing less than fundamental change would be required to achieve the quantum gains in savings and productivity needed to improve transportation business processes.

These directives establish a disciplined process for selecting the best projects based on comparisons of competing alternatives. Defense\u2019s principal means for making these comparisons is a functional economic analysis. For each alternative, a functional economic analysis identifies resource, schedule, and other critical project characteristics and presents estimates of the costs, benefits, and risks. Once an alternative is chosen, the analysis becomes the basis for project approval. Any significant change in expected project costs, benefits, or risks requires reevaluation of the selected alternative.", "In our reviews of DOD\u2019s efforts to implement the migration system strategy across its depot maintenance, materiel management, and transportation business activities, we found that DOD routinely selected and is deploying migration systems without (1) sufficiently analyzing their costs and benefits and (2) considering possible better commercial alternatives, such as reengineering, privatization, and outsourcing of business functions. Only recently has DOD began to consider such options.", "The following are the results of our previous reviews on DOD\u2019s cost, benefit, and risk analyses.", "Our review of depot maintenance migration found that Defense selected the Depot Maintenance Standard System without analyzing the systems\u2019 full development and deployment costs. Instead, it relied on a functional economic analysis of a previously proposed project\u2014the Depot Maintenance Resource Planning system. This analysis understated Depot Maintenance Standard System project costs by at least $140 million by including costs for only some components, and it understated costs for the components it did include.", "Had Defense followed its own regulations and calculated investment returns on its transportation migration selections, it would have found\u2014based on data available when the migration systems were selected\u2014that two of the selected systems would lose money. The Air Loading Module (ALM) would lose $0.67 out of every dollar invested and the Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) would lose $0.04 out of every dollar invested. DOD\u2019s analyses also did not include all costs associated with its evaluation of in-house systems. At least $18 million in costs were excluded\u2014$16 million for an analysis of candidate migration systems and $2 million for maintaining migration system hardware. We also found that had DOD included these costs in its systems selection analyses, it would have found that the overall return on investment would have decreased.", "Our review of materiel migration system efforts showed that a complete economic analysis was never made for the migration strategy until July of 1995\u2014nearly 3 years after the strategy began. Further, when Defense dramatically changed the course of materiel management systems development\u2014abandoning the concept of developing a standard system and instead moving to incremental and individual deployments\u2014it again did not set out to first assess risks, costs, and benefits before proceeding with such a change in strategy.", "Our reviews also found that major changes to operations or potentially better business practices were not assessed during the system selection process. Without a comparison of alternatives, DOD has no assurance that it has selected the most efficient and effective solution. For example, Defense selected a migration system to support its transportation of personal property and plans to spend $63 million over the next 5 years to implement it. Recently, however, DOD began actively seeking to privatize major components of this function. As a result, further spending on the migration system may be questionable since the system may no longer be needed. Similarly, DOD is deploying migration systems to support its materiel management operations without sufficient assessment of recent DOD initiatives focusing on privatizing materiel management operations or consolidating inventory control points. As a result, Defense may end up spending millions of dollars on systems for functions that it no longer performs or on inventory control points that are later consolidated.", "Our previous reports made a number of recommendations to help ensure that DOD selected the systems that offered the most effective solutions at least cost. These recommendations included preparing documentation that described system efforts and validated that they were the best alternatives for improving their respective business areas. Although DOD partially agreed with some of our recommendations, it essentially has continued to deploy systems without adequate economic analysis and full comparisons of available alternatives needed to ensure that it is making the best investment of its resources.", "Nevertheless, DOD is required to manage its information technology as investments. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 was passed to stop government spending on systems projects that were found to be far exceeding their expected costs and yielding questionable benefits to mission improvements. Specifically, under the Clinger-Cohen Act, DOD is required to design and implement a process for selecting IT investments using such criteria as risk-adjusted return-on-investment and specific criteria for comparing and prioritizing alternative information system projects.

Through the Clinger-Cohen Act, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and the Paperwork Reduction Act(PRA), the Congress has underscored the importance of strategic planning for the efficient and effective use of information technology. The Clinger-Cohen Act also requires that the investment process for information technology be integrated with processes for making budget, financial, and program management decisions. For Defense, such planning would establish a direct link between its business objectives and information technology use. In turn, this would have helped Defense focus on meeting the objective of dramatic improvement in operations rather than incremental change.", "Private industry and our studies of public and private organizations have identified that cohesive plans resulting from strategic information management\u2014managing information and information technology to maximize improvements in business performance\u2014are crucial for developing information systems that support substantial business improvement. For example, in early 1993, the International Business Machines (IBM) Consulting Group reported on its extensive case study of 17 exemplary companies chosen from an initial list of 200 companies in a wide range of industries.", "The IBM study found that the best companies had well-structured and well-explained information management plans that closely integrated with their business planning processes. Also, these plans aligned the use of information technology with business objectives to improve performance and deal effectively with changes in the business environment. The study also found that these companies did not invest in an information system until they clearly understood how and to what extent the proposed information system would enhance their business environment.", "Our studies of how leading private and public organizations have applied information technology to improve their performance have also found that organizations achieving substantially higher levels of performance had a disciplined, outcome-oriented, and integrated strategic information management process. For example, one organization that lacked a business vision\u2014a definition of how the organization would work in the future\u2014and an integrated strategic information management process, spent the majority of its resources maintaining existing, aging information systems. By integrating its planning, budgeting, and evaluation processes, the organization was able to shift about a third of its information systems personnel to reengineering projects. These new improvements in turn increased productivity and the quality of customer service.", "With GPRA, the Congress has recently underscored the importance of strategic planning by clarifying and expanding the requirement for a strategic information resources management plan first called for under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. GPRA requires that agencies submit to the Office of Management and Budget, by September 1997, a strategic plan for their activities, including a comprehensive mission statement as well as goals and objectives for the agency\u2019s functions and operations.

Also, other ongoing GAO reviews provided the results of cost and benefit analyses, risk assessments, and interviews with program and technical officials responsible for implementing migration systems in the materiel management and transportation business areas.", "We evaluated the strategies, policies, and memoranda establishing DOD\u2019s Enterprise Model, CIM initiative, and logistics migration information systems strategy to determine whether DOD\u2019s migration systems strategy is consistent with DOD\u2019s corporate business vision for balancing investments across the Department and optimizing its operational effectiveness. Also, we reviewed the findings of studies conducted by the Commission of Roles and Missions of the Armed Services and DOD for achieving dramatic increases in operational efficiency. To identify private and public organizations that have successfully managed information technology use to obtain superior business performance, we researched technical and business databases, reviewed literature by technology vendors, and reviewed prior GAO work and compared the private sector approach to DOD\u2019s strategy in using information technology.", "Focusing on DOD\u2019s new efforts to develop interoperable information systems emphasized in the enterprise model and to privatize and outsource commercial-type activities as recommended by the Commission on Roles and Missions, we compared DOD\u2019s actions and plans for implementing depot maintenance, materiel management, and transportation migration systems with its business vision. Also, we compared the business activities DOD is considering privatizing with those the migration systems are to support. We compared the \u201cbest practices\u201d of private and public organizations with DOD\u2019s logistics migration strategy to identify actions that could increase the probability of achieving logistics business objectives and maximizing the return on technology investments.", "We interviewed senior Defense officials responsible for managing the CIM initiative, implementing the logistics migration strategy, and developing privatization plans. We also met with program and functional officials, including DOD managers responsible for deploying the depot maintenance and materiel management migration systems. Our work was performed from August 1995 through August 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We performed our work primarily at the offices of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics in Washington, D.C.; the Joint Logistics Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; and the Automated Systems Demonstration, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Georgia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting and Information Management Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chicago/Dayton Field Office", "paragraphs": ["James E.
