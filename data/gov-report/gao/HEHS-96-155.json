Since the 1940s, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), previously the Veterans Administration, has provided training to veterans with service-connected disabilities to help improve their employability. In 1980, the Congress enacted the Veterans\u2019 Rehabilitation and Education Amendments, which changed the focus of the veterans\u2019 vocational rehabilitation program from just providing training to improve the employability of disabled veterans to helping them find and maintain suitable jobs. However, in 1984 and again in 1992, we reported and VA agreed that the vocational rehabilitation program was still primarily focused on sending veterans to training, not on finding veterans suitable employment. In fiscal year 1995, VA spent about $300 million to provide program services to about 48,000 veterans.", "This letter responds to your concerns about whether VA\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program is achieving one of its primary goals of helping disabled veterans obtain suitable jobs. Specifically, you requested that we provide information on the status of the program\u2014percentage of rehabilitated veterans, services provided, characteristics of clients served, and cost of rehabilitation. You also asked us to provide similar information on the Department of Education\u2019s state vocational rehabilitation program. Although both VA and Education programs are designed to help disabled people obtain employment, significant differences exist between the two in the kinds of clients served, the types of services provided, and how successful rehabilitations are defined (for example, under the state program, a suitable job can be a nonwage-earning position). For these reasons, we did not attempt to compare the two programs. In addition, you asked us to identify VA efforts to improve program effectiveness.", "To address your request, we met with VA and Department of Education officials responsible for managing their respective vocational rehabilitation programs. We reviewed legislation, regulations, program operating procedures, and program management reports. We also analyzed national data on program participants and visited VA regional offices and state rehabilitation agencies in four localities to obtain examples from selected program case files of costs and services provided. We did our work between September 1995 and July 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. (See app. I for a more detailed discussion of our methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1943, Public Law 78-16 authorized the vocational rehabilitation program to provide training to veterans with service-connected disabilities. Between 1943 and 1980, program features and criteria underwent several legislative changes. In 1980, the Congress enacted the Veterans\u2019 Rehabilitation and Education Amendments (P.L. 96-466), which changed the program\u2019s purpose to providing eligible veterans with services and assistance necessary to enable them to obtain and maintain suitable employment.", "The vocational rehabilitation process has five phases. In the first phase, VA receives the veteran\u2019s application, establishes eligibility, and schedules a meeting with the veteran. In phase two, a counselor determines if the veteran has an employment handicap and, if so, the counselor and the veteran jointly develop a rehabilitation plan. The veteran then moves into training or education (phase three), if needed, and on to employment services (phase four) if training or education is not needed or after it is completed. During phase four, VA, state agencies, the Department of Labor, and private employment agencies help the veteran find a job. In phase five, the veteran is classified as rehabilitated once he or she finds a suitable job and holds it for at least 60 days.", "Veterans are eligible for program services if they have a 20-percent or higher service-connected disability and they have been determined by VA to have an employment handicap. The law defines an employment handicap as an impairment of a veteran\u2019s ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests. Veterans with a 10-percent service-connected disability also may be eligible if they have a serious employment handicap. The eligibility period generally extends for 12 years, beginning on the date of the veteran\u2019s discharge. Veterans found eligible for services can receive up to 48 months of benefits during the 12-year period.", "While in the program, most veterans receive services and equipment that may be required for beginning employment. For instance, veterans generally receive diagnosis and evaluation, as well as counseling and guidance, and some receive such aids as prostheses, eyeglasses, and educational supplies. They may also receive educational and vocational training; special rehabilitative services, such as tutorial assistance and interpreter services; a subsistence allowance; and employment assistance.", "Similar to the 1980 amendments, which affect the VA program, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, authorized the Department of Education to provide eligible people (usually nonveterans) with services and assistance to enable them to obtain and maintain suitable employment. Education provides federal funds to help people with disabilities become employed, more independent, and better integrated into the community. The federal funds are chiefly passed to state vocational rehabilitation agencies that directly provide services and assistance to eligible people. The federal share of funding for these services is generally about 80 percent; the states pay the balance. In fiscal year 1995, about $2 billion in federal funds went to the state program, and about 1.3 million people received program services.", "The state vocational rehabilitation process, like the VA program process, comprises five phases, and state vocational rehabilitation clients who obtain and maintain a suitable job for at least 60 days are also classified as rehabilitated. However, in the state vocational program, suitable employment may not always involve wages or salary and may include, for example, working as an unpaid homemaker or family worker. To be eligible for the program, people must have a disability that is a substantial impediment to employment. However, when states are unable to serve all eligible applicants, priority is given to serving individuals with the most severe disabilities.", "The state vocational rehabilitation program offers a wide range of services to help its clients achieve their vocational goals. Examples of specific rehabilitation services include diagnosis and evaluation, counseling and guidance, vocational and educational training, physical restoration, adjustment training, on-the-job training, and employment assistance. If needed, services such as transportation to enable the individual to arrive at appointments for rehabilitation services or to get to work and income maintenance to cover additional costs incurred while the individual is receiving specific rehabilitation services are also provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Vocational Rehabilitation Program Faces Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The 1980 Veterans\u2019 Rehabilitation and Education Amendments made a significant change in VA\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program by requiring VA to assist veterans in obtaining and maintaining suitable employment. This change expanded the scope of vocational rehabilitation beyond just training and marked a fundamental change in the focus and purpose of the program. However, despite previous GAO recommendations that VA fully implement this amendment and VA\u2019s agreement to emphasize employment services, few veterans in the vocational rehabilitation program obtain jobs. Instead, VA staff continue to focus on providing training services because, among other reasons, they lack adequate training and expertise in job placement.", "In addition, our analysis of national program data revealed that the percentage of veterans in the program with serious employment handicaps has been steadily declining over the last 5 years. Our discussions with program officials also revealed that VA does not have readily available cost data associated with rehabilitating veterans. We found, on the basis of our review of select case files, that VA typically spends about $20,000 to rehabilitate each veteran."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Continues to Place Few Veterans", "paragraphs": ["In our 1992 report, we noted that approximately 202,000 veterans were found eligible for vocational rehabilitation program services between October 1983 and February 1991.

VA rehabilitated 5 percent of the eligible veterans, while the remaining veterans (24 percent) continued to receive program services.", "From October 1991 to September 1995, 201,000 veterans applied to the vocational rehabilitation program. VA classified approximately 74,000 (37 percent) veterans eligible. Of these veterans, 21 percent dropped out before receiving a plan, and another 20 percent dropped out or temporarily suspended their program after receiving a plan. VA rehabilitated 8 percent of the eligible veterans, and the remaining veterans (51 percent) were still receiving program services at the time of our analysis.", "VA officials told us that the vocational rehabilitation program has not been effective in placing veterans in suitable jobs. The primary reason for the low percentage of rehabilitations is the lack of focus on employment services, according to VA officials. The director of VA\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program also acknowledged that the program\u2019s rehabilitation rate needs to be improved and has established a program goal of doubling the number of successful rehabilitations over the next 2 years.", "Our analysis of current program participants showed that almost half of those veterans who were rehabilitated obtained employment in the professional, technical, and managerial occupations\u2014fields such as engineering, accounting, and management. In addition, we found that the average starting salary of these veterans was about $18,000 a year. Moreover, veterans who were rehabilitated spent an average of 30 months in the program, while those who dropped out spent 22 months in the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Does Not Emphasize Employment Services", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program is primarily focused on sending veterans to training rather than on finding them suitable employment, according to VA officials. In 1992, VA issued guidance that emphasized the importance of finding suitable jobs for veterans and suggested that field offices begin employment planning as soon as a veteran\u2019s eligibility for the program services was established. However, regional officials told us that staff do not generally begin exploring employment options until near the end of a veteran\u2019s training.", "In 1992, we reported that 92 percent of veterans who received a plan between October 1983 and February 1991 went from the evaluation and planning phase directly into training programs, while only 3 percent went into the employment services phase. The remaining 5 percent went into a program designed to help them live independently or were placed in a controlled work environment. These figures remained virtually unchanged for the period we examined. For example, from October 1991 to September 1995, 92 percent of veterans who received a plan went from the evaluation and planning phase into training programs, while 4 percent went directly into the employment services phase. The remaining 4 percent entered an independent living program or were placed in extended evaluation, as shown in figure 1.", "Moreover, our analysis of national program data on current program participants showed that the vast majority of veterans in training were enrolled in higher education programs. For example, about 91 percent of such veterans were enrolled in a university or college. The remaining 9 percent were enrolled in vocational/technical schools or participated in other types of training programs, such as apprenticeships and on-the-job training.", "VA regional officials offered several reasons why staff continue to emphasize training over employment services. First, VA officials told us that it is difficult for staff to begin exploring employment options early because veterans entering the program expect to be able to attend college. Veterans acquire this expectation, according to VA officials, because the program is often marketed as an education program and not a jobs-oriented program. This image of the program as education oriented was also evident among some VA management. For instance, the director at one regional office we visited described the vocational rehabilitation program as the \u201cbest education program in VA.\u201d", "A second reason for emphasizing training over employment, according to VA officials, is that program staff generally lack adequate training and expertise in job placement activities. At one office, for example, a counseling psychologist told us that program staff are not equipped to find veterans jobs because they lack employer contacts and detailed information on local labor markets. In fact, counseling psychologists at the regional offices we visited described the employment services phase as \u201cthe weakest part of the program.\u201d", "Third, VA officials told us that large caseloads make it difficult for program staff to spend time exploring employment options with veterans. As one counseling psychologist responsible for managing over 300 cases said, \u201cwith such a large caseload it\u2019s just easier to place veterans in college for 4 years than it is to find them a job.\u201d According to VA\u2019s Vocational Rehabilitation Service\u2019s Chief of Program Operations, the optimal caseload per staff person is about 125."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Participants Have Changed", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, there has been a shift in the type of disabled veteran participating in VA\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program.

The overall objective of VA\u2019s reengineering effort is to increase the number of veterans who obtain suitable employment through improvements in program management. Under new program leadership, VA\u2019s Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Service established a design team in 1995 to restructure the program by focusing on finding veterans suitable employment, making use of automation, and identifying factors that detract from program efficiency. VA consulted with state and private-sector vocational rehabilitation officials, veterans\u2019 service organizations, the Department of Labor, and private contractors to help it identify needed program improvements.", "VA\u2019s design team has identified several key initiatives aimed at improving program effectiveness. For example, VA plans to emphasize employment by exploring job options with veterans before sending them to training. VA also plans to develop marketing strategies that emphasize employment services.

Further, VA plans to assess and develop program staff skills to ensure that staff have the necessary expertise to provide employment services.", "VA is also piloting an automated data management system designed to capture key information on program participants, such as the cost of providing rehabilitation services.

Education agreed with our findings and offered some technical suggestions, which we incorporated where appropriate.", "VA said it generally agreed with our findings and that its current reengineering initiative will successfully address all of the concerns we raised. However, VA cited a number of concerns with the information contained in the draft. For example, VA took issue with our finding that 8 percent of eligible veterans are rehabilitated. Instead, VA claims that 32 percent are rehabilitated and that this rate compares favorably with the 37-percent rehabilitation found in the state program. We disagree. VA based their rehabilitation percentage on the number of veterans who left the program (about 19,000)\u2014a combination of veterans who dropped out or interrupted their program of services, as well as those who were rehabilitated\u2014as opposed to the total number of eligible veterans (about 74,000). VA\u2019s approach inflates the VA rehabilitation rate. Using VA\u2019s approach, the state program would have an even higher rehabilitation rate\u2014more than 60 percent. The fact remains, however, that of the 74,000 veterans found eligible for program services, 6,000 successfully completed the program.", "VA also took exception with our discussion of its lack of focus on employment services. VA contends it has consistently focused on the necessity of providing meaningful employment services, a goal that is outlined in policy directives and reinforced with comprehensive staff training. Our report acknowledges that VA issued guidance in 1992 that emphasized employment services. However, VA staff that administered and implemented the program in the four locations we visited told us that they do not emphasize employment until near the end of a veteran\u2019s training. Furthermore, the Chairman of VA\u2019s design team, an individual charged with evaluating and restructuring the program, told us that the primary reason for the program\u2019s low rehabilitation rate is VA\u2019s lack of focus on employment services. Regarding VA\u2019s claim it provides comprehensive staff training, the Program Operations Chief told us that other than a week-long seminar on employment services presented about 2 to 3 years ago, VA headquarters has not sponsored staff training in employment assistance.

At each VA regional office and state agency visited, we randomly selected and reviewed 9 to 12 case files of program participants who had been rehabilitated or had dropped out of the program between January 1 and June 30, 1995. Because the total number of rehabilitated cases available at VA\u2019s field office in Portland, Oregon, was relatively small, we reviewed all 30 cases. We reviewed a total of 183 vocational rehabilitation cases: 102 at VA\u2019s regional offices and 81 at the state agencies. These cases did not compose a representative sample of each site\u2019s rehabilitation or dropout cases; thus, our results cannot be generalized.", "From case file reviews and discussions with program specialists, we obtained detailed information on client characteristics; services provided; and, when applicable, the type of employment obtained and starting salary. Also from the case files, we determined the costs associated with providing rehabilitation services to program participants, such as how much was spent for basic education and vocational training, readjustment training, physical restoration, and other support services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Irene Chu, Assistant Director, (202) 512-7101 Jaqueline Hill Arroyo, Evaluator-in-Charge, (202) 512-6753 Julian Klazkin, Senior Attorney Steve Morris, Evaluator Michael O\u2019Dell, Senior Social Science Analyst Jeffrey Pounds, Evaluator Pamela Scott, Communications Analyst Joan Vogel, Senior Evaluator (Computer Science)", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
