While some expansion and contraction of the number of domestic schools operated by DOD occurred between the 1950s and early 1970s, relatively few have been closed or transferred since then, and most of those have been related to base closure activities. For affected military families, the retention of these schools is seen as an important quality-of-life issue. The basis for the expert panel recommendations to transfer selected DOD schools to LEAs is difficult to ascertain. Specifically, it is often unclear how various analytical factors examined led to recommendations being made. For example, in one instance the panel recommended transfer of educational responsibilities to the neighboring LEA even though the LEA's per pupil costs were higher than DOD's and the LEA schools were cited as mostly \"underperforming.\" Moreover, the study data indicate that DOD could incur an estimated $125 million to repair and upgrade existing schools. Under the panel's recommendations, DOD would also have a continuing obligation to maintain the schools even after program transfers to the LEAs. Some long-term savings in operating costs could accrue to DOD, but many of these costs would need to be absorbed by LEAs or other federal programs. The transfer study also indicates that various legal restrictions in some states would need to be resolved. Finally, ownership of the schools DOD operates needs to be clarified in order to ensure that it is properly reflected in property records. There are other factors, most not present when the transfer study began, that could further complicate school transfer decisions, including ongoing DOD plans to relocate about 70,000 military personnel and approximately 100,000 family members currently stationed overseas to bases in the United States within the next few years; Army efforts to reorganize its force structure, with the potential for increased numbers of personnel assigned to selected military bases in the United States; and the impact of the 2005 base realignment and closure round. Likewise, current DOD efforts to privatize housing on its military bases could also impact future requirements for schools serving military dependents. DOD has appropriately said that it is postponing decision making on the results of the transfer study until after base closure decisions are finalized later this year. However, the impact of troop redeployments and other force structure changes on schools has not yet been fully assessed. Given the expected increase of school age military dependents on various stateside military bases over the next few years, a clear decision on school transfer issues should be made after the results of the base closure process and overseas rebasing plans are known to ensure adequate planning for facilities by DOD and LEAs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Historically, public elementary and secondary education has been a state  and local responsibility.

Officials in the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA), which administers this program, have  indicated that the new effort was the result of questions raised by the then  chairman of the House Appropriations Military Construction  Subcommittee regarding whether there was a need for continued operation  of these schools by DOD arising from a request for funding for a school- related project on a military base.  Additionally, in 2002, as part of its focus  on improving management of the department, DOD\u2019s senior leadership  endorsed examining departmental functions to determine whether they  were core to the department\u2019s warfighting mission, with expectations that  needed products or services associated with non-core functions should be  obtained from other government agencies or the private sector.

(See appendix II for a listing of these DDESS  school locations.) Approximately 105,000 students are enrolled in these  combined programs, with approximately 24,000 students attending the 59  schools in the continental United States.  DDESS schools mostly serve  elementary school-aged students in the United States, with older students  attending public schools off the installations.   The overseas DODDS  system has approximately 12,000 employees while the DDESS system has  approximately 5,700 employees.  The combined operating budget for both  systems and headquarters in fiscal year 2005 is about $1.49 billion of which  approximately $367 million is for operating DDESS schools.", "As we have previously reported, the federal government\u2019s operation of  elementary schools in the continental United States to educate military  dependents residing on military bases traces its history back many years  and to locations where a suitable free public education was not available.", "There were a variety of reasons for establishing schools on military bases,  including military installations that were located in sparsely populated  areas and efforts to avoid racial segregation at the neighboring school  districts.", "From 1951 to 1981, funding responsibility for the domestic schools resided  with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and subsequently  with the Department of Education. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) transferred funding responsibility to DOD.   Today, DODEA, the umbrella agency created in 1994 to administer the  overseas (DODDS) and domestic (DDESS) systems, operates under the  direction of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Military Community  and Family Policy, and the Under Secretary of Defense, Personnel and  Readiness.", "The DDESS model is but one of several approaches to providing  elementary and secondary education to dependents of military personnel  residing on military bases in the United States.  There are 33 Department of  Education-owned schools located on military bases but operated by LEAs,  providing education for military dependents residing on those bases.  The  Department of Education has been gradually transferring these schools to  LEAs as funds are available to upgrade the condition of the schools to  encourage acceptance of the schools by LEAs.   In other instances, LEAs  own and operate schools located on military bases.  Finally, in a limited  number of instances, DOD directly funds LEAs to educate military  dependents at schools operated on military bases.", "Periodically, questions have arisen within the Congress concerning the  continuing need for such schools within the continental United States, and  various studies were commissioned in the 1980s and early 1990s to evaluate  the potential for transferring the schools to LEAs. In December 1986 we  examined three methods to educate military dependents, then in selected  use, which were viewed as alternatives to the DOD-funded and operated  schools.  They included: (1) operation by local school districts, with  funding from federal, state, and local governments; (2) DOD contracting  with local school districts for educational services; and (3) coterminous  operation, whereby dependents\u2019 schools operated as local school districts  whose boundaries were the same as the military installations\u2019 boundaries,  and where funding for those districts was shared by the Department of  Education (through the federal impact aid program) and the responsible  state government.  We reported in December 1986 that creation of school  districts coterminous with military installations appeared to be the best of  the three alternatives, in part because such an approach would likely  minimize the transfer of students from existing schools and eliminate costs  to DOD.  However, according to a DODEA official, most states have since  passed laws that prohibit the creation of new school districts, which  eliminates the coterminous option from  consideration.  We also reported  that jurisdictional, legal, and other issues could impede consideration of all  three alternatives.  Subsequent studies by others offered varying degrees of  insights regarding these alternatives and difficulties likely to be  encountered in trying to implement them, and often identified multiple  issues that would have to be addressed\u2014including legal and financial  issues, and strong opposition from affected military families\u2014if a transfer  of responsibilities were to be attempted.  As a result, school transfers were  not considered feasible.

DOD housing privatization officials indicated they do not currently  anticipate similar transfers of schools in the future.", "Earlier transfer studies point to expansion and contraction of DOD  operated schools on military bases between 1950 and 1970. Schools were  added to the DDESS system as a result of the racial integration of the  military during the time when the schools in the neighboring LEAs  remained segregated.  At one point, about 100 military installations  reportedly had schools that belonged to what is now the DDESS system.  Various studies report a subsequent contraction in the number of these  schools due to a variety of factors including successful implementation of  integration policies in many instances that allowed base schools to rejoin  their former LEAs, pressure from the U.S. Department of Education on  states and  localities to acknowledge responsibility for the education of  military dependents, and  commercial and residential development  adjacent to some bases that enabled the LEA to provide a viable  educational program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retention of Domestic Dependent Schools Is Seen as a Quality-of-Life Issue", "paragraphs": ["Survey and other data from the current and earlier studies on transfer  issues clearly indicate that affected military families, whose dependents  attend DDESS schools, view their retention as a quality-of-life issue.

Moreover, only 23 percent of all school-aged  dependents of military members assigned to the installations served by  DOD\u2019s domestic dependent schools in the continental United States attend  the schools. This can be attributed to the fact that many military families  reside in local communities\u2014that is, not on the base\u2014and thus are not  eligible to attend DDESS schools, and the fact that relatively few DDESS  schools provide education for high school students.", "DOD\u2019s guidance for deciding what functions the department performs that  could be considered commercial in nature and readily available in the  private sector, has exempted DOD schools from outsourcing consideration.

Accordingly, DOD  dependent schools were exempt from private sector performance  comparisons.  In addition, in recent years, DOD has sought a more  aggressive look at whether various functions are core to the department\u2019s  warfighting mission, and to increase the number of functions that might be  performed by the private sector. Dependent schools are one such function  that has sometimes been questioned regarding its connection to DOD\u2019s  core mission.", "Conversely, in July 2002, DOD published A New Social Compact: A  Reciprocal Partnership Between The Department of Defense,  Servicemembers and Families.

DOD has  appropriately said that it is postponing decision making on the results of  the transfer study until after base closure decisions are finalized later this  year. Until DOD obtains a fuller understanding of all these plans and time  frames the likely financial impact on DDESS and LEAs remains unknown.  Without that assessment, the financial assessment completed by the  current transfer study is incomplete.  Fundamentally, a decision on  whether to transfer educational responsibilities from DDESS to LEAs is a  policy decision that requires balancing fiscal, educational, and other quality  of life considerations.  Once the results of the domestic base closure  process and overseas rebasing plans are known, a decision on the school  transfer issue should be made sooner rather than later to ensure adequate  planning, funding and siting of new school facilities in the United States  that may be needed to support increasing populations of military  dependent students.

However, the department took  exception with the title of our report because it believed we raised issues  that were related to events occurring after the study began such as the  formulation of the rebasing plan, which were outside the scope of the  transfer study.

It noted that while exceptions might  be appropriate on a case-by-case basis, applying the following rules to all  installations helped achieve these dual ends of equity and practicality:  It would be unfair for some students at the same grade level to transfer  to the LEA district while other students in the same grade remain on  base.  Therefore, at any installation, any decision affecting one DDESS  school shall apply to all DDESS schools with the same or overlapping  grade levels;  To maintain continuity and effective education, it is not feasible to  transfer students at a particular grade and then return them to the  DDESS curriculum at a higher grade.  Therefore, if a transfer is made at  one grade, all succeeding higher grades must transfer as well;  If a DDESS elementary school with a pre-kindergarten (pre-K) program  is transferred to an LEA that does not offer a pre-K program, DDESS will  continue to offer pre-K services, using either on-site or off-site  resources; and  It would be both inefficient and detrimental to educational consistency  to have some DDESS schools run under contract with the LEA while  others on the same installation do not.
