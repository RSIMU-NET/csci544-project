Nearly the same number of suppliers submitted a similar number of bids for both the CBP round 1 rebid and round 1. Many suppliers continued to have difficulty complying with financial documentation requirements; however, the number of bids disqualified in the round 1 rebid was significantly less than for round 1. After being notified of their bid results, some suppliers were found to have bids that were disqualified incorrectly and were subsequently offered round 1 rebid contracts. About one-third of the bidding suppliers were awarded CBP contracts.", "Relatively few CBP contract suppliers (those awarded CBP contracts) had their contracts terminated by CMS, voluntarily canceled their contracts, or were involved in ownership changes. Under the CBP, non-contract suppliers (those not awarded CBP contracts) can grandfather certain rental DME for beneficiaries they were servicing prior to the implementation of CBP until CBP-covered beneficiaries\u0092 rental periods expire. Also, some CBP contract suppliers entered into subcontracting agreements with non-contract suppliers to furnish certain services to CBP-covered beneficiaries in the round 1 rebid.", "CMS\u0092s ongoing multiple monitoring activities generally indicate that beneficiary DME access and satisfaction have not been affected by CBP. Although some of these efforts have limitations, in the aggregate, they provide useful information to CMS regarding beneficiary access and satisfaction.", "Early data indicate that utilization has decreased in some CBP-covered DME categories. GAO\u0092s review of Medicare claims data found that fewer beneficiaries in competitive bidding areas received some CBP-covered items in any of the first six months of 2011 than in the same month of 2010.", "Although the first year of the CBP round 1 rebid has been completed, it is too soon to determine its full effects on Medicare beneficiaries and DME suppliers. GAO found that, in general, the round 1 rebid was successfully implemented. GAO also found that utilization of selected DME declined in the CBP areas; while there are many possible reasons for this, it does not necessarily indicate that beneficiaries have not had access to needed DME. GAO does not assume that all pre-CBP utilization was appropriate and the CBP may have reduced unnecessary utilization of DME. More experience with DME competitive bidding is needed, particularly to see if evidence of beneficiary access problems emerges. For that reason, it is important to continue monitoring changes in the number of suppliers serving CBP-covered beneficiaries.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS noted that the CBP round 1 rebid resulted in savings of more than $200 million in its first year.

To examine the extent to which the CBP round 1 rebid  has affected the beneficiary utilization of certain DME items, we obtained  and analyzed the first six months of Medicare claims data both pre-CBP  (2010) and post-CBP (2011) because data for those months are the most  complete. We used these data to determine whether the number of CBP- covered beneficiaries utilizing CBP-covered items and services increased  or decreased in the first 6 months of 2011 when the CBP round 1 began  compared to the same time period in 2010. We compared the number of  Medicare beneficiaries using selected CBP-covered items\u2014chosen by  CMS as the top 80 percent highest cost and highest utilization items\u2014in  the nine competitive bidding areas to non-competitive bidding areas (see  appendix I for the DME items included in our analysis). In submitting  claims for Medicare payments, suppliers use a standardized coding  system\u2014the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS).

To be eligible to submit bids  to furnish CBP-covered DME items in one or more product categories in  one or more of the competitive bidding areas, suppliers must first meet  several requirements. Specifically, suppliers must have an active National  Supplier Clearinghouse (NSC) number that makes them eligible to bill  Medicare for DME, have met Medicare enrollment and quality  standards, have a surety bond, and be accredited. After the bid  window closes, Palmetto GBA reviews bids to determine whether each  supplier\u2019s bid submission is complete and compliant with the bidding  requirements, and whether the supplier\u2019s financial score meets CMS\u2019s  minimum financial standard threshold to be eligible to compete on price.

First, Palmetto GBA reviews the DME bid item prices  submitted by suppliers with qualified bids and uses a methodology to  calculate what is known as a composite bid to allow for a comparison of  prices submitted across bidding suppliers with qualified bids. A composite  bid is determined by summing all of the weights assigned to each item in  a product category\u2014with each item weight calculated using national  beneficiary utilization data for that item compared to the other items within  that product category. Once the composite price has been calculated, the  bids are ordered by the lowest to highest composite bid price in each  product category in each competitive bidding area. When the bids have  been ordered, Palmetto GBA calculates the cumulative projected capacity  of the competing bids\u2014which indicates the capacity that each supplier  projects it could furnish throughout an entire competitive bidding area  each year. Palmetto GBA begins with the lowest composite price and  moves up the ordered list to identify the bid where the suppliers\u2019  cumulative projected capacity meets or exceeds CMS\u2019s estimated  beneficiary demand, which is referred to as the pivotal bid. Although  many bids can be qualified to compete on price, only those with  composite prices that are equal to or less than the pivotal bid are  determined to be winning suppliers, based on price, and are used to  establish Medicare\u2019s CBP single payment amounts for each item in a  product category in a competitive bidding area. Specifically, for each item,  the winning bids\u2019 price offers are ordered from lowest to highest and the  median bid price offered by these suppliers for that item becomes the  single payment amount.

The round 1 contract suppliers were announced in May 2008.  However, round 1\u2019s bid submission and contract award processes caused  concerns about CMS\u2019s CBP implementation. In our November 2009  report, we found problems with the bidding process, including poor timing  and lack of clarity in bid submission information and CMS\u2019s inability to  inform suppliers of missing financial documentation.

Under this provision,  CMS is required to determine if any suppliers\u2019 financial documents that  are submitted by a certain time in a CBP bid window\u2014known as the  covered document review date\u2014are missing and to notify and   provide suppliers the opportunity to submit them. In CBP round 1 rebid,  791 suppliers\u2014or 78 percent of all bidding suppliers\u2014submitted their  financial documentation by the covered document review date. Of those  eligible to have their financial documentation reviewed, 321 suppliers  (about 41 percent) were notified that they had missing documentation\u2014 including 184 small suppliers. Of the 321 suppliers that were notified,   232 suppliers submitted the correct missing documentation, 14 did not  provide missing documentation, and 75 resubmitted their documentation,  but were ultimately disqualified for unacceptable (such as incomplete or  inaccurate) documents. Ninety-three of the 321 suppliers\u2014about   29 percent\u2014that were notified by CMS that they had missing financial  documentation, and subsequently provided correct documentation, were  ultimately awarded one or more CBP contracts.", "In both CBP round 1 and the CBP round 1 rebid, the statement of cash  flow was the most common reason that suppliers were disqualified for  missing or unacceptable financial documentation. Although CMS provided  an example of a statement of cash flow in the CBP round 1 rebid bidding  instructions and suggested that financial statements be compiled by an  independent accounting firm or prepared by the supplier, Palmetto GBA  reported that it was obvious that many bidding suppliers still did not  understand what constituted an acceptable statement of cash flow during  the CBP round 1 rebid bid submission process. According to CMS, one  reason that the statement of cash flow was the most difficult financial  document to prepare in both CBP rounds is because it is prepared much  less often than other types of financial documents\u2014particularly by small  suppliers. CMS reported that another obstacle in preparing acceptable  statements of cash flow is that suppliers with very limited understanding  of accounting practices and how to prepare financial statements compiled  the statements of cash flow themselves and relied on results generated  by inexpensive accounting software, which CMS told us was not  sufficient. As a result, CMS provided additional information in its CBP  round 2 bidding instructions, and strongly recommended that suppliers\u2019  financial statements be compiled by an independent accounting firm to  discourage suppliers from preparing their own financial documents.", "In the CBP round 1 rebid, as in CBP round 1, CMS determined that some  suppliers\u2019 bids had been incorrectly disqualified. During CBP round 1, we  reported that CMS did not effectively communicate to suppliers that they  had an opportunity to have their round 1 bids reviewed. CMS officials told  us that they conducted a postbidding review process for suppliers which  contacted the agency with questions or requested a review and  subsequently found that 10 of the 357 round 1 suppliers that had bids  reviewed had been incorrectly disqualified. After reviewing the language  that CMS provided to suppliers during CBP round 1, we determined that  CMS did not effectively communicate to suppliers that they had an  opportunity to have disqualified round 1 bids reviewed. As a result, in  2009, we recommended, and CMS agreed, that if CMS chose to conduct  a review of disqualification decisions during CBP round 1 rebid and future  bids, CMS should notify and give all suppliers an equal opportunity for  review, and clearly indicate how suppliers can request a review.", "Although the notification that CMS provided to suppliers during the CBP  round 1 rebid provided more information than was provided during CBP  round 1, CMS did not inform suppliers that a review of a disqualified bid  could possibly result in reversal of the disqualification and extension of a  contract offer.

For contract suppliers that won CBP contracts for the same DME  capped rental DME items, grandfathering may be a temporary  disadvantage in both limiting the number of Medicare beneficiaries they  can serve and the amount of Medicare revenue they can immediately try  to gain.

The CBP  costs incurred during this time included outreach materials for  beneficiaries, referral agents, and others, an IT contract, and other  implementation costs. (See table 10.)", "In its 2007 CBP Final Rule, CMS estimated that a bidding supplier spends  an average of $2,303.16 to prepare bids for CBP, and in May 2011, CMS  officials told us that this estimate had not changed. Suppliers and supplier  organizations told us they incurred varying costs when preparing a bid,  including fees for legal and financial services. For example, one supplier  hired a new staff member to oversee the bidding process, and some  suppliers reported paying for assistance in compiling the required  financial documentation. Some suppliers reported additional legal  services to prepare their bids.", "Contract suppliers also incurred expenses for participating in the  program. Winning suppliers may incur additional expenses to fulfill their  contractual obligations\u2014for example, one supplier told us that it paid up  to $1,500 for updates to a software program in order to provide CMS the  data required under CBP.

In a 2012 report, CMS estimated  the CBP saved Medicare approximately $202.1 million in its first year of  implementation, a decrease in expenditures of over 42 percent in the nine  competitive bidding areas. This estimate is larger than the CMS\u2019s 2011  estimate, which did not include possible reductions in claims due to a  decline in utilization. According to CMS, most savings come from the  oxygen, mail-order diabetic supplies, and standard power wheelchair  product categories. CMS also reported that CBP resulted in savings for  beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HHS reviewed a draft of this report and provided written comments which  are reprinted in appendix II. HHS also provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "HHS made several general comments. First, HHS noted that the CBP  round 1 rebid resulted in savings of more than $200 million in its first year,  and that the Department anticipates additional savings of more than   $25 billion to the Medicare program between 2013 and 2022 as CBP  expands in round 2. Second, HHS commented that we had not fully  accounted for the robust nature of CMS\u2019s real-time claims monitoring  system that measures the health status of Medicare beneficiaries using  DME in both CBP and comparison areas, which HHS said indicates that  CBP-covered beneficiaries have not been adversely affected by CBP .  We revised the report to incorporate more details about the monitoring  program, but we believe that our original description of the program was  accurate. We concluded that, in the aggregate, CMS\u2019s monitoring efforts  provide useful information about beneficiary access and satisfaction.  Third, HHS stated that we agreed with its view that the CBP round 1 rebid  had reduced unnecessary utilization of DME. We noted that the CBP may  have successfully reduced unnecessary DME utilization, because  utilization has been reduced and CMS has not detected adverse health  consequences, but our analysis does not allow us to conclude definitively  that unnecessary utilization has been reduced. Moreover, we concluded  that more experience with DME competitive bidding is needed to assess  the program\u2019s full effects. Fourth, HHS suggested that January 2011 was  not an appropriate month to use in our examples of utilization changes  associated with the round 1 rebid because it was the first month of the  rebid. We agree and have changed our examples to May 2011.", "Finally, HHS discussed differences between CMS\u2019s methods for  measuring DME utilization changes associated with the CBP and our  methodology, and noted disparities between CMS\u2019s results and our  findings. HHS noted that CMS monitors all DME claims in real-time in  both CBP and matched comparison areas, and that its analyses are  comparisons between the types of areas. As HHS noted, we analyzed  claims data for DME items accounting for 80 percent of DME costs and  utilization, not all items. We compared DME utilization in CBP round 1  rebid areas to the rest of the country, not to specific comparator areas. In  addition, we analyzed claims for services provided in the months January  through June in 2011 and compared them to the same months in 2010.  Because the process of filing and processing Medicare claims can be  lengthy, we used data for claims that had been processed by CMS\u2019s  payment contractors as of February 2012. We believe that our methods  are valid. Further, our results are similar to results that CMS reported to  us in its technical comments. For example, CMS found that 14 percent  fewer beneficiaries had claims for hospital bed product category items in  CBP areas in 2011 than in 2010. We found that about 13 percent fewer  beneficiaries had claims for these items in May 2011 than in May 2010 in  the CBP areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Although the first year of the CBP round 1 rebid\u2019s contracts has been  completed, it is important to continue to closely monitor the CBP as the  program expands into 91 additional areas in round 2. Our findings are  based on the limited evidence available at the time we did our work. It is  too soon to determine the full effects the CBP may have on Medicare  beneficiaries and DME suppliers.", "We found that, in general, the round 1 rebid was successfully  implemented. Nearly the same number of suppliers participated in the  round 1 rebid as in CBP round 1. Few contract suppliers left Medicare  during CBP\u2019s first year. CMS\u2019s beneficiary satisfaction survey and other  monitoring activities, although limited, does not show evidence that  beneficiaries have been affected negatively by CBP. Utilization of  selected DME items declined in the round 1 rebid competitive bidding  areas; however, we do not assume that all pre-CBP utilization was  appropriate and CBP may have reduced unnecessary utilization of DME,  particularly because CMS chose to implement the CBP round 1 rebid in  areas with what it suspected were relatively high levels of unnecessary  utilization.", "More experience with DME competitive bidding is needed, particularly to  see if evidence of beneficiary access problems emerges. In the program\u2019s  first year, the prevalence of grandfathered suppliers for rental items may  have ameliorated beneficiary access concerns. The number of  grandfathered suppliers will continue to decrease as rental periods expire.  Further, it is not known if the number of subcontracting suppliers will  remain consistent or whether any change in subcontracting may affect  beneficiary access to DME. While few contract suppliers voluntarily  withdrew from CBP or were terminated by CMS in the first contract year,  an increase in either outcome throughout the remaining contract period  could have implications for beneficiary access and the CBP itself.  Additionally, it will be important to determine if DME utilization trends  similar to those in the round 1 rebid occur as the program expands into  round 2\u2019s competitive bidding areas.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services.
