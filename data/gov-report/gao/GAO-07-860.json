GAO obtained an understanding of the Army's efforts to achieve TAV, oversee and manage its business system investments, and address previously reported LMP problems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Supply chain management has been on GAO's high-risk list since 1990. One area that has contributed to this long-standing problem has been DOD's inability to maintain control and accountability over hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. DOD plans to improve its asset management through its business system modernization. In this regard, GFEBS, the Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army), and LMP are aimed at achieving TAV within the Army. The Army estimates that it will invest approximately $5 billion to develop and implement these systems. However, this investment is being made without a clear integrated strategy. GFEBS, GCSS-Army, and LMP are not being developed in the context of a well-defined Army-wide enterprise architecture. As a result, the Army does not have an informed basis for determining if these systems will fit within the context of future Army business operations and will efficiently and effectively address the Army's long-standing weaknesses associated with the lack of asset visibility. The Army lacks a concept of operations that would describe, at a high level, (1) how the three business systems relate to each other in achieving the Army's TAV goal, and (2) how information flows from and through these systems. Moreover, GAO found that the Army's lack of a concept of operations has contributed to its failure to take full advantage of business process reengineering opportunities that are available when using an enterprise resource planning solution. Without these key foundational elements, the Army is at risk of investing about $5 billion in business systems and still not achieving DOD's and the Army's goal of TAV. Furthermore, while the Army has established a governance structure that is consistent with DOD guidance, its processes are still maturing. The Army's governance structure is designed to certify and review individual business systems rather than to evaluate these investments from a portfolio perspective. Such a perspective permits investments to be viewed in a comprehensive manner to help ensure that the organization's missions and objectives are achieved. GAO also found that the Army did not have reliable processes and analyses, such as an independent validation and verification function or economic analyses, to support its oversight of individual business systems. Until the Army's investment processes mature, it runs the risk of investing in business systems that do not provide the desired functionality and efficiency. Additionally, LMP continues to be plagued by problems that have beset the system since its implementation in July 2003. LMP continues to experience problems with accurately recognizing revenue and billing customers, which can, in part, be attributed to ineffective system testing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has continually struggled to achieve  and maintain efficient and effective management over the hundreds of  billions of dollars it has invested in tangible assets, including inventory,  supplies, and materials (inventory and related property) and property,  plant, and equipment (PP&E). DOD was responsible for almost 72 percent  ($697 billion) of the total $970 billion reported governmentwide value for  these assets, as of September 30, 2006. The nature and severity of DOD\u2019s  financial and business management system deficiencies impede the ability  of DOD managers to receive the full range of information needed to  effectively manage day-to-day operations. Of the 27 areas on GAO\u2019s high-  risk list, DOD has 8 high-risk areas of its own and shares responsibility  for 7 governmentwide high-risk areas.", "Visibility over its assets has been a DOD concern for decades. If the  information contained in the asset accountability systems is not accurate,  complete, and timely, DOD\u2019s day-to-day operations could be adversely  affected by investing in inventory, for example, that is not needed to meet  current needs. When this occurs, the department may obligate funds  unnecessarily, which could lead to not having sufficient obligational  authority to purchase needed items. In recognition of the importance of  asset accountability to successful operations, the department established a  goal to achieve total asset visibility (TAV) over 30 years ago. DOD defines  TAV as the ability to provide timely and accurate information on the  location, movement, status, and identity of units, personnel, equipment,  and supplies and having the ability to act on that information. Over the  years, the military services and defense components have undertaken  numerous initiatives to achieve TAV. Within the Army, one such initiative  has been the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP). In May 2004 and  June 2005, we reported that LMP was not providing the Army the promised  capability.

As you requested, our initial effort was  directed at the Army. In September 2006, the Army reported inventory and  related property of about $57 billion and PP&E over $85 billion. The Army  has identified three primary system initiatives directed at achieving TAV  within the service: (1) LMP, (2) Global Combat Support System-Army  Field/Tactical (GCSS-Army), and (3) General Fund Enterprise Business  System (GFEBS). Our objectives were to (1) determine whether the Army  has developed a business system strategy for achieving TAV, (2) determine  if the Army has effectively implemented a governance structure to oversee  and manage its business system investments in accordance with DOD  guidance, and (3) evaluate the extent to which the Army has made  progress in correcting the previously reported problems regarding LMP\u2019s  implementation.", "To address the first objective, we met with Army program office officials  for GFEBS, GCSS-Army, and LMP and obtained briefings on the intended  purpose of each system.  In addition, we conducted walkthroughs and  reviewed documentation related to various transactions to obtain an  understanding of how the systems would exchange data and to assess how  the Army intended to use these systems individually and collectively to  achieve TAV. To address the second objective, we reviewed guidance  issued by DOD, the Army, and the Business Transformation Agency (BTA)  related to investment management. We also obtained an understanding of  the Army\u2019s business system investment governance structure and process  for ensuring compliance with the certification and annual system review  processes required by the fiscal year 2005 National Defense Authorization  Act. To address the third objective, we interviewed and obtained briefings  from LMP program management office officials and others, and reviewed  and analyzed LMP system requirement and testing documentation to  assess the extent to which corrective actions had been taken or are  planned to address our prior recommendations. We determined that the  documentation Army prepared and submitted through its business system  governance process to the investment review boards (IRBs) and the  Defense Business Systems Management Committee (DBSMC) as a basis  for approving individual Army business system investments was  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Our EAMMF is a  five-stage architecture framework for managing the development,  maintenance, and implementation of an architecture and understanding  the extent to which effective architecture management practices are being  performed and where an organization is in its progression toward having a  well-managed architecture program. In short, the framework consists of 31  core elements that relate to architecture governance, content, use, and  measurement. These elements reflect research by us and others showing  that architecture programs should be founded upon institutional  architecture commitment and capabilities, and measured and verified  products and results. Our analysis of information provided by the Army  indicated that it had satisfied only 3 percent of all framework elements.

One of the key benefits of  an ERP is that it can be used to streamline business processes and  eliminate data redundancy.

Considering the billions of  dollars the Army is investing in these systems, it is incumbent upon the  Army to embrace and utilize the most efficient and streamlined ERP  processes to the fullest extent possible in its effort to achieve TAV.", "For example, the Army\u2019s planned strategy to improve control and  accountability over its PP&E does not take advantage of the capabilities of  an ERP solution. (See app. III for additional examples in which the Army\u2019s  TAV systems initiatives have not effectively streamlined legacy processes  related to funds control and disbursements.) Financial data, including  acquisition cost and depreciation, for most of the Army\u2019s PP&E are  currently maintained in the Defense Property Accountability System  (DPAS). PP&E accountability data, such as location and quantity, are  maintained in a variety of legacy systems such as the Property Book Unit  Supply Enhanced (PBUSE) system\u2014which is 1 of the 16 systems that is  expected to be replaced by GCSS-Army. In March 2007, Army Program  Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems officials informed us that  the financial data\u2014such as acquisition cost and depreciation\u2014for the  Army\u2019s PP&E will be transferred from DPAS to GFEBS. This maintains the  existing accounting data in an accounting system. On the other hand, the  accountability data\u2014such as location, condition, and number of units\u2014for  PP&E assets will initially be transferred from the current legacy system to  PBUSE or GCSS-Army, depending on whether the items belong to an  installation or an Army unit that may be deployed. The transferring of  items to PBUSE appears to be an interim solution since, according to  DOD\u2019s enterprise transition plan GCSS-Army is to replace PBUSE.  However, GCSS-Army is not expected to assume the control and  accountability over items that are recorded in PBUSE associated with the  Army Working Capital Fund or other Army organizational entities that are  not considered to be units that can be deployed (field/tactical units) in  military operations.", "The Army\u2019s decision to segregate its PP&E financial and accountability  data into two separate system solutions reflects its lack of an enterprise  concept of operations and enterprise view for achieving TAV. The Army\u2019s  strategy of moving PP&E data from DPAS to PBUSE, and ultimately to  another system, means that one data conversion will take place to move  the data from DPAS to PBUSE\u2014a system the Army is supposed to  eliminate with the implementation of GCSS-Army\u2014followed by another  data conversion from PBUSE to yet another system, not yet identified.  Further, the Army is continuing to limit the capabilities of LMP by  transferring all information on PP&E from DPAS to PBUSE\u2014which as  noted before is considered a legacy business system. As a result,  information on PP&E that could enhance Tobyhanna\u2019s operations,  especially in the area of workload planning, will not be available within the  LMP environment.", "Thus, the approach being taken by the Army is simply to adapt the  processes used by the legacy systems rather than use the streamlined  processes inherent in the ERP solution. If the functionality of an ERP  solution was fully utilized by the Army, it would increase the likelihood  that TAV could be accomplished within each of the three systems for the  specific type of PP&E items each was responsible for. For example,  GFEBS would contain both the financial and accountability information  related to nontactical/non-working capital fund PP&E, GCSS-Army would  have all the information associated with tactical PP&E, and LMP would  have the data related to Working Capital Fund PP&E. Figure 5 illustrates  one way that an ERP approach could be utilized to achieve physical and  financial accountability control of the Army\u2019s PP&E.", "While the Army\u2019s approach may result in incremental improvements in its  asset accountability, it does not take full advantage of the (1) benefits of  adopting enterprise processes and (2) functionality that is available in the  ERP solution it has selected to support those processes. Fundamental to a  successful ERP implementation is the reengineering of an organization\u2019s  business processes in a manner that helps ensure that the right resources  (people, material, machinery, and funds) are available in the correct  quantities when needed. While Army has stated that its use of ERP  software would help reengineer its business processes, we found that at  least some business processes that are being used or expected to be used  in the future do not reflect reengineered processes necessary to most  effectively implement an ERP solution.

The  purpose of an economic analysis is to give the decision maker insight into  economic factors that have a bearing on accomplishing the stated  objective of the system investment, for example implementation of GFEBS  to improve the Army\u2019s financial accountability. As such, it is important  that the economic analysis reliably identifies factors, such as cost and  performance risks and drivers that can be used to establish priorities and  allocate resource allocations. While it may be appropriate to invest in a  particular IT investment, such as GFEBS, for reasons other than estimated  economic benefits, nonetheless, the issues we identified raise questions as  whether the funds invested in GFEBS were economically justified. Our  specific concerns with the August 2004 GFEBS economic analysis are  highlighted below.", "Inappropriate cost savings. At least $142 million of estimated savings  were not savings, but rather, should have been classified as transfers\u2014 which do not equate to economic benefits. Transfers represent shifts of  control over resource allocation from one group to another that do not  result in a net change in the value of the resources involved in the transfer.  For example, we found that the Army claimed over $88 million of savings  related to transferring real property management from the Army\u2019s legacy  system to GFEBS. Since the Army\u2019s real property management  responsibilities were not eliminated, only transferred from the legacy  system environment to GFEBS, this represents a transfer rather than an  economic benefit for the Army. Additionally, the Army claimed benefits of  about $54 million related to GFEBS reducing the length of time funds are  borrowed by the Treasury to meet the Army financial obligations by  facilitating the Army\u2019s ability to make just-in-time disbursements. OMB  guidance provides that there are no economic gains from a pure transfer  payment because the benefits to those government entities that receive  such a transfer are matched by the costs borne by those government  entities that provide the transfer. The Army\u2019s inappropriate classification  of transfers resulted in an overstatement of the economic benefits that  would be achieved by implementing GFEBS. Additionally, in November  2006, BTA\u2019s enterprise risk assessment management review of GFEBS  questioned justifying the GFEBS program on factors not fully within the  program\u2019s control.", "Lack of sensitivity analysis. The analysis did not include an assessment  of the effects of the uncertainty inherent in estimates of GFEBS benefits  and costs, as stipulated in OMB and DOD guidance. Because an economic  analysis uses estimates and assumptions, it is critical that a sensitivity  analysis be performed to understand the effects of the imprecision in both  underlying data and modeling assumptions. This analysis is required since  the estimates of future benefits and costs are subject to varying degrees of  uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis refers to changing the value of a given  variable in a model to gauge the effect of change on model results. It varies  a single data element or assumption while holding the other data elements  and assumptions constant to determine what amount of change in that  element is required to raise or lower the resulting benefit and cost  elements. In this way, GFEBS data and assumptions can be risk-ranked for  decisionmaking and auditing. The Army\u2019s failure to conduct a sensitivity  analysis of GFEBS, as part of its economic analysis, to identify the effect  of uncertainties associated with different assumptions increases the  chance that decisions regarding GFEBS will be made without a clear  understanding of the possible impact on GFEBS estimates of costs and  benefits. Army officials informed us that they will consider including a  sensitivity analysis of the effect of uncertainties when they update  GFEBS\u2019s economic analysis.", "Lack of documentation supporting benefits and cost assumptions.", "The GFEBS program management office could not provide us with  benefits and costs data needed to replicate their analyses.

As a result of  this decision, the Army has not taken full advantage of the capabilities  within the ERP software package being used to implement LMP.  Considering that the Army has already invested approximately               $452 million in LMP, and as previously noted is expecting to invest  hundreds of million more, taking full advantage of its capabilities is also a  prudent financial decision. Because the Army failed to reengineer its  business processes, it continues to use an off-line database, managed by  the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), to compare  entitlement and accounting data and provide approval for prevalidation  requests. The DOD Inspector General report noted that the database  contained errors in the accounting data, which resulted in prevalidation  failures and the need for additional research and rework by DFAS.", "A more efficient and streamlined process could be achieved by adopting  ERP processes for disbursements. For example, by utilizing ERP concepts  LMP would be the accounting system of record and responsible for  ensuring that the applicable federal requirements governing fund control  and disbursements were effectively implemented. Further, the  disbursements would be made directly by the Department of the  Treasury\u2014much like the process used by civilian agencies\u2014rather than  going through DFAS. We recognize that this approach involves some  technical issues, such as building the necessary interfaces with the  Department of the Treasury. However, the commercial-off-the-shelf  (COTS) package adopted by LMP is already required by its Office of  Management and Budget certification to provide the necessary support for  these interfaces.

Customer orders that were not recognized as revenue and billed represent  funds that Tobyhanna Army Depot is entitled to, because the work  requested by the customer was performed. It is essential that revenue is  properly recognized and customers billed for work performed because it is  the means by which the depot finances its day-to-day operations. Similarly,  during the January 31, 2007, billing cycle about 308 customer orders  amounting to about $5.8 million were shown as being overbilled and a  credit should have been issued to the customer. It is critical that the credit  be provided to the customer as soon as possible since the customer may  be able to use these funds to meet other funding demands.", "Our analysis of the January 2007 billings for Tobyhanna disclosed that, of  the 146 unbilled customer orders, 61 (about 42 percent) related to fiscal  years 2006 and 2007.

From a dollar  perspective, most of these billings also related to fiscal years 2006 and  2007 transactions. The fact that these billing problems have persisted  clearly indicates that the various efforts by the Army to resolve this critical  aspect of the system have failed.

The manual workarounds  required to address LMP\u2019s billing issues results in higher DFAS bills for  Tobyhanna, which in turn increases the prices charged by Tobyhanna to  its customers for the work performed. Since Tobyhanna is part of the  Army Working Capital Fund, the costs incurred for accounting services are  passed on to the customer in the form of higher depot prices.

However, based upon our review and analysis of the 10 selected corrective  actions, we still have concerns that the LMP testing process may not be  adequate since we identified specific weaknesses in the 10 corrective  actions reviewed. System testing is a critical process utilized by  disciplined organizations and improves an entity\u2019s confidence that the  system will satisfy the requirements of the end user and operate as  intended. The stated testing process included the following:    Documenting scenario testing. A scenario is a business process that  typically consists of several events. For example, a scenario could be  developed for small purchases, which would include events such as         (1) initiating a purchase request, (2) approving the request, (3) obligating  the necessary funds, (4) ordering the item, (5) receiving the item, and      (6) paying for the item. One benefit of testing scenarios is that it helps to  ensure that information is accurately passed from one process to another.  For instance, the denial of a requisition prevents the purchase of the item.", "Linking requirements to the test cases. Linking requirements and test  cases helps ensure that either (1) all requirements are adequately tested or  (2) the risks associated with not testing a requirement can be properly  evaluated. Because it is not economically feasible to develop a testing  program that can find every defect, it is critical that an approach be  developed to ensure that testing resources are focused on the areas of  highest risk. Accordingly, linking the requirements makes it easier to  determine which combinations of items are not tested, thereby enabling  the Army to evaluate the risks of not conducting those tests.", "Regression testing. Regression testing is a process that helps ensure that  changes made to the system have not adversely affected functionality that  was working prior to a change being made to the system. In essence, it is a  process that retests the entire system to ensure that the problem fixed did  not have an adverse effect on other functions within the system.", "While the processes described above are an improvement over what we  have seen in the past, we continue to identify weaknesses in the testing  process. For example, none of the test scripts provided adequate  information that linked the items in the test script to a specific  requirement. This linking is commonly referred to as traceability and is  characteristic of a disciplined testing process. The test scripts reviewed  contained headings for information on the scenario, key data  requirements, expected results, actual results, and whether the test was  considered successful. However, the actual test script failed to contain the  level of specificity that clearly delineated how a specific requirement  identified in the requirement document(s) and the associated  requirement(s) in that document were being tested. As a result, it is  virtually impossible to ascertain if the requirement was properly tested.  For example, several requirements defined rules that were expected to be  implemented. Without linking a given requirement to the tests designed to  exercise that requirement, it was impossible to obtain reasonable  assurance that (1) all the requirements had been tested and (2) the test  provided adequate coverage for each requirement.", "A review of the test script for one corrective action showed that the  identified expected results were \u201coutput of report should show open  accounts receivable items for customers in the range noted.\u201d Our analysis  of the documentation disclosed that the test scripts only tested to make  sure that a report could be printed for (1) a specific customer, (2) a  consecutive range of customers (e.g., customers 1 through 10), (3) federal  and nonfederal customers (the exact condition tested was not specified  since the user was only required to pick one of the conditions), and   (4) receivables associated with a specified general ledger account. While  this testing addressed the requirements that the report be printed using  these conditions, the scripts did not provide evidence that other  requirements were tested and the data presented were valid. For example,  the report was expected to put receivables into 11 different age categories  (for example 0 to 30 days, 31 to 60 days, etc.); however, no evidence was  provided to show that the balances shown on these reports (1) were  consistent with known results and (2) the accounts selected provided  adequate coverage of the ranges specified. The latter is especially  important since two of the ranges overlap. LMP and CSC officials agreed  that the documentation did not always provide the level of detail that was  needed to (1) document which requirements contained in applicable  requirement documents were being tested and (2) ensure that all of the  specific tests that were required to provide reasonable assurance that the  application worked as expected were completed.", "Furthermore, we were informed that the system testing was conducted by  the developers and subject matter experts. Using developers and subject  matter experts, and depending on those individuals\u2019 comprehensive body  of knowledge as the foundation for a testing effort, carries significant risks  since this is not a recognized best practice. A basic testing principle is that  a developer should not test his or her own work, nor should a  development organization test its own work. These testing principles are  based on the concept that testing is the process of executing a program  with the intent of finding errors. Testing is normally considered a  \u201cdestructive\u201d process while the development activities are normally  considered a \u201cconstructive\u201d progress. It is very difficult for a developer to  change the perspective required to successfully develop a program into  the perspective necessary to adequately test a process. This does not  mean that the developers are not involved in the testing process since a  best practice is to have them responsible for testing the code they develop  to ensure that it is ready for the next stage of testing.", "Further, as noted in our May 2004 report, our analysis of LMP\u2019s December  2003 and January 2004 project status reports identified numerous  instances in which the Army continued to experience problems with the  accuracy of data related to budgeting; workload planning and forecasting  and depot maintenance operations; and accounting records such as  customer orders, purchase orders and requisitions, obligations, and  disbursements.
