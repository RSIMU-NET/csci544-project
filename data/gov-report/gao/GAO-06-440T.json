For example, they have reached agreement with AOC's Chief Fire Marshal on the schedule for testing the base project's life safety systems and have enhanced the manner in which the project's operations schedule is incorporated into the project's master schedule. In addition, they have reviewed and revised the schedule, postponing the opening dates for the CVC and the House and Senate expansion spaces by about 2 months each. Under AOC's revised schedule, the CVC would be open to the public in February 2007 with a temporary cap on visitor occupancy, and the expansion spaces would be open in April 2007. However, to allow for possible delays and start-up time for operations, AOC is proposing to open the CVC in April 2007 and the expansion spaces in May 2007, at which time the temporary cap on CVC occupancy would be lifted. We concur with AOC about the need for postponing the opening dates, but do not believe that AOC has scheduled enough time to complete several of the project's critical tasks and to address the problems, challenges, risks, and uncertainties that AOC and the CVC team are attempting to address. If they are successful in addressing these issues, we believe that the CVC can be opened to the public with the temporary cap on visitor occupancy in May 2007 and that the expansion spaces can be opened beginning in mid-August to early September 2007. Congress may be able to begin occupying the expansion spaces earlier if AOC implements a phased opening plan it is considering. However, if AOC experiences major problems completing construction, such as with installing interior stone or testing major building systems, the work could be finished even later than we have estimated. According to our current estimate, the total estimated cost to complete the entire CVC project is about $555 million without an allowance for risks and uncertainties. This estimate exceeds our November 16, 2005, estimate by about $12 million because we and AOC's construction management contractor are now projecting further delay-related costs. Changes in the project's design and scope have also been occurring, and more are likely. For example, the project's fire protection system has been evolving, and the system is now expected to cost more than previously estimated. To date, about $528 million has been provided for CVC construction. Thus, we now estimate that another $25.6 million will be needed to complete construction without an allowance for risks and uncertainties and taking into account funding from existing appropriations that AOC is planning to use. With an allowance for risks and uncertainties, we now estimate that the project could cost as much as about $584 million at completion, or about $25 million more than we estimated in November 2005.

In January 2006, we and our consultant interviewed project  managers and team members from AOC and its major CVC contractors,  USCP representatives, and AOC\u2019s Chief Fire Marshal to identify the risks  they saw in completing the remaining work and the time they considered  necessary to finish the CVC project and open it to the public. Using the  project\u2019s November and December 2005 schedules (the most recent  schedules available when we did our work), we asked the team members  to estimate how many workdays would be needed to complete the  remaining work. More specifically, for each major activity that the  members had a role or expertise in, we asked them to develop three  estimates of the activity\u2019s duration\u2014the least, the most likely, and the  longest time needed to complete the activity. Using these three-point  estimates and a simulation analysis to calculate different combinations of  the team\u2019s estimates that factored in identified risks and uncertainties, we  estimated the completion date for the base project at various confidence  levels based on AOC\u2019s December 2005 schedule.

For example, the CVC  team reviewed the sequence and duration of the activities scheduled for  interior stonework, finish work, and work associated with the base  project\u2019s fire protection system, including the acceptance testing to be  done by AOC\u2019s Fire Marshal Division. To reflect the results of its review,  the team revised the project\u2019s December 2005 and January 2006 schedules,  and in collaboration with the team that is planning for CVC operations,  enhanced the manner in which the operations activities are incorporated  into the project\u2019s master schedule. AOC and its contractors\u2019 staff who are  involved in planning for CVC operations agree that the January 2006  schedule identifies the related construction and operations activities. The  CVC team has not yet fully reassessed the schedule for the expansion  spaces and has not yet reached agreement with the Chief Fire Marshal on  the requirements for acceptance testing of those spaces. Finally, the CVC  team has continued to meet weekly to identify risks facing the project and  to discuss mitigation strategies and actions. As of February 1, 2006, the  team had identified 62 risks and developed mitigation strategies for all but  1, which had just been identified. The plans vary in their level of detail and  stage of implementation.", "According to AOC\u2019s December 2005 and January 2006 schedules, the CVC  base project will be ready to open to the public with a temporary  certificate of occupancy on February 13, 2007, and the House and Senate  expansion spaces will be ready on April 24, 2007. To allow for possible  delays and start-up time for operations, AOC has proposed an April 2007  opening date for the base project and a May 2007 occupancy date for the  expansion spaces. By the April opening date for the base project, AOC  believes, all construction work in the CVC and East Front will be  completed, but the CVC\u2019s occupancy at any one time will be temporarily  limited to 3,500, compared with about 4,200, the normal anticipated  occupancy level. This temporary limit will be necessary because the  \u201chorizontal exits,\u201d or passages, through the expansion spaces, which the  life safety code requires for exiting the base CVC project, will not be  available until later. These horizontal exits cannot be used until the fire  alarm system in the expansion spaces has been fully tested and  accepted\u2014work that is not slated to be completed until after the base CVC  is scheduled to open. Some additional work will likely be required to  provide temporary emergency exit routes from the CVC, but the CVC team  does not believe that this work or its costs should be substantial.", "Mr. Chairman, a brief explanation of AOC\u2019s rationale for proposing a CVC  opening with a temporary cap on visitor occupancy may be helpful at this  point. The current project schedule calls for completing the construction  of both the CVC and the expansion spaces before December 31, 2006, but  would delay the start of acceptance testing the portions of the fire alarm  system in the expansion spaces until such testing for the base CVC project  is completed in February 2007. AOC is planning this approach because it  believes that starting the acceptance testing for the expansion spaces  earlier would prolong the completion of the acceptance testing in the base  project and thereby delay the base project\u2019s opening to the public. More  specifically, the fire protection devices for the atriums, which are a part of  the horizontal exits ultimately required by code for full occupancy of the  base project, would undergo acceptance testing with the expansion  spaces, rather than with the base CVC project. To accommodate this  change, AOC shifted the finish work in the atriums from the base CVC  schedule to the expansion space schedule, and is planning to conduct the  acceptance testing for the atriums and the expansion spaces at the same  time, after the acceptance testing for the base CVC project is done. Until  the acceptance testing for the expansion spaces has been completed,  AOC\u2019s Chief Fire Marshal has said that the expansion spaces, including the  exits through the atriums, cannot be used as emergency exit routes, and  therefore AOC must take measures to provide temporary emergency exit  routes from the base CVC project and reduce the number of occupants  who can be in the base project until the exit routes are available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Indicates Later Opening Dates in Light of Problems, Challenges, Risks, and Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["Our work to date in monitoring the CVC project and the results of our  recently completed risk assessment of the project\u2019s schedule point to later  opening dates than the schedule indicates. Although the schedule for the  base project goes a long way toward responding to our concerns about the  amount of time previously provided for a number of activities and extends  their duration, CVC team managers and members we interviewed believe  that certain work will take longer to complete than the revised schedule  allows. For example, they believe that interior stonework and finish work  for the base project and the East Front are likely to take longer. According  to our risk analysis, which reflects the CVC team\u2019s input and assumes that  AOC will successfully address the challenges it faces, the CVC is more  likely to be ready for opening with a temporary certificate of occupancy  between late April and mid-May 2007 than in February, as indicated in  AOC\u2019s current schedule. AOC is now proposing an April 2007 opening date  to provide time for possible construction slippages and operations  preparation. The additional time AOC says is necessary for operations  preparation after construction completion would mean that the CVC  would be ready for opening with a temporary cap on visitor occupancy by  about the end of May 2007, according to our analysis. Similarly, our  analysis suggests that the House and Senate expansion spaces are more  likely to be ready in mid August or early September 2007 than in April or  May 2007. We believe the later time frames are more likely because (1)  AOC has scheduled the acceptance testing of the expansion spaces after  the acceptance testing of the base project and, according to our work, the  base project testing will take longer than scheduled and (2) AOC\u2019s Chief  Fire Marshal believes that the acceptance testing of the expansion spaces  will take longer than scheduled.", "We have discussed the results of our analysis with AOC, and it continues  to believe that it will be able to meet its April and May 2007 time frames  for the CVC and the expansion spaces, respectively. Furthermore, AOC  said that it and the CVC team will continuously review the schedule to  identify opportunities for improvement. For example, AOC pointed out  that it may be able to have the acceptance testing of the expansion spaces  done in segments so that Members and staff will not have to wait for the  entire facility to be tested before they can occupy their space. AOC also  believes it may be able to revise the scheduling of some East Front  mechanical work to save time. We agree that AOC should continuously  look for ways to improve the schedule and that improvements may be  possible. However, we also believe that AOC will be challenged to meet  even the later opening dates we have identified given the problems,  challenges, risks, and uncertainties the project faces. A discussion of these  follows:    Delivery of stone and pace of stone installation remain critical. Although  the CVC team has made progress in installing interior wall and floor stone,  work on the wall stone has fallen behind schedule in several areas, and the  project still faces significant challenges, risks, and uncertainties in this  area. These include whether sufficient quantities of the appropriate wall  stone will be received in time and whether the pace of installation will be  sufficient to complete this work as scheduled. According to information  provided by the sequence 2 contractor on February 10, the wall stone  supplier still had a 20-truckload backlog and was not shipping wall stone  at the scheduled rate, resulting in a delivery shortfall of about 6,000 cubic  feet. According to AOC\u2019s construction management contractor, stone  supply is not affecting interior wall stone installation because a large  quantity of stone is currently on site; however, the contractor is concerned  about the ability of the stone supplier to meet current and future  requirements that include stone for the East Front, adequate stone to  maintain productivity, and the 20-truckload backlog. The pace of  installation is also an issue. The sequence 2 contractor has recently  increased the number of stone masons working on the project and has  begun meeting the installation targets in its work plan. However, if the  wall stone installation targets are not achieved, whether because the  masons are less productive than planned or work spaces are not ready for  stonework to begin, completion delays are likely. The sequence 2  contractor has already encountered work spaces in the service level, the  orientation lobby, and the East Front that were not available for  stonework because concrete was out of tolerance or masonry walls were  not ready for wall stone to be hung. Finally, the sequence 2 contractor still  needs to install about 120,000 square feet of floor stone in the CVC and  could have problems meeting the scheduled completion dates if not  enough masons are available, the amount of floor space available is  insufficient because other finish work is not done, or other trades are  working in the areas where floor stone is to be laid. As of February 10,  AOC had not received a floor stone installation plan requested from the  sequence 2 contractor, but the sequence 2 contractor said that it intends to  finish the plan soon.", "Stacking of trades could delay completion. Continued delays, particularly  in wall stone installation, could adversely affect the sequence 2  contractor\u2019s ability to accomplish all of the required finish work on  schedule. The sequence 2 contractor has been making progress relative to  its current plan for installing wall stone in the auditorium and the  orientation lobby, but according to the current project schedule, wall  stone installation is delayed in other areas, such as the East Front, the  great hall, and the orientation theaters\u2019 exterior walls. Furthermore, as of  February 10, although the contractor had completed 10 of the 13  milestones relating to wall stone that are being tracked for the  Subcommittee, none of the 10 was completed by the date set in the  September 2005 baseline schedule, and only 4 were completed by the date  set in the November 2005 schedule. (See app. I.) If delays continue, a  stacking of trades such as we described at the Subcommittee\u2019s November  hearing could hold up finish work, such as drywall or ceiling installation,  electrical and plumbing work, plastering, or floor stone installation. Such  a situation could also increase the risk of accidents and injuries. The CVC  team has also identified \u201ctrade stacking\u201d as a high risk. The sequence 2  contractor acknowledges the risk, but said that it has structured its  schedule to avoid the risk and plans to monitor progress closely to avoid  problems. We acknowledge that these steps can be helpful; however, the  more the wall stone schedule slips, the greater is the likelihood of \u201ctrade  stacking,\u201d since more and more work will have to be done in less time to  meet the schedule. AOC\u2019s construction management contractor agrees  that this is a serious potential problem.", "Complex building systems remain a significant risk. The CVC will  contain complex building systems, including systems for heating, air  conditioning, and ventilation; fire protection; and security. These systems  not only have to perform well individually, but their operation has to be  integrated. If the CVC team encounters any significant problems with their  functioning, either individually or together, during commissioning or  testing, the project could be seriously delayed. AOC and the CVC team are  aware of these risks and have been taking steps to mitigate them as part of  their risk management process. Yet despite these steps, a significant  problem could arise during commissioning or testing, and it is important  that the team be prepared for such an event.", "Building design continues to evolve. The CVC has undergone a number of  design changes, and design changes are continuing for a number of  building components, such as the exhibit gallery and the fire protection  and security systems. Some of these changes have resulted in delays, such  as in the exhibit gallery and in the East Front. In addition, designs or shop  drawings for some elements of the project, such as aspects of the facility\u2019s  fire protection systems, have not yet been fully approved and are subject  to change. At this stage of the project\u2019s construction, one might expect the  number of design changes to dwindle. However, this is not the case. For  example, more than 20 design changes or clarifications were issued last  month. Additional design changes are being considered, and the potential  exists for such changes to further adversely affect the schedule.", "Multiple critical activity paths complicate schedule management. In its  report on the project\u2019s January 2006 schedule, AOC\u2019s construction  management contractor identified 18 critical activity paths\u20144 more than  in the contractor\u2019s report on the project\u2019s October 2005 schedule\u2014that are  crucial to meeting the scheduled completion date. In addition, the  construction management contractor said that several noncritical  activities have fallen behind schedule since November 2005, and a number  of these have moved closer to becoming critical to the project\u2019s  completion. As we have previously said, having a large number of critical  and near-critical activities complicates project management and increases  the risk of missing completion dates. We believe that the CVC team will be  particularly challenged to manage all of these areas concurrently and to  deal effectively with problems that could arise within these areas,  especially if multiple problems arise at the same time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Project Costs Exceed Funding Provided as of February 2006", "paragraphs": ["We currently estimate that the total cost to complete the entire CVC  project is about $555 million without an allowance for risks and  uncertainties and could be as much as about $584 million with such an  allowance. As table 1 indicates, our current estimate without an allowance  for risks and uncertainties is about $12 million higher than the estimate  without such an allowance that we presented at the Subcommittee\u2019s  November 16, 2005, hearing. This $12 million increase is largely  attributable to additional    delay costs estimated by AOC\u2019s construction management contractor and    actual and anticipated changes in the design and scope of the project.", "In particular, changes in the project\u2019s fire protection system, which we  discussed at the Subcommittee\u2019s October 18, 2005, CVC hearing, are now  expected to cost more than previously estimated. Specifically, the system\u2019s  acceptance testing is expected to be more extensive and to take place later  than originally anticipated, and additional temporary construction may be  required to ensure fire safety if the CVC is opened to the public before the  Senate and House expansion spaces are completed. This additional  construction would involve designing and installing\u2014and then removing\u2014 temporary walls and perhaps taking other fire protection measures to  create emergency exits from the CVC. As discussed in more detail earlier  in this statement, the need for temporary construction may be reduced or  eliminated if the fire safety acceptance testing of the expansion spaces and  of the CVC can be performed concurrently, rather than over two separate  periods, as would be likely if the CVC is opened to the public before the  expansion spaces are completed. We discussed this issue during the  Subcommittee\u2019s July 14, 2005, CVC hearing and recommended then that  AOC estimate the cost of these temporary measures so that Congress  could weigh the costs and benefits of opening the CVC before the  expansion spaces are completed. AOC has agreed to provide this estimate  to Congress when it has more information on the status of construction  progress on the CVC and expansion spaces and the specific steps that will  be necessary to provide adequate temporary exit routes.", "We now estimate that the total cost to complete the entire project with an  allowance for risks and uncertainties could be as much as $584 million, or  about $25 million more than we estimated in November 2005. This  increase reflects the potential for the project to incur additional costs if    difficulties arise in commissioning and testing its complex and  sophisticated fire protection, ventilation, and security systems;   significant problems with the building\u2019s design are identified and need to  be corrected during construction;    delays cost more than anticipated; and    significant discretionary changes in the project\u2019s design and scope are  requested.", "To date, about $528 million has been provided for CVC construction. This  amount does not include about $7.7 million that was made available for  either CVC construction or operations. According to AOC, it expects to  use about $2 million of this amount for construction. To obtain the  additional funding that it expected to need to complete the project\u2019s  construction, AOC, in December 2005, requested $20.6 million as part of its  budget request for fiscal year 2007. This request was based, in part, on  discussions with us and took into account our November 16, 2005,  estimate of the cost to complete the project\u2019s construction without an  allowance for risks and uncertainties and funding from existing  appropriations. The request also reflected updates to our November  estimate through mid-December 2005. At that time, the $20.6 million  request for additional appropriations, coupled with the additional funds  that AOC planned to use from existing appropriations, would have been  sufficient to cover the estimated cost to complete construction without an  allowance for risks and uncertainties.", "Our work since mid-December 2005 indicates that AOC will need about $5  million more, or about $25.6 million in additional funds, to complete  construction without an allowance for risks and uncertainties. This  increase reflects  the number and magnitude of potential change orders that CVC team  members and we believe are likely and   additional costs associated with extending the project\u2019s expected  completion date beyond March 31, 2007, the date contemplated in our last  cost estimate.", "AOC generally agrees with our estimate, particularly with respect to  having sufficient contingency funds available for necessary design or  scope changes or for additional delay-related costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Estimated Construction Costs for Library of Congress Tunnel Close to, but under, Limit", "paragraphs": ["Public Law 108-83 limits to $10 million the amount of federal funds that  can be obligated or expended for the construction of the tunnel  connecting the CVC with the Library of Congress.

AOC\u2019s remaining estimated  costs are for potential changes.", "On February 13, 2006, AOC awarded a contract for the work to connect  the tunnel to the Jefferson Building. This work is costing more than AOC  had estimated\u2014a possibility we raised in our November 16 testimony  before the Subcommittee. Because this work involves creating an opening  in the building\u2019s foundation and changing the existing structure, we  believe that AOC is likely to encounter unforeseen conditions that could  further increase its costs.
