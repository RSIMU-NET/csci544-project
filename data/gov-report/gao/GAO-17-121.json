NIH's budget\u2014$30 billion in fiscal year 2015\u2014mostly funds extramural research that supports research personnel working at universities, medical schools, and other institutions. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\u2014one of NIH's 27 institutes and centers (IC)\u2014has primary responsibility for kidney disease research. NIH funding for biomedical research on kidney disease in fiscal year 2015 was approximately $564 million\u2014an increase of 2.7 percent from fiscal year 2014. NIDDK provided the majority (60 percent) of this funding, supporting a broad range of projects, such as chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment, and kidney donation. GAO also reviewed NIH research funding levels for other diseases and conditions in the United States\u2014those that are associated with high mortality or are among the most prevalent chronic conditions. GAO found that funding for fiscal year 2015 varied widely among these diseases and conditions\u2014for example, from $28 million for emphysema to nearly $5.4 billion for cancer. This variation in funding reflects a range of factors, including each IC's mission, budget, and research priorities.", "NIDDK obtains input from the broader kidney care community to develop its research priorities. To develop funding announcements that target high-priority research areas, NIDDK considers the kidney care community's input in the context of its ongoing work and its knowledge of the current state of kidney disease research.

Kidney disease disproportionately affects  older, minority, and low-income individuals, and is often associated with  other health conditions, including heart disease. Diabetes and  hypertension\u2014significant health problems in the United States\u2014are the  leading causes of kidney disease. Individuals who have kidney disease  are at risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a condition  of kidney failure, which causes death without dialysis or a kidney  transplant.

Specifically, we analyzed CDC\u2019s national survey data,  and interviewed CDC officials to identify conditions that had high  mortality, or were chronic conditions with high prevalence, or both. We  then matched the diseases and conditions we identified with fiscal year  2015 data\u2014the most current available\u2014from NIH\u2019s Research, Condition,  and Disease Categorization (RCDC) system, which categorizes NIH  research projects (and associated funding) into categories that  correspond to diseases and conditions.

To understand how  NIDDK officials work with other federal agencies engaged in kidney  disease research, we interviewed officials from the KICC agencies that  fund or conduct biomedical research and attended two KICC meetings in  March and June of 2016. We also interviewed officials from the three NIH  institutes that fund most of the kidney-related research after NIDDK: the  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Institute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases, and the National Cancer Institute. To gain  insight into the extent to which NIDDK\u2019s priorities align with those of the  kidney care community, we obtained the perspective of six private kidney  care groups representing professional societies, patient advocacy groups,  dialysis providers, and other kidney-care industries. We selected these  six groups because, together, they represent a broad range of  perspectives within the kidney care community.

For most people, kidney disease unfolds slowly over many  years and often has no signs or symptoms until the disease is very  advanced, such that less than 15 percent of people in the late stages of  kidney disease are aware of their disease. However, early detection is  possible through blood and urine tests, which can delay or prevent the  progression of kidney disease. Treatment may include, for example,  taking medicines to manage high blood pressure to protect the kidneys.  However, even with treatment, kidney disease usually cannot be cured.  Instead, it may get worse over time leading to kidney failure, or ESRD,  which may lead to death without dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant.  While anyone can develop kidney disease, regardless of age or race,  African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans are at high risk for  ESRD, due, in part, to high rates of diabetes and high blood pressure in  these communities.

As the lead NIH institute for kidney disease, NIDDK funds a  broad kidney disease research portfolio, while the other ICs fund kidney  disease research in more specific areas that relate to their missions. For  example, one component of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood  Institute\u2019s mission is heart health, and as noted earlier, heart disease can  be a cause of kidney disease.

The RCDC  categories corresponding to these leading diseases and conditions, which  are shown in table 1, are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive.  Categories do not exist for all diseases and conditions, and NIH officials  said that a project may be included in, on average, six RCDC categories.

For instance, representatives from four of the six  groups we interviewed expressed concern over a lack of kidney disease  awareness in the general public. To mitigate this, representatives from  one group recommended additional research on identifying at-risk  populations that would benefit from kidney disease screenings. In  addition, some of representatives noted that additional outreach and research is needed to reduce the disparities associated with ESRD.  Specifically, rates of ESRD are 3.4 times higher in African Americans and  1.5 times higher in Hispanics than in whites. NIDDK officials agreed that  improving kidney disease awareness and reducing kidney disease  disparities were important issues, and pointed out a variety of ongoing  NIDDK programs related to these topics. For example, NIDDK  established the National Kidney Disease Education Program to raise  awareness and reduce disparities through a variety of efforts directed at  communities at high risk for kidney disease, patients, and professionals  working in the primary care setting. NIDDK officials also said that  NIDDK\u2019s Kidney Sundays program is intended to address both kidney  disease awareness and disparities.

Though our list of  chronic conditions was primarily based on the OASH list, we compared it  with CDC\u2019s leading causes of death list and the list of most prevalent  chronic conditions that CDC provided GAO in 2013. If a condition was  listed on the leading cause of death list or the 2013 list from CDC, but  was not present on the OASH list, we added it to our total list of  conditions to ensure that we did not omit any key chronic conditions.

Through a  collaboration with over 75 member organizations\u2014such as patient  organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,  dialysis providers, and government agencies\u2014the KHI aims to (1)  advance scientific understanding of the kidney health and patient  safety implications of new and existing medical products, and to  (2) foster development of therapies for diseases that affect the  kidneys. For instance, one of KHI\u2019s current research projects  seeks to clarify clinical trial endpoints for dialysis vascular access  trials. Though FDA does not direct its grant to specific KHI  projects, FDA representatives participate on KHI\u2019s board of  directors and can thereby influence research project funding  decisions. According to FDA officials, in fiscal year 2015, FDA  provided KHI with $500,000.", "Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In fiscal year 2015, VA  supported 107 kidney disease intramural research projects. For  example, a past VA study found that patients who took part in a  screening and education program for kidney disease before being  diagnosed with the disease were better prepared to live with the  disease and had significantly lower death rates than those who had  not taken part in the program. In addition, VA recently issued  guidelines (jointly developed with DOD), for the management of  chronic kidney disease. According to VA officials, the total VA  biomedical research budget in fiscal year 2015 was $589 million, of  which about $20.9 million was for kidney disease research.", "PCORI.

Participants were asked  to categorize their ideas into 12 topic areas, such as chronic kidney  disease, acute kidney injury, and end stage renal disease. According  to NIDDK\u2019s website, the KRND had over 1,600 participants from more  than 30 countries.", "Phase 2 of the KRND (2011\u20142014): NIDDK invited research experts  to participate in one of 12 topic-specific working groups. Each group  was charged with fully assessing the postings from phase 1 of the  KRND, identifying research gaps, and developing a potential strategy  for moving the field forward. Each working group published their  priority recommendations in the Clinical Journal of American Society  of Nephrology. The groups\u2019 papers covered the following 12 topics:  1.  Overview of the KRND  3.  Acute Kidney Injury  4.  Defining Kidney Biology to Understand Renal Disease  6.  Improving Chronic Kidney Disease Therapies and Care  7.

Given the high costs of this disease, we looked at how the federal government funds and prioritizes its research. We found that the National Institutes of Health spent $564 million on kidney disease research in 2015, an increase of 2.7 percent from 2014. These funds supported a broad range of projects, including research on kidney donation."]}
