NRC expects its new process to enhance the efficiency and predictability of its reviews. GAO reviewed NRC's readiness to evaluate these applications by examining the steps NRC has taken to (1) prepare its workforce and manage its workload and (2) develop its regulatory framework and review process for new reactor activities.

As a result, uncertainties remain about NRC's ability to manage its workload associated with the surge of applications. Specifically, NRC has increased its funding for new reactor activities, created the Office of New Reactors and reorganized several other offices, and hired a significant number of entry-level and midlevel professionals. To assist its staff in reviewing the applications, NRC also plans to contract out about one-third of its fiscal year 2008 workload. However, several elements of NRC's preparatory activities are still in progress, including hiring for some critical positions; developing key training courses; and developing computer-based tools intended to enhance consistency and coordination in reviewing like sections of COL applications. In addition, NRC has not fully developed criteria for setting priorities if the workload exceeds available staff and contractor resources. Finally, while the Office of New Reactors established a cross-divisional resource management board early in 2007 for coordinating certain office review activities, it has not clearly defined the extent of the board's responsibilities. NRC has significantly revised its regulatory framework and review process to prepare for licensing new reactors, but until NRC completes certain additional actions, it may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the new process. NRC has revised, augmented, and clarified most rules, guidance, and inspection oversight criteria to provide for early resolution of issues, standardization, and predictability in the license review process. However, NRC has not yet completed several actions to implement this process. For example, NRC only recently modified its acceptance review process to include an evaluation of the application's technical sufficiency in addition to its completeness. NRC plans to complete new acceptance review guidance and tools reflecting this change by the end of September 2007. NRC also is refining its process for tracking requests to each applicant for more information but has not developed a coordinating mechanism to avoid unnecessarily requesting information from multiple applicants."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nearly three decades after the last order was placed for a new civilian  nuclear power reactor in the United States, electric power companies are  again showing interest in nuclear power.  This interest reflects the nation\u2019s  growing demand for electricity, which will require the addition of  substantial new generating capacity.  It also has coincided with ever- increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, higher natural gas prices, and  uncertainty about future restrictions on the carbon dioxide emissions of  coal-fired power plants.  To reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on crude oil,  the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE)  to diversify the U.S. energy portfolio by, among other things, providing  financial incentives to stimulate investment in new nuclear power reactor  projects, which can cost more than $4 billion.  The Nuclear Energy  Institute, which represents the nuclear power industry, estimates that the  industry has spent more than $2 billion during the past 3 years in  preparation for applying to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for  licenses to build and operate new reactors.", "In 1989, NRC promulgated 10 CFR Part 52, which establishes a new  combined license (COL) for electric power companies to obtain a license  to build and operate a new reactor.  The COL is NRC\u2019s response to the  nuclear industry\u2019s concerns about the length and complexity of NRC\u2019s  former two-step process of issuing a construction permit followed by an  operating license.  The COL process provides a one-step approval process  that authorizes a licensee to construct and conditionally operate a nuclear  power plant; as such, it is intended to provide predictability and early  resolution of issues in the review process.  In addition, as shown in figure  1, NRC established (1) the design certification, which standardizes the  design of a given reactor for all power companies using it, with  modifications limited to site-specific needs, and (2) an early site permit,  which allows a potential applicant to resolve many preliminary siting  issues before filing a COL application.  NRC also plans to issue new  regulations addressing the construction activities companies can conduct  with NRC authorization and oversight (through a limited work  authorization).", "As of September 2007, electric power companies had informed NRC of  their intent to submit 20 COL applications between October 2007 and  about April 2009\u20145 by December 2007 alone.  As shown in figure 2, these  companies plan to use five reactor designs:  General Electric\u2019s Advanced  Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) and Economic Simplified Boiling Water  Reactor (ESBWR), Westinghouse\u2019s Advanced Passive 1000 (AP1000),  AREVA\u2019s Evolutionary Pressurized Water Reactor (U.S. EPR), and  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\u2019 Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (U.S.  APWR).  NRC has certified two designs that the companies plan to use\u2014 ABWR in 1997 and AP1000 in 2006\u2014and is currently reviewing the ESBWR  design.  The U.S. EPR and U.S. APWR designs have not yet been  submitted to NRC for review, although at least one reactor using each  design is under construction in another country.  Design applications may  total up to 15,000 pages, and reference to the certified design will  represent a large part of a COL application.", "Under the COL process, NRC estimates that the first few applications will  require about 100,000 hours of staff review and identified around 2,500  associated NRC review activities related to each application\u2019s detailed  safety, environmental, operational, security, and financial information,  which may total several thousand pages.  NRC anticipates that for each  application, the review process will take 42 months\u2014including 30 months  for its staff review, followed by approximately 12 months for a public  hearing.  In June 2007, NRC approved several actions to improve the use  of its resources and further streamline and increase the predictability of its  review process.  These actions may decrease the overall duration of a  given review, depending on how they are implemented.", "Since the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, NRC has  accelerated its efforts to build up its new reactor workforce and develop  the necessary processes for licensing new reactors.  NRC projects that its  total workforce size needs to grow from about 3,100 employees to about  4,000 employees by 2010.  NRC created the Office of New Reactors (NRO)  in October 2006 to lead the new reactor reviews and anticipates that it will  employ about 500 people and spend several million dollars a month for  contractor support to conduct these reviews in 2008.  In January 2007, we  reported that NRC had been generally effective in recruiting, developing,  and retaining a critically skilled workforce and had taken several actions  to enhance its overall workforce capacity; however, we identified several  challenges that will require a considerable level of flexibility, staff  commitment, and successful strategic human capital management for NRC  to be able to appropriately adapt to shifting human capital needs.   Accordingly, we recommended that NRC take actions to further address  its current and future needs for a critically skilled workforce, and NRC  agreed with our recommendations.", "In this context, you asked us to review NRC\u2019s readiness to evaluate  applications for new reactor licenses.  Specifically, we examined the steps  NRC has taken to (1) prepare its workforce to review new reactor license  applications and to manage its workload and (2) develop its regulatory  framework and key review processes for new reactor activities.", "To address these questions, among other things, we reviewed NRC  documents for new reactor workforce staffing and training, examined  NRC\u2019s regulations and guidance for its review of license applications,  observed internal NRC management meetings, and interviewed NRC  managers in NRO and the Offices of Nuclear Security and Incident  Response, Nuclear Regulatory Research, and General Counsel.  We also  obtained the perspectives of the Advisory Committee on Reactor  Safeguards, a statutory body of scientists and engineers, and the Atomic  Safety and Licensing Board Panel.  In addition, we held discussions with  nearly all of the announced COL applicants to obtain their views on the  efficiency and usefulness of the COL process and its implementation.   Finally, we observed several of NRC\u2019s public meetings on the new reactor  licensing process.  We conducted our work from January 2007 through  September 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

NRC\u2019s mission is to ensure that civilian users  of nuclear materials adequately (1) protect public health and safety; (2)  promote the common defense and security, including securing special  nuclear materials against radiological sabotage and theft or diversion; and  (3) protect the environment.  NRC\u2019s budget authority grew from $626  million for fiscal year 2004 to $824.9 million in fiscal year 2007, and NRC  requested $916.6 million for fiscal year 2008.  By law, NRC is required to  recover about 90 percent of its budget authority each fiscal year, less  certain specified amounts, through the fees it charges licensees and  applicants.  NRC staff grew from 3,110 as of September 2004 to 3,536  employees as of August 2007.", "NRC\u2019s design-centered review approach is central to its streamlined COL  review process because it allows multiple applicants to reference a  particular design by including common information in their applications.   Specifically, NRC reviews standardized application content for a reactor  design at one site\u2014known as the reference COL.  Companies using the  same design can then refer to this reference COL content in their  applications to decrease NRC\u2019s need to conduct the same level of review  twice on the same application content.  NRC expects that this design- centered review approach will provide the applicant with more certainty  about the application process and improve its efficiency in reviewing COL  applications without compromising safety.", "The design-centered review approach intends to leverage work NRC  conducts through its design certification process.  During that process,  NRC examines any possible limits on operations and safety, resolves any  issues that arise, and uses a rule-making process to establish a  standardized reactor unit design that is not subject to major modifications  during the COL review process.  However, if a COL application does not  reference a design certification, the applicant will have to submit the  required design information in its COL application.  Furthermore, NRC  staff will review any design variations the applicant makes to the reference  COL.", "For each application, NRC staff prepare the project\u2019s Environmental  Impact Statement and review other site-specific factors affecting safety  and security because these factors are not standard.  Accordingly, 10 CFR  Part 52 requires that the COL application provide data and assessments of  these factors.  Alternatively, an applicant may opt to provide this  information by applying for an early site permit, which allows the  applicant to evaluate the suitability of a given site without going through  the full COL application process.  Once NRC issues an early site permit,  the applicant can reference the permit in its COL application without  resubmitting the site information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Has Implemented Many Actions to Prepare Its Workforce for New Reactor Licensing Reviews, but Several Key Elements Are Still Under Way", "paragraphs": ["In preparing for COL application reviews in the time frame since our  January 2007 report, NRC has continued its hiring and training efforts and  made substantial progress in implementing reviewer and management  tools.

NRC\u2019s overall budget requests for new reactor  licensing activities increased from nearly $50 million in fiscal year 2006 to  about $175 million for fiscal year 2008.  To understand what resources the  agency would need, NRC staff developed estimates for how many full-time  equivalent (FTE) positions would be needed to review various  applications: about 120 FTEs for a design certification, about 60 FTEs for a  reference COL, and about 30 FTEs for a subsequent COL.  NRC officials  noted that the reference COL staff-time estimate does not include any  efficiencies gained through applying the design-centered review approach.", "To support its review of new reactor COL applications, NRC initially  reorganized the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation to create a division  solely responsible for new reactor licensing work and substantially  increased its size to more than 750 employees by hiring of entry- and  midlevel employees.  In August 2006, NRC created NRO to better prepare  for new reactor licensing while ensuring that the Office of Nuclear Reactor  Regulation maintained appropriate focus on the safety of the 104 currently  operating reactors, and began phasing staff into NRO, primarily from the  Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, in October 2006.  NRO is expected  to grow from 350 employees in August 2007 to about 500 staff during fiscal  year 2008.  In addition, NRC is increasing staff to five other offices with  new reactor responsibilities. FTEs for new reactor activities in these  offices will increase from 50 to about 90 FTEs in fiscal year 2008, as hiring  continues.  For example, for new reactor work, the Office of Nuclear  Security and Incident Response plans to have four times as many staff and  the Office of the General Counsel two times as many staff; the Atomic  Safety and Licensing Board Panel plans to hire at least two times as many  staff, as well as more panelists committed to new reactor work.  The  Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and the Office of Nuclear  Regulatory Research FTE levels will also slightly increase.  Several of  these offices also reorganized to assume their new responsibilities.  Table  1 identifies the new reactor responsibilities of several NRC offices.", "NRC has taken steps to expeditiously staff NRO in part because more than  half of the work for a 30-month COL review is conducted in the first year.   NRO reached its fiscal year 2007 staffing level by filling its midlevel and  higher positions, phasing in existing NRC employees, and hiring new  employees.  Regarding fiscal year 2007, NRO managers noted that (1)  budget constraints had limited hiring until NRC\u2019s fiscal year 2007  appropriation was enacted in February 2007 and (2) demanding workloads  made it difficult for NRC staff to develop vacancy announcements and  select and interview candidates.  Some critical vacancies remain, and NRO  will need to grow by an additional 30 percent to reach its fiscal year 2008  target.  NRO managers expressed some concern about whether NRO will  have sufficient staff with expertise to fill such critical vacancies as project  management, structural engineering, and digital instrumentation and  control.  Several managers in NRO and other NRC offices also expressed  concern about NRC\u2019s ability to retain staff in the intermediate and longer  term and provide sufficient physical space for them.", "Regarding training, NRC has taken several steps to build on its existing  curriculum so staff can be prepared to review new reactor license  applications.  Specifically, for new reactor licensing training, in early 2007  NRO adapted some of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation\u2019s training  to contain technical and regulatory content for new reactors.  NRC also  offers basic regulatory and technical overview training across a range of  areas.  In 2008, NRC plans to launch several new courses that will include  both overview and detailed training on new reactor designs.  To the extent  possible, NRO and other offices are also using on-the-job training  opportunities to ensure employees have some exposure to the breadth and  depth of new reactor work, including shadowing and mentoring programs.", "The in-depth and on-the-job training opportunities made available to staff  have been somewhat limited to date.  For example, the implementation of  some technical training courses was delayed because some reactor design  features need further clarification, and NRC\u2019s budget was constrained  until February 2007, when its fiscal year 2007 appropriation was enacted.   It is unclear whether employees working on some new reactor activities  will be able to take these courses before their work group\u2019s design  certification or COL applications arrive.  In addition, some NRC staff  conducting new reactor licensing work will not have related practical  experience because they have not participated in early site permit, design  certification, or preapplication activities.", "NRC is in the process of putting new tools into place to support reviewers  as they conduct their work.  These tools are designed to enhance  productivity and ensure a more consistent and coordinated application  review process by providing easily accessible pointers to key reviewer  guidance and other information.  Some tools are also intended to provide a  means to document and share knowledge and lessons learned. (See  table 2.)", "The development or completion of such computer-based tools as the RAI  system has been delayed until fiscal year 2008 because NRC management  gave higher priority to such activities as developing limited work  authorization guidance, publishing a proposed rule for assessing aircraft  impact characteristics not included in design basis, and completing  licensing work already in process.  As a result, staff reviews may not be as  timely and consistent until these computer-based tools are available, and  NRC may not benefit from intended productivity efficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Is Implementing a Project Management Approach for Its New Reactor Licensing Program but Needs to Make Further Enhancements", "paragraphs": ["As part of its workforce preparation, NRC is using a project management  approach to conduct and coordinate COL reviews so it can apply sufficient  resources to several applications simultaneously.  With this approach,  NRC intends to enhance its overall ability to ensure priorities are  appropriate, eliminate uneven workload, and allow managers to  appropriately assess progress.  As table 3 shows, the project management  approach includes four components intended to communicate the  processes, procedures, and tools to complete new reactor licensing  projects.  They include (1) a Licensing Program Plan manual, (2) general  and application-specific models and templates\u2014whose estimates NRO  took several steps to refine in 2007, (3) a Microsoft Project tool, and (4) a  contracting support strategy.  In addition, from June through September  2007, NRO provided information to staff involved in new reactor activities  to familiarize them with this approach.", "Because it plans to rely on contractors to perform about one-third of its  overall review work, NRC issued a request for proposals, developed a  contracting toolkit for staff that includes generic templates to facilitate  drafting of statements of work, and took steps to enter into or revise  interagency agreements with several DOE laboratories.  NRC plans to  obligate about $60 million to contractors in fiscal year 2008 to assist  reviewers on both the safety and environmental portions of the COL  applications.

However, NRC has not yet ranked initial COL application  factors for making resource allocations and schedule decisions if  licensing work exceeds NRC\u2019s new reactor budget.  These factors  include the quality and completeness of the application itself, the  extent to which the COL application references an early site permit or  design certification, evidence of the applicant\u2019s financial commitment  to build a reactor in the near term, and other factors.  In commenting  on recommendations in our draft report, NRO officials said that NRC  will develop these criteria by the end of 2007.", "Maximizing the use of the Microsoft Project tool.  In June 2007, NRO  began using the Microsoft Project tool to schedule certain internal  activities and work related to design certification and early site permit  applications already under review.  To effectively schedule tasks, the  Microsoft Project tool needs several layers of NRC staff to regularly  estimate and note their progress on each task.  Entering this  information into the system is a new practice that officials  acknowledged will require some adjustment.  Even with this tool, it  will be a complex undertaking for staff and managers to regularly  update and monitor entries, evaluate them for a range of user needs,  and review reports generated to assess progress.  While NRC has  dedicated scheduling and project management resources to coordinate  and direct activities, it is too soon to tell whether they are sufficient.   Accordingly, understanding workflow, evaluating reports, and  continually assessing resource utilization will take some time to  become established practice.  Most COL applicants generally  supported NRC\u2019s use of the Microsoft Project tool and noted that it  could promote more accountability for adhering to established  schedules than has historically been the case.", "Managing the increased reliance on contractors.  NRO plans to use  contracts to support at least one-third of the COL application review  process\u2014for fiscal year 2008, NRO\u2019s budget request is about the same  for contractor support as it is for staff salaries and benefits.  NRC\u2019s  efforts to implement its contractor support strategy are still under way.   For example, NRO staff and managers initially defined particular work  they expected contractors to conduct in fiscal year 2008.  Specifically,  NRO plans to use more than 200 task orders for a broad range of skills  under at least 10 umbrella contracts or interagency agreements.   Contractors are to support about 50 percent of the site-specific and  environmental review work, as they did to review early site permit  applications.  As of early September 2007, NRO staff had completed  most initial statements of technical work to be included in each task  order, and NRC had awarded three of four commercial contracts and  entered into three of seven interagency agreements planned for fiscal  year 2008.  NRC plans to have the remaining contracts and agreements  in place by the beginning of October 2007.", "Allocating funding for developing reviewer and management tools.", "In fiscal year 2008, NRC will have hundreds of licensing activities  under way and other internal activities to support the review of COL  applications and certification of reactor designs.  Evaluating the  importance of completing activities that support the reviews\u2014such as  ensuring the smooth operation of the Microsoft Project tool, revising  computer-based reviewer tools for enhancing productivity, delivering  contractor training, increasing information technology support, or  revising remaining guidance\u2014may not be as important as completing  priority licensing priorities.

In May 2007,  NRO\u2019s management team formed a board of deputy division directors  that meets weekly.  The board is responsible for developing decision- making processes if certain milestones are in danger of not being met,  and NRO therefore has to significantly shift resources.  While NRO  expects the board to recommend actions to mitigate the impact on  overall scheduling if such changes are required, it is unclear whether  the board will have any role in generally setting priorities and directing  resource allocation.

NRC has not yet told applicants how it  will apply resources to limited work authorization applications or how this  will affect individual COL application review schedules.  Also, because  NRC only recently solicited public comments to further update its  environmental guidance, applicants may have more difficulty developing  specific COL content for unresolved issues.  Furthermore, NRC is  continuing to develop several components of the Inspections, Tests,  Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) process, such as the final  closeout review for ensuring all criteria are met.

Consequently, uncertainties remain about how these processes will be  implemented, which may make it more difficult for applicants to know  what information they must provide and how NRC will review their  applications:     Clarifying recent acceptance review process changes.  In June 2007, 3  months before it expected to receive the first COL applications, NRC  announced it would expand its acceptance review process to include not  only an evaluation of the application\u2019s completeness but also its technical  sufficiency.  NRC also increased the allotted amount of time for this  review from 30 to 60 days.  The intent of the new process is to enable NRC  to identify areas of potential concern early in the process and discuss them  with the applicant.  NRC expects that applicants will submit high-quality,  complete applications for docketing.  By the end of September 2007, NRC  plans to publicly release associated internal guidance that its staff will use  for deciding whether to accept, delay, or reject docketing.", "Better managing the request for additional information process.  Such  requests to assess technical sufficiency during the review process have  been a central component of prior safety and environmental reviews, yet a  few steps remain to better ensure efficiency.  NRC is still developing its  process for tracking requests for additional information from applicants.   However, NRC cannot yet coordinate these requests to multiple applicants  who are using the same reactor design, which may lead to unnecessary  duplication of effort.  For example, in some instances, applicants using the  same reference reactor design may be asked the same question, and one  applicant may have already provided a satisfactory answer.  If NRC\u2019s  tracking system were in place, the second reviewer could have access to  the previously submitted information, thereby avoiding another request for  information and improving the efficiency of the review.  Several COL  applicants also expressed concern that duplicative or unnecessarily  detailed requests for information may result because many of the reviews  will be conducted simultaneously by multiple reviewers.  Until the revised  process is available to staff and communicated to stakeholders, it is  unclear whether NRC will gain intended efficiencies in applying the  design-centered review approach to its request for information process.", "Addressing ITAAC process implementation concerns early.  Some NRC  staff and COL applicants said they would benefit from further discussion  about how NRC will (1) oversee the applicant\u2019s implementation of ITAAC  for the construction and operation of the new nuclear reactor units and (2)  determine that an ITAAC is complete.  In addition, applicants will need to  inform NRC about certain procurement and construction activities, such  as the acquisition of major parts.", "Completing revisions to the hearing process.  NRC is revising its policy  for conducting hearings on both the contested and uncontested portions  of applications.", "In June 2007, NRC issued a proposed policy statement that would allow  the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel to consolidate hearings  on contentions related to the standardized portions of multiple  applications.", "The process for hearings for the uncontested portion of the COL  proceeding may change.  The Commission plans to seek legislative  authority from the Congress to eliminate the statutory requirement to  conduct a hearing even if no one has requested it in order to conserve  resources.  If a hearing must be held, however, the Commission has  taken steps to assume responsibility for conducting the uncontested  portion of hearings.  Currently, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board  Panel is responsible for conducting all of NRC\u2019s hearings, not just those  associated with new reactor applications.  NRC assumes that it would  save considerable staff and Panel resources if the Commission takes  the responsibility for this portion of the hearings because it could  conduct a different style of hearing.", "Beyond the changing processes and unresolved technical issues that  remain\u2014such as evaluating applicants\u2019 use of digital instrumentation and  controls, NRC faces some general constraints because of the short or  overlapping time frames between the preparation of its regulatory  framework and process and the submission of applications starting in  October 2007.  For instance, for the environmental component of NRC\u2019s  review, NRC would prefer to have about 22 months of preapplication  discussions with the applicants to allow staff to plan its work more  effectively and identify potential areas of concern.  However, these  discussions are at the applicant\u2019s discretion; none of the fiscal year 2008  applications will begin with this lead time, and some may have had as little  as 2 months.  Also, while NRC has scheduled considerable resources to  conduct design certification reviews concurrently with its COL reviews,  applicants have announced plans to use two new reactor designs that have  not been submitted to NRC for certification, a reactor designer is  amending its previously certified design, and another designer may also  revise its design.  These additional changes likely will tax NRC\u2019s resources  and stafftime."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NRC has made major strides in developing its new licensing process for  nuclear reactors to improve timeliness and provide more predictability  and consistency during reviews.  Nevertheless, NRC will face a daunting  task in implementing this new process while at the same time facing a  surge in applications over the next 18 months.", "We recognize that NRC cannot prepare for all contingencies in its review  of license applications under this new process, but we also find that NRC  could be better positioned to manage the process if it further refined the  criteria and processes it has already put into place.  First, while NRC has  identified factors for staff to consider in developing the fiscal year 2008  budget proposal for new reactor activities, it has not made plans to use  these factors in making resource allocations and schedule decisions.  As a  result, NRC may find it difficult to set priorities as it begins to review  applications early next year.  Second, NRC has not implemented some  reviewer and management support tools that are intended to facilitate  efficiency and productivity, and may not devote sufficient resources to  their completion in the future.  Third, NRO established the Resource  Management Board to recommend actions when the office is at risk of  missing major milestones.  However, NRO has not specified the extent to  which the board is responsible for generally setting priorities or allocating  resources, which is likely to be much more challenging once applications  are submitted.  NRC managers plan to clarify the board\u2019s responsibilities.   Finally, the design-centered approach is premised, in part, on streamlining  the review process through standardization.  However, NRC has not  worked out a process for coordinating multiple, similar requests for  additional information, which could facilitate greater efficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that its workforce is prepared to review new reactor  applications and its review processes more efficiently and effectively  facilitate reviews, we recommend that NRC take the following four  actions:", "Fully develop and implement criteria for setting priorities to allocate  resources across applications by January 2008.", "Provide the resources for implementing reviewer and management  tools needed to ensure that the most important tools will be available  as soon as is practicable, but no later than March 2008.", "Clarify the responsibilities of NRO\u2019s Resource Management Board in  facilitating the coordination and communication of resource allocation  decisions.", "Enhance the process for requesting additional information by (1)  providing more specific guidance to staff on the development and  resolution of requests for additional information within and across  design centers and (2) explaining forthcoming workflow and  electronic process revisions to COL applicants in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided NRC with a draft of this report for its review and comment.
