VA's plans for realigning the management of its IT program include elements of several of the six factors that GAO identified as critical for the department's implementation of a centralized management structure, and it had fully addressed one factor--ensuring commitment from top leadership--having obtained the Secretary's approval of the realignment and the new IT governance structure. However, as of May 2007, the department did not plan to address one of the critical success factors: dedicating an implementation team to manage change. Having such a team is important, since the implementation of the realignment is expected to continue until July 2008. Without a dedicated team, it is less likely that the implementation will be managed effectively. In addition, although the department had begun to take action to establish improved management processes--a cornerstone of the realignment--it had not made significant progress. As of May 2007, it had begun pilot testing 2 of 36 planned new processes. Until it institutionalizes key processes throughout the department, the full benefits of the realignment may not be realized. At the same time that it is implementing the realignment, VA is managing ongoing IT programs such as information security and inventory control, and it is continuing initiatives to develop IT systems. The department is managing these programs and initiatives using existing management processes, many of which display the long-standing weaknesses that VA aims to alleviate through its realignment. Some progress has been made: for example, the department took actions to improve controls over IT equipment, such as issuing several new policies to establish guidance and controls for information security, but because the realignment was not yet fully implemented, improved processes for inventory control had not been established. In addition, progress on the development of a modernized compensation and benefits system occurred after the project implemented improved management processes, which the department now plans to apply to all its IT projects. VA also achieved a milestone in the long-term effort to share electronic health information with DOD, having begun to exchange limited medical data with DOD (at selected sites) through an interface between the data repositories for the modern health information systems that each department is developing. To achieve their long-term vision, VA and DOD have much work still to do (such as extending the current capability throughout both departments), and the two departments have not yet projected a final completion date for the whole initiative. Further progress in VA's IT programs and initiatives could be significantly aided by the improved processes that are the cornerstone of the realignment. Until these are fully implemented, the impact of the realignment on these programs and initiatives is uncertain"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the information  technology program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

However, VA has encountered  numerous challenges in managing its IT resources, as we have  reported over the years. In our more recent reporting, we have  identified challenges in security management, inventory control,  project management, and other IT management processes. One  factor contributing to the development of these challenges has been  the department\u2019s management structure, which until recently was  decentralized and gave the VA administrations and headquarters  offices control over a majority of the department\u2019s IT budget.", "In October 2005, VA initiated a realignment of its IT program to  provide greater authority and accountability over its resources.

Over time, the use of IT has become  increasingly crucial to the department\u2019s effort to provide benefits  and services. VA relies on its systems for providing access to  medical information to ensure high-quality health care for veterans  as well as for processing benefit claims, including compensation and  pension and education benefits.", "In reporting on VA\u2019s IT management over the past several years, we  have highlighted challenges the department has faced in achieving  its vision of creating \u201cOne VA\u201d\u2014that is, integrating IT resources to  enable department employees to help veterans obtain services and  information more quickly and effectively. One major challenge was  that the department\u2019s information systems and services were highly  decentralized and that its administrations controlled a majority of  the IT budget. As we have previously pointed out, it is crucial for  the department CIO to ensure that well-established and integrated  processes for leading, managing, and controlling investments are  followed throughout the department. Similarly, a contractor\u2019s  assessment of VA\u2019s IT organizational alignment, issued in February  2005, noted the lack of control over how and when money is spent.  The assessment found that project managers within the  administrations had the ability to shift money to support individual  projects.

According to VA, its goals in moving to centralized management are  to provide the department better oversight over the standardization,  compatibility, and interoperability of IT systems, as well as better  overall fiscal discipline for the budget. By July 2006, the  department\u2019s realignment contractor began work to assist with the  realignment effort.", "In February 2007, the Secretary approved the department\u2019s new  organization structure, which includes the Assistant Secretary for  Information and Technology, who serves as VA\u2019s CIO.

By implementing these improved processes, VA expects to  correct deficiencies it has encountered as a result of its  decentralized management approach. Proper implementation should  result in institutionalizing best management practices that will be  sustained regardless of future leadership changes at the department.  According to the contractor, with a system of defined management  processes, the Office of Information and Technology could quickly  and accurately change the way IT supports the department.

Only one factor had been fully addressed;  additional work remained on the other five factors, as shown in  table 1.", "The department had fully addressed the first critical success factor,  ensuring commitment from top leadership, as demonstrated by the  Secretary\u2019s actions in support of the realignment. Besides approving  the transfer of personnel to the centralized office, the Secretary  approved in February 2007 a new organization structure for  centralized IT management.", "Since undertaking the realignment, VA concentrated its efforts on  transferring approximately 6,000 staff to the CIO\u2019s office from the  administrations and staff offices and on creating the new centralized  organizational structure. As shown in the table, VA had begun or  planned to begin actions on four other critical success factors, but it  had not completed the actions. For example, the department  approved its governance plan to address how the Office of  Information and Technology will manage resources; however, it had  not yet established the boards that are to provide governance over  the centralized structure. In addition, although the department had  identified the responsibilities for managing its workforce within its  new structure, it had not yet established a knowledge and skills  inventory to help determine the proper roles for all employees in the  new organization.", "VA had neither addressed nor planned to address the last critical  success factor: dedicating an implementation team to manage  change. Although it had highlighted the importance of managing  change in its realignment documentation, VA did not plan to  establish a realignment implementation team. As we have pointed  out, a dedicated implementation team that is responsible for the  day-to-day management of a major change initiative is critical to  ensure that the project receives the focused, full-time attention  needed to be sustained and successful. Specifically, the  implementation team is important to ensuring that various change  initiatives are implemented in a coherent and integrated way. The  team must have the necessary authority and resources to set  priorities, make timely decisions, and move quickly to implement  the transformation. In addition, the implementation team can assist  in tracking implementation goals for a change initiative and  identifying performance shortfalls or schedule slippages. It is  important for the team to use performance metrics to provide a  succinct and concrete statement of expected performance versus  actual performance. Because of its close involvement with the  change initiative, the implementation team can also suggest  corrections to remedy any problems.", "The department had not addressed this critical success factor: it had  not dedicated an implementation team to manage the realignment  effort and track its progress. At the conclusion of our review in June  2007, staff from the IT realignment office, which was responsible for  overseeing the realignment, had been reassigned to other areas of  responsibility within the department\u2019s new structure. In addition,  the Director of the Realignment Office told us that multiple offices  would assume responsibility for managing the realignment through  July 2008: the Office of Quality and Performance Management  would oversee process implementation across the Office of  Information and Technology, and the Office of Oversight and  Compliance Management would assess whether the department is  complying with the new processes. However, there was no one  group responsible for managing the realignment in its entirety.  Without such a dedicated group, it is less likely that VA will be able  to ensure that the realignment is managed effectively throughout its  implementation.", "With regard to the new IT management processes, the department  had begun to take action, but it had not made significant progress at  the time of our report. The department had planned to begin  implementing 9 of the 36 new processes in March 2007. However,  the department had missed key implementation dates for these  processes. As of May 2007, it had begun pilot testing two of the new  processes: the risk management process and the solution (that is,  business application) test and acceptance process.", "Thus, although the department had taken positive steps in moving to  centralized IT management, it had much more work to complete  before the realignment can be considered finished and a success. If  VA does not continue to address the critical success factors we  identified and develop and implement the new management  processes by their target date, the department may continue to  operate in a decentralized manner and risk not fully realizing the  long-term benefits of the realignment.", "Accordingly, we recommended that the department dedicate an  implementation team responsible for change management  throughout the transformation and that it develop detailed IT  governance process descriptions that identify how IT resources will  be managed in the centralized organization.

Under FISMA and the Veterans  Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, the  CIO ensures compliance with requirements of these laws and  designates a chief information security officer (CISO) to assist in  carrying out his responsibilities. One mechanism organizations can  adopt to achieve effective coordination and communication is to  establish a central security management office or group to  coordinate departmentwide security-related activities. To ensure  that information security activities are effective across an  organization, the management structure should also include clearly  defined roles and responsibilities for all security staff and  coordination of responsibilities among individual staff.", "Under the realignment, the management structure for information  security has changed, but improved security management processes  have not yet been completely developed and implemented. In  particular, under the new structure, responsibility for information  security functions within the department is divided between two  organizations (see fig. 2), but no documented process yet exists for  the two responsible offices to coordinate with each other in  managing and implementing the departmentwide security program.", "Under the new organization, the Director of the Cyber Security  Office (who is also the department\u2019s designated CISO) has  responsibility for developing and maintaining a departmentwide  security program, among other things. However, the Director of the  Field Operations and Security Office is responsible for  implementing the program. Although VA officials indicated that  these officials are communicating about the department\u2019s  implementation of security policies and procedures, this  communication is not defined as a role or responsibility for either  position in the new management organization book, nor is there a  documented process in place to coordinate the management and  implementation of the security program. Both of these activities are  key security management practices. Without a documented process,  policies or procedures could be inconsistently implemented  throughout the department, which could prevent the CISO from  effectively ensuring departmentwide compliance with FISMA. In  addition, without a defined process and responsibilities, VA will  have limited assurance that the management and implementation of  security policies and procedures are effectively coordinated and  communicated.

In July  2007, we reported and testified on an assessment of the risk of theft,  loss, or misappropriation of IT equipment at selected VA medical  centers. Our assessment found that a weak overall control  environment for IT equipment at the four locations we audited  posed a significant security vulnerability to the nation\u2019s veterans  with regard to sensitive data maintained on this equipment.  According to our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, agencies are required to establish physical controls to  safeguard vulnerable assets, such as IT equipment, which might be  vulnerable to risk of loss; in addition, federal records management  law requires federal agencies to record essential transactions.  However, we reported in July that current VA property management  policy does not provide guidance for creating records of inventory  transactions as changes occur. Also, policies requiring annual  inventories of sensitive items (such as IT equipment), adequate  physical security, and immediate reporting of lost and missing items  had not been enforced.", "Our statistical tests of physical inventory controls at the four  locations identified a total of 123 missing IT equipment items,  including 53 computers that could have stored sensitive data.

Missing items were often not reported for several months and, in  some cases, several years. It is very difficult to investigate these  losses because information on specific events and circumstances at  the time of the losses is not known. Further, our limited tests of  computer hard drives in the excess property disposal process found  hard drives at two of the four case study locations that contained  personal information, including veterans\u2019 names and Social Security  numbers.

The BDN, which has  been in operation for more than 40 years, is based on antiquated  software programs, which have become increasingly difficult and  costly to maintain. VBA is in the process of replacing the BDN with  a faster, more flexible, and higher capacity system.", "Replacing the BDN has been a focus of systems development efforts  at VBA since 1986. VBA currently depends on the BDN to  administer programs for three types of benefits: (1) compensation  and pension, (2) education, and (3) vocational rehabilitation and  employment (VRE) services. Originally, the administration planned  to modernize the entire system, but after experiencing numerous  false starts and spending approximately $300 million on the overall  modernization of the BDN, VBA revised its strategy in 1996. First, it  narrowed its focus to replacing only those functionalities that  support the compensation and pension program, and began  developing a replacement system, which it generally refers to as the  Veterans Service Network (VETSNET). Then, in December 1999, it  began an initiative, The Education Expert System (TEES), to move  its education claims processing systems from the BDN to new  technology platforms and a new architecture, as a way to improve  its education benefits delivery services. (We have not evaluated the  VRE program or possible plans to migrate VRE operations from the  BDN.)", "Progress Made in Long-Term Effort to Replace Benefits Payment System, but Challenges Persist  When VBA began the VETSNET project in 1996, it planned to  complete the replacement system in May 1998 at an estimated cost  of $8 million. However, over the years, VBA encountered numerous  problems in completing the replacement system. We have reported  on this topic several times, making numerous recommendations.  Although VA concurred with our recommendations and took several  actions to address them, its actions were not sufficient to implement  all our recommendations or establish the program on a solid footing:  certain basic requirements of sound project management, such as an  integrated project plan for the replacement system, continued to be  lacking.", "In 2005, because of concerns about continuing problems with the  replacement project, VA contracted for an independent assessment  of the department\u2019s options for the project, including whether the  project should be terminated. This assessment, conducted by the  Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI), concluded  that the replacement project faced many risks arising from  management and organizational issues, but no technical barriers  that could not be overcome. According to SEI, a new system was  still needed, and VBA would not be able to successfully deliver a  full, workable solution unless it addressed its management and  organizational weaknesses. SEI recommended that VBA continue to  work on the project at a reduced pace, while taking an aggressive  approach to addressing the identified weaknesses.", "We reported in April 2007 that VBA was generally following the  course of action recommended by SEI: it was continuing to work on  the replacement initiative at a slower pace, while taking action to  address identified weaknesses in overall management and software  development processes. For example, VBA established a new  governance structure, and it took steps to improve its software  development processes, such as establishing risk and requirements  management processes. However, some processes had not been  addressed, such as capacity planning and management, which will  be important for ensuring that further development does not lead to  processing slowdowns. Further, VBA had not yet documented  policies and procedures to institutionalize all the process  improvements that it made on the replacement initiative, having first  concentrated its efforts on establishing the governance and building  the organization. If VBA does not institutionalize these  improvements, it increases the risk that they may not be maintained  through the life of the project or be available for application to other  development initiatives.", "As of April 2007, VBA had developed critical functionalities needed  to process and pay certain original compensation claims using the  replacement system. According to VBA officials, all five of the major  software applications that make up the new system were being used  in VA\u2019s regional offices to establish and process new compensation  claims for veterans. In April 2007, the replacement system was  providing monthly compensation payments to almost 50,000  veterans (out of about 3 million veterans who receive such  payments). Nonetheless, the system requires further development,  and VBA still faces the substantial task of converting records for the  approximately 3.5 million beneficiaries on the BDN to the  replacement system.", "Under the realignment, the responsibility for all system development  projects has moved from VBA to the central CIO organization:  specifically, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enterprise  Development. Thus, this official is now responsible for completing  the development and implementation of VETSNET. Accordingly, we  recommended that the CIO document and incorporate the improved  processes for managing risks, requirements, and defects into  specific policy and guidance for the replacement initiative and for  future use throughout VBA. VA concurred with our recommendation  and stated that the VETSNET project management processes will be  incorporated into a set of standard project management policies,  processes, and procedures for all IT projects in VA. Further, the CIO  has identified the VETSNET governance model as the model for all  VA enterprisewide IT projects, and it is being implemented in other  VA priority IT development programs.", "In addition, we made five other recommendations aimed at  sustaining the improved management and software development  processes currently being used by VETSNET project management,  including processes for capacity planning and management. The  Secretary also agreed with these recommendations and described  actions planned in response.", "Improved Planning Needed to Guide Development and Implementation of Education Benefits System   The Education Expert System (or TEES) effort aims to replace the  existing education benefits systems on the BDN with a new rules- based system that will add more automated capabilities, eliminate  most human intervention, and enable faster and more accurate  processing of education claims. When it began the initiative, VBA  had planned to complete the new system by September 2005;  however, in 2004, the department refocused and rebaselined the  system\u2019s development effort. VA currently estimates that the TEES  initiative will be completed by 2011.", "When we reported on this matter in July 2007, VBA had enhanced  education benefits claims processing by developing certain  functionalities to allow information to be captured in an electronic  format. For example, it had developed automated systems that  allow (1) education institutions to provide online enrollment  certifications, (2) students to provide online and telephonic  verification of enrollment, and (3) the public to inquire about  approved academic programs, licensing and certification programs,  and national exams. However, although VBA had identified other  initiatives as necessary to complete the new system and eliminate  most human intervention, it had not taken action on these  initiatives, which included moving the processing and payment  functionality used for many education claims from the BDN to new  technology.", "Contributing to our concerns was that VBA did not have an  integrated project plan for the TEES initiative. According to agency  officials, the plan that had been developed in 2001 has not been  updated since 2004, when program goals were modified. Because  VBA did not have an integrated project management plan, it lacked  critical elements needed to effectively guide the initiative to  completion (such as a full description of the scope of the system  development efforts) and an overall approach for coordinating its  various education claims initiatives (such as the BDN code  conversion effort). Without these critical elements, the department  would be at risk of wasting millions of dollars on education claims  processing initiatives that may overlap or be duplicative.", "One reason for this management weakness is the lack of well- defined IT management processes across VA, which is to be  addressed by the realignment. Under the realignment, the  responsibility for TEES, like other system development projects, has  moved from VBA to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enterprise  Development, who is part of the central CIO organization. At the  time of our report, the TEES project had not yet been affected by  VA\u2019s stated intention of incorporating the VETSNET project  management processes into a set of standard project management  policies, processes, and procedures for all IT projects in the  department. Establishing improved IT management processes is  vital to ensuring effective project management and thus the future  development and implementation of TEES.", "To ensure the successful implementation of TEES, we made three  recommendations aimed at ensuring that a comprehensive,  integrated project plan to coordinate and manage the initiative  would be developed. VA concurred with our recommendations and  described actions planned to address them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Is Making Progress in Sharing Medical Information with DOD, but the Two Departments Are Far from Comprehensive Electronic Medical Records", "paragraphs": ["For almost 10 years, VA and DOD have been engaged in multiple  efforts to share electronic medical information, which is important  in helping to ensure that active-duty military personnel and veterans  receive high-quality health care. These include efforts focused on  the long-term vision of a single \u201ccomprehensive, lifelong medical  record for each service member\u201d that would allow a seamless  transition between the two departments, as well as more near-term  efforts to meet immediate needs to exchange health information,  including responding to current military crises.", "As we testified in May 2007, VA and DOD have made progress in  sharing health information, but much work remains to achieve the  goal of a shared electronic medical record and seamless transition  between the two departments. In their long-term initiatives, each  department is developing its own modern health information system  to replace its legacy systems, and they are collaborating on a  program to develop an interface to enable these modernized  systems to share data and ultimately to have interoperable  electronic medical records. Unlike the legacy systems, the  modernized systems are to be based on computable data: that is, the  data are to be in a format that a computer application can act on, for  example, to provide alerts to clinicians (of such things as drug  allergies) or to plot graphs of changes in vital signs such as blood  pressure. According to the departments, such computable data  contribute significantly to patient safety and the usefulness of  electronic medical records.", "At the time of our testimony, the departments had begun to  implement the first release of the interface between their  modernized data repositories, and computable outpatient pharmacy  and drug allergy data were being exchanged at seven VA and DOD  sites. Although the data being exchanged were limited,  implementing this interface is a milestone toward the long-term goal  of modernized systems with interoperable electronic medical  records.", "While working on this long-term effort, the two departments also  made progress in various near-term initiatives to exchange  electronic medical information in their existing systems. The  departments completed development of a system to allow the one- way transfer of health information from DOD to VA when service  members leave the military. DOD has been using this system (the  Federal Health Information Exchange or FHIE) to transfer  information to VA since 2002. According to department officials, as  of March 2007, over 184 million clinical messages on more than 3.8  million veterans had been transferred to the FHIE data repository,  and VA had been given access to data for more than 681,000  separated service members and demobilized Reserve and National  Guard members who had been deployed. Transfers are done in  batches once a month, or weekly for veterans who have been  referred to VA treatment facilities. According to a joint DOD/VA  report, FHIE has made a significant contribution to the delivery  and continuity of care of separated service members as they  transition to veteran status, as well as to the adjudication of  disability claims.", "In addition, two ongoing demonstration projects were successfully  exchanging particular types of data at selected sites:  \u25cf  The Laboratory Data Sharing Interface allows DOD and VA facilities  serving the same geographic area to share laboratory resources. As  of May 2007, this capability had been deployed at 9 localities to  communicate orders for lab tests and their results electronically and  could be deployed at others if the need is demonstrated.  \u25cf  The Bidirectional Health Information Exchange allows a real-time,  two-way view of health data from existing systems. As of May 2007,  this system provided this capability (for outpatient data) to all VA  sites and 25 DOD sites and (for certain inpatient discharge summary  data) to all VA sites and 5 DOD sites. Expanding this interface is  the foundation of the departments\u2019 interim strategy to share  information among their existing systems.", "The two departments had also undertaken ad hoc activities to  accelerate the transmission of health information on severely  wounded patients from DOD to VA\u2019s four polytrauma centers. These  centers care for veterans and service members with disabling  injuries to more than one physical region or organ system. The ad  hoc processes include manual workarounds such as scanning paper  records and individually transmitting radiological images. Such  processes were generally feasible only because the number of  polytrauma patients was small (about 350 in all as of May 2007).", "Through all these efforts, VA and DOD have achieved exchanges of  health information. However, these exchanges are as yet limited,  and it is not clear how they are to be integrated into an overall  strategy toward achieving the departments\u2019 long-term goal of  comprehensive, seamless exchange of health information.  Significant work remains to be done for the departments to achieve  their long-term goals, including agreeing to standards for the  remaining categories of medical information, populating the data  repositories with all this information, completing the development  of their modernized systems, and transitioning from the legacy  systems. In addition, the departments have not yet projected a  completion date for the project as a whole. Consequently, it is  essential for the departments to develop a comprehensive project  plan to guide this effort to completion. In previous work, we have  made numerous recommendations with regard to this effort, placing  particular stress on the need for comprehensive planning. VA and  DOD have agreed with our recommendations, and have taken action  to implement them. However, at the time of our May testimony, the  two departments had not yet developed a comprehensive integrated  project plan.", "The need for such a comprehensive plan is further highlighted by  the strategy announced by the two departments in January 2007:  that is, to jointly develop a new inpatient medical record system.  The departments have indicated that by adopting a joint solution,  they could realize significant cost savings and make inpatient health  care data immediately accessible to both departments.  Incorporating this new strategy into the departments\u2019 ongoing  efforts would be greatly facilitated by a comprehensive project plan.", "In summary, effectively instituting the realignment is essential to  ensuring that its IT programs achieve their objectives and that VA  has a solid and sustainable approach to managing its IT investments.  The department continues to work on improving such programs as  information security and asset control, and it currently has many  significant initiatives under way, for which substantial investments  have been made. Yet we continue to see management weaknesses in  these programs and initiatives (many of a long-standing nature),  which are the very weaknesses that VA aims to alleviate with its  reorganized management structure. However, until the department  provides the foundation for its new IT management structure by  carrying out its plans to establish a comprehensive set of improved  management processes, the impact of this vital undertaking will be  diminished. Implementation of the recommendations that we have  made in this area could play a significant role in resolving many of  these concerns.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
