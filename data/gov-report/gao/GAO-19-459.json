GAO interviewed representatives of federal agencies and stakeholders, including a nongeneralizable selection of state agencies from four states that had laws or oversight activities involving CRAs and seven CRAs selected based on size and the type of consumer reports produced.

In using its oversight authorities, CFPB has prioritized CRAs that pose the greatest potential risks to consumers\u2014such as those with significant market shares and large volumes of consumer complaints\u2014for examination. CFPB's oversight has generally focused on assessing compliance with Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requirements regarding accuracy and the investigations CRAs conduct in response to consumer disputes. For example, since 2013, CFPB has conducted examinations of several CRAs and directed specific changes in CRAs' policies and procedures for ensuring data accuracy and conducting dispute investigations.", "CFPB has not defined its expectations for how CRAs can comply with key statutory requirements. FCRA requires CRAs (1) to follow reasonable procedures for ensuring maximum possible accuracy and (2) to conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes. CFPB has identified deficiencies related to these requirements in its CRA examinations, but it has not defined its expectations\u2014such as by communicating information on appropriate practices\u2014for how CRAs can comply with these requirements. Absent such information, staff from four CRAs GAO interviewed said that they look to other sources, such as court cases or industry presentations, to understand what CFPB will consider to be noncompliant during examinations. A 2018 policy statement issued by CFPB and other regulators highlighted the important role of supervisory expectations in helping to ensure consistency in supervision by providing transparent insight to industry and to supervisory staff. By providing information to CRAs about its expectations for complying with key FCRA requirements, CFPB could help achieve its goal of accurate consumer reporting and effective dispute resolution processes. Such information also could help to promote consistency and transparency in CFPB's supervisory approach."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["CFPB should communicate to CRAs its expectations regarding (1) reasonable procedures for assuring maximum possible accuracy and (2) reasonable investigations of consumer disputes.

Banks, employers, and others use these reports  to assess consumer risks and behaviors and make important decisions  about issues such as cost of credit, insurance premiums, employment,  and housing. Inaccuracies in consumer reports could affect these  decisions. For example, inaccurate negative information in consumer  reports may affect consumers\u2019 access to credit or the cost at which they  can obtain credit. The exclusion of positive or updated information, such as timely payments, may also limit consumers\u2019 access to credit or  increase its cost.

We  selected these states because they had laws and regulations related to  consumer reporting or had oversight activities involving CRAs. We  interviewed representatives from three nationwide CRAs and four smaller  or specialty CRAs that produce or compile consumer reports covering the  credit and background-screening markets about federal and state  oversight. We selected these CRAs because of potential differences in  oversight based on their size and market. Additionally, we interviewed two  groups representing state agencies, two industry groups representing  CRAs, and four consumer groups about federal and state oversight of  CRAs. We selected these groups because, based on our analysis of  publicly available information and interviews with federal agencies, they  are the primary organizations representing stakeholders in our review,  such as CRAs, or have existing work, such as reports or congressional  testimonies, related to CRAs.

The information provided by furnishers may  include personally identifiable information such as names, addresses,  Social Security numbers, and employment data and account status  and credit histories. A furnisher may provide CRAs with consumer  information on multiple types of products. For example, a financial  institution may provide account information on student loans as well  as bank deposits. Furnishing of information to CRAs is generally  voluntary; therefore, a furnisher is not required to submit all of the  records about a consumer\u2019s activity on an account to CRAs.

Companies use  consumer information compiled in consumer reports to screen for  consumer risks and behaviors. For example, banks and credit unions  may rely on consumer reports to assess the risk of opening new  accounts. Some companies may act as both furnishers and consumer  report users.", "During the consumer reporting process, a consumer does not necessarily  interact with the CRA; however, if consumers discover inaccurate or  incomplete information on their consumer reports as a result of, for  example, being denied credit, they can file a dispute with the CRA, the  furnisher, or both. Consumers may also request copies of their  consumer reports from CRAs directly, and CRAs may provide consumers  with certain disclosures about how their information is being shared.", "Different types of CRAs compile different types of reports using the data  they obtain. The three nationwide CRAs produce credit reports and credit  scores that can be used to qualify consumers for credit. Credit reports  generally contain personally identifiable information, employment  information, account status and credit histories, and inquiries made about  consumers\u2019 credit histories (see fig. 2).

Specifically, CFPB staff told us that CFPB has prioritized CRAs that  represent a significant share of the market and the largest volume of  consumer complaints submitted to CFPB\u2019s complaint database. CFPB  has also examined one or more specialty CRAs. CFPB stated that in  determining which specialty CRAs to examine, it considered factors such  as the CRAs\u2019 market share in the particular consumer reporting products  they offer. According to CFPB, in setting supervisory priorities,  supervision staff also consulted with stakeholders and considered CFPB\u2019s  resources and findings from prior examinations that may have indicated  weaknesses.", "CFPB staff said that when CFPB began examining CRAs, its supervisory  approach was to examine their compliance management systems first  before focusing on other compliance areas. The staff said that the  compliance management system reviews helped CFPB to learn about  how CRAs operate. Based on the compliance management reviews,  CFPB determined that it could review data accuracy, dispute  investigations, and other compliance areas by examining the mechanisms  CRAs use to comply with FCRA. After examining compliance  management systems, CFPB prioritized examining other aspects of  compliance related to data accuracy (including processes for monitoring  furnishers) and dispute investigations, as well as performing follow-up  examinations in those areas. CFPB staff stated that they have chosen to  focus on data accuracy and dispute investigations because these were  the largest problem areas based on CFPB\u2019s assessment of complaint  data. Additionally, CFPB identified compliance with the FCRA obligations  regarding data accuracy and effective and efficient dispute resolution as  agency priorities for the consumer reporting market.", "CFPB has also examined other CRA compliance areas, including  procedures related to suppression and reinsertion of information that  CRAs found to be inaccurate, unverifiable, or obsolete; procedures for  ensuring a permissible purpose for obtaining consumer reports; and  compliance management systems related to data security. According to  CFPB, when determining compliance areas for examination, the agency  considered factors such as its data on complaints, the extent to which it  had previously examined the areas, and concerns identified in prior  examinations. In February 2019, we found that CFPB\u2019s examination  process did not routinely include an assessment of CRAs\u2019 data security  risks, and we recommended that CFPB\u2019s prioritization specifically account  for data security risk.", "In conducting its examinations, CFPB has focused on assessing CRA  procedures for complying with FCRA rather than on the extent of  inaccuracy in consumer reports. For example, according to a 2017 CFPB  report, CFPB directed one or more CRAs to establish quality control  programs to regularly assess the accuracy of information included in  consumer reports and to develop systems to measure the accuracy of  consumer reports and identify patterns and trends in errors. CFPB staff  said CFPB has not monitored the extent of inaccuracy in consumer  reports produced by the CRAs it examines. They stated that FCRA  requires CRAs and furnishers to follow reasonable procedures with  regard to accuracy but does not require or identify acceptable thresholds  for accuracy. CFPB staff explained that CFPB\u2019s supervisory program has  therefore focused on evaluating CRAs\u2019 compliance with FCRA  requirements for reasonable procedures with regard to accuracy and  identifying weaknesses in such procedures.", "According to CFPB, in prioritizing examinations of data furnishers, the  agency has primarily considered the furnishers\u2019 market shares, the  number of disputes CRAs received about the furnishers, and the number  of complaints CFPB received in its complaint database. CFPB has  prioritized large furnishers within their respective markets. For example,  CFPB identified one or more student loan servicers furnishing data to  CRAs that had large shares of the student loan servicing market. CFPB  has also prioritized furnishers with high dispute rates relative to other  furnishers within their markets. For example, CFPB identified one or more  credit card issuers with higher dispute rates compared to their peers,  based on CFPB\u2019s review of dispute data provided by CRAs. According to  CFPB, it has also considered the results of prior CFPB examinations and  input from agency stakeholders. As with CRAs, CFPB\u2019s examinations of  furnisher activities have focused on accuracy and dispute investigations.  In its Supervisory Highlights from March 2017, CFPB stated that the  accuracy of consumer report information is a CFPB priority and that  furnishers play an important role in ensuring the accuracy of consumer  report information through the dispute process.

Additionally, some examinations evaluated other  FCRA compliance areas, including ensuring that users had permissible  purposes for requesting consumer reports and preventing reinsertion of  previously deleted information.", "CFPB\u2019s examinations related to data accuracy and dispute investigation  obligations resulted in supervisory findings that CFPB directed CRAs to  take actions to address. CFPB found that one or more CRAs had minimal  compliance mechanisms in place to meet requirements for data accuracy  and for dispute investigations (see table 4 for examples of CFPB\u2019s  supervisory findings and directed actions in these areas). For example,  CFPB found that one or more CRAs lacked quality control policies and  procedures to test compiled consumer reports for accuracy and had  insufficient monitoring and oversight of furnishers that provided  information used in the reports. CFPB also found that one or more  CRAs did not review evidence that consumers provided to support their  disputes and relied entirely on the furnishers to investigate the disputes.  CFPB directed specific changes in some CRAs\u2019 policies and procedures  for ensuring data accuracy and conducting dispute investigations,  including increasing oversight of incoming data from furnishers,  developing internal processes to monitor furnisher dispute responses to  detect those that may present higher risk of inaccurate data, and  enforcing the CRAs\u2019 obligation to investigate consumer disputes,  including review of relevant information provided by consumers. In  addition, CFPB directed one or more CRAs to establish quality control  programs that regularly assess the accuracy and integrity of compiled  consumer reports.", "In follow-up reviews of some of its supervisory findings, CFPB found that  one or more CRAs took actions that resulted in improvements in policies  and procedures. For example, CFPB has found that one or more CRAs  established quality control programs, including developing tests to identify  the extent to which consumer reports are produced using information for  the wrong consumer. For other findings, CFPB determined that one or  more CRAs had not taken actions to address the findings, or CFPB had  not yet conducted follow-up examinations to determine if they had been  addressed.", "From 2013 through 2018, CFPB conducted examinations of several data  furnishers. These furnishers were involved in various consumer financial  markets, such as automobile loan servicing, debt collection, mortgage  servicing, and student loan servicing. CFPB staff told us that until 2017,  CFPB generally examined furnishers\u2019 compliance with FCRA as part of its  assessment of compliance with other Federal consumer financial laws  and regulations. CFPB staff said that in 2017, CFPB began conducting  examinations specifically focused on furnishing activities under FCRA and  Regulation V. CFPB stated that this change was made because the  review of furnishers\u2019 practices under FCRA and Regulation V was  resource-intensive and merited dedicated resources.", "In a 2017 report, CFPB stated that it had found numerous furnisher  violations of FCRA and Regulation V related to data accuracy and dispute  investigations and that it directed furnishers to take corrective actions  (see table 5 for examples of CFPB\u2019s supervisory findings and directed  actions). For example, CFPB found that certain furnishers failed to  establish, implement, and maintain reasonable written policies and  procedures consistent with Regulation V regarding the accuracy and  integrity of the information furnished; provided information to CRAs  despite having reasonable cause to believe the information was  inaccurate; and lacked policies for their employees on how to conduct  reasonable investigation of consumer disputes. In some cases, CFPB\u2019s  furnisher examinations conducted from 2013 through 2018 resulted in  findings related to FCRA and Regulation V that CFPB directed the  furnishers to take actions to address. For example, CFPB directed  furnishers to develop reasonable written policies and procedures  regarding accuracy, to promptly update the information provided to CRAs  after determining that the information was not complete or accurate, and  to update and implement policies and procedures to ensure disputes are  handled in accordance with FCRA requirements.", "CFPB staff told us that the agency decides whether to investigate based  on consideration of factors such as consumer complaints, extent of  effects on consumers, and severity of misconduct. CFPB staff told us  that, in many cases, CFPB has chosen to identify and correct FCRA  violations and weaknesses in compliance management systems at CRAs  through supervisory activity rather than enforcement investigations.  However, CFPB has also investigated and used enforcement remedies,  such as civil penalties and injunctive relief, against CRAs and furnishers  that violated FCRA or Regulation V. From 2012 through 2018, CFPB  settled 26 enforcement actions for violations related to FCRA and  Regulation V, including four settlements involving CRAs and 16  settlements involving furnishers. Although CFPB found other FCRA  violations in its investigations of these companies, such as those related  to permissible purpose for obtaining consumer reports and disclosure  issues, most of the violations related to data accuracy and dispute  investigations. For example, two of the four FCRA-related settlements  with CRAs involved dispute investigations or data accuracy procedures.  Of the 16 settlements with furnishers for alleged violations related to  FCRA and Regulation V, all contained violations related to the furnishers\u2019  obligations regarding data accuracy or dispute investigations.", "CFPB\u2019s settlements contained findings similar to its supervisory  examination findings. For example, CFPB found that a CRA failed to  investigate consumer disputes, and another CRA failed to take steps to  ensure its consumer reports were accurate. For furnishers, CFPB found  violations including furnishers that failed to establish and implement  reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and  integrity of information provided to CRAs, as well as furnishers that  provided inaccurate or incomplete information about consumers to CRAs  or failed to conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CFPB Has Not Defined Expectations for CRA Accuracy and Dispute Investigation Procedures", "paragraphs": ["CFPB has not defined its expectations\u2014including views on appropriate  practices\u2014for how CRAs can comply with key FCRA requirements.  Among other provisions, FCRA requires CRAs to (1) follow reasonable  procedures when preparing a consumer report to assure maximum  possible accuracy of consumer report information and (2) conduct  reasonable investigations of consumer disputes. However, FCRA does  not define what would constitute such reasonable policies and procedures  or investigations or stipulate the types of procedures or investigations that  would meet the requirements for CRAs.", "While CFPB has not defined its expectations for these two key FCRA  requirements for CRAs, it has adopted Regulation V, which, as required  by statute, includes information on CFPB\u2019s requirements and guidelines  in these areas for furnishers. Regulation V includes requirements and  guidelines for reasonable policies and procedures concerning the  accuracy and integrity of furnished consumer information and  requirements for reasonable investigations of consumer disputes filed  directly with the furnishers. In its supervision of furnishers, CFPB has  examined furnishers for compliance with the requirements of Regulation  V\u2014for example, it has found in examinations that furnishers violated  Regulation V\u2019s requirement to establish written policies and procedures  regarding the accuracy of consumer information furnished to a CRA.", "Although CFPB has not similarly established guidelines or otherwise  provided information on its supervisory expectations for CRAs, CFPB has  found specific weaknesses in CRA practices. In particular, CFPB has  cited one or more CRAs for specific deficiencies related to determinations  of noncompliance with FCRA provisions regarding reasonable procedures  for accuracy and dispute investigations. For example, CFPB has directed  one or more CRAs to take specific actions to improve their accuracy  procedures. In addition, CFPB found one or more CRAs\u2019 data governance  programs to be decentralized and informal, and it directed the CRAs to  develop and implement written policies and procedures to formalize the  programs. However, CFPB has not issued any information on its  supervisory expectations indicating that \u201creasonable procedures\u201d include  having formal written policies and procedures. CFPB also has identified  FCRA violations related to reasonable dispute investigations. For  example, CFPB determined that one or more CRAs failed to review and  consider documentation attached by consumers to disputes and relied  entirely on furnishers to investigate a dispute\u2014therefore violating FCRA  requirements for reasonable investigations and for reviewing and  considering all relevant information submitted by the consumer\u2014and  directed the CRAs to independently investigate consumer disputes.  However, CFPB has not issued any information on its supervisory  expectations to help interpret FCRA\u2019s requirement for CRAs to conduct a  reasonable investigation of disputes and to review and consider all  relevant information, including the expectation that CRAs investigate  consumer disputes independently. Based on the FCRA requirements  alone, it may be unclear to CRAs and others that these FCRA  requirements include performing independent investigations. For  example, representatives from one large CRA we interviewed stated that  the company is not required to conduct an independent investigation.", "FCRA instructs CFPB to enact regulations that are necessary to carry out  the purposes of the act, which could include issuing implementing  regulations for CRAs regarding data accuracy and dispute  investigations. Additionally, a 2018 policy statement issued by CFPB  and the prudential regulators explains that information on supervisory  expectations serves to articulate an agency\u2019s general views regarding  appropriate practices. The policy statement further states that it is  important for such information to provide insight to industry, as well as to  supervisory staff, in a transparent way that helps to ensure consistency in  the supervisory approach. According to CFPB\u2019s Supervisory Highlights  from March 2017, CFPB\u2019s vision for the consumer reporting system is a  system in which furnishers provide and CRAs maintain and distribute data  that are accurate, supplemented by an effective dispute management and  resolution process for consumers. According to the same CFPB  publication, this vision is rooted in the obligations and rights set forth in  FCRA and Regulation V.", "One reason why accuracy guidelines exist for furnishers but not CRAs is  that the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 added a  provision to FCRA requiring the prudential regulators and FTC to  establish and maintain guidelines for furnishers regarding the accuracy of  consumer data furnished to CRAs and to prescribe regulations requiring  furnishers to establish reasonable policies and procedures for  implementing the guidelines. In 2011, CFPB adopted these regulations  as part of Regulation V after assuming rulemaking authority from the  other agencies. Neither the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of  2003 nor any other statutory provision within FCRA includes a similar provision for the agencies to establish and maintain guidelines or provide  information concerning supervisory expectations regarding the accuracy  of consumer data CRAs maintain, and CFPB has not established  guidelines or defined supervisory expectations for CRAs.", "Since 2015, CFPB\u2019s long-term rulemaking agenda has stated that it will  evaluate possible policy responses to consumer reporting issues,  including potential additional rules or amendments to existing rules  governing consumer reporting accuracy and dispute processes. However,  as of May 2019, CFPB had not conducted any rulemaking related to  these topics. CFPB staff said that a substantial body of case law exists to  guide CRAs regarding what practices may be considered compliant with  FCRA requirements, including with respect to provisions for reasonable  procedures for accuracy and performing reasonable dispute  investigations. The staff also said that CFPB staff look to relevant case  law when assessing CRA compliance with FCRA during examinations,  and that supervisory findings serve to communicate to a supervised CRA  how CFPB has applied FCRA during an examination.", "Providing information to CRAs about its supervisory expectations for  these two key FCRA requirements\u2014and ways in which CRAs could  comply\u2014could help CFPB to facilitate CRA compliance with FCRA and  achieve agency objectives for the consumer reporting system. Without  information about its expectations, CFPB\u2019s supervision lacks  transparency about what practices it considers appropriate or expects  CRAs to adopt to comply with key FCRA requirements. Absent such  information from CFPB, representatives from four CRAs we interviewed  told us that they look to other sources to understand what CFPB will  consider to be noncompliant during examinations and to determine if they  are meeting FCRA requirements for maintaining reasonable procedures.  These sources include publicly available information such as court cases,  presentations from industry associations, CFPB publications highlighting  supervisory actions, and public enforcement actions. While CFPB can  communicate with individual CRAs during examinations and by directing  corrective actions, the impact of such interactions is limited to specific  CRAs rather than helping to ensure consistency in its supervisory  approach by providing transparent insights to the industry.", "While relevant case law could provide CRAs with some information  regarding practices that have been determined to be compliant with  FCRA requirements, there may be a lack of clarity about the extent to  which all case law fully reflects CFPB\u2019s expectations. By communicating  information about its expectations and ways in which CRAs could comply,  CFPB could help ensure that CRAs receive complete and consistent  information about how to interpret key FCRA requirements.

However, FTC staff also told us that they do not use a specific  size threshold to initiate investigations against CRAs or furnishers and  that they conduct their enforcement on a case-by-case basis, focusing on  violations or potential violations of applicable laws.", "Prior to taking an enforcement action against a company, FTC conducts  an investigation to determine if the company has violated a law. Using its  investigative authority, FTC can compel companies to produce  documents, testimony, and other materials to assist in its investigations.  To determine whether to initiate investigations, FTC staff said they  consider several sources, including leads from consumer advocacy  groups and other FTC investigations, tips from whistleblowers, and  monitoring of media reports. FTC staff also said that FTC regularly  monitors its consumer complaint database to identify the types of  complaints that consumers file and to determine if the activity described in  the complaint indicates potential noncompliance with laws and  regulations. FTC also can start investigations based on requests, such as  by a member of Congress. FTC staff said that the agency targets its  investigations based on the extent to which the potential noncompliance  may affect a large number of consumers. For example, staff said FTC  targets companies for investigation where inaccuracies may be occurring  on a large scale. In addition, as we reported in February 2019, FTC staff  said that when determining whether to initiate an investigation related to  privacy and data security matters, they consider factors such as the  companies\u2019 size and the sensitivity of the data in the companies\u2019  networks.", "FTC staff said that the consumer reporting market is a high priority for  FTC, and that the accuracy of consumer reports and CRA activities has  been a large part of FTC\u2019s enforcement priorities.

FTC  staff stated that of the approximately 160 investigations, about 70 related  to CRAs or companies, such as data brokers and companies selling  public records, that FTC investigated to determine if they were engaged  in conduct that would render them CRAs. Additionally, the staff said that  about 20 of the approximately 160 investigations related to furnishers,  about 55 related to users of consumer reports, and about 15 related to  companies that fall under provisions of FCRA that do not require that the  entity be a CRA, furnisher, or user. FTC staff stated that among these  investigations, FTC investigated specialty CRAs, such as background- screening and check-authorization companies, and furnishers, such as  debt collectors, lenders, and telecommunications companies.", "After an investigation, FTC may initiate an enforcement action if it has  reason to believe that a law is being or has been violated. From 2010  through 2018, FTC took 30 enforcement actions related to FCRA,  including against 14 CRAs, six furnishers, and two companies that acted  as both a CRA and furnisher. Of the 30 enforcement actions, 14  contained issues related to data accuracy or disputes and two contained  issues related to data security. In total, 20 of the 30 enforcement actions  contained issues related to other consumer reporting topics, such as  provision of consumer reports without permissible purpose. FTC staff told  us that all of the enforcement actions related to FCRA involved injunctive  relief. Additionally, some enforcement actions involved civil penalties. For  example, in one action, a CRA was ordered to pay civil penalties for  failing to use reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible  accuracy of information it provided to its customers, and for failing to  reinvestigate consumer disputes, as required by FCRA. FTC alleged that  the CRA failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information in  the reports was current and reflected updates, such as the expungement  of criminal records. FTC staff said that there is no overarching definition  regarding the FCRA provision for reasonable procedures for assuring  maximum possible accuracy and that FTC determines on a case-by-case  basis whether a violation has occurred. FTC staff also said that FTC\u2019s  enforcement actions provide industry with information on unacceptable  practices and that the enforcement actions are closely monitored by the  consumer reporting industry.", "In addition to enforcement actions related to FCRA, FTC staff told us that  FTC took five actions against CRAs for unfair or deceptive acts or  practices related to data security in the past 10 years.

In addition, FTC and CFPB reported in separate  studies in 2012 that mismatching is a key source of inaccuracies in  consumer reports.

CFPB, FTC, and  industry stakeholders\u2014three CRAs, a CRA industry group, and a  consumer group\u2014identified multiple reasons why personally identifiable  information in data furnished to CRAs may be inconsistent, inaccurate, or  incomplete, including the following examples:", "Consumers may use variations of their names when establishing an  account with financial institutions (such as Kathy and Katherine).", "Consumers may change their names as a result of divorce or  marriage, but the name change may not be reflected in furnished  data.", "Consumers with suffixes in their names (such as junior or senior) may  not consistently use suffixes in their applications.", "Furnishers may omit personally identifiable information.", "Furnishers may input consumers\u2019 information incorrectly during data  entry.", "In addition, CFPB stated in its 2012 report that matching public records to  consumers\u2019 files can be particularly challenging for CRAs because public  records rarely contain Social Security numbers.", "The processes CRAs have in place to match data to consumers\u2019 files may  also contribute to inaccuracies in consumer reports. Generally, CRAs use  various combinations of personally identifiable information to match data  to consumers. For example, representatives from one CRA said the CRA  uses at least the name and address to conduct matches. These  representatives said that where only name and address are used, the  address is required to be an exact match while the name can be a logical  variation determined by the CRA\u2019s algorithm. Representatives from  another CRA said that the CRA matches public record information using  at least the full name and date of birth but not the Social Security number  because it is difficult to obtain. According to a CFPB report, the three  nationwide CRAs\u2014as part of their settlements with multiple state Attorney  General offices\u2014now require name, address, and Social Security number  or date of birth to be present in public records furnished to them and use  that personally identifiable information to conduct matches.  Representatives from three consumer groups attributed consumer report  inaccuracies to how CRAs make such matches. For example,  representatives of two consumer groups said that CRAs could reduce  inaccuracies arising from mismatching by using stricter requirements,  such as requiring both Social Security number and date of birth, in  addition to names and addresses, or only matching data to consumers if  all nine digits of the Social Security number are present.", "Altogether, the errors originating from consumers or furnishers, as well as  processes that CRAs have in place for matching, affect the accuracy of  consumer reports (see fig. 3).", "CFPB and representatives from several industry stakeholders identified  errors in furnished data as a primary cause of consumer report  inaccuracies. Even when a CRA matches data to the correct consumer  file, the consumer report can still contain inaccuracies if the information a  furnisher provided to the CRA regarding the consumer contained errors  (see fig. 4). CFPB has reported and a few CRAs told us that CRAs  conduct quality checks to identify issues including blank fields or logical  inconsistencies in furnished data, such as reporting of new account  balance for closed consumer accounts. The CRA can reject furnished  data or ask furnishers to provide corrected data. However, a CFPB report  and a few industry stakeholders we interviewed identified weaknesses in  furnisher and CRA processes as contributing to errors in furnished data.  Two of the consumer groups we interviewed\u2014Consumers Union and the  National Consumer Law Center\u2014also cited weaknesses in furnisher and  CRA processes as contributing to errors in furnished data in reports they  published.", "Processes for handling consumer transactions. CFPB reported  that problems with processes used by furnishers include failing to  update records, failing to post a payment, and misattributing  ownership of an account to an individual who is only an authorized  user.", "Processes for handling data accuracy. CFPB also reported and a  few stakeholders told us that some furnishers lack processes for  ensuring the accuracy of data submitted to CRAs and some CRAs  lack processes for ensuring the accuracy of furnished data.", "CFPB reported and representatives from a few industry stakeholders said  that timing of data updates in furnished data and court records could be a  source of potential inaccuracies. For example, representatives from one  CRA said that an address or name change can take up to two billing  cycles to be reflected in a consumer report. Additionally, representatives  from a CRA industry group told us that online court records, where CRAs  may obtain data, often lag behind paper court records. Representatives  from one consumer group pointed to the timing of when furnishers report  debt as a source of potential inaccuracies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identity Fraud or Theft", "paragraphs": ["CFPB, the National Consumer Law Center, and Consumers Union have  reported that identity fraud and theft are causes of inaccuracies in  consumer reports. Additionally, representatives from one CRA also told  us that identity fraud and theft are primary causes of inaccuracies. For  example, identity thieves can create new credit accounts in a consumer\u2019s  name and let the debt go unpaid. Such debts then may be reflected in the  consumer\u2019s account and be reported to CRAs if not identified by the  furnisher as resulting from fraudulent activity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consumers Can Dispute Potential Inaccuracies in Their Consumer Reports with CRAs or Furnishers", "paragraphs": ["Consumers can dispute the accuracy or completeness of their consumer  reports with the CRAs that produced the consumer reports, with the data  furnishers, or both. As stated previously, FCRA requires CRAs to conduct  reasonable investigations of consumer disputes; FCRA, Regulation V,  and FTC\u2019s Furnisher Rule, as applicable, generally also require furnishers  to conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes. If consumers  are dissatisfied with the results of the investigations conducted by the  CRAs or furnishers, they have a few options, discussed in detail below.", "FCRA requires CRAs and furnishers to take specific steps to respond to  consumer disputes. When a consumer files a dispute with the CRA, the  CRA must investigate the dispute internally, and once the CRA notifies  the furnisher of the dispute, the furnisher must also investigate the  disputed information (see fig. 5). If the CRA\u2019s internal investigation or  the furnisher\u2019s investigation finds that the disputed item is inaccurate,  incomplete, or cannot be verified, the CRA must delete the disputed item  from the consumer\u2019s file or modify the information and notify the furnisher  of the action taken. The CRA must notify the consumer of the  investigation results. Representatives from six of the CRAs we  interviewed said that they consider disputes resolved when they or the  furnishers complete their investigations and notify consumers of the  results, even if the consumer does not agree with the results. If a  furnisher does not conduct an investigation and report to the CRA within  the time frame required by FCRA, then the CRA must remove the  disputed information from the consumer\u2019s file.", "Certain furnisher processes for investigating a dispute received from a  CRA and a dispute received directly from the consumer are similar under  FCRA. When a furnisher investigates a dispute received from a CRA, the  furnisher must report the results of the investigation to the CRA that  forwarded the dispute. If the furnisher receives the dispute directly from a  consumer, then it must investigate the dispute and report the results of  the investigation to the consumer, generally within 30 days (see fig. 6). In  both cases, the furnisher must provide corrected information to every  CRA to which it provided the information.", "CRAs may have differing dispute investigation processes in place  because of regulatory requirements or because of how they obtained their  data. Under FCRA, the nationwide CRAs are required to maintain an  automated system through which furnishers can report incomplete or  inaccurate information in a consumer\u2019s file. The nationwide CRAs share  the use of an automated system that sends disputes to furnishers and  receives furnishers\u2019 responses to the disputes. Other CRAs are not  required by FCRA to use an automated system. Representatives from  one CRA told us that the CRA uses email and phone calls to send  disputes to and receive responses from furnishers. Representatives from  a CRA industry group, as well as representatives from a background- screening CRA, said that compared to CRAs that obtain information from  furnishers, background-screening CRAs generally obtain records from  courts and therefore conduct their dispute investigations by confirming  court records and contacting court officials.", "Consumers have several options to address potential inaccuracies in their  consumer reports if they disagree with the results of a CRA or furnisher  investigation, but these options have potential limitations, according to the  stakeholders we interviewed.", "Placing a consumer statement on the report. Under FCRA, if the  investigation does not resolve the dispute (where the dispute is filed  with a CRA), the consumer may place a statement regarding the  nature of the dispute on the consumer report, such as why the  consumer disagreed with the reported item. According to the three  nationwide CRAs, such statements alert creditors to the consumer\u2019s  disagreement. However, the statement does not modify or remove the  information that the consumer perceived to be inaccurate from the  consumer report, and users of the consumer report may or may not  consider the consumer\u2019s statement in their decision-making.", "Resubmitting disputes to CRAs or furnishers. Consumers who  believe their disputes have not been satisfactorily resolved may  choose to resubmit disputes regarding the same items that they  disputed previously to CRAs or to the furnishers. If a consumer  submits a dispute and does not provide sufficient information to  investigate the disputed information or resubmits a dispute and does  not provide additional or new supporting information, a CRA or  furnisher may determine that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant and  does not warrant an investigation. Representatives from one CRA  told us that if the CRA receives a dispute from a consumer about an  item that was previously disputed, it would review consumer records  to see if it has verified the consumer\u2019s information previously. If so,  the CRA would ask the consumer to provide additional documentation  or to contact the furnisher to obtain support for the dispute. In some  cases, consumers may turn to third parties that submit disputes on  their behalf. Representatives from one CRA said that the CRA does  not investigate disputes that certain third parties submit on behalf of  consumers because these third parties dispute the same items  repeatedly. Representatives from another CRA said that the CRA  reviews third-party dispute requests to determine if the third party has  proper authorization from consumers to act on their behalf.", "Submitting complaints to federal and state agencies. Consumers  can submit complaints about inaccuracies in their consumer reports to  federal and state agencies, such as CFPB and state Attorney General  offices. CFPB has stated that it forwards these complaints to CRAs  and works with them to obtain responses within 15 days. Staff from  several state agencies we interviewed generally told us that after  receiving complaints, they contact CRAs about the complaints to  obtain responses but do not compel CRAs to take specific actions.  CFPB has reported that CRAs handle complaints similarly to  consumer disputes. As a result, although complaints are separate  from the dispute process required under FCRA, the effectiveness of  this option also depends on the same CRA processes for addressing  inaccuracies. However, representatives from two consumer groups  said that submitting complaints to CFPB through its consumer  complaint database has helped consumers resolve inaccuracies in  their reports. Representatives from one consumer group said the  publication of complaints in CFPB\u2019s database helps to hold CRAs  accountable and incentivizes CRAs to respond.", "Taking private legal action. Under FCRA, consumers have private  rights of action\u2014or ability to litigate\u2014against CRAs and furnishers,  under certain provisions. Consumers have brought legal claims  against CRAs and furnishers for failure to follow reasonable  procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy or conduct a  reasonable investigation of a dispute. Under FCRA, consumers can  sue a furnisher for failure to conduct a proper investigation when  notified by a CRA that a consumer has disputed information provided  by the furnisher. However, before initiating suit, the consumer must  first dispute the information with the CRA. A consumer may initiate  a dispute through a CRA even if the consumer has previously initiated  a dispute with the furnisher. Representatives from two consumer  groups and one state agency told us that in general, consumer  barriers to litigation include that it is time-consuming and has  potentially high legal costs and that consumers might be unaware of  their legal rights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight Has Led CRAs to Make Changes to Promote Accuracy, but Challenges to Consumer Report Accuracy Remain", "paragraphs": ["As a result of CFPB and FTC oversight and settlements with multiple  state Attorneys General, the nationwide CRAs and several other CRAs  have made changes in their policies and procedures to improve data  accuracy and processes for addressing inaccuracies in consumer reports.  However, CFPB and a few industry stakeholders said that challenges to  improving accuracy in consumer reports remain.", "According to CFPB and nationwide CRAs, examples of the changes that  CRAs have made as a result of oversight include the following:", "Changes as a result of CFPB supervision. According to CFPB, as a  result of supervisory findings, one or more CRAs have implemented  or changed policies and procedures related to ensuring accuracy and  dispute investigations. These include (1) establishing a data- governance structure to oversee furnisher monitoring, such as by  developing policies and procedures for ongoing and systemic  screening of furnishers; (2) implementing systems to forward relevant  dispute documents submitted by consumers to furnishers; and (3)  implementing policies and procedures to ensure consideration of all  supporting material submitted by consumers.", "Changes as a result of CFPB and FTC enforcement. As a result of  CFPB\u2019s and FTC\u2019s enforcement, the two agencies directed a few  CRAs to revise the procedures they use to match data using  personally identifiable information. For example, CFPB directed two  background-screening CRAs to revise procedures for assuring  accuracy, such as by using algorithms to distinguish records by  middle name and to match common names and nicknames. In  another example, FTC directed a background-screening CRA that  required an exact match of a consumer\u2019s last name and a nonexact  match of first name, middle name, and date of birth to put in place  reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy.", "Changes as a result of state oversight. According to the three  nationwide CRAs, they have implemented measures as a result of  their 2015 settlements with multiple state Attorneys General. For  example, they stated they monitor data furnishers\u2019 dispute responses  and take corrective actions against data furnishers for noncompliance  with their dispute investigation responsibilities. Additionally, they  established special handling procedures for disputes involving mixed  files, fraud, and identity theft and provided CRA employees with  discretion to resolve such disputes, rather than relying on furnishers\u2019  responses.", "In addition to the changes described above, representatives at various  CRAs said they had quality assurance processes in place to help ensure  that furnished data are accurate and that furnishers are responsive to  disputes.", "Monitoring of furnished data. Representatives from four CRAs said  that they use various mechanisms to monitor furnished data to detect  potential inaccuracies and take corrective actions against furnishers  that do not comply with data furnishing standards. For example,  representatives from three CRAs told us they compare data  submissions against industry patterns and historical trends\u2014such as  data submission history over the past 6 months\u2014to identify anomalies  that would suggest erroneous data and take actions such as rejecting  incoming data and returning data for correction. Representatives from  one of these CRAs said that they analyze why a furnisher deviates  from industry trends and help the furnisher identify and implement  changes. Representatives from four CRAs told us that they provide  regular reports, such as monthly reports, on data quality to furnishers.  We reported previously that such steps may improve the quality of the  information received from furnishers but cannot ensure the accuracy  of such data.", "Monitoring of dispute investigations. Representatives from four  CRAs said they have processes in place to help ensure that  furnishers are responsive to disputes. For example, representatives  from one CRA said that the automated system they use to correspond  with furnishers about disputes automatically identifies illogical  furnisher responses; the CRA contacts the furnisher to confirm the  accuracy of those responses. Representatives from four CRAs told us  that they monitor furnisher responses to disputes, such as dispute  trends by furnisher type and the rate at which furnishers do not  respond to disputes.", "Although CRAs have made changes to improve processes for ensuring  accuracy and addressing inaccuracies, CFPB and industry stakeholders  said that challenges remain in these areas. First, CFPB staff told us that  the consumer reporting market has historically had comparatively less  regulatory intervention than other regulated markets. As a result, the staff  said that it has been challenging to change CRAs\u2019 approach to a  proactive one, whereby the CRAs proactively address compliance and  change practices, as opposed to a defensive, reactive approach in  response to consumer disputes and lawsuits. CFPB staff explained that  this has been a focus of CFPB\u2019s supervision and said that its examination  findings have demonstrated that CRAs can take actions to improve  accuracy. Further, representatives from three consumer groups said that  consumer report inaccuracy remains a challenge because CRAs lack  incentives to be responsive to consumers, in part because the CRAs\u2019  customers are the users of consumer reports, such as banks and  employers, rather than the consumers themselves. Additionally, two  industry stakeholders identified gaps in furnisher responsibilities for  ensuring accuracy as a challenge. Representatives from one of these  stakeholders, a state agency, said that furnishers often do not know their  responsibilities for ensuring the accuracy of their data. Representatives  from the other stakeholder, a CRA, said that while the CRA has  implemented policies and procedures to ensure accuracy in response to  CFPB\u2019s supervision, furnishers might not have implemented similar  policies and procedures to ensure the accuracy of the data provided."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Consumer reports affect the lives of millions of Americans because of the  role they play in many important decisions, such as whether a lender  decides to extend credit and at what terms or whether an employer offers  a candidate a job.

We found that opportunities exist for CFPB to  improve its oversight of CRAs.", "As part of its supervision, CFPB has directed CRAs it has examined to  make specific changes based on examination findings related to FCRA  requirements for (1) reasonable procedures for assuring accuracy and (2)  reasonable investigation of consumer disputes. However, CFPB has not  defined its expectations for how CRAs can comply with these  requirements. Providing additional information to CRAs about its  expectations for key FCRA requirements could help CFPB achieve its  vision of promoting a consumer reporting system where CRAs maintain  and distribute accurate data, supplemented by effective dispute resolution  processes.

In email  responses, officials indicated that NCUA and OCC did not have any  comments on the draft of this report.", "In its written comments, CFPB neither agreed nor disagreed with the  recommendations. CFPB stated that it has made oversight of the  consumer reporting market a top priority and that its supervisory reviews  of CRAs have focused on evaluating their systems for assuring the  accuracy of data used to prepare consumer reports. CFPB noted that  CRAs have made significant advances to, among other things, promote  greater accuracy.", "With respect to the first recommendation\u2014that CFPB should  communicate to CRAs its expectations regarding reasonable procedures  for assuring maximum possible accuracy\u2014CFPB noted that case law  includes interpretations of the reasonableness standard and provides  guidance to CRAs about how the standard applies to various factual  scenarios. CFPB also noted that it and FTC have settled enforcement  actions regarding the reasonableness standard in which each agency  provided examples of how it applied the standard and the relevant case  law to the facts of each matter and described a consent order with two  background-screening companies that made clear that a lack of certain  written procedures was not reasonable. Additionally, CFPB noted that its  examination procedures discuss factors that would be considered in  evaluating compliance with the reasonable procedures standard and that  it publishes \u201cSupervisory Highlights\u201d that document key examination  findings.", "While we agree that case law may provide information to CRAs regarding  how courts have interpreted the reasonableness standard in specific  circumstances, as we note in the report, there may be a lack of clarity  about the extent to which all case law fully reflects CFPB\u2019s expectations.  Absent additional information from CFPB, the current case law and case- by-case enforcement actions may not best serve to enable CRAs to  proactively address compliance practices. More direct communication of  CFPB\u2019s expectations can provide CRAs with clearer information on what  they should be doing and what actions might constitute a FCRA violation.  Similarly, while FTC and CFPB have settled actions with certain CRAs  regarding reasonable procedures, such settlements may be applicable  only to the specific facts and circumstances and the parties involved in  those cases. CFPB\u2019s examination procedures provide information on  factors that would be considered in evaluating compliance and areas that  may be reviewed in examinations, but they do not provide information on  CFPB\u2019s oversight expectations regarding how CRAs may comply with the  FCRA requirement for reasonable procedures. Likewise, while CFPB\u2019s  Supervisory Highlights provide information on key examination findings,  the Supervisory Highlights do not represent CFPB\u2019s expectations for how  CRAs may or should comply with the reasonableness standard. For  example, the Supervisory Highlights state that the legal violations  described are based on particular facts and circumstances and may not  lead to such findings under different facts and circumstances.", "With respect to the second recommendation\u2014that CFPB should  communicate to CRAs its expectations regarding reasonable  investigations of consumer disputes\u2014CFPB stated that what qualifies as  a \u201creasonable investigation\u201d has been articulated in court cases and  noted that an FTC report summarizes how the reasonable investigations  standard has been interpreted by courts and FTC. While we acknowledge  that FTC may have interpreted and the courts may have ruled on this  issue, CFPB has not communicated to CRAs specific information on what  may and may not qualify as a \u201creasonable investigation.\u201d CFPB also  stated that it issued a bulletin in September 2013 that is relevant to this  recommendation.

We  selected four states\u2014Maine, Maryland, New York, and Ohio\u2014for a more  in-depth review. We chose these states because they had laws and  regulations related to consumer reporting or had oversight activities  involving CRAs, such as prior enforcement actions. We interviewed staff  from state regulatory agencies in Maine, Maryland, and New York, as well  as staff from the New York Office of the Attorney General. In addition, we  received written responses to our questions from the Ohio Office of the  Attorney General. In each case, we asked questions about state oversight  of CRAs, including the relevant state laws and state enforcement,  rulemaking, and supervisory authorities. We interviewed three nationwide  CRAs and four smaller or specialty CRAs that produce or compile  consumer reports covering the credit and background-screening markets  about federal and state oversight, including applicable laws. We selected  these CRAs because of potential differences in oversight based on their  size and market. In our selection, we considered the size of the CRA and  the number of consumer complaints in CFPB\u2019s database. We also  interviewed two industry groups representing CRAs (the Consumer Data  Industry Association and the National Association of Professional  Background Screeners); two groups representing states (the Conference  of State Bank Supervisors and the National Conference of State  Legislatures); and four consumer groups (Consumers Union, the National  Association of Consumer Advocates, the National Consumer Law Center,  and U.S. Public Interest Research Group). We asked these groups about  federal and state authorities for overseeing CRAs. We selected these  groups because, based on our analysis of publicly available information  and interviews with federal agencies, they are the primary organizations  representing stakeholders in our review, such as CRAs, or have existing  work, such as reports or testimonies, related to CRAs.
