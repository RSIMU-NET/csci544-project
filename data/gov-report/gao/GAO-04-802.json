In 2002, states and localities contributed 54 percent of the Nation's capital investment in highways, while federal funds accounted for 46 percent. However, as state and local governments faced fiscal pressures and an economic downturn, their investment from 1998 through 2002 decreased by 4 percent in real terms, while the federal investment increased by 40 percent in real terms. Evidence suggests that increased federal highway grants influence states and localities to substitute federal funds for funds they otherwise would have spent on highways. Our model, which expanded on other recent models, estimated that states used roughly half of the increases in federal highway grants since 1982 to substitute for state and local highway funding, and that the rate of substitution increased during the 1990s. Therefore, while state and local highway spending increased over time, it did not increase as much as it would have had states not withdrawn some of their own highway funds. These results are consistent with our earlier work and with other evidence. For example, the federal-aid highway program creates the opportunity for substitution because states typically spend substantially more than the amount required to meet federal matching requirements--usually 20 percent. Thus, states can reduce their own highway spending and still obtain increased federal funds. These trends imply that substitution may be limiting the effectiveness of strategies Congress has put into place to meet the federal-aid highway program's goals. For example, one strategy has been to significantly increase the federal investment and ensure that funds collected for highways are used for that purpose. However, federal increases have not translated into commensurate increases in the nation's overall investment in highways, in part because while Congress can dedicate federal funds for highways, it cannot prevent state highway funds from being used for other purposes. GAO identified several options for the future design and structure of the federal-aid highway program that could be considered in light of these issues. For example, increasing the required state match, rewarding states that increase their spending, or requiring states to maintain levels of investment over time could all help reduce substitution. On the other hand, the ability of states to meet a variety of needs and fiscal pressures might be better accomplished by providing states with funds through a more flexible federal program--this could also reduce administrative expenses associated with the federal-aid highway program. While some of these options are mutually exclusive, others could be enacted in concert with each other. The commission separately approved by both houses of Congress in 2004 may be an appropriate vehicle to examine these options."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, both houses of Congress approved separate legislation to  reauthorize the federal-aid highway program to help meet the Nation\u2019s  surface transportation needs, enhance mobility, and promote economic  growth. Each bill also recognized that the Nation faces significant  transportation challenges in the future. Many transportation experts have  noted that eventually, the introduction of more fuel-efficient vehicles and  clean fuels may undermine the sustainability of financing the Nation\u2019s  surface transportation program through motor fuel taxes. As such, both  bills established a National Commission to assess future revenue sources  for the Highway Trust Fund and to consider the roles of the various levels  of government and the private sector in meeting future surface  transportation financing needs. In the longer term, broader fiscal  challenges face the Nation, including federal and state budget deficits and  the fiscal crisis looming as the baby boomer generation retires, causing  mandatory commitments to Social Security and Medicare to consume a  greater share of the Nation\u2019s resources, squeezing funding available for all  domestic discretionary programs. These challenges require the Nation to  think critically about existing government programs and commitments.", "In light of these issues, you asked us to provide information on past trends  in the federal, state, and local capital investment in highways, and on how  federal-aid highway program grants influence the level of state and local  highway spending. We responded to the first part of your request in June  2003. This report (1) updates information on trends in federal, state, and  local capital investment in highways; (2) assesses the influence that  federal-aid highway grants have had on state and local highway spending;  (3) discusses the implications of these trends for the federal-aid highway  program; and (4) discusses options for the structure and design of the  federal-aid highway program that could be considered in light of these  issues. In addition, this report identifies characteristics associated with  differences among states\u2019 levels of effort for highway investment (see app.  III).", "To respond to your request, we reviewed data from the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the  Bureau of the Census, and other sources for the period from 1982 through  2002. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our analyses. We also reviewed and synthesized the research  literature on the influence that federal highway grants have had on the level  of state and local highway spending. Our literature review revealed a  number of studies that used statistical models developed by the studies\u2019  authors to estimate the influence of federal funding on state spending  choices. These models examined different time periods, employed different  statistical methods, and considered different social, demographic,  economic, and political factors that may affect state highway spending  decisions. None of the models used in the studies we reviewed included the  most recent data now available on highway funding, and none examined  whether the effect of federal grants on state spending changed over the  time period covered in the study. Therefore, based on the models used in  the earlier studies, we developed a statistical model of state highway  spending outcomes to estimate the fiscal effects of federal highway funding  on state highway spending choices. This model included the most recent  data available and examined whether the effect of federal grants on state  spending changed over the time period covered by our data. The purpose of  the statistical model was to isolate the effect that federal grants have on  state highway spending by controlling for other factors that also affect  state spending decisions. The model therefore takes into account changing  state economic conditions, the size and intensity of highway usage, and  other factors that may be associated with states\u2019 willingness to support  highway spending. This statistical model was reviewed by experts in DOT  and peer reviewed by three authors of the earlier studies on the fiscal  effects of federal highway grants. These experts and authors generally  agreed with our methods, and we made revisions based on their comments  as appropriate. A more detailed description of the literature and the  statistical model is contained in appendix II. We conducted our work from  August 2003 through July 2004 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding for highways is provided to the states mostly through a  series of formula grant programs collectively known as the federal-aid  highway program. Periodically Congress enacts multiyear legislation that  authorizes the Nation\u2019s surface transportation programs, including  highway, transit, highway safety, and motor carrier programs. This  legislation authorizes the federal-aid highway program and the individual  grant programs that comprise it, and it sets overall funding for it and other  surface transportation programs. In 1991, for example, Congress enacted  ISTEA, which authorized $121 billion for highways for the 6-year period  from fiscal years 1992 through 1997, and in 1998 Congress enacted TEA-21,  which authorized $171 billion for the federal-aid highway program from  fiscal years 1998 through 2003. In 2004, the House and Senate each  approved separate legislation to reauthorize the federal-aid highway  program, the House authorizing $226.3 billion and the Senate authorizing  $256.4 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2009. These authorizations  provide multiyear \u201ccontract authority\u201d that gives the states notice several  years in advance of the size of the federal-aid program and the approximate  amount of federal funding they may expect to receive.", "Funding for the federal-aid highway program is provided through the  Highway Trust Fund. Established by the Highway Revenue Act of 1956, the  Highway Trust Fund is a dedicated source of revenues generated by  highway user fees such as taxes on motor fuels, tires, and trucks. TEA-21  established two additional mechanisms to support the dedication of  highway user fees to highways. First, the act established guaranteed  funding for certain highway, transit, and highway safety programs,  including the federal-aid highway program, by protecting them with  \u201cfirewalls\u201d from competing for funding with other domestic discretionary  programs through the congressional budget process. Second, the act  provided that the highway program funding authorizations would be  adjusted to reflect changes in estimates of Highway Trust Fund revenue,  ensuring that funding available for the federal-aid highway program  reflected the revenue taken in by the Highway Trust Fund. Both the Senate  and the House have each approved separate legislation to extend the  collection of fuel taxes to the Highway Trust Fund, the Senate through 2009  and the House through 2011. Amid concerns that the introduction of more  fuel-efficient vehicles and clean fuels may undermine the sustainability of  financing the Highway Trust Fund through fuel taxes in the future, both  houses also included provisions to create a National Commission to  examine future revenue sources to support the Highway Trust Fund and to  consider, among other things, the roles of the various levels of government  and the private sector in meeting future surface transportation financing  needs.", "Once Congress authorizes funding, FHWA makes federal funding available  to the states annually at the start of each fiscal year through  apportionments based on formulas specified in law for each of the several  formula grant programs that make up the federal-aid highway program.  Ninety-two percent of the funds apportioned to the states in fiscal year  2003 were apportioned by formula. The remaining highway program funds  were distributed through allocations to states with qualifying projects. The  highway programs with apportionments based on formulas are shown in  table 1.", "As we reported in 1995, the federal funding formula derives from a  complicated set of calculations and is a complex process in which the  underlying data and factors are ultimately not meaningful because they are  overridden by other provisions that yield a predetermined outcome. One  reason is the presence of \u201cequity provisions\u201d that ensure that states receive  set amounts based on historic funding levels and other considerations.  These equity provisions were strengthened after our 1995 report. For  example, as table 1 shows, TEA-21\u2019s Minimum Guarantee Program ensures  that each state\u2019s share of apportionments from nearly all federal-aid  highway funds is not less than 90.5 percent of that state\u2019s percentage share  of contributions to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund.  Funds from this program accounted for nearly a quarter of all highway  funding in fiscal year 2003. Under separate legislation approved by both the  House and the Senate, each state\u2019s share of apportionments could rise to 95  percent by 2009. Furthermore, as table 1 shows, states receive minimum  apportionments regardless of the formula for several grant programs.", "States have broad flexibility to transfer funds between the various grant  programs. For example, states may transfer up to 50 percent of their  Interstate Maintenance and National Highway System Program funds to  other programs, including the Surface Transportation Program, which, as  table 1 shows, has broad eligibility rules. In addition, ISTEA and TEA-21  provided the states broad authority to transfer federal-aid highway funds to  transit projects and vice versa. Between fiscal years 1992 and 2002, 47  states and the District of Columbia transferred about $8.8 billion from  federal-aid highway funds to transit programs to fund rail line  improvements, motor vehicle purchases, new or improved passenger  facilities, and other projects. During that same time, about $40 million was  transferred from FTA to FHWA for highway projects.", "Once FHWA apportions funds to the states, funds are available to be  obligated by the states for construction, reconstruction, and improvement  of highways and bridges on eligible federal-aid highway routes and for  other purposes authorized in law. About 1 million of the Nation\u2019s 4 million  miles of roads are eligible for federal aid; however, these roads accounted  for 85 percent of the vehicle miles traveled on the Nation\u2019s roadways in  2001. The roads that are generally ineligible are functionally classified as  local roads or minor collectors. Around 161,000 miles of federally eligible  roadways are on the National Highway System, of which around 47,000  belong to the Interstate Highway System. With few exceptions, federal  funds for highways must be matched by funds from other sources\u2014usually  state and local governments. The matching requirement on most projects is  80 percent federal and 20 percent state or local funding. In addition to  matching federal funds, states and localities spend funds to finance  highway capital projects and to maintain existing roadways.", "The federal-aid highway program is administered by FHWA, whose  responsibilities include reviewing periodic transportation improvement  plans prepared by state and local governments, approving projects for  federal aid, apportioning grant funding to the states, providing technical  support, and overseeing federally funded projects. In fiscal year 2004,  FHWA received $334 million to provide these services, with an authorized  staff level of 2,931 positions. FHWA personnel are located in Washington,  D.C., and in 52 field offices located in each state, the District of Columbia,  and Puerto Rico, as well as a regional \u201cresource center\u201d with four offices  across the country that provide specialized technical assistance to the field  offices and the states.", "The federal-aid highway program has a considerable regulatory  component. As a condition of receiving federal aid, states agree to apply  and enforce certain federal laws on federally aided projects, such as the  environmental assessment provisions in the National Environmental Policy  Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the nondiscrimination protections  found in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and others. In addition, states are  required to establish goals and to award a set percentage of contracts (the  national goal is 10 percent) on federally aided projects to small businesses  owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged  individuals, including minority and women-owned businesses.  Furthermore, in accepting federal-aid highway funds, states must enact  certain laws to improve highway safety or face penalties in the form of  either withholdings or transfers in their federal grants.In addition to these  penalties, states may apply for and receive highway safety incentive grants  through programs administered outside the federal-aid highway program  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). For  example, states in which the use of seat belts exceeds the national average  or improves over time are eligible for incentive grants based on NHTSA\u2019s  calculation of the annual savings to the federal government in medical  costs that resulted from the increased use.", "In general, there are three possible ways that federal grant funding can  influence state spending for a program, as illustrated in figure 1. First,  increased federal funding may stimulate, or leverage, additional spending  from state resources. For example, a state may have to increase its own  spending in order to meet federal matching requirements and obtain  federal funds, thus increasing the overall level of spending by more than  the amount of the federal grant. As the federal-aid highway program in  most cases requires that states must contribute 20 percent of the total cost  of a project in order to receive federal matching funds of 80 percent of the  total cost, the suggestion is that every $1.00 increase in federal funds would  go towards a total spending increase of $1.25 ($1.00 is 80 percent of $1.25),  $0.25 of which would be funded with state and local government funds  ($0.25 is 20 percent of $1.25). The result of a stimulative effect of federal  grant funding is illustrated in the first panel of figure 1, in which an  additional $1.00 of federal aid increases spending from state resources by  25 cents, increasing the overall level of highway spending by $1.25.  Alternatively, increased federal funding may supplement state spending by  adding to what states would otherwise have spent, increasing the overall  level of spending by the amount of the federal grant, as illustrated in the  second panel of figure 1. To the extent that states maintain their own  spending when they receive additional federal funding, either because  federal policy requires that they do so or because they do so voluntarily,  then the additional federal aid supplements state spending. Finally, states  may use increased federal funding to substitute for, or replace, what they  would otherwise have spent from state resources, so that the overall level  of spending increases by less than the amount of the federal grant. This  substitution of federal funds for state funds is illustrated in the third panel  of figure 1, in which an additional $1.00 in federal funding results in only a  50 cent increase to total spending because in response to the influx of  federal funds, the state withdraws 50 cents of its own spending on the  program and uses these funds for other purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and Localities Invest More in Highways Than the Federal Government; However, Recent Federal Investment Has Outpaced State and Local Investment", "paragraphs": ["The Nation\u2019s capital investment in its highway system has doubled in the  last 20 years, and during that time period as a whole, state and local  investment in highways outstripped federal investment in highways\u2014both  in terms of the amount of and growth in spending. Between 1982 and 2002,  state and local capital investment in highways increased 150 percent, from  $14.1 billion to $35.7 billion in real terms, whereas the federal investment  increased 98 percent, from $15.5 billion to $30.7 billion in real terms. For  every year after 1986, states and localities invested more in the Nation\u2019s  highways than did the federal government. (See fig. 2.) Most recently, in  2002, states and localities contributed 54 percent of the Nation\u2019s capital  investment in highways, spending $35.7 billion, while the federal  government contributed 46 percent or $30.7 billion in real terms.", "In addition to the billions of dollars states and localities invest in capital  highway projects to expand highway capacity or rehabilitate existing  highways, states and localities spend additional funds maintaining and  policing their roadways. For example, in 2001, states and localities spent  about 27 percent of their total capital and maintenance funding on  maintenance activities, including fixing potholes, sealing cracks in bridge  decks, and fixing highway lighting.", "Although states and localities still spend more on highway capital  investment than the federal government, recently, state and local highway  investment has increased at a slower pace than federal highway  investment. In addition, state and local investment has decreased in real  terms three times since 1996: between 1996 and 1997, between 1999 and  2000, and between 2001 and 2002. Last year, we reported that since TEA-21  was passed, from 1998 through 2001, federal investment increased faster  than state and local investment. In real terms, federal investment  increased 29 percent, while state and local investment increased 2  percent. This trend of federal investment increasing more quickly than  state and local investment continued in 2002. From 2001 through 2002,  federal investment increased 8.5 percent, while state and local investment  decreased 5 percent in real terms. Thus, from 1998 through 2002, federal  investment increased 40 percent, while state and local investment  decreased by 4 percent. Figure 3 shows the annual federal and state and  local capital expenditures on highways during these years.", "The general trend of federal investment in highways increasing at a faster  pace than state and local investment in highways holds over a longer period  of time as well, including the period following the passage of ISTEA in  1991. Although there was some variation on a year-by-year basis, from 1991,  when ISTEA was enacted, through 2002, state and local investment  increased 23 percent, from $29.0 to $35.7 billion in real terms. During that  same time period, federal investment increased 47 percent, from $20.9 to  $30.7 billion in real terms, as shown in figure 4.", "Although the reasons for this change in spending patterns by level of  government are unclear, tough economic times, with a majority of states  needing to reduce spending to avoid budget deficits, along with large  increases in federal funds for highways may have influenced these  spending patterns. For example, a recent survey of states by the National  Conference of State Legislatures found that even after the economy began  growing after the March 2001 national recession, 36 states still have budget  shortfalls with a cumulative gap of about $25.7 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evidence Suggests Federal Highway Grants Have Increasingly Been Used to Substitute for Rather Than Supplement Spending from States\u2019 Own Resources", "paragraphs": ["The preponderance of evidence suggests that increases in federal-aid  highway grants influence state and local governments to substitute federal  funds for funding they would have otherwise spent on highway projects  from their own resources. We built on earlier studies to develop a model  that analyzed data from 1982 through 2000 to examine whether and to what  extent states have substituted increases in federal highway funds for state  highway funds. Our preferred model analyzes data from 1983 through 2000  because of the statistical techniques we used. Our analysis suggests that  significant substitution has occurred and that the rate of grant substitution  increased significantly over the past two decades, rising from 18 percent in  the early 1980s to about 60 percent during the 1990s\u2014the periods that  ISTEA and TEA-21 were in effect. Three previous studies of this issue also  found that substitution existed, although their estimates of levels of  substitution varied. The structure of the federal grant system as a whole  may encourage substitution. Specifically, the structure of the federal-aid  highway program creates an opportunity for substitution because states  typically spend substantially more in state and local funds than is required  to meet current federal matching requirements. As a consequence, when  federal funding increases, states are able to reduce their own highway  spending and yet obtain the increased federal funds. If states substitute  some of the increase in federal funds for their own funds, then total  highway spending may increase, but not by as much as it would have had  substitution not occurred."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Our Statistical Model Suggests Federal Highway Funds Have Increasingly Been Substituted for State Funds That Were Shifted to Nonhighway Uses", "paragraphs": ["Our statistical model, which we developed from previous models,  estimates that states have used a significant portion of increases in federal  highway funding to substitute for state and local funding for highways, and  that the rate of substitution increased during the 1990s. According to our  preferred model, for the entire period from 1983 through 2000, state  governments used roughly half of the increases in federal highway grants to  substitute for funding they would have otherwise spent from their own  resources on highways. When our model examined four separate time  periods from 1983 through 2000 that corresponded to the four  authorization periods for the federal-aid highway program, the results  suggest that the rate of grant substitution increased in the 1990s, during the  periods in which ISTEA and TEA-21 were in effect, in comparison to the  early 1980s. Specifically, our model suggests that states substituted  approximately 18 cents (not statistically significant) of every dollar  increase in federal aid from 1983 to 1986 for funds they would have spent  on highways from their own resources. Our model suggests that the  substitution rate rose to approximately 36 cents of every dollar increase in  federal aid for the period from 1987 to 1991, and that the substitution rates  then rose again to approximately 60 cents for every dollar increase in  federal aid for the two periods examined in the 1990s: 1992 through 1997  and 1998 through 2000. (See fig. 5.)", "The rates of grant substitution for the time periods reported in figure 5 are  derived from our statistical model of state spending choices and are subject  to some uncertainty. While these estimates represent our most likely  estimates of the rate at which states substituted federal funds for state and  local funds, the actual substitution may be larger or smaller than these  estimates. The uncertainty surrounding our estimates can be expressed in  terms of a level of confidence that a given range of values encompasses the  actual substitution rate. The range of values surrounding each of our  estimates is shown in table 2 at a 95 percent level of confidence. The size of  each interval provides a sense of the uncertainty associated with our  estimates. The intervals associated with the two time periods during the  1980s contain possible values of zero, meaning that we cannot be 95  percent confident that substitution occurred during these periods. In  contrast, the range of estimates for both time periods in the 1990s does not  encompass zero; therefore, they are statistically different from zero, which  means that our results imply at least a 95 percent level of confidence that  substitution occurred. Our most likely estimates for the two periods we  looked at in the 1990s are in both cases just under 60 percent, and we can  be 95 percent confident that the actual substitution rate was between 21  percent and 97 percent.", "These results are roughly consistent with previous studies that, when taken  together, also seem to suggest increasing substitution rates over time. We  made four primary enhancements to the models used in previous studies in  developing our model. First, we used more recent data on highway  expenditures than were available for previous studies. Second, we used a  conservative definition of substitution. Our model defined substitution as  occurring only when, in response to increased federal highway funds, state  and local funds were moved out of highway-related projects altogether. We  did not consider it substitution if in response to increased federal highway  funds, state and local funds were moved from highway projects that were  eligible for federal aid to highway projects that were not eligible for federal  aid. Third, our model is structured to examine substitution rates over time,  rather than being limited to one estimate covering all the years included in  our study. Finally, compared to previous studies, we employed a more  comprehensive collection of factors related to state spending decisions.", "Combined, we believe these enhancements increase the ability of our  model to provide a conservative and more reliable estimate of the extent to  which states substitute federal highway aid for spending that would  otherwise have come from state and local resources. However, all  estimates that are based on statistical models, particularly of complex  processes such as the determination of states\u2019 budget choices, are subject  to uncertainty. This uncertainty can derive from both choices about what  factors to include in a model and the inherent impreciseness in estimating  relationships between one factor\u2014in this case federal highway grants\u2014 and another, state and local highway spending. While we have attempted to  take many factors affecting state spending decisions into account, there  may be other factors that are not subject to precise measurement, such as  the influence of citizen and interest groups on states\u2019 funding decisions,  that could not be included in our analysis. As a result of the uncertainty in  both the data and the statistical formulation of our model, the precision of  our estimate, or any other estimate, is limited and our estimate should be  considered one point in a range within which the actual extent of  substitution falls, and one piece of a body of evidence on the existence of  substitution. (See app. II for additional details on our statistical model.)", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOT officials said that to the  extent substitution occurred and increased during the 1990s, it was likely  due to a number of factors, including changes in states\u2019 revenues and  priorities. While our analysis specifically took changing economic  conditions into account when assessing state spending choices,  determining specific causes is beyond the scope of our statistical model.  For example, states faced rising demands for health care and education  during the 1980s and early 1990s that they may have funded, in part, by  reducing their own levels of highway funding effort when federal highway  funding increased. Accordingly, our model establishes an association  between substitution and increases in federal highway grants; it does not  identify the specific causes responsible for these rising rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Earlier Studies Found That Federal Grants Reduced States\u2019 Highway Spending, Although Substitution Estimates Varied", "paragraphs": ["Three other studies, including two published in the past 3 years, have  reported that states substituted additional federal highway spending for  state spending.

The wide range of estimates is  the result of different time periods examined, different definitions of  substitution, and differences in the statistical methods employed.", "A study by Brian Knight, which, of the three studies, included the most  recent data, found that from 1983 through 1997, roughly 90 percent of  increased federal aid was substituted for state highway spending. Knight  used a different definition of substitution than we used in our study. Knight  defined substitution as occurring when, in response to increased federal  highway funds, state funds were moved out of highway-related projects. He  did not take into account local spending on highways, which might possibly  have mitigated the reduction in state funds.", "Another study, by Shama Gamkhar, analyzed data from 1976 through 1990  using two different measures of federal grants. Gamkhar reported an  average substitution rate of 63 percent when measuring federal grants  through grant expenditures (the same measure of federal grants used by  the other studies, including our model) and an average substitution rate of  22 percent when measuring federal grants through grant obligations.  Gamkhar defined substitution the same way our model did, as when, in  response to increased federal highway funds, state and local funds were  moved out of highway-related projects altogether.", "A study by Harry G. Meyers examined data from 1976 through 1982, and  modeled substitution based on two different definitions of substitution.  Using a definition of substitution similar to the definition employed in our  model, the study found no evidence of substitution during this period.  Meyers also modeled the substitution rate based on a different definition of  substitution, defining substitution as occurring when state funds were  moved out of federal-aid highway projects, even if those funds were used  for highway projects that were ineligible for federal aid. Using this  definition of substitution, the study found a substitution rate of 63 percent.  The findings of these studies and GAO\u2019s results are summarized in figure 6.  In this figure, we placed next to our finding the findings of the three models  that used the same measure of federal grants and the same or a similar  definition of substitution that we did, organizing these chronologically.", "As can be seen from this figure, generally, those studies with the same or  similar definitions of substitution as our model also suggest that  substitution rates may have increased over time. Specifically, Meyers  reported no evidence of substitution into nonhighway spending from 1976  through 1982; Gamkhar, based on data through 1990, reported higher rates  of substitution; and Knight, based on data through 1997, reported even  higher rates of substitution, although using a somewhat different definition  of substitution. Our model also found evidence of such a trend."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structure of the Federal Grant System in General May Encourage Substitution", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, we reported that the federal grant system as a whole does not  encourage states to use federal dollars to supplement their own spending  but rather results in states using federal grants to substitute for their own  spending. In summarizing research over the past 30 years for a wide  variety of federal grant programs, we reported that each additional dollar  of federal grant funding substitutes for between 11 and 74 cents of funding  states otherwise would have spent. On balance, we found that for every  dollar of additional federal aid, states have withdrawn about 60 cents of  their own funding.", "Our 1996 study found that federal grant programs produced a variety of  fiscal effects, in part depending on the grant program\u2019s structure. For  example, grants are considered \u201copen-ended\u201d when there is no limit on  federal matching, and \u201cclosed-ended\u201d when total federal matching funds  are capped. The influence of federal matching is essentially the same for  both types of grants until a state obtains the maximum federal contribution  for a closed-ended grant. After this point, closed-ended grants no longer  provide additional matching funds in response to additional state spending.  This lack of additional federal matching funds reduces the incentive for  states to increase their own spending on aided activities. As a result, we  found that open-ended grant programs, for example, Foster Care, Adoption  Assistance and Medicaid, generally stimulated additional spending from  state resources because the more states spent of their own resources, the  more federal resources they would obtain. In contrast, closed-ended  matching grant programs, such as the federal-aid highway program, which  place a limit on the total amount of federal funds that states can receive  through meeting matching requirements, as well as programs that do not  require states to contribute matching funds to receive federal funds, were  associated with higher rates of grant substitution and stimulated less  additional spending on the aided activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structure of Federal-Aid Highway Program Creates an Opportunity for Substitution", "paragraphs": ["The federal-aid highway program is particularly susceptible to substitution  because in general the current matching requirement for states is not high  enough to require states to maintain or increase their spending in order to  receive increases in federal funds. In most cases, the federal-aid highway  program requires that the federal contribution be no more than 80 percent  of the total cost of the project, while the state\u2019s matching contribution be at  least 20 percent. If the federal highway program worked to stimulate state  spending, this might suggest that every $1.00 increase in federal funds  would result in a total spending increase of $1.25 ($1.00 is 80 percent of  $1.25), $0.25 of which would be funded with state and local government  funds ($0.25 is 20 percent of $1.25). However, because in most cases state  funding already exceeds the required state matching contribution, often by  large amounts, states are not required to increase or even maintain their  level of funding for projects in order to receive increases in federal funds.", "Several studies have demonstrated that state highway spending  substantially exceeds federal matching requirements. The earliest study we  reviewed found that, during the 1960s, 38 percent of aggregate state capital  spending for noninterstate federal-aid highways was in excess of federal  matching requirements. This study found that for the large majority of  states, state spending on federal-aid highway system projects exceeded  federal matching requirements by more than 10 percent. Another study  found that in 1982, state spending on federal-aid highway system projects  exceeded the required federal match by more than 19 percent. Other  studies that have analyzed the fiscal effects of federal highway aid have  also reported that state spending typically exceeds federal matching  requirements.", "In general, states continue to spend more than their required match on  federal-aid highway projects. In 2000, the most recent year for which data  are available for federal-aid highways, states accounted for approximately  49 percent of all federal-aid-eligible highway capital spending, which is  over twice the required 20 percent match on most federal-aid highway  projects. Figure 7 shows the variation among states in their highway  capital spending as a percent of total (federal plus state and local) highway  capital spending during the period from 1997 through 2000. Although these  data include spending on nonfederal-aid-eligible highways and therefore  can not be used to determine precisely to what extent states are exceeding  federal matching requirements, they show that in the majority of states,  state and local spending counts for over half of total capital highway  spending."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Substitution May Be Limiting the Effectiveness of Strategies to Accomplish the Federal-Aid Highway Program\u2019s Overall Goals", "paragraphs": ["The trends in funding and probable substitution described in this report  imply that substitution may be limiting the effectiveness of strategies  Congress has put into place to help the federal-aid highway program  accomplish its overall goals.

In  establishing the Interstate Highway System, Congress, in the Federal-Aid  Highway Act of 1956, stated that the Interstate system was to serve  principal metropolitan areas and industrial centers, support the national  defense, and connect with routes of continental importance in Canada and  Mexico. Current law defines the primary focus of the federal-aid highway  program as completion and expansion of the National Highway System, of  which the Interstate is a part, to provide interconnected routes that serve,  among other things, major population centers, international border  crossings, commercial ports, airports, and major travel destinations. \u201c\u2026among the foremost needs that the surface transportation system must meet to provide  for a strong and vigorous national economy are safe, efficient, and reliable (i) national and  interregional personal mobility (including personal mobility in rural and urban areas) and  reduced congestion; (ii) flow of interstate and international commerce and freight  transportation; and (iii) travel movements essential for national security.\u201d", "To meet the program\u2019s goals, Congress has set out a number of strategies,  including increasing investment in highways and providing states flexibility  to best meet their transportation needs.

Since 1991,  Congress has provided significant increases in federal spending on  highways. ISTEA\u2019s authorization of $121 billion for highways for the 6-year  period from fiscal years 1992 through 1997 was a 73 percent increase over  the $70 billion authorized in the prior 6-year bill, and TEA-21\u2019s  authorization of $171 billion for the federal-aid highway program from  fiscal years 1998 through 2003 represented an increase of 41 percent over  ISTEA\u2019s authorization level. In 2004, the House and Senate each approved  separate legislation to reauthorize the federal-aid highway program,  increases of 32 percent and 50 percent over TEA-21, respectively. Despite  these increases, numerous congressional transportation leaders stated that  these increases were not enough, and that further spending was required to  meet the country\u2019s needs.", "Congress has also included features in the design of the federal-aid  highway program to attempt to ensure that funds collected by the federal  government for highways are used for that purpose. Prior to 1956, federal  fuel and motor vehicle taxes were directed to the General Fund of the U.S.  Treasury, and there was no relationship between the receipts from these  taxes and federal funding for highways. Amid concerns that federal taxes  on motor fuel were being used for nontransportation purposes, Congress  established the Highway Trust Fund in 1956 and specifically provided that  revenues from most highway user taxes would be used to finance the  greatly expanded highway program enacted by the Federal-Aid Highway  Act of 1956. Despite having a dedicated source of funding, highways  competed for federal funding with other forms of domestic discretionary  spending through the appropriations process over the years. As a result,  Congress often appropriated less money than was authorized, even though  sufficient funds were being collected in the Highway Trust Fund to support  the authorized levels. So Congress took further action in TEA-21,  establishing guaranteed spending levels for highway programs that  protected highway programs from having to compete for funding through  the congressional budget and appropriations process. It also established  \u201cRevenue Aligned Budget Authority,\u201d directly linking highway revenues  collected into the Highway Trust Fund with the apportionments provided  annually to the states for their highway programs.", "Despite congressional efforts to increase the federal investment in the  highway system and to ensure that funds collected by the federal  government for highways are used for that purpose, due to probable  substitution, the sizable increases in dedicated federal funding that  Congress has provided for highways have not translated into  commensurate increases in the Nation\u2019s overall investment in its highway  system. Moreover, the effectiveness of Congress\u2019 strategy to dedicate  federal funds to highways is limited because Congress has no similar ability  to prevent state and local highway funds, where most of the investment  occurs, from being used for other purposes. Therefore, while Congress can  ensure that certain federal moneys are dedicated to highways and given to  the states for that purpose, it cannot ensure that state and local highway  funds are not used for other purposes. When substitution occurs, some  dedicated federal highway funds replace state highway funds, and those  state highway funds are then used for other purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Another Strategy Has Been to Emphasize Importance of States\u2019 Priorities and Decision-making", "paragraphs": ["Congress has also sought to meet the goals of the program by emphasizing  the importance of states\u2019 priorities and decision-making regarding how to  meet their most pressing transportation needs. One way it has done so is by  incorporating return-to-origin features into the program--returning to the  states more of the money collected in fuel taxes. TEA-21\u2019s Minimum  Guarantee provisions ensure that each state receives back from most  highway programs 90.5 percent of the total estimated percentage share of  contributions to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund from  motor fuel and other taxes collected in that state. Under separate  legislation passed by both the House and Senate in 2004, this amount could  rise to 95 percent by 2009.", "In addition, Congress has given the states broad flexibility in the use of its  federal aid grant funds by providing states significant discretion to use  these funds flexibly across highway, bridge, transit, and other  transportation projects. States have, if they choose, broad flexibility in the  use of slightly more than half of their federal-aid highway funds. For  example, the Surface Transportation grant program has broad eligibility  rules, and states can use those funds for highways, bridges, transit capital  projects, bus terminals, and many other uses. States may use some of their  Minimum Guarantee Program grant funds under the same rules; in fiscal  year 2003, the funds apportioned under these two programs accounted for  one third of all federal aid highway funds apportioned nationwide. For  eight states that receive higher levels of Minimum Guarantee grant funds,  these two programs account for more than 40 percent of their funding, and  in one of these eight states, for just over 50 percent. While other federal-aid  highway grant funds have more limited uses, states have the authority to  transfer funds from these limited programs to more flexible programs and  uses. For example, states may transfer up to 50 percent of their National  Highway System and Interstate Maintenance program funds to the Surface  Transportation Program or certain other grant programs, and, in the case of  the National Highway System program, 100 percent under certain  conditions.", "Furthermore, states have broad flexibility in deciding which projects to  pick and how to implement them. The projects for which states use federal  funding must be for construction, reconstruction, and improvement on  eligible federal-aid highway routes. Nevertheless, federal law (23 U.S.C.  \u00a7145) provides that the authorization or appropriation of federal funds  \u201cshall in no way infringe on the sovereign rights of the States to determine  which projects shall be federally financed.\u201d Moreover, FHWA\u2019s role in  overseeing the design and construction of most projects is limited.  Specifically, only high cost construction or reconstruction projects on the  Interstate Highway System are always subject to \u201cfull\u201d oversight in which  FHWA prescribes design and construction standards, approves design  plans and estimates, approves contract awards, inspects construction  progress, and renders final acceptance when projects are completed. For  projects that are not located on the National Highway System, states are  required to assume oversight responsibility for the design and construction  of projects unless a state determines that it is not appropriate for it to do  so. As figure 8 shows, in 2002, about $1 out of every $5 obligated for  federal-aid projects occurred on the Interstate system, while projects off  the National Highway System accounted for about 57 percent, nearly 3  times as much.", "Substitution may be limiting the effectiveness of Congress\u2019 strategy of  emphasizing the role of states\u2019 priorities and decision-making regarding  how to meet their most pressing transportation needs.

One of the purposes of GPRA is to provide  decisionmakers a means of allocating resources to achieve desired results.  Linking resources and results will become even more important than it is  today in the years ahead, as the Nation faces a fiscal crisis in which  mandatory commitments to Social Security and Medicare will consume a  greater share of the Nation\u2019s resources, squeezing the funding available for  discretionary programs, potentially including highways. These challenges  require the Nation to think critically about all existing government  programs and commitments.", "Among its performance goals, DOT has articulated goals for mobility and  economic growth, including to improve the condition of the transportation  system, reduce travel times, and increase access to and reliability of the  transportation system. Two major performance measures related to the  federal-aid highway program are to (1) improve the percentage of travel on  the National Highway System meeting pavement performance standards  for acceptable ride and (2) slow the growth of congestion--in particular, to  limit the annual growth of urban area travel time under congested  conditions to one-fifth of 1 percent below the growth that has been  projected. These goals are shown in figure 9.", "Although DOT has articulated performance measures, the federal-aid  highway program does not have the mechanisms to link funding levels with  the accomplishment of specific performance-related goals and outcomes.  In contrast, NHTSA has some incentive grant programs that link funding to  particular outcomes, such as increasing the use of seat belts within states.  As we have reported, although a variety of tools are available to measure  the costs and benefits of transportation projects, they often do not drive  investment decisions, and many political and other factors influence  project selections. For example, the law in one state requires that most  highway funds, including federal funds, be distributed equally across all the  state\u2019s congressional districts.

The first  two options are designed to stimulate additional state spending on  highways, while the third option is designed so that increased federal  funding will supplement state spending rather than replace it. These  objectives may not be perfectly achieved because models of substitution,  like any models, produce estimates that are subject to uncertainty. As such,  there is no way to objectively determine with certainty what states would  have spent in the absence of increased federal funding. Table 3 summarizes  the options, along with possible approaches that could be taken in  implementing them.", "Each of these options and approaches would be likely to have somewhat  different effects and would require careful consideration of various factors.  Some possible effects are summarized below; see appendix IV for  additional discussion of these options.", "The likely effect of revising the matching requirement would depend on  the magnitude of the change. For example, if the requirement was  changed so that states generally had to provide 60 percent of the total  funding for eligible projects, states currently spending less than 60  percent of total highway funds for eligible projects would have an  incentive to increase their spending in order to obtain the maximum  federal match, while those spending more than 60 percent would not  have an incentive to increase their spending. A few states with a low  state/federal spending ratio might have to more than double their  current spending in order to receive additional federal funds. Setting the  required match at 40 percent would give fewer states an incentive to  increase their spending and would generally require less of an increase  in spending from those states with low state/federal spending ratios. An  advantage of continuing to set the state match at 20 percent but  counting only state spending in excess of what each state spent during a  base time period towards the match is that it would stimulate state  spending in all states to a similar degree.", "Using funding formulas that link federal funds to states\u2019 highway  funding effort could also be achieved through various approaches. For  example, providing federal funds to states proportionally based on their  effort in comparison to the average effort of all states would put states  in competition with each other, rewarding states whose funding effort is  already high and penalizing states whose funding effort is currently low.  On the other hand, providing federal funds to states proportionally  based on each state\u2019s own effort during an initial base time period would  put each state in competition with the funding effort it made in the base  period, rewarding states whose spending grew more quickly in  comparison to their spending during the base period and penalizing  states whose spending stayed the same or dropped when compared to  their spending during the base period. Such provisions could be  designed so they could be suspended in a recession or severe economic  downturn in order to prevent states from having to make  disproportionate reductions in other state services to maintain highway  funding.", "Instituting a maintenance of effort provision would require each state to  continue to spend what it spent in a defined base period, plus inflation,  in order to obtain increased federal funds. Therefore, it would not  stimulate state spending, but it would attempt to ensure that states used  federal funds to supplement rather than replace state and local funds. In  previous work, we concluded that, to be effective, maintenance of effort  provisions need to define a minimum level of state spending effort that  can be objectively quantified and updated to keep pace with inflation in  program costs so that the maintenance of effort provision ensures a  continued level of activity when measured in inflation adjusted dollars.

But devolving funding responsibilities to  the states would not require abandoning the program\u2019s regulatory  component. Some federal laws and requirements in place originated  outside the transportation program and would doubtless remain in force,  such as civil rights compliance. Others that are currently part of the  transportation program could also remain in effect. Depending on  priorities, these could continue to be overseen by FHWA directly or a  process could be established through which states certify their compliance  with the requirements, as is done in other programs. In this manner, it  would be possible to enforce these laws and requirements without an  extensive field structure, as other federal agencies and programs do.", "Devolving authority to the states could also take the form of devolving not  only the federal programs, but the revenue sources that support it.  Considerable federal effort goes into collecting and accounting for motor  fuel taxes and other highway user fees. One argument for maintaining a  federal fuel tax is that this tax may be a useful public policy to prevent tax  competition between states to avoid the disinvestment in the highway  system that could potentially result. Such a \u201cturnback\u201d provision was  considered in the form of an amendment to TEA-21 in the House of  Representatives in 1998, but it did not pass.", "Devolving federal responsibilities to the states is not dissimilar to the  Surface Transportation System Performance Pilot Program that was  proposed in the administration\u2019s reauthorization proposal, but which was  not included in either the House or Senate version of the bill.

DOT officials also stated that  while they recognize that federal-aid highway grants can influence state  and local governments to substitute federal funds for state and local funds  that otherwise might have been spent on highways, they believe that this  substitution is likely due to numerous factors. Specifically, the officials said  that to the extent substitution occurred and increased during the 1990s, it  was also likely due to changes in states\u2019 revenues and priorities. DOT  officials also emphasized that regardless of changes in the availability of  state funds for highway programs, the overall federal share of capital  spending on highways declined during the period we studied, from over 55  percent in the early 1980s to around 45 percent today. DOT officials also  emphasized that there is no evidence that the substitution discussed in our  report resulted in the diversion of federal-aid highway funds apportioned to  the states.

We also  agree with DOT officials that many factors influence state budgetary  decisions, including changing state budget priorities and the availability of  state revenues. It was for this reason that we used a statistical model that  specifically took changing economic conditions and revenues into account  in order to better isolate the effect of federal grants on state spending  choices. We believe that our model has reasonably distinguished between  the effects of changing economic conditions and revenues and the effect of  federal grants, and, consistent with earlier models and studies, we found  the relationship between federal grants and state spending, indicating  substitution, to be statistically significant, particularly during the 1990s.  However, determining specific causes of substitution is beyond the scope  of our statistical model. For example, while states faced rising demands for  health care and education during the 1980s and 1990s that could have  resulted in states reducing their highway spending when federal highway  funding increased, our model does not identify the specific causes  responsible for rising substitution rates. Although DOT officials said that  the overall federal share of capital spending on highways declined during  the period we studied, these relative shares do not affect our findings on  substitution since substitution can occur when the federal share of funding  is either rising or falling; if substitution occurs when state funding is rising  it simply means that state spending increased less than the increase that  might have occurred had there been no substitution. While DOT officials  stated that there is no evidence that substitution resulted in the diversion of  federal-aid highway funds, there are important differences between  diversion and substitution. In the context in which DOT officials raised it,  diversion is the transfer of federal funds for purposes other than those  authorized by law, while substitution, as we have reported it, is the transfer  of state funds that would have otherwise been spent on highways. States  can both use federal funds for the purposes authorized by law and at the  same time substitute federal funds for state funds. Thus, while we agree  that there is no evidence that substitution resulted in the diversion of  federal-aid highway funds, we do not believe our report suggests the  existence of such evidence.", "Finally, we agree with DOT officials that states\u2019 flexibility and FHWA\u2019s role  are important factors in the federal-aid highway program; however, we  believe that options for changing the design, structure, and funding  mechanisms of the federal-aid highway program should be considered in  light of substitution and the issues raised in this report, and that a variety of  factors, including but not limited to these two, should be weighed when  considering such changes. While the department took no position on the  matter for congressional consideration to expand the mandate of the  proposed National Commission, officials did state that they believe these  issues merit further study. We continue to believe that Congress has the  opportunity to maximize the effectiveness of federal funding and promote  national goals and strategies by expanding the proposed mandate of the  National Commission to consider these issues.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Norman Mineta,  Secretary of Transportation.

We responded to  the first part of your request in June 2003. This report (1) updates  information on trends in federal, state, and local capital investment in  highways; (2) assesses the influence that federal-aid highway grants have  had on state and local highway spending; (3) discusses the implications of  these issues on the federal-aid highway program; and (4) discusses options  for the federal-aid highway program that could be considered in light of  these issues. In addition, this report identifies characteristics associated  with differences among states\u2019 levels of effort for highways (see app. III).", "To update information on federal, state, and local capital investment in  highways, we obtained 2002 (the most recent year available) expenditure  data from the Federal Highway Administration.

Our literature review revealed a number of studies  that used statistical models to estimate the influence of federal funding on  state spending. These models examined different time periods, employed  different statistical methods, and considered different potential social,  demographic, economic, and political factors that may affect state highway  spending decisions. None of the models used in the studies we reviewed  included the most recent data now available on highway funding, and none  examined whether the effect of federal grants on state spending changed  during the time period covered in the study. Therefore, based on the  models used in the earlier studies, we developed our own statistical model  of state highway capital and maintenance outcomes to estimate the fiscal  effects of federal highway funding on state highway spending. The purpose  of our statistical model was to isolate the effect of federal grants on  highway spending in states by controlling for other factors that affect state  spending decisions. Our model therefore considered a wide range of  potential factors such as economic conditions and the size of a state\u2019s  highway system, that may affect state spending choices. In addition, our  model included the most recent data available and examined whether the  effect of federal grants on state spending changed during the time period.  A more detailed description of the literature and our statistical model is  contained in appendix II.

These  experts and authors generally agreed with our methods, and we made  revisions based on their comments as appropriate.", "To address the implications of the effect of federal highway grants on state  and local highway spending and options raised by these implications, we  reviewed pertinent legislation and congressional actions affecting the  federal-aid highway program, including goals, funding trends, program  features, and financing mechanisms. We reviewed the Government  Performance and Results Act and DOT\u2019s strategic and performance plans  and reports for 2003 and 2004.

We determined a multivariate analysis is required so that  other factors, in addition to the state characteristic under consideration,  can be taken into account and held constant.

As a result, the models characterize the  demand for and supply of highway spending as depending on four types of  factors: 1. Fiscal capacity (FC), which is the ability of states to fund services using  2. The tax price (TP) faced by the typical voter/consumer of highway  services, which can be thought of as the cost of an additional unit of  mobility;  3.", "Intergovernmental grant funding (G), including both grants intended  for highways and grants for other public services; and  4. Differences in voter/consumer preferences (P) for highway  transportation services.", "This relationship can be summarized in the following relationship: State Highway Expenditure = f(FC,TP, G, P)", "In these models, greater tax paying capacity is expected to result in a  higher demand for mobility that in turn increases the demand for a larger  highway network. Similarly, more grant funding (both for highways as well  as for other public services) increases the resources available to states and  is expected to increase total highway spending. Differences in political  culture are also expected to result in different preferences for  transportation services relative to other public services, such as health and  education. Finally, if the typical voter/consumer faces a higher unit cost of  transportation services, also called the tax price of highway services, the  demand for transportation services is likely to be lower.", "The tax price of highway services is, in turn, dependent upon several  factors:  1. A higher cost of inputs (labor, building materials, supplies, etc.) used to  build and maintain highways results in more expensive transportation  services. A higher unit cost of mobility is expected to reduce the  demand for transportation services, but will increase highway spending  as long as the demand for transportation services is price inelastic. 2. Economies and/or diseconomies of scale may also affect the unit cost  of mobility. A required minimum facility size may result in more lane  miles per resident in smaller states, which may result in a higher unit  cost for the typical voter/consumer. Similarly, very low lane miles per  resident may be associated with more intensive usage, which may also  result in a higher unit cost as well. Thus, unit cost may be U-shaped.  3. A greater number of voter/consumers with whom the cost of highway  services may be shared is expected to reduce unit cost to the typical  state voter, increasing the demand for transportation services. This will  result in higher total highway spending and lower spending per voter so  long as demand is price inelastic.  4. More highway users may lead to greater deterioration in the quality of  highways and greater congestion, raising the unit cost of transportation  services to the typical voter/consumer, reducing the demand for  highway services. The effect on spending is expected to be positive if  demand is price inelastic. In addition to cost considerations, more  users could also be thought of as reflecting a stronger preference for  highway services relative to other goods and services. 5. Matching grants on the marginal dollar of highway spending reduce the  unit cost of services to the typical voter/consumer. To the extent that  matching requirements apply to additional state spending the typical  voter/consumer pays a smaller share of additional spending, lowering  the cost of additional spending to the typical voter/consumer and  raising the demand for highway services.", "In table 4, we summarize three studies that are representative of the variety  of models that have been considered in the literature and upon which we  base our analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statistical Methods", "paragraphs": ["The three studies employ a variety of statistical methods in estimating the  substitution effect of federal highway grants.

The matching requirement,  therefore, does not provide states with an incentive to increase or even  maintain their level of funding in order to receive additional federal funds.  Instead, states are free to substitute federal funds for funds they would  have spent from their own resources and to use their own funds in other  ways.", "For the matching requirement to leverage additional state spending, the  states\u2019 matching portion would have to be set high enough so that states  would not receive additional federal funds without spending beyond what  they would have otherwise spent without additional federal assistance.

If increases of this magnitude were deemed too extreme, a more  moderate increase in the state match could be established. For example,  raising the state matching share to 40 percent instead of 60 percent would  require smaller funding increases in states whose state and local spending  is currently a smaller proportion of the total highway spending, but it  would also reduce the number of states that would be required to increase  their level of funding in response to increased federal funding.", "Another drawback of simply increasing state matching requirements is that  even substantial increases in the requirements (raising the required state  match from 20 percent to 60 percent) would not be likely to leverage  additional state spending in all states. An alternative that would increase  the likelihood of leveraging additional state spending in all states would be  to continue with the 80 percent federal/20 percent state matching ratio but  stipulate that only state spending in excess of what the state had spent for  highways in an appropriate base time period be counted against its federal  matching requirement. This approach has the advantage of maintaining the  current 20 percent state matching rate, yet provides a leveraging incentive  in all states rather than in only those states with below average spending.

In this approach, each state\u2019s highway  funding effort would be compared to its own effort during an initial time  period, such as the year (or an appropriate average of years) prior to  initiation of the set aside. For example, all states could be awarded the  same per capita grant amount in the first year of the set-aside program.  Then, in future years, each state\u2019s funding effort would be compared to its  own funding effort in the first year of the set aside program and adjusted  accordingly. Each state whose funding effort increased compared to the  initial base year would receive an increase in federal funding proportionate  to the increase in its own spending. Such an approach would, in effect, put  each state in competition with the effort it made in the base period. If both  approaches to rewarding state highway funding effort were deemed  desirable, a combination of the two approaches could be employed.
