These challenges were also highlighted by numerous experts GAO interviewed and in documents GAO reviewed. Although the Global AIDS Coordinator's Office has begun to address these challenges, resolving some challenges requires additional effort, longer-term solutions, and the support of others involved in providing ARV treatment. First, the Office has taken steps to improve U.S. coordination and acknowledged the need to collaborate with others, but it is too soon to tell whether these efforts will be effective. Second, to address policy constraints, U.S. agencies are working to enhance contracting capacity in the field and resolve differences on procurement, foreign taxation of U.S. assistance, and auditing of non-U.S. grantees. However, the Office's guidance did not address key issues related to the use of PEPFAR funds to buy certain ARV drugs. Third, the Office has proposed short-term solutions to the health worker shortage, such as using U.S. and other international volunteers for training and technical assistance; however, agency field officials said that using such volunteers is not cost effective. The Office is discussing with other donors certain longer-term interventions. Fourth, the Office has taken steps to encourage host countries' commitment to fight HIV/AIDS, but it is not addressing systemic challenges outside its authority, such as poor delineation of roles among government bodies. Finally, the Office is taking steps to improve data collection and reporting and better manage drug supplies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2003, the President announced an unprecedented 5-year  initiative to combat the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. The President\u2019s  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), as authorized through the U.S.  Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria Act of 2003 (the U.S.  Leadership Act), nearly triples the U.S. financial commitment to  addressing the disease and targets $9 billion in new funding to dramatically  expand prevention, treatment, and care efforts in 14 of the world\u2019s most  severely affected countries. The administration\u2019s strategy establishes the  goal of supplying antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to 2 million HIV-infected  people, preventing 7 million new HIV infections, and providing care to 10  million people infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, including orphans. The  strategy also seeks to streamline the U.S. approach to global HIV/AIDS  treatment by coordinating and deploying U.S. agencies and resources  through a single entity, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (the  Coordinator\u2019s Office), created in January 2004, within the Department of  State. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are primarily responsible  for implementing PEPFAR overseas.", "Whereas previous U.S. programs focused mainly on preventing HIV/AIDS,  PEPFAR proposes that the U.S. government commit significantly greater  resources to providing treatment for those infected by the virus.

We  coded the responses to our open-ended interview questions using a set of  analytical categories we developed. We also reviewed numerous  documents analyzing treatment programs from U.S. government agencies,  U.N. organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGO), including  reports by medical experts and practitioners. We also interviewed U.S.- based officials from USAID and HHS; representatives from multilateral  organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint  United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Bank, and the  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global Fund); and medical  experts experienced in treating people with HIV/AIDS in resource-poor  settings. To assess the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator\u2019s approach to  coordinating the U.S. response to these challenges, we reviewed the  February 2004 PEPFAR 5-year strategy, administration guidance, and  information on the emerging structure and initial activities of the  Coordinator\u2019s Office. We also interviewed officials from the Coordinator\u2019s  Office, USAID, and HHS.

In the 1990s, medical experts found that new forms of  treatment, involving a combination of three drugs, were effective in  suppressing the virus and thus slowing progression to illness and death.  According to medical experts, data from Brazil, Uganda, and Haiti showed  that patients in resource-poor settings adhere well to this complex drug  regimen. Adherence to ARV treatment is important: if patients do not take  the drugs properly or consistently, the virus in their bodies may become  resistant to the drugs and the drugs will cease to be effective. The  treatment must continue for life.", "Since 2000, the price of ARV drugs has dropped considerably, from a high  of more than $10,000 per person per year to a few hundred dollars or less  per person annually, owing in part to the increased availability of generic  ARV drugs and public pressure. In addition, some generic manufacturers  have combined three drugs in one pill\u2014known as fixed-dose combinations,  or FDCs\u2014thereby reducing the number of pills that patients must take at  one time. While major multilateral and other donors allow recipients of  their funding to purchase these FDCs, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS  Coordinator currently funds only the purchase of drugs that have been approved by a \u201cstringent regulatory authority,\u201d citing concerns about the  quality of drugs that have not demonstrated safety and efficacy to such an  authority. Presently, only brand-name drugs meet this standard. As a  result, the Coordinator\u2019s Office does not now fund the purchase of generic  ARV drugs, including FDCs. However, on May 16, 2004, the HHS Secretary  announced an expedited process for reviewing data submitted to the  HHS/Food and Drug Administration (HHS/FDA) on the safety, efficacy, and  quality of generic and other ARV drugs, including FDCs, intended for use  under PEPFAR.", "To date, only more developed countries have offered ARV treatment on a  massive scale. The planned expansion of treatment to millions of people in  developing countries under PEPFAR coincides with international efforts to  increase the availability of treatment to HIV-infected people in poor  countries. These efforts include the launch of the Global Fund in January  2002 and a campaign by WHO, announced in 2003 on December 1 (World  AIDS Day), to provide access to ARV treatment to 3 million people by the  end of 2005, commonly referred to as the \u201c3 by 5\u201d campaign. (See app. III  for more information on global, including U.S., HIV/AIDS funding.)   PEPFAR\u2019s goal is to initiate ARV treatment for nearly 2 million people in the  14 targeted countries by 2008. As of February 2004, a total of 78,921 people,  or about 4 percent of that goal, were receiving ARV treatment in these  countries (see fig. 1). On April 25, 2004, to synchronize international  efforts, the Global AIDS Coordinator and his counterparts from UNAIDS,  the World Bank, the Global Fund, and other bilateral donors voiced their  support for an international agreement to abide by the following principles:  (1) that there be one agreed-upon framework for coordinating HIV/AIDS  activities among all donors and other partners in each recipient country;  (2) that each recipient country have one national AIDS coordinating  authority; and (3) that each recipient country have one system for  monitoring and evaluating AIDS programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PEPFAR Builds on Earlier U.S. Efforts to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally", "paragraphs": ["PEPFAR builds on U.S. bilateral efforts begun in June 2002 under another  presidential initiative that focused on preventing mother-to-child  transmission (PMTCT) of HIV during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and  breastfeeding. This $500 million initiative, formally known as the  International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, and more  commonly referred to as the PMTCT Initiative, focused on the same 14  countries as PEPFAR. According to administration officials, the countries  were selected based on the severity of their HIV/AIDS burden, the extent to  which they have a substantial U.S. government presence, the effectiveness  of their leadership, and foreign policy considerations. The initiative focuses  on treatment and care for HIV-infected pregnant women and provides a  short course of ARV treatment that has been shown to be 50 percent  effective in lowering the risk of transmission of the virus in breast-feeding  mothers. With the establishment of the Coordinator\u2019s Office, PMTCT  Initiative funding and activities were included in PEPFAR.

The Coordinator plays an overall coordinating role,  and the State Department raises HIV/AIDS issues through diplomatic  channels and public relations campaigns. USAID maintains overseas  missions in 12 of the 14 PEPFAR focus countries, with personnel trained in  procurement and managing grants to foreign entities; it works with NGOs  and other entities.

HHS/CDC provides  clinicians, epidemiologists, and other medical experts who generally work  directly with foreign governments, health institutions, and other entities.  Within HHS, PEPFAR also draws on expertise from the National Institutes  of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is  involved in HIV/AIDS research in PEPFAR focus countries; the Health  Resources and Services Administration, which has experience expanding  HIV/AIDS and other health services in resource-poor settings in the United  States and is providing some assistance in several PEPFAR focus countries;  and the Office of the Secretary/Office of Global Health Affairs, which plays  a coordinating role on HIV/AIDS within HHS. Other agencies involved in  PEPFAR are the Department of Defense, which works on HIV/AIDS issues  with foreign militaries, helps construct health facilities, and conducts some  research and program activities in PEPFAR focus countries; the Peace  Corps; and the Departments of Labor and Commerce, which are involved in  HIV/AIDS-related activities in the workplace and with the private sector,  respectively.

The Coordinator has been granted authority to transfer and  allocate the funds appropriated to his office among the U.S. agencies  implementing PEPFAR in the 14 focus countries and additional bilateral  HIV/AIDS programs in other countries. The U.S. Leadership Act authorizing  PEPFAR states that not less than 55 percent of the amount appropriated  pursuant to section 401 of the act is to be spent on treatment and that at  least three-quarters of that amount should be spent on the purchase and  distribution of ARV drugs for fiscal years 2006 through 2008.

One of the most  commonly cited challenges dealt with host governments\u2019 perceptions. Field  staff said that host government officials are often skeptical of donors\u2019  intentions and may question the commitment of donors and the  sustainability of new treatment programs, especially when they think that  donors are promoting programs that run counter to their national  strategies. Similarly, an NGO official working with the host government in  one of the 14 PEPFAR focus countries reported that when initial funding  plans were created, U.S. field staff for the country ignored existing  government and NGO programs. The official said that the plans for this  country also did not incorporate any funding for training, which was a  stated government priority. In addition, consulting the host government  only after funding applications were completed has increased government  officials\u2019 skepticism regarding U.S. intentions and programs in this country,  according to U.S. field staff. Field staff also noted that it is difficult to  coordinate with host governments owing to the governments\u2019 limited  human resource capacity. In addition, staff are often hindered by the  governments\u2019 slow bureaucratic practices and lack of understanding of  U.S. and other donors\u2019 programs and policies. Field staff commented that  all of these problems, paired with expedited PEPFAR timelines and  consequently compressed consultation time, could increase the challenges  faced by the United States in persuading host governments to support  PEPFAR plans for expanded treatment.  Field staff generally reported the  most difficulty coordinating with host governments and multilateral  organizations (see app. VII).", "Sixteen of 28 field staff identified coordination challenges with multilateral  organizations (such as the World Bank, the Global Fund, WHO, and other  U.N. organizations), with many citing perception issues. Because of the  influx of PEPFAR funding, the United States will significantly increase its  financial investment in treatment programs, potentially causing other  donors to see themselves as overshadowed. Staff noted that before the  United States instituted the PMTCT Initiative, UNICEF was the main  implementer of these programs. According to field staff we interviewed,  when the United States expanded its own programs, UNICEF and other  donors felt \u201csteamrolled\u201d by programs that were quickly put in place by the  United States with little input from the donor community. Some U.S. staff  said that PEPFAR is replicating this unilateral approach. According to  these staff, the perception that the United States acts unilaterally is  compounded by the fact that, unlike many other donors, U.S. agencies are  not allowed to contribute money to other donors\u2019 programs or to pooled  host government funding \u201cbaskets\u201d for the health and other sectors. The  staff noted that some donors therefore indicated that the United States is  willing to create duplicative programs. Staff frequently cited the need for  the United States to work with the WHO as both the PEPFAR program and  WHO\u2019s 3-by-5 campaign begin. Staff said that such coordination is needed  to minimize overlapping efforts, confusion over standards, and the  administrative burden on host governments and other donors.", "Finally, while some staff noted that they have not had enough time to  coordinate efforts, many said that all stakeholders need to harmonize  specific aspects of treatment programs\u2014including treatment guidelines,  training schedules and materials, technical approaches, educational and  media campaigns, procurement policies, hiring and payment policies, and  the collection and reporting of data. The staff indicated that without  harmonization, unnecessary duplication and confusion could occur as  treatment programs are expanded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Field Staff Cited Challenges Coordinating with Headquarters and Other U.S. Agency Field Offices", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-four of 28 respondents cited challenges in coordinating with other  U.S. government agencies, their agency\u2019s headquarters, or the  Coordinator\u2019s Office in Washington, D.C. Twenty-two of the field staff we  interviewed told us that they face challenges coordinating with  headquarters, and 15 of 28 said that they face challenges coordinating with  other U.S. government agencies in the field. These challenges were also  cited in documents field staff prepared for the Global AIDS Coordinator.", "Field staff reported that headquarters did not coordinate with them early in  the process of developing activities for the PMTCT Initiative and PEPFAR.  For example, they expressed concern that headquarters announced  intended programs without first notifying staff in the field or giving them  the opportunity to discuss the PMTCT Initiative and PEPFAR programs  with host governments. Field staff stated that government officials in these  countries often regarded such announcements as statements of  commitment rather than intention, resulting in overly optimistic  expectations of the amounts of funding they might receive from the United  States. Also, headquarters\u2019 limited coordination with field staff has made it  more difficult for U.S. officials in-country to work with host governments,  increasing these governments\u2019 perception that the United States is  imposing programs on them rather than seeking their commitment or  concurrence, which could impede U.S. efforts to expand ARV treatment.", "In addition, when discussing coordination problems between the field and  headquarters, most field staff said that they were burdened by  administrative requirements, during both the PMTCT Initiative and the  initial stages of the PEPFAR planning. For example, eight respondents  stated that they rushed to complete multiple reporting requirements that  were often unclear or redundant. This point was also made in several  written communications from the field to the Coordinator\u2019s Office. Three  respondents stated that at the same time they were trying to work with  their agency counterparts in the field to complete integrated reporting  requests from the Coordinator\u2019s Office, they were asked by headquarters to  prepare duplicative, agency-specific reports, which further compounded  their burden. Five respondents indicated that the time spent responding to  these requests within the period allotted has directly limited their ability to  implement treatment programs.", "Just over half (15 of 28) field staff also identified coordination challenges  among agencies in the field. Most staff that raised interagency issues cited  challenges arising from the different agencies\u2019 roles\u2014for example,  HHS/CDC has traditionally provided technical assistance directly to foreign  governments through cooperative agreements, while USAID has focused  on development, primarily by managing grant agreements implemented by  NGOs. Staff further stated that as the programs become more coordinated,  challenges could arise from agencies\u2019 differing administrative procedures.  For example, agencies may have different procurement or hiring policies;  agencies entering a program area may find themselves competing with  another agency previously dominant in that area; and field staff busy with  administrative tasks and program implementation may find little time to  communicate with their field counterparts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Policy Constraints Limit Agencies\u2019 Ability to Rapidly Expand Treatment Programs", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-five of the 28 structured interview respondents identified U.S.  policy constraints as a challenge that could limit the ability of the agencies  implementing PEPFAR to rapidly expand treatment programs.

In addition, field staff raised concerns that their current  contracting capacity will not be sufficient to manage the large influx of  funds expected under PEPFAR. Further, differing laws governing the funds  appropriated to these agencies\u2014affecting procurement standards and  foreign taxation of U.S. assistance\u2014and varying grant requirements used  by the agencies may challenge their joint efforts to expand ARV treatment  programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Unclear Guidance on ARV Procurement Complicates PEPFAR\u2019s Ability to Support Country Treatment Programs", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-one respondents indicated that they had not received adequate  guidance on the procurement of ARV drugs, which makes it difficult for the  U.S. missions to plan their support of country programs. At least four of the  national programs in the PEPFAR focus countries are currently purchasing  generic ARV drugs with their own funds or with funds from the Global  Fund or other sources, and other countries are considering purchasing  them. In addition, in other PEPFAR countries, NGOs such as M\u00e9decins sans  Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) are also purchasing generic ARV  drugs. Given this situation, and the fact that USAID and HHS/CDC have  different procurement standards, one USAID official in Africa stated that  adhering to the agency\u2019s current standards, which generally require that  USAID-financed pharmaceuticals be produced in and shipped from the  United States, will present a challenge as more governments purchase  generic FDCs to boost adherence. An HHS/CDC official in the same  country stated that the host government is buying these drugs with Global  Fund money and training doctors and pharmacists to support this regimen.  He said that it would complicate the country\u2019s ability to expand treatment if  the United States is not able to support such a regimen.", "In addition, in communications to the Global AIDS Coordinator in mid- to  late-2003, U.S. government officials in several PEPFAR focus countries  requested guidance regarding local procurement of ARV drugs. A  September 18, 2003, communication from Ethiopia observed that several  local companies are poised to produce generic ARV drugs, and an October  8, 2003, communication from Uganda stated that generic drugs are  available at much lower prices than brand-name drugs. The Uganda  communication also stated that procurement of nonlocal goods or services  (e.g., U.S. brand-name ARV drugs) to implement PEPFAR will undermine  PEPFAR\u2019s goal of enhancing local capacity to fight HIV/AIDS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Field Staff Concerned That Current Contracting Capacity Is Insufficient to Manage PEPFAR Funds", "paragraphs": ["Almost half (13 of 28) of the structured interview respondents, primarily  from HHS/CDC, stated that contracting capacity in the field is a problem.

Further, a June 2003 communication summarizing lessons  learned from the PMTCT Initiative stated that HHS/CDC, which uses the  embassy contracting system, has experienced considerable delays, funding  level ceilings, and other difficulties in processing contractual transactions.  HHS/CDC uses the embassy contracting system because it does not have  contract officers in the field. The communication stated that these  difficulties raise concerns that the embassy system will not be able to  handle the number of contracts and inflow of funds needed to expand  treatment under PEPFAR.", "Two HHS/CDC respondents cited embassy spending limits as a problem.  One HHS/CDC respondent explained that the embassy in his country can  process purchase orders for up to $100,000 but that orders exceeding that  amount require additional consultation in Washington, a process that can  take 4 to 6 months. He added that the $100,000 ceiling will be reached  quickly under PEPFAR and that the embassy procurement system is  designed for buying items like furniture rather than evaluating, awarding,  and managing long-term contracts or grant agreements with implementing  partners. Another HHS/CDC respondent stated that it takes time to  familiarize embassy personnel with the specifications for certain medical  equipment related to ARV treatment. Moreover, he stated that if the  equipment is specialized, it may have only one supplier, causing additional  delays for the embassy to justify sole sourcing. When questioned about  these examples, HHS/CDC contract officers at headquarters stated that a  time frame of several months is not unusual and that the process could take  just as long regardless of whether it went through the embassy, HHS/CDC  headquarters, or an HHS/CDC field office.", "Although HHS/CDC field staff articulated more concerns regarding  inadequate contracting capacity in the field, the PMTCT Initiative summary  stated that the current number of USAID contract officers in the field will  be insufficient to facilitate the number of contracts and large amount of  funds needed to meet PEPFAR treatment goals. Another communication,  dated December 5, 2003, spoke of \u201can urgent plea for greater contracting  officer support,\u201d and a third communication, dated October 16, 2003, cited  \u201ca desperate need for contracting agents in-country.\u201d In addition, a USAID  respondent in one country and HHS/CDC respondents in three countries  stated that more staff in general are needed in the field to expand treatment  under PEPFAR.", "The PMTCT Initiative summary and a communication from Botswana to  the Coordinator\u2019s Office offered several suggestions for addressing the  problem. These suggestions included changing the contracting system or  increasing the number of contract officers in the field and strengthening  USAID regional contracting offices with additional personnel and capacity  to travel to countries in their region. The PMTCT Initiative summary also  recommended that HHS/CDC and its parent agency, HHS, work with the  Department of State to review current contracting mechanisms and  develop strategies that will allow for greater flexibility and capacity to  program PEPFAR funds. According to technical comments on a draft of  this report that were submitted jointly by the Coordinator\u2019s Office, HHS,  and USAID, the funding requests required of field staff for track 1.5 (rapid  allocation of funds to expand ongoing activities) and track 2 (annual  operational plans) specifically asked what additional contracting support  field staff would need, and some posts have been allotted staffing positions  to help fill these gaps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differing Laws and Regulations May Inhibit Agencies\u2019 Joint Efforts to Expand Treatment Programs", "paragraphs": ["The agencies implementing PEPFAR are subject to varying laws and  regulations regarding procurement and foreign taxation of U.S. government  assistance, as well as differing grant requirements for audits of grantees.

In South Africa, for example, according to USAID  officials in that country, the mission obligated all of its money for drug  procurement under PEPFAR track 1.5 through the HHS/NIH; that agency\u2019s  funds are governed by less restrictive rules for overseas procurement, and  HHS/NIH was therefore able to allocate the money quickly to meet a  January 2004 deadline.

In  addition, the provision states that when a host country assesses taxes on  U.S. assistance provided under the act, an amount equal to 200 percent of  the total assessment shall be withheld from the fiscal year 2005  appropriations for assistance to that country.  Since this restriction applies  only to funds appropriated under the 2004 Foreign Operations  Appropriations Act, it does not affect funds appropriated to HHS agencies  in their own appropriations acts. According to the communication from the  field and interviews we conducted with the procurement and legal officials  who contributed to it, there could be confusion among agencies and grant  recipients over managing funds provided under different appropriations  laws, since some of the funds are subject to the taxation provision and  some are not.", "In addition, there was initial confusion over what restrictions would apply  to money appropriated to the Coordinator\u2019s Office and transferred to HHS  agencies. Since funding for the Coordinator\u2019s Office was appropriated  under the 2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, certain restrictions  apply to these funds, including the taxation provisions discussed above and  procurement restrictions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Officials  from the Coordinator\u2019s Office told us that they recently determined that  funds transferred to agencies from that office would still be subject to their  original appropriations restrictions. In contrast, funds appropriated  directly to HHS for PEPFAR-related activities are not subject to these  restrictions. We spoke with the authors of the South African  communication and an HHS/CDC grantee, who raised concerns over  managing funds that may be subject to differing restrictions. They stated  that grantees could be confused by differing sets of rules. The grantee, a  U.S. organization, also noted that non-U.S. grantees often lack the  resources to ascertain what these rules require. According to HHS officials,  the Coordinator\u2019s intention is to set one policy for all U.S. government  agencies implementing PEPFAR.", "Agency Requirements for Auditing Grantees Vary  Agencies have varying grant requirements regarding the auditing of foreign  recipients of U.S. funds, possibly complicating the agencies\u2019 oversight of  organizations implementing PEPFAR. Office of Management and Budget  circular A-133 provides uniform auditing standards applicable to all U.S.  government agencies with respect to grants awarded to U.S. entities.  However, it does not apply to non-U.S. entities that receive funds directly  as grant recipients or indirectly as subrecipients. U.S. government officials  expect that many such entities will implement PEPFAR. USAID officials  noted that their agency requires that any local (i.e., non-U.S.) grantee  spending more than $500,000 in U.S. government funds per year be audited  annually, for example, by a preapproved local audit firm in accordance with  U.S. government auditing standards. HHS/CDC\u2019s audit requirements for  non-U.S. grantees differ from USAID\u2019s in that audits must be performed by  a U.S.-based firm (which, according to USAID audit officials, could be  expensive). HHS/CDC\u2019s audit requirements for non-U.S. grantees also  state that audits must be performed according to international accounting  standards or standards approved by HHS/CDC.
