MDA conducted two intercept tests demonstrating an increased capability. However, it did not complete six planned flight tests for a variety of reasons, including test delays and retests to address previous failures, which limit the knowledge gained in fiscal year 2014. Additionally, several BMDS elements delivered assets in fiscal year 2014 without completing planned testing, which increases cost and schedule risks for an individual system and the BMDS as a whole. In one instance, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense element delivered assets although its capability has not been demonstrated through flight testing.", "Potential also exists to reduce acquisition risks for several MDA efforts that are pursuing high-risk approaches that do not adhere to an approach which encourages accumulating more knowledge before program commitments are made and conducting testing before production is initiated.

This approach  recognizes that programs require an appropriate balance between  schedule and risk, but does not include an undue amount of what is often  referred to as acquisition concurrency, where overlap occurs between  technology development and product development or between product  development and production of a system.

Some of  these practices include initiating new programs without robustly assessing  alternative solutions, incorporating high levels of concurrency, and fielding  capabilities prior to completing flight testing. While some concurrency is  understandable, committing to product development before requirements  are understood and technologies are mature, as well as committing to  production and fielding before development is complete is a high-risk  strategy that often results in performance shortfalls, unexpected cost  increases, schedule delays, and test problems. We previously found  that although these practices enabled MDA to quickly ramp up efforts in  order to meet tight, presidentially-directed deadlines, they were also high  risk and resulted in problems that caused some programs to be cancelled  or significantly disrupted. For example:  In July 2013, we found that the Secretary of Defense decided to  cancel an MDA satellite system program, called the Precision  Tracking Space System, based on the results of a departmental  review of the program which determined that the program had  significant technical, programmatic, and affordability risks. We  previously found that MDA did not consider a broad range of  alternatives prior to its decision to start the program, was relying on a  highly-concurrent acquisition approach despite significant technical  and operational challenges, and was projecting a lower total program  cost by increasing risk to the warfighter. Although MDA gained some  technical knowledge from the effort, it also expended significant  resources\u2014approximately five years and $231 million.

Because the program moved forward with producing and fielding  interceptors before completing its flight test program, test failures  exacerbated the disruptions to the program, causing the program to  fall several years behind on its flight test program and increasing the  cost to demonstrate the CE-II from $236 million\u2014the cost of GMD\u2019s  first CE-II flight test\u2014to $1.981 billion\u2014the cost to resolve the test  failures and implement a retrofit program.

MDA officials have told us that they do not plan for target failures,  test failures, or potential retests when developing the test schedule, and  that there is no flexibility to absorb these issues. We previously  recommended that MDA include sufficient margin in its test schedule  based on recent test outcomes and forecasted testing demands so it  could better meet its testing goals. However, MDA has not implemented  this recommendation. Consequently, when MDA encounters challenges,  it does not have the flexibility to accommodate changes and falls short of  its testing goals and hinders oversight.", "According to MDA officials, the reasons that the six flight tests in 2014  were not conducted as planned include: sequestration that limited the  funds available for testing, target availability, and retests to address  previous failures. To address these challenges, MDA made the decision  to remove or delay some planned tests. For instance, of the four Aegis  BMD program tests that were planned but not conducted, one was  cancelled and one was delayed due to sequestration, and two were  delayed due to lack of target availability. Some of these tests are  designed to assess MDA\u2019s regional ballistic missile defense approach for  Europe, also called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA).  As a result, MDA risks discovering performance shortfalls with some of its  assets after they are fielded and declaring future phases without all of the  information it initially planned to have. Of the two GMD program flight  tests that were planned but not conducted, the program cancelled one  because the test objectives were met through prior tests, and the other  test was significantly changed, including a new name and test objectives,  after the successful FTG-06b test.", "MDA came closest to achieving its testing goals in fiscal year 2010 when  it conducted five out of seven, or 71 percent, of its planned tests (see  figure 1).", "Each year as MDA falls short of its testing goals due to target failures,  test failures, or retests, it takes steps to recoup by delaying and removing  tests.

For example, FTX-19\u2014a significant flight test of Aegis BMD\u2019s ability to  coordinate two ships to track and engage multiple threats\u2014has been  delayed twice from its original planned date in fiscal year 2013, once to  fiscal year 2014 and then again to fiscal year 2015. Additionally, since  2010, Aegis Ashore has removed five of its seven flight tests designed to  assess its capability for EPAA Phase 2. According to program officials,  the program is leveraging data from sea-based Aegis BMD tests, but  conditions at sea are different than on land, as are the system  configurations (for more information see appendix III).

Also, THAAD delivered assets to meet urgent warfighter  needs although there were changes incorporated to address  obsolescence issues, and these will not be tested until the fourth quarter  of fiscal year 2015. We have previously recommended that MDA  synchronize its testing and asset delivery schedules to ensure that assets  are tested before they are delivered.

Aegis BMD reduced testing  and production risks for its SM-3 Block IIA by achieving full design  maturity at its critical design review\u2014a key knowledge point juncture for  acquisition programs considering whether to start building and testing  production-representative prototypes. As we previously reported, the  Aegis BMD program has taken steps aligned with this best practice by  revising its SM-3 Block IIA schedule to alleviate compressed events and  include additional time for subsystem reviews before conducting the  critical design review to resolve any issues. As such, the program  conducted the critical design review in October 2013 with no major issues  identified and 100 percent of its design drawings completed\u2014a key  indication that the interceptor\u2019s design is stable. This allows the program  to move forward with flight testing and into initial production with  assurance of design maturity.", "Also in fiscal year 2014, GMD took additional actions to reduce  development and testing risk by incorporating an additional non-intercept  flight test in fiscal year 2015. After successfully conducting FTG-06b in  June 2014, the GMD program planned to conduct its next flight test\u2014an  intercept test called FTG-09\u2014in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. This  test, in part, was designed to demonstrate two redesigned components  intended to address prior issues discovered in flight test failures.  However, the program subsequently encountered delays developing the  redesigned components and could not support the planned test date for  FTG-09. According to program officials, the Director, MDA decided to  repurpose FTG-09 as a non-intercept flight test, called GMD Controlled  Test Vehicle (GM CTV)-02+, to provide the program with additional time  to complete development for the redesigned components and to test  additional objectives, such as the capability to discriminate the target from  other objects during an engagement. The program previously conducted  a non-intercept flight test, GM CTV-01, prior to conducting FTG-06b,  which significantly contributed to the intercept flight test\u2019s success. Adding  the non-intercept flight test GM CTV-02+ is a positive step as it allows the  program to collect valuable data on how the redesigned components  operate in the in-flight environment, which reduces risk for the next  intercept flight test.", "The Targets and Countermeasures program reduced BMDS testing risks  by using a non-intercept flight test for a new target prior to its use in more  complex and costly intercept tests. New, untested targets introduce  higher risks of failures and, if a target fails, it often means costly and time- consuming re-tests, which could further delay the delivery of the capability  to the warfighter. In 2013, we recommended that MDA add risk reduction  flight tests for each new target type. Risk reduction flight tests are  conducted to confirm that the target works as intended and to discover  and resolve issues prior to its use in an intercept test. MDA has not fully  implemented this recommendation. However, the Targets and  Countermeasures program successfully conducted a non-intercept flight  test in October 2014 using a new target called the Medium-Range  Ballistic Missile Type 3 (MRBM T3) prior to its first planned intercept test  in fiscal year 2016. This non-intercept flight test reduces testing risks,  such as potential target failures, by giving the program insight into the  target\u2019s performance, and provides about a year to address any issues  that may emerge. If the program continues to integrate non-intercept flight  tests into the test schedule prior to intercept tests when new target types  are introduced, it may reduce the risks for failures in intercept test events.  The Targets and Countermeasures program also adopted contracting  types aimed at providing incentives for the successful performance of  targets.

Although a failure review  investigation is ongoing to determine the root cause of the failure,  preliminary findings indicate that the third-stage rocket motor\u2014the  component that controls the final maneuvers of the interceptor\u2014 experienced a failure similar to that which occurred in September 2011.  As a result of the interceptor failures during the two flight tests, Aegis  BMD is redesigning components in the third-stage rocket motor and  expects to complete and accept the final redesign specifications in the  second quarter of fiscal year 2015.", "The Aegis BMD program is currently not planning to flight test the SM-3  Block IB with the redesigned components of the third-stage rocket motor  before it is incorporated into the production line and deployed, in part, to  support the regional defense of Europe. According to program officials  and contractor representatives that produce the SM-3 Block IB  interceptors, the effort to redesign components in the rocket motor is  considered to be relatively straightforward and low risk. They also  indicated that they do not believe that a flight test to demonstrate the  redesigned rocket motor components is necessary, as plans are in place  to conduct ground tests. However, without flight testing the redesigned  rocket motor components, MDA may not fully understand the interceptor\u2019s  performance and capabilities and whether it works as intended.  Additionally, Director, Operational Test and Evaluation officials stated that  the environments for a flight and ground test are very different and that  MDA has not been able to replicate the SM-3 Block IB interceptor failure  through ground tests. As we have previously reported, both failures  occurred during flight tests, not ground tests. Moreover, different issues  with that same component have contributed to previous SM-3 Block IB  program schedule delays and production disruptions which resulted in a  delayed production decision.", "The Aegis BMD program is also moving forward with plans to initiate SM- 3 Block IB full rate production in fiscal year 2015 and plans to enter into a  multiyear procurement contract in fiscal year 2016. Both the full-rate  production decision and multiyear procurement contract represent major  commitments by the program and carry significant cost and schedule  risks as the SM-3 Block IB with the redesigned third-stage rocket motor  components have not been demonstrated through flight testing. When  used appropriately, multiyear contracting can save money compared to a  series of annual contracts by allowing contractors to use their resources  more efficiently. However, multiyear procurement can limit DOD\u2019s budget  flexibility and also entails certain risks that must be balanced against  potential benefits, such as the increased costs to the government should  the multiyear contract be changed. As MDA progresses with the full rate  production of the interceptors and upcoming interceptor acquisition  decisions, Aegis BMD still has an opportunity to insert a flight test into its  test plan prior to inserting the redesigned components of the third-stage  rocket motor into its production line.

The production and  integration of the CE-II interceptor was previously suspended following a  failure in its December 2010 flight test. As we have previously reported,  this flight test failed because of excessive vibration in the inertial  measurement unit (IMU)\u2014a component of the kill vehicle\u2019s guidance  system. The program subsequently modified the IMU to mitigate the  excessive vibration; demonstrated the modified IMU\u2019s effectiveness in the  non-intercept flight test; and performed a successful intercept with a CE-II  configured with the modified IMU during FTG-06b in June 2014. Following  the successful flight test, the GMD program resumed integration and  production of the CE-II interceptor. In addition to modifying the IMU,  according to the Director, MDA, the program is also developing alternate  divert thrusters (ADT)\u2014a component that steers the kill vehicle in flight\u2014 to address the systemic problem of in-flight vibration. The program plans  to implement this new component, along with changes to components in  the booster, such as the flight computer, into new interceptor production  in fiscal year 2017.

For example, the program experienced  delays with restarting interceptor production for the current interceptor  version\u2014the CE-II with the modified IMU. Defective wiring harnesses  were identified on all CE-II interceptors, including those previously fielded  and those currently undergoing production. It was determined that an  improper soldering application was used during wiring harness assembly  that could later cause corrosion, which could have far reaching effects  because of the component\u2019s power and data interfaces with the kill  vehicle\u2019s IMU. The program previously experienced problems with the  wiring harness and the issue was resolved, but the corrective actions  were not passed along to other suppliers. MDA assessed the likelihood  for the component\u2019s degradation in the operational environment as low  and decided to accept the component as-is, which helped mitigate the  schedule delay, but increased the risk for future reliability failures. An  assessment conducted by the Defense Contract Management Agency  found that any deviation from the program\u2019s kill vehicle delivery schedule  of one kill vehicle per month could jeopardize the program\u2019s chances of  meeting its goal of fielding 44 interceptors by 2017.", "CE-II Block I:  The GMD program is following a high risk approach for  acquiring the CE-II Block I, but an opportunity exists for the program to  reduce risk by flight testing the CE-II Block I prior to starting the  interceptor\u2019s production.

According to acquisition best practices reported in our July 2002  assessment of DOD\u2019s weapon system acquisition process, the  demonstration flight test should be conducted before production for  operational use. As we testified last year, the GMD program has had  many years of significant and costly disruptions caused by production  getting well ahead of testing and then discovering issues during testing.  Even though assets have already been produced, MDA has had to add  tests that were not previously planned and delay tests that are necessary  to understand the system's capabilities and limitations. By continuing to  follow a concurrent acquisition approach, it is likely that the GMD program  will continue to experience delays, disruptions, and cost growth.", "In addition, the GMD program has encountered issues with a number of  the component modifications being developed for the CE-II Block I. The  developmental issues have caused the program to delay necessary  design reviews, generated significant schedule compression, and has  pushed out the completion of CE-II Block I deliveries to the second  quarter of fiscal year 2018. For example, in November 2013, the program  experienced an ADT qualification test failure as a result of design  changes that were not verified prior to qualification testing. By omitting  steps in the design process, the program increased the risk for costly,  time-consuming problems to occur later in development. These risks  materialized when the program failed the qualification test, resulting in a  one-year delay to the ADT development effort, which the Defense  Contract Management Agency assessed as having left the program with  no schedule margin for performing the next flight test, GM CTV-02+,  according to the program\u2019s current schedule. Although the recent delays  to the CE-II Block I design reviews put the program behind schedule, it  also provides the program with additional decision time\u2014should program  officials choose to use it\u2014to assess the merits of conducting FTG-15  prior to starting CE-II Block I production for operational use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GMD: Opportunity Exists to Incorporate Results of Alternatives Assessment Which Provide Valuable Knowledge for Its Kill Vehicle Redesign Plans", "paragraphs": ["MDA is moving forward with the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV)  program\u2014a new effort intended to address concerns about GMD\u2019s  interceptor fleet reliability\u2014prior to considering the benefits and risks of a  broad range of options. Both the Director, Operational Test and  Evaluation and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics have previously voiced concerns with the CE- II\u2019s reliability. MDA validated these concerns when it acknowledged that  the current kill vehicle design is costly to produce and sustain and  requires the warfighter to fire more interceptors to overcome anticipated  in-flight reliability failures. In the fall of 2013, DOD\u2019s Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation began conducting a study to assess  options, called an analysis of alternatives (AOA), for improving,  augmenting, or providing an alternative interceptor to improve homeland  ballistic missile defense. The assessment continued through fiscal year  2014 and is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2015.", "We previously reported that a key challenge facing MDA was improving  investment decisions, and that an AOA can help establish a sound basis  for new acquisition efforts.

MDA began the RKV program to replace currently fielded  interceptors with ones that are more testable, reliable, producible, and  cost effective. According to MDA, this effort began in July 2013 and  options for the RKV program were based on interim results from an  ongoing GMD fleet assessment and an interim analysis MDA produced in  support of the homeland missile defense AOA. MDA defined the RKV  design parameters and assessed design concepts provided by industry.  MDA proceeded to incorporate the RKV effort into GMD\u2019s current  program of record and increased GMD\u2019s budget request for fiscal years  2015 through 2019 by over $700 million to fund the RKV\u2019s development.  In addition, MDA added two RKV flight tests to the GMD test plan and  collaborated with industry to finalize the RKV concept. MDA developed  plans to conduct the first RKV flight test in fiscal year 2018 and begin  delivering interceptors in fiscal year 2020.

By not making the AOA a major part of the RKV effort,  MDA runs the risk of starting the effort on an unsound acquisition footing  and pursuing a kill vehicle that may not be the best solution to meet the  warfighter\u2019s needs within cost, schedule, and technical constraints. In  September 2009, we found that the effectiveness of AOAs for some major  defense acquisition programs were limited because decision makers  locked into a solution before an AOA was conducted and the results of  AOAs came too late in the process. However, in April 2014, the Director,  MDA committed to following a knowledge-based approach to acquire the  RKV, which is an encouraging sign that the agency intends to take  actions to place this new investment on a sound acquisition footing.

For example, integrating Aegis BMD  with forward-based radars through C2BMC allows it to launch the  interceptor earlier, before its own radar can acquire the threat, thus  defending larger areas. Table 5 includes additional examples of planned  integrated capabilities. Because MDA does not systematically report this  information, external decision makers have limited insight into the  interdependencies between element-level development efforts and  whether these efforts are on track to reach maturity needed for integration  activities.

MDA conducted two intercept and three non- intercept flight tests that demonstrated an increased capability for Aegis  BMD and the GMD program. Moreover, several programs, such as the  Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIA and the Targets and Countermeasures  program, took steps to reduce acquisition risk. At the same time,  however, MDA is still allowing production to get ahead of testing  (concurrency)\u2014a practice which has consistently led to cost and  schedule growth as well as performance problems in the past. For the  Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB, MDA will have a full rate production decision  in fiscal year 2015 and plans to enter into a multiyear procurement  contract in the following year. If it does not conduct a flight test of the  redesigned components of its third-stage rocket motor before entering  into full production, the Aegis BMD program is at risk for potential cost  growth and schedule delays, affecting its planned interceptor production.  A flight test serves as an opportunity to increase the confidence that the  redesigned component works as intended and determine if any additional  changes are necessary. For GMD, the program planned to start  production of CE-II Block I interceptors for operational use almost two  years before it conducts an intercept flight test in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2016. In this case, recent development challenges have  delayed design reviews, providing the program with additional time to  assess the merits of conducting the demonstration flight test ahead of  starting CE-II Block I production.", "In addition, because the agency started the RKV program in the fall of  2013 rather than await the results of an ongoing AOA for homeland  missile defense, congressional and DOD decision makers may not have  the insight necessary to discern whether MDA\u2019s approach is the most  promising, cost-effective solution to pursue. Though design decisions  have been made, development activities have yet to begin, so there is still  an opportunity for the Director, MDA to follow through on his commitment  to follow a rigorous systems engineering approach to conduct the  redesign effort.", "Lastly, although MDA has increased its focus on BMDS integration and  delivering integrated system-level capabilities, it does not provide a  systematic view of its plans and progress for delivering these capabilities  to external decision makers. While the agency is currently not required to  externally report key aspects of integration, insight into the  interdependencies between element-level development efforts and  whether these efforts are on track to reach maturity needed for integration  activities is necessary to understand MDA's progress, as many of the  capabilities envisioned for EPAA and other regional deployments hinge  on successful integration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following three  actions to strengthen MDA\u2019s acquisition efforts and help support  oversight.  1.  To ensure that future efforts are aligned with a sound acquisition  approach, which includes robust systems engineering and testing, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the following two  actions:  a)  For Aegis BMD SM-3, DOD conduct a flight test to increase  confidence that the redesigned SM-3 Block IB third-stage rocket  motor component works as intended prior to inserting it into the  SM-3 Block IB production line.  b)  For GMD, delay production of CE-II Block I interceptors intended  for operational use until the program has successfully conducted  an intercept flight test with the CE-II Block I interceptor.  2.  To ensure MDA makes sound investment decisions on improving  homeland ballistic missile defense, the Secretary of Defense should  direct MDA to make the department\u2019s analysis of alternatives an  integral part of its planning effort and delay any decisions to begin  development of the new GMD Redesigned Kill Vehicle until:   a)  the department\u2019s analysis of alternatives is completed and  identifies the best solution to pursue; and  b)  Congressional and DOD decision makers have been provided the  results of that analysis.  3.  Drawing from information it already has, the Secretary of Defense  should direct MDA to report annually to Congress its plans for, and  achieved progress in developing and delivering integrated BMDS- level capabilities. This reporting should include:  a)  planned integrated BMDS-level capabilities, including dates for  when capability is planned for delivery; and   b)  element-level upgrades needed for delivery of the integrated  BMDS capability, including dates that these upgrades need to be  available for integration into the BMDS capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report.

However,  the department partially concurred with the second part of this  recommendation to delay production of the CE-II Block I interceptors until  the program has conducted a successful intercept attempt with this new  interceptor version. In its comments, DOD stated it will delay  emplacement of CE-II Block I interceptors until the program has  successfully conducted an intercept flight test with the CE-II Block I, but  will continue production and final integration of interceptors. DOD also  stated that delaying interceptor production and integration until the flight  test is conducted would unacceptably increase the risk to reaching the  Secretary of Defense mandate to achieve 44 emplaced interceptors by  the end of 2017. Based on our past work examining weapon system  acquisition and best practices, we found that successful programs follow  a knowledge-based acquisition approach and achieve an appropriate  balance between schedule and risk that does not include an undue  amount of concurrency. However, MDA\u2019s current approach for acquiring  the CE-II Block I embraces a proven risk of undue concurrency because  any issues uncovered during the intercept test could significantly affect  the program. As we found in this report, such an approach has proven  very costly for MDA. Because the agency moved forward with CE-II  production prior to completing flight testing, test failures exacerbated the  disruptions to the program and increased the CE-II\u2019s cost by $1.745  billion. We maintain our position that MDA should take the recommended  action to delay production of CE-II Block I interceptors intended for  operational use until the program has conducted a successful intercept  flight test with the CE-II Block I in an effort to align its efforts with a sound  acquisition approach.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to delay any decision  to begin development of the RKV until: 1) the department\u2019s AOA for  improving homeland ballistic missile defense is completed and identifies  the best solution to pursue; and 2) congressional and DOD decision  makers have been provided the results of that analysis. In its response,  DOD stated that interim results from the AOA have been used to inform  planning decisions and that the results of the final analysis of alternatives  will be provided to Congressional and DOD leadership. The department  also noted that that an AOA does not make a \u201cbest solution\u201d  determination but rather provides an objective comparison of alternatives  that allows the leadership to make the determination of what path the  department should take. We agree that there is generally no requirement  for an AOA to identify a single solution. However, the goal of an AOA is to  identify the most promising options for decision makers to consider rather  than simply providing a comparison of alternatives that does not clearly  indicate the most promising solutions, whether it be one or multiple  options. DOD declined to commit to delaying any decision to begin  developing the RKV and stated its investment decisions will be sound  because interim results from the ongoing AOA have been used to inform  early planning decisions, including an acquisition strategy framework for  the RKV. While we recognize in this report that DOD\u2019s decision to  redesign the GMD kill vehicle may be justifiable, by starting RKV  development in advance of the AOA\u2019s completion, DOD runs the risk of  locking into a solution that may not be the most promising and cost  effective option to pursue. In addition, MDA has previously attempted to  start new major efforts that were not informed by AOAs which DOD later  cancelled because of the programs\u2019 high-risk acquisition strategies and  technical challenges.

With the GMD program\u2019s  successful execution of FTG-06b, the program demonstrated it had  resolved some of the major technical problems discovered during the  prior six-and-a-half year period of test failures and development  challenges and successfully executed FTG-06b.", "Although the program has resolved many of the technical challenges, it  now faces the long term effects from the prior period, as flight tests were  delayed by several years in order for the program to overcome the test  failures. For example, the program initially planned to conduct a salvo  intercept test in early fiscal year 2009 following a successful CE-II  intercept test. However, because of the test failures and development  delays, the salvo test is now planned to occur in late fiscal year 2017\u2014 almost nine years later than initially planned. The cumulative effect of  these delays has extended the completion of planned CE-II flight tests to  fiscal year 2023\u2014approximately five and a half years after the program  has completed fielding the CE-IIs.", "Another long term effect from the prior period of CE-II test failures is that  the cost to demonstrate, as well as fix, the currently deployed CE-IIs has  increased from an initial $236 million\u2014the cost of the first CE-II flight  test\u2014to currently $1.981 billion. The need for failure reviews, additional  flight tests, mitigation development efforts, and a retrofit program have  increased the CE-II\u2019s demonstration cost by $1.745 billion. Some of the  mitigation development efforts are ongoing and, as such, the cost to  demonstrate and fix the CE-IIs may continue to increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in interceptor retrofits extend risk to warfighter", "paragraphs": ["MDA\u2019s fleet of currently deployed CE-I and CE-II interceptors are in need  of upgrades and retrofits to address prior test failures. However, in order  to meet the goal of fielding 44 interceptors by the end of 2017 and also  offset the unplanned cost increase to demonstrate and fix the CE-II, MDA  plans to delay fixing the fielded CE-IIs until fiscal year 2015 with fielding  completed in fiscal year 2016. MDA also plans to delay fixing the fielded  CE-Is until fiscal year 2018, which will continue beyond fiscal year 2020.  In addition, according to program officials, the program does not plan to  fix the currently deployed or newly produced CE-IIs\u2019 divert thrusters, a  component with known performance issues that helps steer the  interceptor in flight.", "While MDA\u2019s plan to produce new interceptors ahead of fixing the fielded  interceptors may enable the program to field additional interceptors  sooner, it also increases risk for the warfighter because the deployed  interceptors do not have the fixes needed to address known issues. As  such, the fielded interceptors are susceptible to experiencing the same  failure modes exhibited during prior test failures, leaving the warfighter  with an interceptor fleet that may not work as intended. According to  MDA, the warfighter can compensate for some of these anticipated in- flight reliability failures by launching a number of interceptors to defend  against an enemy attack. However, such an approach is inventory- intensive and limits the system\u2019s raid handling capacity, reducing the  system\u2019s overall effectiveness to defend the homeland against ballistic  missile attacks. In addition, since MDA tentatively plans to begin replacing  the fleet of currently fielded interceptors with RKV interceptors starting in  fiscal year 2020, it is unclear why MDA would expend the resources to fix  the CE-Is only to begin replacing them two years later.", "MDA\u2019s decision to redesign the GMD kill vehicle will be DOD\u2019s seventh  major attempt to fix and improve the current kill vehicle design. The  current GMD kill vehicle was initially designed as a prototype in the early  1990\u2019s. Since then, MDA has spent tens of billions of dollars to correct  issues with the original prototype design, improve the kill vehicle\u2019s  performance, and increase the number of interceptors fielded to expand  capabilities to defend the homeland from ballistic missile attacks. In the  fall of 2013, MDA began a new effort to redesign the GMD kill vehicle,  called the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), to address growing concerns  within the department about the CE-II\u2019s reliability. The RKV is in addition  to efforts currently underway to upgrade and redesign the CE-II, as seen  in table 12 below:  MDA\u2019s prior performance in upgrading and redesigning the GMD kill  vehicle has achieved mixed results. Over the past 15 years, MDA has, on  average, initiated redesign or upgrade efforts for GMD approximately  every two years. These efforts, while perhaps needed, have proven to be  very expensive and, according to MDA, did not achieve the goal of  providing the warfighter with a reliable, producible, and cost-effective  interceptor.", "A more recent example of updating the GMD kill vehicle is the CE-II Block  I, which began in 2010 when MDA awarded a contract to Boeing to  develop and sustain the GMD system. As part of that effort, Boeing was  tasked with redesigning the CE-II EKV to address obsolescence and  improve reliability, producibility, availability, and maintainability. MDA has  since devised a new, multi-phased strategy to evolve the GMD system  and the planned improvements for the CE-II Block I are now limited to  component modifications and quality improvements that were identified  during the FTG-06a failure resolution effort. Many of the initial goals and  objectives for the CE-II Block I appear to have been passed onto the  RKV. According to MDA, it is pursuing the RKV to replace the current  fleet of interceptors with new ones that are testable, reliable, more  producible, and cost effective.", "During an April 2014 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the  Director, MDA, stated that the agency was committed to implementing a  rigorous acquisition process for the redesign effort and would not  circumvent sound acquisition practices. Also, in an April 2014 report  submitted to Congress describing the RKV\u2019s plans and objectives, MDA  described some initial steps the agency is taking to employ a rigorous  systems engineering process, such as including manufacturability,  reliability, and testability criteria as critical design conditions. The  agency\u2019s recent commitment to follow a knowledge-based approach to  acquire the RKV is a positive indication that the agency is seeking to  improve its investment decisions and achieve better outcomes. Our prior  work on best practices for acquisitions found that successful programs  take steps to confirm their technologies are mature, their designs are  stable, and their production processes are in control. These steps help  ensure a high level of knowledge is achieved at key junctures in  development."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Targets and Countermeasures (Targets)", "paragraphs": ["Appendix VIII: Targets and Countermeasures  (Targets)", "Key Findings for Fiscal Year 2014", "The Targets program supported MDA\u2019s test schedule and  improved reliability by reducing failures.", "The program\u2019s current contracting approach may result in better  acquisition outcomes.", "The Targets program has flown targets in non-intercept tests that  can reduce risks, but it continues to use new targets in more  expensive and higher risk intercept tests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Overview", "paragraphs": ["The MDA\u2019s Targets and Countermeasures (hereafter referred to as  Targets or Targets program) designs, develops, and procures missiles to  serve as targets during the testing of missile defense systems.

Specifically, the Targets program  provided three short-range targets and one medium-range target to  support Aegis testing requirements, including the full-rate production  decision for the SM-3 Block IB interceptor. The Targets program provided  seven additional targets in fiscal year 2014, including an intermediate- range target to support the retest of Ground-based Midcourse Defense\u2019s  (GMD) Capability Enhancement (CE)-II interceptor that failed during FTG- 06a in December 2010.", "In the past we have reported that reliability and availability of targets has  caused delays in MDA\u2019s testing schedule. For example, target failures  and anomalies have caused the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  (THAAD) program to change its flight test plan and decrease the amount  of flight tests. However, while the program has improved its reliability by  reducing the number of target failures (see figure 2), target availability  remains a risk to MDA\u2019s test schedule.", "From fiscal years 2010 through 2014, only one of the 46 targets launched  failed. The Targets program may have reduced target failures during this  timeframe, in part, by primarily using short-range targets that are less  complex than medium-, intermediate-, and intercontinental-range targets.  Moving forward, however, the majority of MDA\u2019s tests will use medium-,  intermediate-, and intercontinental-range targets. Another contributing  factor to the reduction in target failures may be the additional time  available to further develop targets while programs have been resolving  developmental issues. For example, the GMD program\u2019s CE-II interceptor  failed during FTG-06a in December 2010 which resulted in the need for a  retest. The GMD program\u2019s first retest failed in fiscal year 2011 and it  successfully conducted a retest in fiscal year 2014. Consequently, this  slowed the GMD program\u2019s test schedule and subsequently its target  demands providing the Targets program with additional time to further  develop or resolve issues with any of its targets. As GMD and other  programs resolve their developmental issues, the test plan becomes  more aggressive, and target demands increase, additional time to  develop or address issues with targets may not be as readily available.", "Target availability remains a risk to the MDA test plan. For example, two  of the Targets program\u2019s medium-range targets\u2014the MRBM T1/T2 and  MRBM T3\u2014have not been available as planned for some tests.  Consequently, these tests either received substitute targets or were  delayed. According to program officials, there was a delay in awarding the  MRBM T1/T2 contract due to a procurement integrity allegation which  was not substantiated, but affected its availability for testing. As a result,  the first flight of this target was delayed two and half years from the third  quarter of fiscal year 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and  several substitute targets were needed for tests between that timeframe.  The MRBM T3 has had some development issues that had to be resolved  which delayed its availability for tests, according to program officials.

According to program officials, the eMRBM  contract did not contain disincentives for poor performance or failures.  Accordingly, when there were issues with the target during testing, the  program stated they had to pay the contractor additional money to resolve  the issues. Consequently, after developmental delays and spending $333  million for two of these targets\u2014one successfully used in fiscal year 2013  and one planned to be used in fiscal year 2015\u2014the remaining  requirements were reduced due to affordability and the multiple tests that  were scheduled to use this target either received substitute targets or  were deleted.
