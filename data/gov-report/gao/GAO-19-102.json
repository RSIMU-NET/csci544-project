This report examines the military departments' planning processes for determining (1) operational medical personnel requirements, including an assessment of the mix of federal civilian, contractor, and active and reserve medical personnel; and (2) the most appropriate workforce mix at MTFs and any challenges in executing their desired workforce mix. GAO compared MHS staffing practices with DOD policy, and analyzed fiscal year 2017 budgetary data to determine the proportion of military, federal civilian, and contractor personnel. GAO also interviewed senior leaders at six MTFs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The military departments each have their own processes to determine their operational medical personnel requirements; however, their planning processes to meet those requirements do not consider the use of all medical personnel or the full cost of military personnel. Specifically:", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has not assessed the suitability of federal civilians and contractors to meet operational medical personnel requirements. Federal civilians and contractors play key roles in supporting essential missions, i.e. providing operational assistance via combat support. Military department officials expressed a preference for using military personnel and cited possible difficulties in securing federal civilian and contractor interest in such positions. An assessment of the suitability of federal civilians and contractors could provide options for meeting operational medical personnel requirements.", "When determining the balance of active and reserve component medical personnel, the military departments' processes generally do not consider full personnel costs, including education and benefits. Specifically, officials stated that the Army and the Navy do not consider personnel costs in their assessment of the appropriate balance between active and reserve personnel, and the Air Force's analysis had some limitations. DOD policy states that workforce decisions must be made with an awareness of the full costs. Further, in a 2013 report, DOD identified the cost of unit manning, training, and equipping as one of five factors that play a key role in decisions concerning the mix of active and reserve component forces. By developing full cost information for active and reserve component medical personnel, DOD can better ensure an appropriate and cost-effective mix of personnel.", "The military departments have taken actions, such as establishing policies and procedures, to assess the appropriate workforce mix for beneficiary care within Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), but challenges remain. The military departments distribute military personnel across the MTFs and then use policies and procedures to consider risks, costs, and benefits to determine how to fill the remaining positions with federal civilians and contractors. However, a number of challenges, including lengthy hiring and contracting processes and federal civilian hiring freezes affect DOD's ability to use federal civilians and contractors. For example, senior officials at each of the six MTFs that GAO spoke with cited challenges with the federal civilian hiring process, and five of six MTFs cited challenges with the contracting process. As a result, senior officials from five of six MTFs reported discontinuing some services and referring patients to DOD's TRICARE network of private sector providers or Veterans Affairs facilities. The Military Health System (MHS) is also preparing for the phased transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs to the Defense Health Agency (DHA), including management of the MTF workforce. According to GAO's report on agency reform efforts, strategic workforce planning should precede any staff realignments or downsizing. However, according to a senior official, the DHA has not developed a strategic workforce plan. Without developing such a plan, the DHA may continue to face the same challenges experienced by the military departments in executing an appropriate and efficient workforce mix at its MTFs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD, among other things, (1) assess the suitability of federal civilians and contractors to provide operational medical care; (2) develop full cost information for active and reserve component medical personnel; and (3) develop a strategic total workforce plan for the DHA to help ensure execution of an appropriate workforce mix at its MTFs.

This report examines (1) to what extent  the military departments\u2019 planning processes for operational medical  personnel requirements include an assessment of the mix of federal  civilian, contractor, active and reserve medical personnel; and (2) the  military departments\u2019 processes for determining the most appropriate  workforce mix at MTFs and any challenges in executing an appropriate  workforce mix as responsibility for MTFs\u2019 administration transfers to the  Defense Health Agency (DHA).", "For objective one, we compared military department efforts in planning for  operational medical personnel requirements to DOD and department- level policies and guidance on workforce mix determination and  identifying the full cost of personnel. Specifically, DOD Directive 1100.4  states that authorities should consider all available sources when  determining workforce mix. Moreover, DOD\u2019s 2017 Workforce  Rationalization Plan recognizes DOD\u2019s federal civilians as an essential  enabler of its mission capabilities and operational readiness, and DOD\u2019s  National Defense Business Operations Plan for Fiscal Years 2018 to  2022 states that workforce rationalization strategies include, among other  things, reassessing military manpower allocations for military essentiality  and identifying functions and positions that are commercial in nature that  may be appropriately or efficiently delivered via private sector support. In  addition, DOD Instruction 7041.04 has guidance for departments to  identify the full cost of their active component, federal civilian, and  contractor workforces, and in a 2013 report, DOD established five factors  that play a key role in active and reserve component balance decisions,  including the cost of unit manning, training, and equipping. We  interviewed officials from the military departments to discuss: (1) how they  determine their operational medical requirements and if they identified the  full cost of its active and reserve component medical personnel, and (2)  the use of the active and reserve components for operational  requirements and any efforts to assess the balance of active and reserve  component medical personnel.", "To determine the extent to which federal civilians and contractors were  deployed to provide medical care, we reviewed federal civilian and  contractor deployment data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017.

Moreover, officials noted that federal civilians  and contractors supporting operational medical requirements are  generally considered to be a temporary solution. Officials also expressed  concern regarding their military department\u2019s ability to identify and recruit  federal civilians and contractors for such positions. Officials stated that  while there is currently no guidance outlining the potential role of federal  civilians and contractors providing medical care in operational settings,  they noted that DOD workforce mix guidance includes a provision that  highlights the military-essential nature of medical personnel embedded in  non-medical units engaged in hostile action. However, this instruction  does not otherwise address the role of federal civilians and contractors in  providing medical care, including whether they can serve in medical- specific operational platforms, such as combat support hospitals providing  level 3 care.", "To ensure that its federal civilian employees will deploy to combat zones  and perform operational roles such as critical combat support functions in  theater, DOD established the emergency-essential civilian program in  1985. Under this program, DOD designates as \u201cemergency-essential\u201d  those federal civilian employees whose positions are required to ensure  the success of combat operations or the availability of combat-essential  systems. DOD\u2019s emergency-essential workforce is now governed under  the Expeditionary Civilian Workforce program. DOD can deploy  emergency-essential federal civilian employees either on a voluntary or  involuntary basis to accomplish the DOD mission. In certain DOD  functional communities, federal civilians and contractors play a critical  role in combat support roles. For example, as we previously reported,  DOD relies on the federal civilian personnel it deploys to support a range  of essential missions, including logistics support and maintenance,  intelligence collection, criminal investigations, and weapons system  acquisition and maintenance. Further, as we have previously reported,  DOD has long used contractors to provide supplies and services to  deployed forces. Since the early 1990s, much of this support has come  from logistics support contracts\u2014contracts that are awarded prior to the  beginning of contingencies and are available to support the troops as  needed.", "Although they are generally not a part of the military departments\u2019  planning processes, and there is no guidance dedicated to delineating the  role of federal civilians and contractors in providing care in deployed  operational settings according to officials, these personnel have deployed  within the past 5 years. Based on our analysis of DOD federal civilian  deployment data\u2014for fiscal years 2013 through 2017\u2014about 120 DOD  federal civilians, including nurses, physicians, and technicians, were  deployed to provide medical services.

U.S. Central  Command officials told us that they have not used contractors to provide  care to military personnel. Officials noted that the deployed contractors  were not contracted by DOD for purposes of providing medical care and  instead provided medical care to other contractors as they were part of a  larger contract for other services, such as security services or logistics  support.

A senior official with the U.S.  Central Command Surgeon\u2019s office noted concerns regarding the pre- deployment training provided to contractors. Specifically, the official  stressed the importance of such training to operating effectively in the  unique operational environment of a deployed medical team and that  such training is only required to be completed by military personnel and  DOD expeditionary civilians. U.S. Africa Command officials expressed  concerns regarding challenges in obtaining clinical privileging rights (i.e.,  the right for a physician to perform specific health care services) for  contractors supporting small teams in an operational setting. Further,  OASD(HA) officials noted that a key factor to determining if federal  civilians or contractors should be used to provide operational medical  care is whether or not using those workforces would achieve any cost  savings.", "Moreover, officials with the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service  noted that they have had limited success with using DOD\u2019s Expeditionary  Civilian Workforce program for the provision of medical administrative  support and medical advising functions. A senior official from the U.S.  Central Command Surgeon\u2019s office noted this was due to relatively few  qualified federal civilians within the program with medical skills. Defense  Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials noted that the fiscal year  2019 force pool that defines the number and types of federal civilian  requirements needed for the program included 7 medical related positions  and none of these were for medical care; 1 was administrative and 6 were  medical advisors. Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials  stated that the DHA has a responsibility to build 1 or 2 of the medical  advisor positions in the force pool into their planning as a continuing  requirement, and noted that DHA has made some recent progress with 1  medical advisor scheduled to deploy in fiscal year 2019. While there may  be challenges with utilizing federal civilian personnel to fulfill operational  medical requirements, DOD also faces challenges with regard to military  personnel.

Further, DOD\u2019s National Defense Business Operations  Plan for Fiscal Years 2018 to 2022 states that workforce rationalization  strategies include, among other things, reassessing military manpower  allocations for military essentiality, determining whether workload requires  deployments and whether traditional military performance is necessary,  and identifying functions and positions that are commercial in nature that  may be appropriately or efficiently delivered via private sector support.", "Federal civilians and contractors are not incorporated into the military  departments\u2019 planning to meet operational medical requirements because  DOD has not performed an assessment of the suitability of federal civilian  or contractor personnel to provide operational medical care.

For example, an assessment may include what  level(s) of care would be appropriate for federal civilians and contractors  to support, if any, and factors to take into consideration in making such  decisions, such as exposure to danger and cost. By conducting such an  assessment and incorporating the results into relevant policies, DOD can  have greater certainty that it is planning for the most appropriate and  cost-effective mix of personnel to meet the mission, and, depending on  the outcome of the assessment, more options to meet its operational  medical personnel requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Military Departments Do Not Consider the Full Cost of Active and Reserve Component Medical Personnel When Planning for Operational Requirements and Do Not Have Full Cost Information", "paragraphs": ["The military departments\u2019 planning to meet DOD\u2019s operational personnel  requirements generally do not consider the full cost of active and reserve  component personnel when determining the balance of active and  reserve component medical forces. Officials from Army and Navy medical  headquarters stated that cost generally does not inform their decisions  about the balance of active and reserve personnel. Army officials noted  they consider cost of a unit when making tradeoffs within the reserve  component; however, cost was not cited by Army officials as a factor  when determining between the active and reserve components. Navy  officials noted that while it uses certain cost information when preparing  the President\u2019s budget submission, cost is not explicitly considered when  determining the balance of the active and reserve components. The Air  Force is the only military department that has performed an assessment  of the cost effectiveness of using active or reserve component medical  personnel, although it had some limitations and did not impact the Air  Force\u2019s active and reserve component mix decisions. Army, Navy, and Air  Force officials cited other key factors which they consider in determining  the balance of active and reserve component personnel, such as the  availability of forces to deploy quickly, length of time needed in theater,  capability needed, and frequency of deployments.", "Moreover, the military departments have not developed full cost  information of medical personnel to use in their assessment of active and  reserve balance. Army and Navy officials stated that they do not maintain  full cost information on its active component and reserve component  medical personnel. Navy provided programming cost for the reserve  component but these rates were averages across the reserve component  and not specific to medical. The Air Force\u2019s 2016 High Velocity Analysis  attempted to assess the cost of active and reserve medical personnel and  identify potential efficiencies within its medical workforce. However, this  study was limited because it did not include the full cost of active and  reserve component medical personnel. Specifically, the Air Force analysis  considered only compensation and did not consider other benefits, such  as medical education costs, and used average pay for officers and  enlisted personnel regardless of the specialty or skill level. However, the  full costs for certain medical personnel, such as officers, are generally  higher than average military pay, as they are eligible for a significant  number of special pays and benefits, such as graduate medical education  and training. In fiscal year 2017, DOD obligated $788 million for special  pays for active duty medical personnel, representing approximately 24  percent of the $3.3 billion obligated for all special pays across DOD, and  $707 million for medical education. While the Air Force had full cost data  for active component personnel, according to officials, they did not  include it in their analysis because they did not have comparable cost  data for the reserve component. Reserve medical personnel, when not  mobilized, receive a fraction of what active duty personnel receive, and  typically do not encumber significant education and training costs as  reserve medical personnel generally are recruited as fully trained medical  professionals.", "We have previously reported that when the reserve forces can  successfully meet deployment and operational requirements, individual  reserve-component units are generally less costly than similar active- component units. However, the full cost of medical personnel can vary  based on a number of factors. Specifically, more than one reserve- component unit may be needed to achieve the same output as a single  active-component unit. For example, the Army has a policy that states  reserve-component physicians, dentists, and nurse anesthetists shall not  be deployed for longer than 90 days. Thus, the Army would need to  deploy four different reserve component physicians for successive 90-day  rotations to fill a single 1-year active component requirement. Therefore,  in some cases, using reserve units to achieve the same operational  capacity over time may be more costly than using active units. However,  the lack of full cost information on active and reserve component medical  personnel is a barrier to an analytical-based determination on the balance  between active and reserve component medical personnel.", "In 2013, we reported limitations with the DOD-wide software tool  developed by Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation\u2014the Full Cost  of Manpower\u2014which, among other things, is used to identify the full cost  of active duty military personnel.  Specifically, we reported that this tool  has certain limitations for determining cost for certain cost elements. For  example, instead of determining training cost by specialty, it estimates  such costs by dividing total funding for such cost estimates by the number  of military personnel. We recommended, among other things, that DOD,  in order to improve its estimates and comparisons of the full cost of its  workforces, develop guidance for cost elements that users have identified  as challenging to calculate, such as general and administrative,  overhead, advertising and recruiting, and training. DOD partially  concurred with this recommendation but has not implemented this  recommendation. We continue to believe that developing such costs is  needed, especially for the medical community since training and  education costs can be higher than in other communities. Moreover, in  that report we also found that DOD did not include Reserve and National  Guard personnel in their methodology for estimating and comparing the  full cost to the taxpayer of work performed. We recommended DOD,  among other things, develop business rules for estimating the full cost of  National Guard and Reserve personnel. DOD partially concurred with this  recommendation but has not implemented the recommendation and  noted that a cost estimating function for reserve component personnel  would be more complex than for active component and DOD federal  civilian cost estimates. While we agree that developing cost estimates for  the reserve component could be more complex, we continue to believe it  is advisable for DOD to implement our recommendation.", "In a 2013 DOD report, DOD identified the cost of unit manning, training,  and equipping as one of five factors that play a key role in decisions  concerning the mix of active and reserve component forces. According  to the report, cost is often outweighed by other factors when making  active component and reserve component mix decisions, but should  always be considered in active component and reserve component mix  decisions. Further, DOD policy states that workforce decisions must be  made with an awareness of the full costs of personnel to DOD and more  broadly to the federal government, and highlights that the full cost of  active duty personnel extends beyond cash compensation, and also  includes other costs such as education and training.", "The military departments do not assess the full cost of personnel when  determining the balance of active and reserve component medical forces  because there is no DOD requirement to do so. Although DOD guidance  states that cost is one of several factors that should be considered in  active and reserve component balance decisions, the military  departments have not conducted assessments of the full cost of active  and reserve component personnel to inform their decisionmaking.  Further, DOD and the military departments are unable to conduct any such assessments because they have not developed full cost information  for active and reserve component medical personnel.

To determine MTF personnel requirements, the  military departments use their respective suite of manpower models or  standards based on a number of factors, including historical medical  workload information and the size of population eligible for care.  According to Army and Navy medical command officials, the Army and  Navy suites of models respectively include at least 36 and 46 medical  specialties, and generally express historical medical workload in relative  value units, a metric of the level of professional time, skill, training and  intensity to provide a given clinical service.

Senior officials from one  Air Force MTF stated they successfully submitted waivers to bypass the  180-day waiting period, but senior officials from one Army and one Navy  MTF stated that the waiver process often takes as long as the waiting  period.", "Senior officials from each of the six MTFs stated that hiring authorities,  such as direct or expedited hiring authority, can help address challenges,  but officials at four of six MTFs also expressed concerns about the  adequacy of such flexibilities. Direct-hire authority allows agencies to fill  occupations that have a severe candidate shortage or a critical hiring  need, and is meant to expedite hiring. DOD designated a number of  health care occupations as shortage category positions or critical need  occupations in accordance with this expedited hiring authority. In 2017,  DOD reported that it used expedited hiring authority in approximately 30  percent of hiring actions for its medical employees. Officials from one  Navy MTF stated they have direct hiring authority, but their human  resources office extends the process by requiring that the position be  announced within the last 90 days, or else be re-announced, before they  can utilize it. Army officials from one MTF stated interest in expanding the  list of medical specialties granted direct hiring authority. Air Force officials  from one MTF stated direct hire authority can help obtain qualified  candidates, but does not necessarily shorten the hiring process.", "Challenges in the federal hiring process are a longstanding issue.

Senior officials from two Air Force MTFs stated that after the  contract is awarded, contractors may have up to 60 days to present a  candidate; officials from one MTF stated if the MTF rejects the candidate,  then the vendor has another 30 to 60 days to find a candidate. According  to officials at one Air Force MTF, at times they have to consider whether  to accept a subpar candidate or leave a position vacant. Further, senior  Air Force officials stated that controls on contract spending limit their  flexibility in hiring.

Senior officials from four of six MTFs stated special salary rates are  helpful but not sufficient. Officials at one Navy MTF noted that two  primary care providers left within the last year for better pay in the private  sector, negatively affecting access to care. Officials at one Army MTF  noted that the application for special salary rates can take 2 years or  more, and therefore may not address short-term hiring needs.

These targets were intended to prevent an increase in the size of  the federal civilian workforce, even when federal civilians\u2019 performance of  work is most cost-effective. For example, Air Force headquarters officials  stated that due to the federal civilian FTE target, they generally default to  hiring contractor personnel when new personnel needs arise.

Senior officials at two of six MTFs\u2014one  Navy and one Air Force\u2014stated that they have not been adversely  affected by the federal civilian FTE targets because the relatively high  number of vacancies in their funded federal civilian positions means that  they never exceed their target. Conversely, officials at one Air Force MTF  stated they have considered hiring additional private sector contractor  services when they reach their allowed federal civilian FTEs.", "During the course of our review, DOD issued its National Defense  Business Operations Plan for Fiscal Years 2018 to 2022, which states  that it would discontinue the use of federal civilian FTE targets because  they acted as artificial and arbitrary constraints on the workforce, and  encouraged the military departments to utilize hiring flexibilities to identify  the most appropriate and economical personnel type to achieve their  mission. In 2002 we reported that federal hiring policies should, among  other things, avoid arbitrary full-time equivalent or other arbitrary  numerical goals.", "Federal civilian hiring freezes. Senior officials at five of six MTFs stated  that federal civilian hiring freezes adversely affect MTF operations. As  part of planning for sequestration in fiscal year 2013, DOD imposed hiring  freezes on federal civilian personnel. Further, there was a federal  civilian hiring freeze from January 2017 to April 2017. Senior officials from three of six MTFs reported that hiring freezes lower morale and  elongate the already lengthy hiring process, even when they are granted  waivers to continue to hire. Further, senior officials from one Army MTF  stated hiring freezes limit their ability to shape their workforce, and often  result in higher costs when they increase the size of their contracted  workforce in accordance with their needs. We reported in 2018 that  defense laboratory officials we surveyed identified government-wide  hiring freezes as a challenge to hiring candidates, stating that candidates  accepted other offers due to delays created by the freeze and that hiring  efforts continue to be adversely affected even after a freeze is lifted.", "These three key hiring challenges limit the military departments\u2019 ability to  strategically consider the advantages of converting one source of support  to another, and limit their ability to hire the appropriate personnel type or  for contract vendors to fill positions. According to senior MTF officials,  these key hiring challenges and low fill rates in some areas can result in  personnel gaps that can adversely affect the operations of MTFs. When  personnel gaps arise, officials stated, military personnel often must work  additional hours or must be borrowed from other facilities. Senior officials  from one Navy MTF cited the example of a cost of about $16,000 in travel  expenses for the temporary transfer of an active duty nurse stationed in  Japan to work for a MTF in the United States for 3 months because the  MTF was not able to fill the position by other means. Additionally, senior  officials from one Air Force MTF noted that morale of its military staff is  negatively affected by extra hours and additional responsibilities placed  on them to ensure continued operations.", "Further, officials stated that personnel gaps can negatively affect care.  Due to concerns about patient safety, MTFs may decide to discontinue  some services at MTFs. Senior officials from five of six MTFs reported  discontinuing some services as a result of these challenges and referred  patients to the TRICARE network or to Veterans Affairs facilities.  Referring patients to the private sector can have secondary effects on  MTF operations, such as on hospital accreditations. Senior officials from  one Navy MTF noted that in the past fiscal year they had to refer patients  to private sector care after two hematology-oncology physicians resigned,  which may affect their hematology-oncology program\u2019s accreditation.  Senior officials at the other Navy MTF stated that in the last fiscal year  they could not meet the minimum staffing standards for labor and delivery  staff and therefore sent patients to the TRICARE network. They noted  they are also having difficulty filling key administrative positions related to  quality control of laboratory services and are concerned about  maintaining their pathology program accreditation.", "Senior officials from MTFs reported varying fill rates for military and  civilian personnel, and for the contractor personnel provided by private  sector vendors. However, officials from the MTFs we spoke with stated  that fill rates may not illustrate the availability of personnel. For example,  officials stated that authorizations for military personnel are counted as  filled even when a servicemember is deployed and therefore not working  at the MTF. In addition, MTF officials stated that any on-board civilians  without corresponding authorizations inflate the civilian fill rate, resulting  in a fill rate of greater than 100 percent. In addition, DOD officials noted  that DOD pays for contracted services and does not directly employ  contractor personnel. Therefore, the fill rate for contractors represents  either the number of authorized FTEs in the individual contract or  positions filled by contactors noted on the MTF\u2019s force planning  document, which could also result in fill rates of greater than 100 percent,  even as other positions remain unfilled. The MTFs that we spoke with  reported the following fill rates:", "Two Navy MTFs.

Specifically, DOD\u2019s 2016 Strategic Workforce Plan included  steps DOD was taking to address personnel gaps, such as a targeted  recruitment program for critical skills, including 27 harder-to-fill medical  occupations. In 2018, DOD published a Human Capital Operating Plan  which states that it replaces the previously required Strategic Workforce  Plan, but DOD does not yet have a plan of action specific to the medical  professions. Further, DOD officials stated that components are  encouraged to consider developing their own human capital operating  plans. With regard to contracting, in response to a requirement in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, DOD issued a status report in January 2018 on the development of its acquisition  strategy for health care services at MTFs. The report notes that  contracting for health care services is fragmented, and the report outlines  DOD\u2019s plan to move toward a single contract vehicle for health care  services and to establish metrics for the strategy, such as measurement  of contract fill rates.", "While these steps represent efforts to address these challenges,  responsibility for management of the federal civilian and contractor  workforces within the MHS will soon see significant changes. Specifically,  in December 2016, Congress directed the transfer of administrative  responsibility for MTFs from the military departments to the DHA.  Further, Congress amended the law in 2018 to specify that the transfer  should be completed by September 30, 2021. The law also states that  at each MTF, the Director of the DHA has the authority to determine total  workforce requirements, direct joint manning, and address personnel  staffing shortages, among other things.", "Although the DHA will soon begin to assume these responsibilities and  the challenges associated with them, a senior OASD(HA) official  responsible for human capital issues stated that the DHA currently has no  strategic total workforce plan, or similar document, to help ensure  execution of an appropriate workforce mix at its MTFs. According to  GAO\u2019s key questions to assess agency reform efforts, strategic workforce  planning should precede any staff realignments or downsizing, so that  changed staff levels do not inadvertently produce skills gaps or other  adverse effects that could result in increased use of overtime and  contracting. GAO\u2019s key principles for effective strategic workforce  planning and applicable federal regulations have shown that addressing a  critical human capital challenge\u2014such as closing or reducing personnel  gaps\u2014requires tailored human capital strategies and tools and metrics by  which to monitor and evaluate progress toward reducing gaps. Although  many hiring challenges are longstanding government-wide issues, GAO\u2019s  model of strategic human capital management states that agencies need  not wait for comprehensive civil service reform to modernize their human  capital approaches. In addition, according to OPM\u2019s standards for  strategic workforce planning, human capital strategies should be  integrated with acquisition plans, among other things, such as DOD\u2019s  acquisition strategy for health care services at MTFs.", "As the DHA finalizes its plans for assuming administrative control of  MTFs, senior leaders may find that they face the same challenges  reported by the military departments in executing an appropriate  workforce mix. DHA could mitigate these challenges to executing the  appropriate workforce mix in the MTFs by engaging in strategic workforce  planning, including tailored human capital strategies, tools, and metrics by  which to monitor and evaluate progress toward reducing gaps, and  integrating this planning with DOD\u2019s acquisition strategy for health care  services at MTFs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Military Departments and DHA Have Not Decided How Military Personnel Will Meet Operational and Beneficiary Missions after the Transfer of Administrative Responsibility for MTFs to DHA", "paragraphs": ["The planned transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs from the  military departments to the DHA may present challenges to DOD\u2019s  management of military personnel.

However, DOD\u2019s stated desire  to place greater emphasis on the readiness mission may affect current  MTF staffing practices. For example, military department officials told us  that it is common practice to assign military personnel to locations that  face challenges in hiring federal civilian and contractor medical personnel  to maintain access to medical care in these locations. However, the  transfer implementation plan states that the departments will provide  military personnel to the MTFs only to the extent that the MTFs can  provide sufficient workload to maintain providers\u2019 military medical  Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs). KSAs are a metric for military  operational readiness that DOD has not yet finalized. Officials responsible  for planning the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs to the  DHA stated that the emphasis on fulfilling KSAs in the future may result in  concentrating military providers in larger MTFs, which can provide  opportunities for providers to fulfill KSAs. However, this change could  create a disadvantage for smaller facilities, which may not be able to  provide military providers with as much practice and already face  challenges in hiring federal civilian and contractor personnel.", "Second, DHA and the military departments have not clearly identified how  they will mitigate the effect of deployments of military medical personnel  on MTF operations. When medical personnel are deployed out of MTFs  to provide operational care, their absence can create a gap or reduction  in capability at the affected MTF, according to military department  officials. The military departments, prior to the transfer, manage  deployments and are responsible for ensuring appropriate staffing at the  MTFs in the absence of deployed personnel. Officials at all six of the  MTFs we visited cited challenges with mitigating the effect of  deployments on MTF operations. DOD has stated that after the transition,  there will be no barriers to the military departments\u2019 access to personnel  for deployment, and has highlighted options for addressing staffing gaps,  such as using borrowed military personnel, contractors, or referral to the  TRICARE network. However, officials at all six of the MTFs we spoke with  stated that contracting for medical services was not sufficiently timely or  effective, and officials at one MTF noted that referral to the TRICARE  network was difficult in their area.", "According to officials within the MTFs of the National Capital Region,  which is directly managed by the DHA and not the military departments,  management of deployments and their adverse effect on hospital staffing  has been a challenge. For example, officials cited a period in the summer  of 2017 when, due to overlapping deployments across military  departments, 8 of 9 general surgeons at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital  in Virginia were simultaneously deployed, and patients had to be referred  to private providers within the TRICARE network or sent to Walter Reed  National Military Medical Center in Maryland.", "Although the military departments and the DHA have executed a  Memorandum of Agreement concerning coordination for service  personnel to fill scheduled deployments, this does not always prevent  gaps in medical specialties. For example, officials noted that requests for  volunteer deployments are not always vetted through NCR management.  Further, addressing these gaps can be challenging. Specifically, officials  cited difficulties in successfully contracting for medical services and  reported that requests for backfill support from the reserve components  has associated costs and is difficult to execute.", "Third, DHA and the military departments have not clearly identified how  they will manage changes to the size or composition of the active duty  medical workforce that affect workforce balance within MTFs. Since 2008,  the military departments have been prohibited from converting medical  positions designated for military personnel to positions that can be filled  by federal civilians\u2014even when such conversions would result in cost  savings. Air Force headquarters officials noted that they have identified  more than 4,000 medical positions to review for possible conversion to  achieve cost savings, particularly in medical specialties with excess  military personnel, such as family practice and pharmacy. Air Force  officials previously identified 4,724 positions for conversion beginning in  fiscal year 2005, of which 1,449 were completed before the prohibition  was enacted. The Army planned to convert 4,340 military positions from  fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2011, of which 1,459 were completed  before the prohibition was enacted. The Army restored 165 of planned  conversions for fiscal year 2007, and reversed, or offset the remaining  through growth in the active duty medical force after the prohibition was  enacted.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 allows for  the prohibition on such conversions to be lifted after DOD submits a  report that defines the military medical and dental requirements  necessary to meet operational medical force readiness requirements, and  lists the positions necessary to meet such requirements. However,  decisions on conversions taken by the departments could affect MTF  operations. Specifically, existing challenges with hiring federal civilian  personnel could create challenges with military-to-civilian conversions.  For example, DOD has stated that during the previous round of military to  federal civilian conversions, changes in local market conditions affected  the ability of the military departments to fill converted positions with  civilians in a timely fashion. Medical headquarters officials the Army  stated that they currently have no intention to use conversions if the  prohibition is lifted; Navy officials stated they currently do not plan to use  conversions since their military personnel requirements exceed their  authorizations. Senior officials from one Navy MTF we spoke with stated  that if conversions occurred, recruitment and retention challenges related  to hiring federal civilian employees would need to be addressed to ensure  such positions are filled.", "In addition, military department policies can affect workforce balance  within MTFs. Specifically, in its modeling for operational medical  personnel requirements, the Air Force includes a preference for  uniformed personnel to receive primary care from uniformed medical  personnel. Officials told us that this approach, known as the Critical Home  Station, is because Air Force leadership believes that performance of this  function by military personnel provides for increased accountability for  medical readiness. For example, senior officials from one Air Force MTF  stated they believe the policy is important for the Air Force to maintain  access to information about health factors that could render a  servicemember not medically qualified to deploy. Air Force medical  headquarters officials estimate that the policy results in 2,000 positons  reserved for military personnel that could be designated for federal civilian  or contractor performance.", "Leading practices for results-oriented government state that cooperating  federal agencies need to sustain and enhance their collaboration in  several ways, including the development of policies and procedures to  operate across agency boundaries and agreement on their respective  roles and responsibilities. However, planning for the transition by the  DHA and the military departments has not yet included development of  policies and procedures for management of military personnel and  agreement on specific roles and responsibilities for the military  departments and the DHA in this process. The MHS process for  collaborating across agency boundaries, known as MHS Governance,  emphasizes collaborative work in the management of the MHS. This  forum could provide an opportunity for the military departments and the  DHA to develop policies and procedures for management of military  personnel and agree on specific roles and responsibilities for the military  departments and the DHA in this process. Until DHA and the military  departments develop such policies and procedures and agrees on roles  and responsibilities, the MHS may continue to face a number of  challenges related to the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs  to the DHA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the size of the MHS, its central importance to the success of DOD\u2019s  mission, and its cost, having the right mix of military, federal civilian, and  contractor personnel providing medical care within MTFs and in deployed  operational settings should be a key priority for DOD leadership. While  the military departments have policies and procedures in place to assess  medical workforce mix in both settings, the shortcomings we have  highlighted present barriers to achieving an appropriate workforce mix.  Recently, such as in the 2018 National Defense Business Operations  Plan, DOD has emphasized the need to reassess who can most  efficiently perform all aspects of DOD\u2019s mission. However, the military  departments\u2019 planning processes for operational medical personnel  requirements continue to rely solely on military personnel, despite the use  of federal civilians and contractors in operational settings, and the military  departments have not developed full information on the cost of their  medical forces and incorporated such information into decision-making  processes about the mix of active and reserve component personnel.  Similarly, the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs to the DHA  represents an opportunity to reassess workforce mix at the MTFs.  However, long-standing challenges in the management of federal civilian  and contractor personnel, coupled with challenges related to the  management of medical personnel after the transfer, could overshadow  and cast doubt on the success of that reform. Without addressing the  concerns we have highlighted, DOD may miss the opportunity presented  by current transformation efforts in the MHS to ensure it has in place the  most cost-effective mix of personnel in its workforce to accomplish its  medical mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making five recommendations to the Department of Defense.", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the military departments,  perform an assessment of the suitability of federal civilian and contractor  personnel to provide operational medical care and incorporate the results  of the assessment into relevant policies, if warranted.

DOD Directive 1100.4 states that authorities should consider  all available sources when determining workforce mix. DOD Instruction  1100.22 directs the steps that workforce planning authorities must take in  planning for personnel requirements and emphasizes consideration of all  potential workforce sources and an accurate understanding of personnel  costs. We also reviewed related DOD documentation on identifying  military essential positons and the use of alternative workforces.  Specifically, DOD\u2019s National Defense Business Operations Plan for fiscal  years 2018 through 2022 states that workforce rationalization strategies  include, among other things, reassessing military manpower allocations  for military essentiality and identifying functions and positions that are  commercial in nature that may be appropriately or efficiently delivered via  private sector support. Moreover, DOD\u2019s 2017 Workforce Rationalization  Plan recognizes DOD\u2019s civilians as an essential enabler of its mission  capabilities and operational readiness and noted that there are numerous  opportunities for the military departments, combatant commands, and  others to make well-reasoned adjustments to workforce mix.", "To determine the extent to which federal civilians and contractors were  deployed to provide medical care we reviewed federal civilian and  contractor deployment data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. We analyzed data for this timeframe to enable us to identify deployments over  the last 5 years, and fiscal year 2017 was the most recent full fiscal year  of available data at the time of our review. To assess the reliability of  these data, we electronically tested the data to identify obvious problems  with completeness or accuracy and interviewed knowledgeable agency  officials about the data. We found the data to be limited in that the  deployment data may not be sufficiently reliable for identifying the  universe of deployments. However, we found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting that federal civilians and contractors  have been deployed to provide medical care. Further, we interviewed  officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness (USD(P&R)), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Health Affairs (OASD(HA)), Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory  Service, the military departments, and selected combatant commands to  identify considerations and any challenges of using different personnel  categories as workforce alternatives for meeting operational medical  requirements.", "To determine the appropriate use of the active and reserve components  for DOD\u2019s operational medical personnel military requirements, we  compared the military departments\u2019 efforts in assessing their active and  reserve balance to DOD and department-level policies and guidance.  Specifically, in a 2013 DOD report issued in response to section 1080A of  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, DOD  established five factors that play a key role in active and reserve  component balance decisions, including the cost of unit manning, training,  and equipping. According to the report, cost is often outweighed by other  factors when making active component and reserve component mix  decisions, but should always be considered in active component and  reserve component mix decisions. DOD Instruction 7041.04 has guidance  for military departments to use to identify the full cost of their active  component, federal civilian, and contractor workforces. Moreover, we  interviewed officials from the military departments to discuss: (1) how they  determine their operational medical requirements and if they identified the  full cost of active and reserve component medical personnel, and (2) the  use of the active and reserve components for operational requirements  and any efforts to assess the balance of active and reserve component  medical personnel.", "To determine the mix of active and reserve component medical  personnel, we analyzed authorization data from the Health Manpower  and Personnel Data System for fiscal year 2017.
