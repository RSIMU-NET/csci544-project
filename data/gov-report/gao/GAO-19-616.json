This report examines (1) the challenges SEAs and selected school districts face implementing the ESSA educational stability provisions for youth in foster care, and (2) how Education provides technical assistance and monitors state implementation efforts. GAO surveyed SEA foster care points of contact in the 50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and all but one state responded. In addition to interviewing federal officials, GAO interviewed selected state and local educational and child welfare agency officials, and held discussion groups with foster youth and parents, in three states selected by number of youth in foster care, among other factors. GAO also held discussion groups with officials from 14 SEAs and 5 state child welfare agencies, and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, and technical assistance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State educational agencies (SEAs) reported several challenges in implementing the provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) related to educational stability for youth in foster care. In their responses to GAO's national survey, SEAs reported challenges, including high turnover among local educational and child welfare agency officials, and with identifying and arranging transportation to schools for students (see figure). Turnover of local staff can result in the loss of knowledge and experience needed to implement the provisions, according to SEA and local officials we interviewed. Regarding transportation, ESSA requires school districts to work with child welfare agencies to provide and fund transportation so that youth in foster care can remain in their current school when it is in their best interest. Six school district and child welfare agency officials we interviewed indicated that funding was a concern and some noted that transporting youth to their current school can result in extensive costs.", "The Department of Education (Education) provided technical assistance in the form of written guidance, webinars, and in-person meetings to help states implement the ESSA educational stability provisions. Education officials said they also plan to monitor state implementation of the provisions. Most SEA officials reported in GAO's survey that they would like additional assistance and more opportunities to interact with other state officials. Education plans to convene a community of practice for several states in which participants will meet regularly for several months, and is exploring other technical assistance efforts. To share information about implementing the ESSA educational stability provisions, Education maintains an email address list of SEA foster care points of contact. GAO found that the list was inaccurate and not regularly updated. Education updated the list in late summer 2019 and plans to do so quarterly. Education also provides information online, but the information is scattered across different web pages. Twenty-two SEA officials reported on GAO's survey that a clearinghouse of information would be extremely helpful. Federal standards for internal control require agencies to externally communicate necessary information in a manner that enables them to achieve their objectives. Without a dedicated web page about implementing the provisions, states may not receive the assistance they need to improve educational stability for youth in foster care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education develop an online clearinghouse of resources.

Youth in foster care experience much higher levels of  residential instability than their peers, and it is not uncommon for a  student to change schools when changing living placements. Studies  from two states, Colorado and California, showed that approximately 9  percent of youth in foster care in those states attended at least three  schools in one school year. We previously reported that student mobility  has a negative effect on students\u2019 academic achievement. Specifically, we cited research that found that students who change schools more  frequently than other students tended to have lower scores on  standardized reading and math tests and drop out of school at higher  rates than their less mobile peers.", "The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of  2008 (Fostering Connections Act) aimed to improve educational stability  for youth in foster care by requiring, among other things, that state child  welfare agencies participating in the federal foster care program  coordinate with local educational agencies (LEAs) to ensure that youth in  foster care remain in the school in which they are enrolled at the time of  each placement (also referred to in this report as the current school or  school of origin), if it is in the best interest of the child. The Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), which reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), included similar requirements for state  educational agencies (SEAs) participating in Title I, Part A of the ESEA to  generally maintain such children in their school of origin. ESSA also  established requirements for participating LEAs to collaborate with child  welfare agencies to develop and implement written procedures governing  how transportation to the youth\u2019s school of origin will be provided,  arranged, and funded, if it is in the youth\u2019s best interest to stay there. If it  is not in the youth\u2019s best interest to remain in their school of origin, the  youth must immediately be enrolled in a new school, even if the youth is  unable to produce records normally required for enrollment.

The survey  included questions about the practices states employed to implement the  ESSA educational stability provisions, challenges they faced, and their  views of federal technical assistance and guidance. We also conducted  site visits to Arizona, Georgia, and Ohio to obtain information on how  some SEAs, school districts, and child welfare agencies are implementing  these provisions. We selected these three states based on a mix of  factors, including the type of child welfare agency (state- or county-  administered) and whether the number of children in foster care  exceeded the national average. We also sought diversity in location;  variety in types of school districts; and percentage of students attending  school in urban, rural, or suburban districts. We selected three school  districts to visit in each state\u2014an urban, rural, and suburban district\u2014 where we met with the school district officials responsible for  implementing the ESSA educational stability provisions and their primary  child welfare agency counterpart. We conducted three discussion  groups\u2014two with SEA officials and one with state child welfare agency  officials\u2014that focused on the educational stability provisions in ESSA. In  total, these groups included representatives from 14 SEAs and five state  child welfare agencies. During our site visits, we also held two discussion  groups with foster parents and three with current or former youth in foster  care to gain their perspectives on educational stability.

Specifically, in our survey, 43 of 51 SEAs  reported turnover of local child welfare agency points of contact as at  least somewhat challenging. A similar number of respondents (39)  reported facing challenges with turnover of school district points of  contact (see fig. 1). During our discussion group, state child welfare  agency officials highlighted turnover of local child welfare agency and  school district staff as one of the most significant challenges their states  face in ensuring educational stability for youth in foster care.", "In addition to turnover itself being a challenge, several other challenges  reported by SEAs are related to staff turnover, according to officials we  spoke with from four state and local educational and child welfare  agencies. Specifically:", "Thirty-two SEA survey respondents identified maintaining an accurate  list of school district foster care points of contact for their state as  challenging, and officials from four state and local educational and  child welfare agencies we spoke with stated turnover makes it difficult  to keep these lists updated. One SEA point of contact said that when  she sends emails to school district points of contact, she receives  numerous responses each time from school district staff saying they  are no longer the point of contact. Officials we interviewed at one  school district noted that they tried to identify a new point of contact at  another school district, but the list on the state website had not been  updated.", "Thirty-eight SEAs reported on our survey that ensuring that school  district points of contact are aware of their responsibilities is a  challenge. Eight state and local educational and child welfare agency  officials we interviewed echoed this observation and cited staff  turnover as leading to a lack of awareness of responsibilities or  protocols related to the ESSA educational stability provisions.", "Local staff being unaware of their responsibilities under ESSA can  lead to conflicts, according to officials from two state and three local  agencies we interviewed, and resolving conflicts between school  districts and local child welfare agencies was a challenge reported by  three-quarters (38) of SEA survey respondents. For example, officials  at one local child welfare agency said they encountered school district  officials who did not believe a youth in foster care could attend their  current school, since their foster parent lived outside the school  district. To resolve the conflict, the school district point of contact  discussed the provisions with the school officials.", "To alleviate challenges related to turnover, SEA points of contact we  surveyed and interviewed explained that they regularly provide  information to local school district and child welfare agency officials on the  ESSA educational stability provisions. To inform and remind local officials  about the provisions, a few of these officials said they send emails to  school district points of contact or provide training on the provisions at  orientation for new staff at child welfare agencies. In all three states we  visited, the SEAs and/or state child welfare agencies said they held joint  presentations for both school districts and local child welfare agencies,  and SEA officials in Georgia said they are considering holding regional  collaborative meetings every four to six months. In addition, most SEAs  reported on our survey that they work with their state child welfare  agencies to provide or develop assistance, guidance, and sample  documents or templates to facilitate implementation of the ESSA  educational stability provisions at the local level. (See tables 1 and 2 in  appendix II for more information on this assistance.)", "School District Input for Best Interest Determinations  On our survey, 34 of 50 SEAs reported that ensuring school districts  participate in best interest determinations is a challenge (see fig. 2). Two  of five state child welfare agency officials in our discussion group also  described challenges related to the lack of collaboration between child  welfare agencies and schools on best interest determinations. While  ESSA does not prescribe who should be involved in the best interest  determination, the joint federal guidance encourages state and local child  welfare and educational agencies, including school districts, to develop a  process that involves all relevant parties. School district involvement,  however, depends on child welfare agencies informing them when a child  enters foster care or changes homes.", "Officials we interviewed at several child welfare agencies indicated they  may not include school districts or schools in these determinations due to  time constraints. Child welfare officials explained that removing a child  from a home and placing them into foster care is a chaotic time and many  steps need to be taken to quickly provide the child with a safe  environment. During this time, caseworkers may lack the capacity to  collaborate with school districts or schools. Child welfare agency officials  at two local offices we visited explained that they prioritize a child\u2019s health  and safety when placing a child in a new foster home and that they place  a greater focus on these issues than on educational stability.", "Some child welfare agency officials we spoke with said they do not  always need school district input to make a best interest determination.  For example, officials at two local child welfare agencies said that in some  cases, the commute to a child\u2019s current school may be so long that  remaining there is clearly not in a child\u2019s best interest. Officials from one  state and two local child welfare agencies told us they assume it is in the  best interest of the child to remain at their current school. Officials from  the state child welfare agency said they do not believe they need to  consult with school districts to make that decision. Officials at another  local child welfare agency said it would not be helpful to collaborate with  school districts on the best interest determination, since the child welfare  officials do not believe where the child attends school is the highest  priority. However, youth we spoke with in our discussion groups told us  that changing schools can create several challenges (see text box).", "Officials from other state and local child welfare agencies told us they  recognize the need to involve school districts and are taking steps to try  to include them in best interest determinations. For example, one state  child welfare agency we visited includes a line for the school district point  of contact\u2019s signature on the state\u2019s best interest determination form; however, we heard from officials at a local child welfare agency that the  school district point of contact may not be involved in making the best  interest determination, and the form may not be consistently used.  Officials at a local child welfare agency told us that they hold best interest  determination meetings with the school district by phone because these  meetings are faster to schedule than in-person meetings. Rather than  speaking with school district staff, officials from four local child welfare  agencies said they try to contact school staff that may be close to a child,  such as a counselor or teacher, but officials from three of these agencies  said they may not do so in every case.", "Thirty-seven of 50 SEAs reported on our survey that assisting school  districts with identifying or arranging transportation is at least somewhat  challenging (see fig. 3).", "To help school districts and local child welfare agencies identify  transportation options, SEAs in two states we visited provide guidance or  other documents to these agencies that describe potential transportation  options. School district and local child welfare agency officials we spoke  with reported using different approaches to transport youth, including  having foster parents, school district or child welfare staff, or the youth  drive to school; rerouting buses; hiring a taxi or other private  transportation service; or using public transportation. Sometimes they  reported combining these methods to transport youth to their current  school. However, eight school district and local child welfare officials  noted difficulties with their options, including limited options in rural areas  and lack of appropriate transportation for younger youth and those with  behavioral issues. For example, an Arizona local child welfare official  explained that while they can use taxis to transport youth, they are not  approved for use for children age 6 and younger. Foster parents and  youth we spoke with shared challenges they have experienced with  transportation to the school of origin (see text box).", "Experiences of Selected Foster Parents and Youth with Transportation to School  of Origin  Multiple foster parents in two states we visited shared that they were told by child welfare  case workers that the foster parent(s) would have to transport children in their care to  school for those children to remain in their current school. They told us that sometimes  they could not drive the child due to distance or the needs of other youth in their care,  and the child transferred to a new school.  We also heard that other modes of transportation may be unreliable or cause difficulties  for a child\u2019s schedule. For example:", "One child in foster care in Arizona told us that she missed a week of school because  the taxi provided by the child welfare agency failed to pick her up.  A child in a foster care group home in Ohio said that despite being placed in a  school which was in the same school district as her school of origin, her commute  was long\u2014she needed to take two public buses\u2014and she sometimes missed  dinner.", "On our survey, 30 of 50 SEAs reported that helping school districts  determine how to fund the additional transportation costs\uf8e7defined in the  joint federal guidance as the difference between what a school district  would otherwise spend transporting a student to their assigned school  and the cost of transporting a child in foster care to their school of origin\uf8e7  is also challenging. Among these 30 SEAs, 12 noted it was very or  extremely challenging. Six school district and child welfare agency  officials we interviewed also indicated that funding was a concern and  some noted that transporting youth to their school of origin can result in  extensive additional costs (see text box).", "Examples of Transportation Costs to Maintain Youth in Foster Care in Their  School of Origin", "Over a school year, officials from a local child welfare agency said it spent  $155,000 to transport students in one school district.  According to officials at one school district, to transport one student, the school  district had to hire a van at an estimated cost of up to $30,000 per year.  In one month, another school district reported paying over $4,000 to transport  five students.", "School district and child welfare officials said that they can rely on  multiple funding streams\u2014local, state, and/or federal\u2014to cover these  additional costs. Districts and local child welfare agencies reported that  they sometimes split these costs, depending on their state\u2019s policies. (See  fig. 9 in appendix II for state-specific cost-sharing requirements reported  in our survey.) For example, in Arizona, one agency transports the child  to school and the other transports the child home and each pays for the  cost of their one-way trip. To assist localities with funding additional  transportation costs, nine SEAs said their state provides funding that  partially or fully covers these costs. While educational and child welfare  agencies may use federal funding through Title I or Title IV-E for the  additional transportation costs, some SEA, school district, and child  welfare agency officials we interviewed noted that they do not use these  funds. Officials at a few school districts said they use Title I funding for  other needs, while some child welfare agency officials explained their  agency does not use Title IV-E funds because they did not have state  \u201cmatching\u201d funding, did not understand how to use the funds to reimburse  schools for their costs, or had some youth who are not Title IV-E  eligible.", "Ensuring Accurate Identification of Youth in Foster Care  Thirty-two SEA survey respondents reported that ensuring school districts  can accurately identify youth in foster care is at least somewhat  challenging (see fig. 4). School district officials we spoke with expressed  similar concerns. Officials we interviewed in nine of 10 districts stated  they are not consistently aware of which students in their district are in  foster care, and seven explained that there is no systematic way for  school districts to be notified when a child enters or leaves care. Similarly,  officials in four local child welfare agencies said they have no systematic  way to inform schools when youth in foster care leave care or when their  status in foster care changes. Officials from two school districts also  stated their data systems have no way to indicate that a student is in  foster care, so even if the child welfare agency notifies them of a youth\u2019s  status, they may not easily track the information.", "Officials from two school districts said not knowing the status of youth in  foster care in their district impedes their ability to effectively implement the  ESSA educational stability provisions. For example, one district official  stated they would probably be transporting more youth to their school of  origin if they knew which students were in foster care. In addition, two  school district officials said that if they do not know which students are in  foster care, they cannot provide additional supports that may be available  to these youth, such as tutoring, financial assistance, or mental health  services. The ability of school districts to accurately identify youth in foster  care can also affect the accuracy of state and local report cards. Nine  SEAs reported on our survey that they rely exclusively on school districts\u2019  identification of youth in foster care for their state report cards. Of those  nine, seven reported that ensuring that school districts accurately identify  these youth is a challenge, which may affect the accuracy of the  additional report card data required by ESSA.", "Some states and localities we visited had different ways to inform school  districts when a youth\u2019s foster care status changes, but officials noted  varying degrees of consistency in notifying the districts of changes.  Officials at two state child welfare agencies we visited told us they require  the person enrolling the youth in school to present an official document  that shows the youth is in state custody; however, they said schools are  not informed when a child leaves foster care. One county and one state  we visited had electronic data sharing agreements between child welfare  and educational agencies for the purposes of updating school district  records when a child enters and leaves foster care. Specifically, in that  county, once a child enters foster care under the custody of the county  child welfare agency, the school district\u2019s database automatically receives  pertinent information from the child welfare agency, according to officials.  School and child welfare agency officials meet monthly to ensure data  accuracy. In Georgia, officials from the state educational agency said they  signed a data sharing agreement in spring 2018 with the state child  welfare agency to allow information about youth in foster care to be provided to school districts. The previous data sharing agreement  prevented the SEA from sharing the data with the school districts,  according to officials. In Idaho (a state that participated in our discussion  group), state officials said they ensure school districts are aware of youth  in foster care by using an automated letter (see text box).", "Idaho\u2019s iCARE System for Youth in Foster Care  When a youth enters foster care or changes placements, Idaho\u2019s iCARE system  produces an automated letter that provides an initial communication from a child welfare  social worker to the school district, SEA foster care points of contact, and the school  principal.  When the youth\u2019s school of origin is entered into the system, the letter automatically  populates the email addresses of the appropriate school district point of contact, SEA  point of contact, and school principal. The letter contains the social worker\u2019s initial best  interest determination, and indicates if the student will need transportation to attend their  school of origin, which the school district point of contact is responsible for coordinating.  The school district point of contact has three days to provide input on the best interest  determination when school is in session and 14 days during the summer months. The  school district foster care point of contact and the child welfare social worker both must  sign off on the plan identified within the electronic letter.", "Monitoring School Districts\u2019 Efforts to Implement ESSA Educational  Stability Provisions  Under federal grant regulations, SEAs, which subgrant Title I funds to  school districts, are required to conduct regular monitoring and oversight  to ensure appropriate implementation of Title I by their school districts,  and 43 SEA survey respondents reported that their states used one of the  methods asked about in our survey to monitor how school districts  implement at least one of the ESSA educational stability provisions. For  example, over half (33) of SEAs reported that the Title I plans they  receive from school districts include an assurance related to at least one  of the ESSA educational stability provisions we asked about on the  survey.", "More than two-thirds (36) of SEAs reported on our survey that effectively  monitoring school districts\u2019 implementation of the provisions is a  challenge (see fig. 5). In their survey comments, eight SEA points of  contact said limited state resources hinder their ability to ensure that the  hundreds of school districts in their states properly execute the  provisions. Officials we interviewed from all three SEAs in our site visits  told us their states incorporate the educational stability provisions into  their existing procedures for overseeing implementation of federal  education programs. For example, SEA officials in Georgia told us that  during one of their state reviews, they look for evidence of local agency  collaboration, such as meeting agendas or emails. In Arizona, the SEA  point of contact said he examines school district transportation  procedures during on-site reviews. These on-site reviews occur for one- sixth of school districts in the state every year. (See table 3 in appendix II  for more information on SEA monitoring of school districts.)", "Ensuring Immediate Enrollment and Obtaining Records  While we did not ask on our survey about challenges related to immediate  enrollment or obtaining records, seven state or local officials we spoke  with noted difficulties with enrolling or obtaining records for students with  disabilities who have individualized education programs, or students who  previously attended juvenile justice or residential treatment facilities.  Officials at a local child welfare agency and two school districts said that if  an individualized education program is missing from a child\u2019s records,  they cannot know which services or classes a child might need and it may  delay the child\u2019s enrollment in the school or require switching classes  again. Officials from Georgia\u2019s SEA said they mitigate this challenge by  providing school districts the option to share individualized education  programs electronically, which enables other school districts that need the  records to more easily obtain them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Could Take Steps to Improve Access to Technical Assistance and Plans to Begin Monitoring of the ESSA Educational Stability Provisions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education Provided Technical Assistance, At Times Collaborating with HHS, but Could Improve Access to Information", "paragraphs": ["Education has provided technical assistance to states, at times in  collaboration with HHS, to help states implement the ESSA educational  stability provisions.

Education and HHS jointly held a session on sharing data to support  students in foster care during its Combined Federal Programs  Meeting for SEA officials in December 2018 in Washington, DC. At  this meeting, Education also facilitated a session during which foster  care points of contact networked with each other and subject matter  experts, shared resources, and discussed outstanding implementation  challenges. In addition, Education officials told us that they assign  each state a point of contact at Education, and states can request  technical assistance at any time through their assigned contact. This  contact can work with the appropriate offices within Education to  provide information requested by states and can facilitate further  technical assistance through the State Support Network. Education  officials said they respond to questions from states generally asking  about expectations and requirements for the ESSA educational  stability provisions.", "Thirty-seven SEAs reported on our survey that they would like additional  federal assistance as they continue to implement the ESSA educational  stability provisions. Our survey showed that most SEAs were interested in  receiving additional guidance related to transportation cost sharing,  transportation funding options, and arranging transportation; data privacy;  and state monitoring of school districts\u2019 efforts to implement these  provisions, among other topics (see fig. 6). (Also see fig.10 in appendix II  for all survey responses on these topics.) With respect to transportation  issues, several state officials commented that they would like more  information on how other states and localities are arranging and funding  transportation. Regarding data privacy, a few other officials commented  that they could use more information regarding privacy laws and what  information can be shared across agencies. A few SEA officials noted  that guidance on how they could monitor school district implementation  would be useful.", "A majority of SEAs reported that opportunities for in-person and virtual  meetings with a federal point of contact and their SEA and state child  welfare agency counterparts, and a federally supported clearinghouse of  information with sample documents from other states, would be  moderately to extremely helpful (see fig. 7). (Also see fig. 11 in appendix  II for all survey responses on this topic.) State educational and child  welfare officials we interviewed explained that in-person and virtual  meetings are helpful because they allow them to ask the federal contact  questions and share and discuss issues with each other. Similarly, SEA  officials in our discussion sessions said they would like federal agencies  to organize more collaborative opportunities for SEA points of contact to  interact with their peers to help identify best practices they can adapt in  their state. Some states suggested Education could adopt methods it  uses for other programs, such as the Education for Homeless Children  and Youth program, to provide assistance and support to foster care  points of contact, such as facilitating regional phone calls and identifying  a point of contact specific to foster care at the federal level. According to  Education officials, in June 2019 the agency selected a staff person to  serve as the federal point of contact to work directly with SEA foster care  points of contact, and they told us Education maintains a designated  mailbox for all foster care-related correspondence (FosterCare@ed.gov).", "Education officials informed us that they plan to develop a community of  practice for a small group of SEA foster care points of contact who will  meet regularly for several months, which may facilitate more peer to peer  interaction for a select number of states. Education plans to work with the  Legal Center for Foster Care and Education to convene and facilitate the  community of practice. According to Education officials, the community  of practice will provide networking opportunities for participants to ask  questions and obtain answers from their peers, and may include  discussions of promising practices at the state and local level, among  other areas. Officials said they will solicit interest from all SEAs about the  opportunity to participate in the community of practice. However, they will  limit the number of participants, depending on the level of interest, to 10  to 12 SEAs to promote discussion and sharing among states. Officials  noted that if more states are interested in participating in the community  of practice than they can accommodate, they will consider additional  ways to support and share information with those additional states.  Education officials also noted that they are exploring other types of  technical assistance to facilitate more interaction and information  exchange among states, such as a web portal where states can upload  and share documents.", "Although Education is planning to develop a community of practice and is  exploring other types of technical assistance, it may not have effective  methods to reach all SEA points of contact to inform them of this  assistance. In the course of our follow up on our survey, we determined  that 22 of the current SEA points of contact were missing from  Education\u2019s email list. Education primarily disseminates information  pertaining to the ESSA educational stability requirements to states  through email. Twenty-three SEAs reported on our survey that they were  not aware of webinars that Education offered in summer 2018. We  discussed the email list with Education officials in June 2019 and they told  us they had not conducted outreach to states to update the email list  since they initially identified the SEA points of contact in 2016. Rather,  officials said the email list was updated on an ad hoc basis, and  Education depended on states to inform them when they want someone  added to the email list. Subsequent to that discussion, in response to a  recommendation included in a draft of this report which Education  reviewed, Education officials told us they updated the email list in July  and August 2019, and planned to update it quarterly moving forward.  Education officials also acknowledged it could be useful to publicize the  email list on its website.", "Education does not maintain information about its technical assistance  webinars or other relevant materials in a centralized online location.  Information relevant to implementing the ESSA educational stability  provisions is located on multiple Education web pages, and the materials  from the most recent 2018 webinars, including the recorded session and  related sample documents shared by a number of states, are only  available on a third party website for which there is no link from  Education\u2019s website. In our survey, SEA points of contact reported that  they are interested in receiving additional information from other states.  Thirty-seven SEAs reported in our survey that a clearinghouse of  information with sample documents from other states would be helpful,  and 22 of these 37 reported that this would be extremely helpful. One  SEA official commented that it would be useful to have a clearinghouse  that could be shared with school districts and other relevant parties  nationwide. Federal standards for internal control maintain that  management should select appropriate methods of communication, such  as providing hard copy or electronic documents or conducting face-to- face meetings, and should periodically evaluate the methods of  communication in order to communicate quality information on a timely  basis. Without creating and maintaining a centralized online location for  SEAs to access all related information, Education cannot ensure that all  SEAs have access to technical assistance and guidance that could help  them implement the ESSA educational stability provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Plans to Begin Monitoring Implementation of the ESSA Educational Stability Provisions in Fall 2020", "paragraphs": ["Education officials told us that in 2020, they expect to fully implement the  monitoring protocols for reviewing how states are implementing the ESSA  educational stability provisions.

According to Education officials, once the protocols are implemented,  they plan to use a risk assessment approach to determine which states to  review each year, and anticipate reviewing approximately nine states  each year, depending on staff and resources. As part of their reviews,  Education officials told us they plan to visit two school districts in each  state under review to assess how the selected states are implementing  the ESSA requirements, and to determine whether districts are getting  appropriate support from the states.

In addition, SEA officials are seeking more opportunities to  understand how other states and localities have implemented the  provisions and learn from their peers. Despite the assistance Education  has provided to SEAs on a range of topics, the mechanisms Education  uses to inform states of assistance are limited.
