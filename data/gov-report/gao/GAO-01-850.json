The Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) share the federal government's responsibility for the program's funding and execution. Since its inception, the program has received more than $761 million in funding. One third of this amount has been spent to procure critical items.

Such an accident could affect people in 10 different states. The Army plans to destroy its entire chemical weapons stockpile by 2007 and is taking measures to protect the public before and during the demilitarization process. In 1988, the Army established the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program to assist the 10 states with communities near the eight storage facilities obtain the additional necessary equipment and training they need to be fully prepared to protect the public, the facilities\u2019 workforces, and the environment in the unlikely event of a chemical stockpile accident. The Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency share the federal government\u2019s responsibility for the program\u2019s funding and execution. On the basis of varying needs for critical items (such as warning sirens, protective equipment, and response plans) required by the states, the Army and the agency agree that when these items are in place, the states and communities are fully prepared to respond to a chemical emergency. The program established a self-imposed goal of reaching full preparedness by 1998. In 1999, the Army estimated that the program would cost about $1.2 billion through 2010.", "In 1997, on the basis of a congressional request, we reported on the status of the program and identified several key management weaknesses. After an accidental chemical release at the storage facility in Utah in May 2000, you requested that we perform another assessment of the program\u2019s status and of any continuing management problems. As agreed with your offices, we addressed the following questions: (1) What is the status of the program\u2019s funding? (2) What progress have the communities in the 10 states made toward being fully prepared? (3) What changes in federal management relations with the states and communities in the program could help achieve the goal of full preparedness? The scope and methodology of our work are described in appendix I. Regarding reported financial information, we did not independently determine its reliability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1985, the Congress required the Department of Defense to carry out the destruction of the U.S. stockpile of chemical agents and munitions and established an organization within the Army to manage the disposal program. The Congress directed the program to provide maximum protection to the environment, the general public, the personnel involved in disposing of the chemical weapons at the eight storage sites. Further, the Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense to make grants to state and local governments, either directly or through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist them in carrying out functions related to emergency preparedness. In 1988, the Army established the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP) to help communities near the stockpile storage sites establish a full level of emergency preparedness and response capabilities. CSEPP also helps to implement the emergency preparedness at the Army installations storing the chemical stockpile.", "The Congress originally set 1994 as the date for the complete destruction of the stockpile. This date was later extended to 2007, after the Senate ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and the Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, commonly known as the Chemical Weapons Convention, on April 24, 1997. Under the convention, April 29, 2007, is the deadline for the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles.", "CSEPP is a partnership between the Army, as custodian of the chemical stockpile, FEMA, which has long-standing experience in preparing for and dealing with all types of emergencies, and state and local governments. In October 1997, the Army and FEMA signed a revised memorandum of understanding under which FEMA assumed responsibility for off-post (civilian community) program activities. The Army continued to manage \u201con-post\u201d (installation) emergency preparedness and provide technical and financial support for both off-post and on-post activities. FEMA provides the civilian community with expertise, guidance, training, and other support. Specifically, FEMA\u2019s CSEPP roles and responsibilities are to (1) administer the off-post funds; (2) support the states in developing response plans; (3) prepare, develop, deliver, and evaluate training; (4) provide technical assistance; and (5) develop programs for evaluating off-post readiness. Similarly, the states and communities also have responsibility for developing response plans and evaluating resource requirements. To improve overall management, the Army and FEMA use 12 \u201cbenchmarks,\u201d or performance measures, to execute the program and report on its status. These performance measures were revised in January 2000 and are now also used for budgeting, accountability, and for assessing the status of states\u2019 preparedness to respond to chemical emergencies.", "The Army\u2019s Chemical Demilitarization Program (including CSEPP) has a 1999 total life-cycle (from start to finish) cost estimate of about $15 billion. The Army periodically updates the estimate. In 1985, the Army\u2019s original cost estimate for the disposal project, the largest portion of the program, was $1.7 billion. This grew to nearly $10 billion in 1999. In 1988, it estimated that the cost of CSEPP would be $114 million. CSEPP has a 1999 life-cycle cost estimate of $1.2 billion. Sharing responsibility for the program, the Army provides the 10 states and the local communities near the storage sites with funding for the off-post program through FEMA. As with other emergency preparedness programs, FEMA administers this program through its regional offices to the states.", "Under the current management arrangement, the Army, FEMA, and the states and counties share responsibility for preparing CSEPP annual budgets. The states and counties are responsible for identifying the requirements and developing annual requests for the critical items that they believe are needed to be fully prepared to respond to a chemical emergency. After each state prepares its initial budget proposal, it negotiates an acceptable level of funding for its proposed projects with the appropriate FEMA regional office. The approved budget proposal is then forwarded to FEMA\u2019s headquarters for further review and approval. After the Army approves a total funding amount that it will transfer to FEMA for CSEPP\u2019s off-post activities, FEMA\u2019s headquarters prepares a Cooperative Agreement with specific activities, funding, and periods of performance for each state. On the basis of these Cooperative Agreements, FEMA issues funds received from the Army as needed throughout the fiscal year to match a state\u2019s budgeted CSEPP spending. The states then apportion the funds among various state agencies and the local communities (counties and cities) surrounding the sites for their CSEPP operations.", "Although the Army\u2019s Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization is responsible for the stockpile\u2019s safe destruction, the current arrangement between the Army and FEMA does not provide the Program Manager with direct responsibility for CSEPP. However, in the past, FEMA has received supplemental funding from the Program Manager to help meet CSEPP\u2019s unexpected funding needs. But the Program Manager told us that the program no longer has any uncommitted funds on hand to support CSEPP\u2019s activities.", "The greatest risk to the local community is from an event that would cause a chemical release while the chemical weapons are in storage. Low- probability occurrences, such as an airplane crash, earthquake, or serious accident in the storage area, could potentially cause a cloud or plume of toxic chemical agent to be released into the air, putting the surrounding community at risk of exposure. In the unlikely event of such an incident, the professional or volunteer emergency personnel in the community would be the first responders. The type of protective action response\u2014 evacuation or sheltering in place\u2014would be determined for each of the numerous zones in the counties that surround each site on the basis of recommendations made by emergency personnel at the Army post. To be able to effectively support the evacuation or shelter-in-place emergency response, local emergency management activities require that critical items, such as warning sirens, protective equipment, and response plans be in place. The Army and FEMA also fund joint training exercises that bring together the personnel, equipment, and response plans to practice emergency response preparedness. To illustrate, figure 1 shows three scenes around a decontamination unit during (training) exercises at Anniston, Alabama on March 2, 2001 and Umatilla, Oregon on May 8, 2001.", "The off-post emergency preparedness program is linked to the demilitarization program through its budget and in two other ways. First, the emergency program is designed to protect the public from a chemical emergency while the chemical weapons are in storage and during the demilitarization process. The public faces the highest risk when the stockpile is in storage because that is when the greatest amount of agent is present. When the destruction of the stockpile munitions begins, the risk to the public begins to decrease as the stockpile diminishes. When the destruction of the chemical weapons at a site is complete, the risk is gone and CSEPP funding for local preparedness ceases.", "Second, certain CSEPP and demilitarization program conditions must be met before states will agree that it is safe to begin the destruction operations. If state officials do not believe they have a satisfactory level of emergency preparedness, it will be difficult for the Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization to begin destruction of the chemical weapons at a stockpile site. This linkage between the demilitarization and the emergency preparedness programs has thus set the official date that a state must be fully prepared for a chemical emergency as the date when the demilitarization process is scheduled to begin. If a state is not prepared and thus delays the start of demilitarization operations, it will cost the Army millions of additional dollars to pay contractors and support the facility.", "The Army, FEMA, and the states continue to use the projected start of demilitarization at each facility as the goal for having the needed critical items in place at the local communities near the stockpiles. Furthermore, this date also guides their program management and funding priorities. Likewise, this date matches either state law or planning goals linking the start of demilitarization operations with CSEPP readiness. For example, Oregon requires the governor to officially sign a statement that emergency preparedness at Umatilla is adequate before operations there are authorized to begin. Officials in other states also told us that similar emergency preparedness initiatives need to be completed before demilitarization operations begin. Without state officials\u2019 agreement that their emergency preparedness is complete, the Army will not be able to begin demilitarization operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Needed for Critical Items Exceeds Projected Costs", "paragraphs": ["CSEPP\u2019s funding needs have continued to grow since 1997, after the Army said that the states would have all critical items in place by the end of 1998 and that, in particular, procurement funding requirements would diminish soon thereafter. Funding has generally been in line with the Army\u2019s estimates of total needs through fiscal year 2000, but the program has already spent nearly all the procurement funds that had been estimated as needed through fiscal year 2010. The Army and FEMA are recalculating cost estimates for fiscal years 2003-07, but according to information provided by FEMA and the states, even this revised estimate will not include money for all needed items. According to the Army\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s financial documents, through the end of fiscal year 2000, the states received about half of the total CSEPP funding. But they have received different amounts because they each have different needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Requirements Are Greater Than Program Cost Projections", "paragraphs": ["FEMA officials told us that the Army has generally funded the CSEPP program in line with the Army\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate and program cost projections, but they added that these projected amounts are less than past and current individual state requirements. For example, the states have requested unfunded critical items that exceeded the procurement funding that the Army predicted. To illustrate, through fiscal year 2000, the Army provided almost 88 percent of the total procurement expenses projected through fiscal year 2010. (See table 1.) Our review shows that needed procurement funding will exceed the amount estimated for fiscal years 2001-10. In contrast, during fiscal years 1988-2000, the program spent just over 53 percent of the total projected operation and maintenance funds.", "FEMA and the Army rely on the states and local communities to initiate funding requests. However, since the eventual funding decisions flow from the Army\u2019s budget process, the states and FEMA have found it difficult to fund any newly identifiable requirements or other valid program needs once the budget is set. Such added costs to the program arise when unanticipated critical needs are asked for by the states on the basis of unforeseen rapid population growth around some chemical storage sites or when some critical items have needed unexpected repair or replacement.", "The Army\u2019s budget for CSEPP is part of the Department of Defense\u2019 s overall program, planning, budgeting, and execution budget process,which entails long planning request lead times. The lead time for projecting budget requests is 18 to 24 months beyond the time required for a particular item or funding need. FEMA and the states and local communities have not always adequately planned for anticipated and replacement needs and have had many unanticipated needs arise within this budget window. For example, some new and unanticipated CSEPP requests were not included in the Army\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s budgets for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 because the Army\u2019s budget is already set and cannot be expanded. As a result, when budget cost estimates and funding are below the program\u2019s actual requirements, FEMA and Army officials told us that FEMA has had to delay or spread out funding for some critical items. When FEMA and Army officials have to deny such funding requests, or so- called \u201cunfunded requests,\u201d from the states because funds are not available, they deny the states and local communities the opportunity for reaching full preparedness by not providing needed critical items in a timely manner.", "Correspondingly, if the Army and FEMA do not assist the states and local communities in accurately identifying requirements in a timely matter and determining the appropriate levels of funding, the states may not be fully prepared when chemical demilitarization is set to start. Any delay in achieving full preparedness could, in turn, delay the start of chemical demilitarization operations and would potentially cost the Army millions of dollars and jeopardize meeting the 2007 deadline. This unacceptable scenario may call for increased federal funding and funding in a more timely fashion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Life-Cycle Cost Estimate Understates Future Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Army, with the assistance of FEMA and the states, began updating the CSEPP life-cycle cost estimate in March 2000 and recalculating cost estimates for fiscal years 2003-7. Army and FEMA officials said that the estimate would increase by about $90 million. Though the revised cost estimate was not available to us at the time of our review, FEMA and state officials told us that not all the critical items that states will require nor the associated funding for all needed items were included. Our discussions with federal, state and local CSEPP officials identified several items, costing at least $50 million, which were not included in the projected procurement funding requirements. State officials told us that because of population growth and unexpected equipment replacement needs, they were not able to anticipate these critical needs. Such unfunded items include a communications system for the counties and the state of Oregon, the overpressurization of facilities in Alabama, and highway reader boards (signs) in Indiana. FEMA officials told us they would try to add additional funding needs to the revised cost estimate this summer. However, it is unlikely that these additions will include all of the items needed in the near future. These needed items have to be funded through new appropriations. Though FEMA and the Army have some discretion to reprogram or reallocate some funds for newly identified CSEPP needs, this discretion is limited, and there are few available funds to reprogram to meet unfunded requests.", "In many cases, personnel in the local communities do not have adequate experience and training to understand, identify, and prepare requests to meet federal and state budget and cost estimates. Thus, FEMA officials told us that state and local CSEPP officials have not always adequately identified the critical items they will need. As a result, the latest cost estimate is not sufficient to fund all critical items, and funding for the program will have to be increased in order to procure all needed items to achieve full preparedness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most CSEPP Program Funds Support Off-Post Activities", "paragraphs": ["Since the inception of the CSEPP program in 1989, the Army has provided $761.8 million in funding.

Most of the growth in program costs has been in FEMA\u2019s off-post program, while funding for the on-post program has stabilized at about $30 million annually since fiscal year 1993. Typical on-post-funding requirements include alert and notification and communication equipment, as well as emergency operations personnel and training expenditures. Likewise, off-post funding requirements encompass similar expenditures plus public awareness activities and exercises. The Army\u2019s on-post activities received $270.2 million, or about one-third of the funding, and FEMA\u2019s off-post activities received $491.6 million, or about two-thirds.

Under this principle, FEMA provides each state or local community with adequate assets to meet a level of response capability agreed to by FEMA, the Army, and the states. Thus, FEMA and the Army provide the states with levels of funding support according to their requirements and mutually agreed-upon needs.

In 1997, none of the states had attained all of the items deemed necessary to respond to a chemical emergency. Despite significant improvements in these states, more work is needed at the remaining three states where issues about some critical items are still unresolved. One of the counties in Alabama, Calhoun, has no agreed-upon response plan and has not informed the public about the actions they may be directed to take. This situation raises the question whether the county will be able to adequately respond to a chemical emergency.

In addition, the Maryland state CSEPP director told us that an active cooperative community effort, such as participation in integrated process team meetings, helped CSEPP achieve its goals in Maryland. Utah\u2019s and Washington\u2019s CSEPP officials indicated that communications, cooperation, teamwork, and interpersonal relationships are the root of their success in implementing CSEPP. Additionally, Washington state\u2019s CSEPP officials cited the inclusion of state and local CSEPP officials in the budgeting process as contributing factors to the program\u2019s success. These three states, like the others, have ongoing needs for equipment upgrades, equipment replacement, and/or expanding response capability.

If these issues are not resolved shortly, the start of demilitarization operations may have to be delayed. Army efforts to destroy the stockpile within the Chemical Weapons Convention\u2019s mandated time frame may also be compromised. For example, plans are for the Anniston, Alabama, site to be operational by March/April 2002\u2014 some 9 to 10 months from now\u2014requiring all critical items to be in place by this date. Among the unresolved issues facing the three states are controversies surrounding what facilities to over-pressurize, the number of highway reader boards to order, the number of shelter-in-place kits to order, and the strategy for both evacuation and sheltering in place. Delays have been attributed to issues such as (1) complicated projects that were initially managed at the local level but were later assigned to a more experienced entity to manage and (2) the lack of timely federal response to requests.", "Alabama has major unresolved issues with FEMA and the Army and is lacking five critical items (overpressurization, tone alert radios, coordinated plans, CSEPP staffing, and shelter-in-place kits). There are unresolved issues with two of these five items. Specifically, Army\u2019s, FEMA\u2019s, and Alabama\u2019s CSEPP officials have not agreed on how best to address the state\u2019s overpressurization projects and its coordinated plans. State officials told us that Calhoun County and FEMA have not agreed on the number of facilities requiring overpressurization systems. FEMA is planning to over-pressurize some portion of 28 different facilities but has funded only eight of these projects. FEMA advised us that it believes an additional request by Calhoun County is without merit and not supported by science. The issue of coordinated response plans centers on local preference for a strategy of evacuation. Despite attempts by the Army and FEMA to have the state and Calhoun County officials consider a strategy combining evacuation and sheltering in place, Alabama\u2019s overall immediate response zone counties\u2019 protective action strategy covered evacuation only. In 1999, the Army funded a study that designed a strategy with both evacuation and sheltering in place. Talladega county, Alabama, uses the study\u2019s guidebook to determine its response strategy. However, Calhoun county\u2019s CSEPP leaders and FEMA still do not agree on how to incorporate and resource a strategy that includes shelter in place.

According to state CSEPP officials, the state had proposed using the Indiana Department of Transportation\u2019s mobile reader boards during a chemical emergency. However, the transportation department decided that it could not share its reader boards with CSEPP.

For example, many local CSEPP officials do not have either the training or substantial expertise in chemical weapons, budgeting, or the acquisition of very specialized high-tech equipment needed for emergency response systems. Yet in spite of complaints by some local CSEPP officials that they need more and better technical and budgetary assistance, Army and FEMA officials have not always reached out to help communities learn what they need, how to get it, or, most importantly, who they can turn to for assistance. Army and FEMA officials said that they have provided both general and specific information on many of these topics via training opportunities, publications, and copies of exercise reports. But because they view the program as primarily a state-managed endeavor, they also normally rely on the state and local community officials to ask for such assistance.", "We found a number of cases where FEMA did not offer specific technical assistance when local CSEPP officials were having difficulties with complicated administrative processes or were unaware of available options to meet requirements. For example, several local community officials said they were unaware that various radio communication systems (tone alert radios) and alert and notification (sirens) options are available or that different states had varying experiences with contractors. Similarly, various state officials said they needed additional technical risk assessment assistance from the Army and FEMA to evaluate the toxic properties of various stored chemicals and the potential adverse exposure effects they may have on humans. Furthermore, several local community officials said that unfamiliarity with federal contracting procedures and accounting practices have caused unnecessary program delays and confusion. Particularly in the case of CSEPP\u2019s budgeting matters, the lack of assistance and guidance has created delays in requesting needed items. Many local CSEPP officials told us they still do not understand how the Army\u2019s budget process works and how to plan ahead for future requirements and acquisitions. Without accurate and timely estimates, program officials have difficulty determining how much funding they will need and when they will need it.", "We recognize the need for the Army and FEMA to give states and local communities both flexibility and sufficient independence in carrying out their programs. However, we believe that the Army and FEMA also have a responsibility to fully inform state and local CSEPP officials of the types of assistance the federal government is able and willing to provide. The FEMA officials we spoke with agreed that some local CSEPP officials may not know of the types of assistance available, but said they had, in most cases, responded to the local officials\u2019 needs. FEMA officials said that, starting in January 2001, they began to formally educate state and local officials on budgetary issues through a seminar. However, this single seminar did not reach all CSEPP staff in the states and local communities and will need to be repeated. In commenting on a draft of this report, FEMA said it is providing other budgetary assistance and guidance in the form of additional instruction on topics such as federal grants and financial processes. Most of these new initiatives had not been fully implemented at the time we ended our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ineffective Dissemination of Information and Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["Although FEMA and the Army have both been placing greater emphasis on public awareness campaigns, they have not always carried out effective public information or awareness campaigns about CSEPP in local communities. As a result, communities in some states are openly hostile or suspicious of the overall aims and goals of the program and do not see it as their own. Furthermore, FEMA has not taken the lessons learned from some of the more successful states and applied them elsewhere to avoid public relations problems or to increase overall understanding and acceptance of the program.", "One prime example of such problems has been the controversy in Alabama over two different types of responses to a chemical emergency: \u201cshelter in place,\u201d whereby people seek shelter in whatever building they are in and take specific protective actions, and evacuation, which involves leaving an area of risk until the hazard has passed and the area is safe for return. Alabama\u2019s local CSEPP communities had only planned for evacuation for years. The Army funded the production of a guidebook published in 2000 that provides emergency personnel with step-by-step instructions to evacuate or shelter in place in the event of a chemical accident or incident at the Alabama storage site. County officials claim that the Army and FEMA have been trying to use the guidebook to persuade them to adopt shelter-in-place strategies without addressing several outstanding safety issues. The Army, which funded the guidebook through FEMA under an existing Army contract at the request of the state and counties, initially refused to endorse or assume any ownership of the study. However, the Army acknowledged that local communities\u2019 continued reservations to the idea of sheltering in place raised questions about the whole CSEPP concept of sheltering-in-place. It has now formally supported the guidebook, provided that its use does not hamper the Army\u2019s ability to meet mandated alert and notification times to the off-post community. The Army also announced that it would evaluate the assumptions and scope of the guidebook for correctness and applicability.", "Much of the controversy surrounding the study and its recommended response strategy of sheltering or evacuation was due to poor relations with the Calhoun county CSEPP officials. FEMA and Army officials did not have a \u201cpartnered\u201d strategy with local community participants and a coordinated public information initiative on the study, thus causing a public relations problem that placed both agencies on the defensive and in a reactive, rather than proactive, mode. FEMA has had other controversies that led to similar public relations problems, though not as severe, in Indiana, Kentucky, and Oregon. At various times, some local community leaders have been advocating a greater proactive role by the Army and FEMA in public relations and team-building initiatives for the program\u2014 not just for emergency planning, but also for the decision-making process that comes before the planning and that requires local CSEPP officials\u2019 involvement, support, and ownership. Strategies that include resources for proactive information campaigns can be very effective in building local CSEPP officials\u2019 ownership.", "FEMA has rarely leveraged the lessons learned from some of the more successful state efforts and applied them elsewhere to increase effectiveness while avoiding public relations problems. An example of a successful approach that has not been used is FEMA\u2019s very positive experience in Oregon, where innovative management schemes and practices were implemented to improve coordination, services, and local community participation. We recommended such program coordination in our 1999 report identifying strategies and results-oriented organizational frameworks for enhancing the program\u2019s implementation in Oregon.There, FEMA and the state of Oregon placed both of their CSEPP representatives inside the local community (rather than at state or regional headquarters) to provide a concrete and daily presence that is both reassuring and more immediately effective. In addition, the state of Oregon has organized a governing ruling board\u2014composed of all key state and local CSEPP officials\u2014to provide more direction, coordination, and oversight at the local level. All the Oregon CSEPP community participants we spoke with expressed great satisfaction with this arrangement and feelings of accomplishment, thanks to the new organizational structure.", "Although FEMA is not actively considering setting up or endorsing similar structures elsewhere, officials said they had explored such an arrangement in Alabama.", "FEMA also has no plans to disseminate best practices or lessons learned among the different states and communities. The Army and FEMA use the quarterly meetings of CSEPP\u2019s State Directors and annual gatherings of all CSEPP stakeholders as an opportunity for participants to share information and experiences. Only recently, in November, 2000, did FEMA create a public affairs team to recommend ways to ensure that the public is aware of protective action strategies. In addition, FEMA provides an inventory of literature that may have implications for emergency preparedness on a Web-site. This is not enough. If FEMA had a more timely, proactive approach to sharing lessons learned with all 10 states and had taken the initiative to apply them where unresolved issues were slowing progress, the program would be farther along. A more proactive management approach to share and apply success stories, such as with special tone alert radios purchased by Arkansas, may have helped resolve issues in Indiana."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures Vary Because Guidance Is Inconsistent and Not Standardized", "paragraphs": ["The benchmarks FEMA uses to measure performance are not defined consistently in the national planning guidance and in FEMA\u2019s policy papers.  The information about the benchmarks in these documents cannot be fully reconciled and used for measuring compliance. Additionally, FEMA officials told us that the benchmarks were not evaluated with the same standards in all states. This makes it difficult to measure and compare performance or accountability and to identify requirements correctly to assist in budgetary determinations.", "The new and revised national benchmarks that FEMA issued in August 2000 identify both the items and processes necessary for full chemical emergency preparedness. Also in 2000, FEMA and the Army issued supplementary information (policy papers) to the national planning guidance for the development of local emergency response plans. However, the 1996 guidance does not consistently match the definition of terms in the revised benchmarks. Furthermore, the guidance for measuring compliance with the benchmarks (known as \u201ccommunity profile\u201d guidance) is not always internally consistent. For example, one benchmark says that communities must have a \u201cfunctioning communications system\u201d (so emergency personnel can talk to one another) and another mentions a \u201cfunctioning alert and notification system\u201d (to alert citizens of an emergency). But the community profile guidance does not specify what constitutes a functioning item, and the 1996 guidance cannot be traced to the definition of terms in the revised benchmarks to determine what constitutes a functioning item.", "The Army and FEMA believe that states are in the best position to determine their priorities and requirements. They cite \u201cfunctional equivalency\u201d\u2014the concept that it is not necessary to provide every local community with identical assets and resources, as long as the community\u2019s basic emergency management capabilities meet CSEPP\u2019s guidance. Thus, CSEPP policy allows benchmarks to be modified from state to state as appropriate to address any unique community circumstances.  In some cases, however, states do need clarification on the benchmarks and additional guidance in order to perform their responsibilities. For example, at least three states (Alabama, Indiana, and Kentucky) have had problems interpreting some of the benchmarks for 2000. And because there is limited guidance on how to measure the local communities\u2019 compliance with the benchmarks, state and federal assessments are not standardized. Alabama, Oregon, and Utah, for example, use different grading systems to measure local community compliance. At the same time, FEMA\u2019s regional offices have, at times, used their own and different criteria for measuring compliance. Some state officials expressed concerns about the lack of standardization of benchmark measurement.  For example, about the possible adverse effects that this unevenness may have on funding in states with more rigorous standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA and the Army Have Not Completed Key Planning Guideline", "paragraphs": ["One of the areas where the Army and FEMA do not agree concerns planning guidance for what is known as \u201creentry.\u201d Reentry is the process of determining if and when it is safe to return to a contaminated area or leave shelters after a chemical accident.

Although the Army did develop draft guidance in 1997, 5 years later no site-specific guidelines for reentry have been distributed or used. Additionally, we found that no one at FEMA knew of generic (not site- specific) guidance issued by the Army in 1997.

If it is not considered an element of CSEPP, then it is exclusively under the purview of the Army. While FEMA has been largely noncommittal on the issue, Army officials insist that reentry must be implemented and planned by the Army\u2019s Service Response Force, with assistance from state and local officials. Army officials also believe that because every emergency is different and unpredictable, there is no way to assess local preparedness for reentry or make specific reentry plans until an emergency actually happens. State and local CSEPP officials disagree with the Army and have been working together on an interim conceptual plan.", "A 1994 planning concept paper on recovery from a chemical weapons accident was prepared for the Army. But it contained only limited public awareness information and no guidance based on it was distributed to the states and their communities. The only guidance prepared by the Army has not been distributed to the CSEPP community nor to FEMA officials we interviewed.

Of these seven, three are still seriously unprepared to respond to a chemical accident. The Army may not be able to begin destroying its chemical agents at two of these sites on schedule unless further improvements are made in the emergency preparedness of those communities. As a result, residents will face higher risks for a longer period, the Army may incur millions of additional dollars to maintain the program beyond its projected completion date; and the Army may not meet the Chemical Weapons Convention destruction deadline.", "To ensure that communities are safe and that demilitarization can begin on schedule, the Army and FEMA need to move in a timely manner to apply lessons learned and best practices to improve poor working relations with these states and their communities, especially with those where demilitarization of the stockpile is most threatened by delays. These lessons include better guidance to the state and local CSEPP officials in the three states with unresolved issues to determine needed critical items and additional technical assistance to acquire them. In addition, the Army and FEMA need to improve the accuracy of the life-cycle cost estimate for CSEPP so that estimated funding is sufficient to procure all needed items as quickly as possible.

In determining our performance measures we, in some cases, identified sub-elements within a benchmark and included reentry. According to Army officials, reentry is not a CSEPP issue.

It\u2019s easier to plan for a chemical event in Maryland because only one chemical agent (mustard) is stored in bulk in Maryland and according to the Army, mustard agent is the most stable and least toxic agent in the U.S. stockpile. The local CSEPP officials credited the mitigation activities undertaken by the Army that reduced the \u201cat risk\u201d population from 333,000 to 55,000. In addition, the Maryland State CSEPP director told us that a cooperative community effort, such as participation in the integrated process team (a group of key CSEPP personnel that focus on a particular issue), helps CSEPP achieve its goals in Maryland.", "Utah\u2019s CSEPP officials said that communications, cooperation, teamwork, and interpersonal relationships are the root of Utah\u2019s success in implementing CSEPP. For example, Utah integrated all of the affected parties and entities into its CSEPP effort early in the program to facilitate effective communications and foster good working relationships amongst the CSEPP stakeholders.", "Washington state\u2019s CSEPP officials said that like Maryland it too had an extensive disaster control program in place prior to CSEPP because of its involvement in the Radiological Emergency Program. And like Utah, Washington\u2019s CSEPP officials cite good coordination among all participating agencies and the inclusion of state and local CSEPP officials in the budgeting process as contributing factors to the program\u2019s success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States That Are Progressing Toward Full Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["Arkansas still has gaps in five of its critical items. For example, not all of the personal protective equipment has been distributed to the first responders. According to state CSEPP officials, the overpressurization project at the local high school is underway and expected to be completed in August 2001. The elementary school project is in the design phase, and its estimated completion date is August 2002. FEMA approved the overpressurization project for an elementary school for $2.25 million. According to a state CSEPP official, 15 additional sirens are needed and FEMA is reviewing this issue. The current tone alert radios do not work as intended, and Arkansas has $2.5 million to replace them. Medical training is ongoing. Thus far not all medical response personnel have received the necessary CSEPP training.", "Colorado is in the process of distributing its tone alert radios. Once Colorado completes this distribution effort, it will be considered fully prepared.", "Illinois still has capability gaps in three of its critical need items. For example, a state CSEPP official indicated that the state has a need for additional replacement personal protective suits and FEMA is reviewing this issue. Although FEMA approved funding for 40 tone alert radios in February 2001, they have not yet been delivered and distributed in Vermillion County. In addition, only one of three hospitals participating in the program has a full supply of antidote.", "Oregon still has capability gaps in five of its critical items. The current communications system, consisting of a high-banded very high frequency radio, is cumbersome to use and does not meet CSEPP\u2019s standards. A 450-megahertz communications system project has been studied and approved. Its estimated cost is $7.2 million; FEMA is committed to funding the project, which is expected to be complete no later than August 2002. A proposal for five additional overpressurization projects is under review. The state and counties identified a need for additional personal protective suits, sirens, and CSEPP staff. FEMA will then validate the need for more suits and it has funded a sound propagation study to validate the need for the seven additional sirens requested. FEMA officials said they will consider the need for more staff.

State officials told us that Calhoun County, the Army, and FEMA have yet to agree on the number of facilities requiring overpressurization systems. Calhoun County requested that more than 130 facilities be over-pressurized. Excluding the emergency operations centers, currently there are no facilities in the immediate response zone that have been over-pressurized. According to FEMA officials, they are planning to over-pressurize some portion of 28 different facilities but has only funded eight of these projects. Part of the delay in these projects was due to the limited procurement experience of the county. The projects were turned over to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to manage, and work has begun on five schools.", "Another unresolved issue in Alabama centers around its coordinated emergency response plans. Despite the Army\u2019s attempt to have the state and Calhoun county consider a strategy including both evacuation and sheltering, Alabama\u2019s overall immediate response zone counties\u2019 protective action strategy remained for evacuation only. As early as November 5, 1993, the Army informed the local emergency management directors of both of Alabama\u2019s immediate response zone counties that an evacuation-only strategy may not be feasible. In 1999, the Army funded a study to produce a guidebook with step-by-step instructions to Alabama county emergency personnel on how best to respond to a chemical emergency. The study supported the Army\u2019s position that a strategy of evacuation and shelter-in-place provided the safest response to a chemical incident. Talladega county, Alabama, uses the guidebook to determine its emergency response strategy. However, Calhoun county\u2019s CSEPP leaders and FEMA still do not agree on how to incorporate and fund the guidebook strategy. FEMA is in the process of funding Alabama\u2019s shelter- in-place kits, providing the resources to purchase additional sirens, hiring additional staff, and supporting a public awareness campaign.", "In Indiana, it isn\u2019t clear whether FEMA will provide more funding for highway reader boards. According to state CSEPP officials, the state now needs more funding for highway reader boards, which FEMA approved earlier. The state later reprogrammed the funds in support of another CSEPP project but was hoping to use the Indiana Department of Transportation\u2019s reader boards during a chemical emergency. However, the transportation department decided that it did not have enough reader boards for CSEPP to use. Now Indiana\u2019s CSEPP managers are in need of more funding to purchase this capability. The state is also now considering purchasing shelter-in-place kits, but FEMA has not yet provided funding. FEMA is also funding personal protective equipment.", "Kentucky\u2019s CSEPP officials and FEMA have yet to resolve issues involving enhanced sheltering projects, coordinated plans, and medical planning. Although 2 schools and 1 hospital will be over-pressurized, the state identified over 35 facilities that will require enhanced sheltering. FEMA and state and local CSEPP officials have not yet finalized the number of facilities. Also, CSEPP needs school buses to be placed by two schools to evacuate students during an emergency. Additionally, the state and counties are using draft plans that have not yet been approved. A state CSEPP official we interviewed was unaware of a target date for final approval. Additionally, of the 13 hospitals that participate in the program, only about half  have the needed chemical antidote. Local CSEPP officials are concerned that FEMA has not acted in a timely fashion to fill this gap.
