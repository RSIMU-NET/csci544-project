This report focuses solely on environmental reviews of highway projects in states with SEPAs and addresses 1) factors determining whether federal or state environmental reviews are required; 2) how state and federal review requirements compare; and 3) the extent of any duplication in federal and state reviews, including frequency and cost. GAO reviewed FHWA and CEQ documents and interviewed officials of these federal agencies; analyzed state laws and regulations; surveyed the 18 states with SEPAs required for highway projects; and interviewed selected state agencies within 9 of those states based on the number of FHWA NEPA reviews underway and other factors.", "This report has no recommendations.

Projects without federal highway funding usually do not require a Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) NEPA review, but NEPA reviews of highway projects may still be required to obtain federal permits. Thresholds for environmental review vary under state environmental policy acts (SEPA) and may include project cost or length, whereas NEPA focuses on the potential for significant environmental impacts. Eighteen states have SEPAs required for highway projects, and 17 of these allow for the partial or full adoption of FHWA analyses or documentation to meet state environmental review requirements, according to GAO's survey of these states.", "State environmental review requirements are generally similar to the FHWA NEPA process\u2014including consideration of impacts, development and evaluation of project alternatives, mitigation of adverse project impacts, interagency coordination, and public involvement\u2014although differences in specific requirements may affect key environmental decisions. For example, for the consideration of environmental impacts of a proposed highway project, a majority of states responding to GAO's survey indicated that their requirements are similar to FHWA's NEPA requirements overall. However, officials in 7 states GAO surveyed reported that their SEPA requirements related to social and environmental justice impacts are less stringent than FHWA's NEPA requirements. In addition, while state public involvement requirements are generally similar to FHWA's NEPA requirements overall, individual requirements vary, ranging from states that have no requirements to allow public involvement to others that may have more stringent requirements than FHWA's. Officials in 3 states told GAO that in practice they match FHWA's NEPA public involvement requirements for state-only reviews to meet public expectations, even if state law requires less. Further, in the absence of required federal NEPA reviews, certain federal laws related to protection of parklands and historic preservation may not apply to a project, potentially affecting whether a project is determined to have significant impacts and whether those impacts are mitigated.", "Officials in 4 of the 18 states in GAO's survey identified instances of potential federal\u2013state duplication in environmental review processes, stemming either from supplemental state requirements or from the lack of alignment between required federal and state review documents. By contrast, 10 of the states in GAO's survey reported that there was no duplication in environmental reviews. Generally, state officials explained that little duplication of effort occurs in state and federal review processes because these reviews are done concurrently by state officials able to address requirements with analyses used for different purposes without replicating effort. Further, 7 of the 10 states reporting no duplication allow for the adoption of a NEPA review to fulfill SEPA requirements. Finally, 4 states pointed to potential duplication or overlap that did not stem from the interaction of state and federal requirements, such as the rework necessary to keep environmental reviews up to date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["When a state uses federal-aid highway funding for a highway project, the  project becomes subject to federal requirements, including a requirement  for environmental review established under the National Environmental  Policy Act (NEPA). Roughly one-third of the states also have laws that  require the review of environmental impacts under a variety of  circumstances. Enacted in 1970, NEPA, and the subsequent Council on  Environmental Quality (CEQ) implementing regulations, set out an  environmental review process that has two principal purposes: (1) to  ensure that an agency carefully considers information concerning the  potential environmental effects of proposed projects; and (2) to ensure  that this information is made available to the public. NEPA and CEQ  regulations require federal agencies to analyze the nature and extent of a  project\u2019s potential environmental effects and, in many cases, document  their analyses. NEPA environmental reviews have been identified by  critics as a cause of delay for projects because of time-consuming  environmental analysis requirements and praised by proponents for,  among other things, bringing public participation into government decision  making. Congress has also expressed ongoing interest in the cost of and  time required for reviews completed under NEPA for federal-aid highway  projects, and we have published several reports assessing available  information on the cost and time frames of required reviews.", "In 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP- 21)  added provisions intended to accelerate highway project completion  and reduce costs, while protecting the environment, among other things.  Several of these provisions were aimed at expediting project delivery,  including the reviews required under NEPA. MAP-21 required GAO to  examine state environmental reviews to determine whether they duplicate  federal environmental reviews for federal-aid highway projects. To  respond to the MAP-21 mandate, we provided key preliminary information  to your staff on September 25, 2014. This report transmits our final results  related to this review. This report addresses: (1) the factors that  determine whether federal or state environmental reviews are required for  highway projects, and how the types of federal and state environmental  review documents compare; (2) how state environmental review  requirements and practices compare with federal requirements for  assessing the environmental impact of federal-aid highway projects; and  (3) the extent of any duplication in federal and state reviews, including  frequency and cost, in states with environmental review requirements for  highway projects.", "We have defined duplication as occurring when two or more agencies or  programs are engaged in the same activities or provide the same  services to the same beneficiaries.

Our legal analysis compared key elements  of SEPAs and related state regulations to key elements of NEPA and  FHWA regulations for NEPA reviews. We identified these elements by  reviewing the relevant federal statutes and regulations in consultation with  CEQ and FHWA. Specifically, we started with the statutory language of  NEPA, which requires agencies to prepare, for major federal actions  significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed  statement on, among other things (1) the environmental impact of the  proposed action, (2) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be  avoided should the proposal be implemented, and (3) alternatives to the  proposed action. NEPA, CEQ regulations, and\u2014for federal-aid highway  projects\u2014FHWA regulations then specify detailed environmental review  processes, which include requirements for interagency coordination,  avoiding duplication, and participation by state and local governments as  well as the general public, among other things. Based on these statutory  and regulatory requirements, and in consultation with CEQ and FHWA,  we distilled 12 key elements of NEPA environmental review. Examples of  these 12 elements include the type and level of detail required for  environmental reviews, requirements to improve coordination and  promote efficiency, and public participation. Details on all 12 elements  and findings from our legal comparison of the NEPA and SEPA  processes based on these elements are contained in appendix I, and we  refer to these findings throughout this report as our legal analysis. To  compare state environmental review requirements and practices in more  detail for highway projects subject to FHWA requirements, we surveyed  state DOTs in each of the 18 states that have SEPAs required for  highway projects on the degree of similarity between state requirements  and federal requirements identified in FHWA\u2019s Toolkit. For more  information about how we conducted and used the survey, see appendix  II. In addition to these analyses, we interviewed state DOT officials and  officials with state resource agencies (e.g., state departments of natural  resources) in 9 of the 18 SEPA states we surveyed, which we selected  based on a range of factors, including the number of FHWA NEPA  reviews underway. Our findings for these nine states are not  generalizable to the other states with SEPAs but provide examples of  varying state requirements and practices.", "To respond to the third objective, we included in our survey of the 18  state DOTs with SEPAs questions related to duplication and included  questions about duplication in our interviews of state officials and FHWA  division officials in the nine states we selected for additional interviews. In  the context of environmental review requirements, such duplication could  occur if, for example, two separate\u2014but similar\u2014analyses were carried  out to satisfy federal and state requirements, but would not occur if the  same analysis could be used to satisfy both state and federal  documentary (i.e., procedural) requirements. We inquired about  duplication of review efforts within and among highway projects, as well  as duplication that may occur across time within a project. We also asked  FHWA and state officials for any data or analyses regarding the cost of  any potential duplication (and how such cost might be measured) and the  frequency of any potential duplication. Finally, in our survey we asked  state officials about efforts to improve the efficiency and timeliness of the  environmental review process, as well as any potential benefits from such  efforts. See appendix II for additional details on our objectives, scope,  and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2013 to November 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under NEPA, federal agencies generally are required to evaluate the  potential environmental effects of proposed federal actions such as  permitting, funding, approving, or carrying out of federal-aid highway  projects. These evaluations allow decision makers to fully consider  significant environmental impacts, develop and evaluate project  alternatives, and consider mitigating adverse impacts before they decide  whether to approve a proposed project. The NEPA process also provides  a forum for ensuring that all applicable federal and state resource  protection laws and requirements are addressed during the project  development process, such as applicable provisions of the federal Clean  Water Act and Endangered Species Act. NEPA\u2019s implementing  regulations require coordination as a means to avoid duplication and  increase efficiency. For example, they require all federal agencies to  \u201ccooperate with state and local agencies to the fullest extent possible to  reduce duplication.\u201dcan include, among other things, seeking input, and in some cases  approvals, from the public as well as federal and state agencies  responsible for natural resources, environmental protection, and historic  preservation, and obtaining approval of the environmental evaluation by  the lead federal agency prior to making a decision, which in some cases  results in the issuance of a record of decision (ROD).", "In addition, the environmental review of projects  FHWA has statutory and regulatory requirements for conducting NEPA  reviews, which include additional highway-specific requirements and put  additional emphasis on an interagency decision-making process. For  instance, FHWA regulations require that each project alternative  considered in the review connect logical end points (e.g., involve the  development of a highway that links with existing roads) and be of  sufficient length to address environmental matters broadly. FHWA  regulations and policy also include provisions to coordinate with other  federal agencies with jurisdiction, expertise, or interest in the project, as  well as non-federal actors, including state agencies and project  sponsors. In addition, FHWA\u2019s statutory authority includes a mechanism  to limit the time frames available to challenge decisions in federal court as  part of the judicial review process, as well as other provisions, such as  permission to fund assistance to specific groups to improve interagency  coordination. Figure 1 illustrates six principles of FHWA NEPA review  from its Toolkit.", "According to CEQ and FHWA, establishing the purpose and need for the  federal action takes into account the project sponsor\u2019s purpose and need  for a project and is essential in establishing a baseline for the  development of the range of reasonable project alternatives required in  environmental reviews. It also assists with the identification and eventual  selection of a preferred alternative. For FHWA NEPA reviews for federal- aid highway projects, the purpose and need for a proposed project might  take into account the status of the project (e.g., the project\u2019s history,  funding, and schedules, as well as information on agencies involved); a  discussion of highway or bridge capacity, the project\u2019s relationship to the  larger transportation system, and traffic demand; as well as social  demands or economic development.", "In addition to the procedural requirements of NEPA, the decision to fund a  federal-aid highway project also must comply with substantive  environmental and natural resource protection laws, including applicable  state laws.", "Federal environmental laws commonly applied to a proposed highway  project such as the Clean Water Act (Section 404); the Endangered  Species Act of 1973 (principally Section 7); Section 106 of the  National Historic Preservation Act; and Section 4(f) of the  Department of Transportation Act (protecting publicly owned parks,  recreation areas, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and public or private  historic sites). Section 4(f) applies to DOT projects and Section 106  applies to projects with federal funding and some projects that require  federal permits. Other federal natural resource protection laws\u2014 FHWA has identified over 40\u2014can apply to federal and state or local  projects, depending on characteristics of the project. For example, the  Wild and Scenic Rivers Act protects designated and potential wild,  scenic, and recreational rivers.", "State environmental laws, such as laws related to the growth-inducing  effects of agency actions may also apply to a proposed highway  project. States may also have laws that protect certain resources,  such as those designating protected or endangered species or those  protecting tribal or other cultural resources.", "For federal-aid highway projects, reviews are typically conducted by state  DOT officials\u2014or other project sponsors\u2014who carry out analyses and  coordinate with FHWA. FHWA generally serves as the federal lead  agency for the NEPA process and approves the environmental impact  documentation. Under NEPA, the level of review required depends on  the potential significance of the environmental effects of the project.", "Projects that have the potential for a significant effect: An  Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) must be prepared for a project  that has the potential for a significant effect on the environment. Both  CEQ and FHWA regulations identify EIS requirements related to  public involvement (such as public participation in scoping, response  to substantive public comment on a draft EIS, and public hearings  when appropriate); interagency participation; consideration of project  impacts (such as impacts on water quality or wildlife habitat);  development and evaluation of alternatives; and the mitigation of  adverse project impacts. Projects requiring an EIS are likely to be  complex and expensive, as we have noted in prior work. The median time to complete a highway project EIS was over 7 years in  2013, according to FHWA data, and the EIS itself may cost several  million dollars, as reported by FHWA.", "Projects that may or may not have a significant effect: When project  effects are uncertain, project sponsors (such as state DOTs or local  highway departments) must prepare an environmental assessment  (EA) to determine whether the project may have a potentially  significant impact on the human environment. An EA briefly provides  evidence and analysis sufficient to determine whether to prepare an  EIS or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI). A FONSI presents  the reasons why the agency has concluded that no significant  environmental impacts will occur if the project is implemented. FHWA  regulations governing EAs require early scoping and coordination  activities, as well as making the EA publicly available. EA review  activities have been estimated to take from 14 to 41 months,  according to reports from FHWA and AASHTO.", "Projects that normally will not have a significant effect: These projects,  by their very nature (e.g., the project fits within a category of activities  that the agency has determined normally do not have the potential for  significant environmental impacts), require limited review under NEPA  to ensure\u2014by considering any extraordinary circumstances\u2014that a  proposed project does not raise the potential for significant effects.  Agencies promulgate categorical exclusions (CE) for such projects in  their NEPA implementing procedures. The subsequent use of a  categorical exclusion for a proposed project, as described in CEQ  guidance, can reduce paperwork and delay by speeding the review  process. CEs typically take much less time to prepare than EAs or  EISs. Environmental review activities for categorically excluded  projects have been estimated to take an average of 6 to 8 months to  complete, according to FHWA, and could take as long as an average  of 22 months to complete, according to a report prepared for  AASHTO. Federal-aid highway projects that are generally processed  as CEs include resurfacing, constructing bicycle lanes, installing noise  barriers, and landscaping projects.", "Figure 2 illustrates FHWA\u2019s NEPA decision-making process, including the  three main types of highway project environmental review documentation.", "For federal-aid highway projects, FHWA has found that the vast majority  of projects (96 percent in 2009) qualify for environmental review as CEs,  and only 1 percent require EIS reviews, as shown in figure 3 below.  However, EIS projects, because of their high costs, account for a greater  share of federal-aid funds than their numbers might suggest.", "According to CEQ and our analysis, 18 states have adopted SEPAs that  require environmental reviews for highway projects (see fig. 4). The  majority of SEPAs were modeled on NEPA and require state and  sometimes local public agencies to assess the impacts of projects (or  other actions) affecting the quality of the environment within the state.Among other things, SEPAs may expand requirements for environmental  reviews to projects (e.g., state, local, or private projects) that are not  required to have such reviews under federal law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Factors Generally Affect the Types of Environmental Reviews Required for Highway Projects, and State Environmental Review Document Types Largely Mirror NEPA", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Three Factors Generally Affect Whether Federal or State Environmental Reviews Are Required for Highway Projects", "paragraphs": ["Three factors\u2014project funding sources, project characteristics, and rules  allowing state adoption of federal review documents\u2014generally  determine whether a highway project needs a federal environmental  review or a state environmental review, or both."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["Federal-aid highway projects are generally subject to environmental  review under NEPA and the environmental provisions of title 23, with  FHWA serving as the federal lead agency for the review. By contrast,  when a project is funded solely through state or local funds, it rarely  requires an FHWA NEPA review, although action by another federal  agency may require an environmental review.", "To some extent, states can influence whether or not FHWA NEPA  reviews are required by their selection of funding for a particular project.  By using\u2014or avoiding\u2014federal-aid highway funds, states can determine  whether their projects are subject to a FHWA NEPA review and even  whether certain other federal environmental laws apply. For example,  officials in some states told us that federal-aid highway funding was  sometimes requested for a project requiring permits from other federal  agencies specifically so that FHWA would serve as the federal lead  agency for the NEPA review, rather than have a federal permitting agency  (e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)) serve in that capacity.  Officials in two states cited their positive working relationships with  FHWA, or the lack of resources at other federal agencies, to explain such  decisions. As another example, California officials explained that not  having federal funding or not needing a federal permit\u2014either of which  would trigger NEPA\u2014requires them to comply with more burdensome  requirements of the Endangered Species Act. They therefore would have  an incentive to include federal-aid highway funds to ensure NEPA would  apply.", "Some state officials, however, identified reasons why they may seek not  to use federal-aid highway funding for certain projects. For example, state  officials in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and North Carolina told us that  they chose not to use federal-aid highway funding on some projects  mainly to avoid certain federal review requirements, notably Section 4(f)  or Section 106, which can increase project costs or require additional time  for reviews to meet federal requirements.three other states (California, Maryland, and New York) focused their  federal funding on certain\u2014often large\u2014projects, resulting in fewer  FHWA NEPA reviews overall. Some state officials told us that as a  practical matter, there may not always be a choice to not use federal  funding, even if they might otherwise choose to do so, because limited  state funding may not cover the full cost for some large projects. Although  only using state funds may preclude the need to meet certain federal  requirements, other federal environmental requirements, such as  compliance with the Clean Water Act, largely remain for state-funded  projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["SEPAs vary with respect to which project characteristics trigger an  environmental review as well as what type of review is required and the  scope and extent of that review.

These  requirements contrast with NEPA, which generally focuses on the  potential for significant environmental impacts. reviews are required for state projects costing $500,000 or more. Other  dollar-value thresholds are built into the SEPA requirements of the District  of Columbia, Georgia, and New Jersey. In Massachusetts, environmental  reviews are required for the construction of new roadways 2 or more  miles in length. Likewise, Minnesota requires an EIS-type review for new  For example, in Virginia,  road projects four or more lanes in width and 2 or more miles in length.Finally, in certain cases, states require particular environmental reviews  for expected service impacts. For example, EA-type reviews are required  for the construction of new roads over 1 mile in length that will function as  collector roadways in Minnesota.", "In January 2014, however, pursuant to MAP-21, FHWA adopted a regulation allowing a  project that receives less than $5,000,000 of federal funds to be treated as a CE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Adoption of Federal Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Almost all states with SEPAs responding to our survey (17 of 18) allow for  the partial or full adoption of analyses or documentation produced in  conducting federal reviews to meet state requirements for highway  projects, while Massachusetts requires that a separate state review be  completed. Figure 5 illustrates the number of states allowing for full  adoption, in which the NEPA review fulfills the SEPA requirements; those  allowing for the adoption of the federal review with additional state  analyses or documentation (i.e., partial adoption); and those requiring that  state requirements be met separately from the FHWA NEPA review.  Several factors may affect whether a NEPA document can be accepted  as a SEPA document in those states that allow for full or partial adoption.  For example, state DOT officials reported that their ability to use a NEPA  review to meet SEPA requirements varies based on the project sponsor,  the type of review, and whether a similar type of environmental review  document is required to satisfy federal and state environmental review  requirements. Finally, several states carry out and adopt federal analyses  or documentation for state projects even in the absence of federal funding  or permitting. Maryland DOT officials told us that in practice they adopt  federal FHWA NEPA reviews for almost all highway projects\u2014even those  with only state funding\u2014given staff familiarity with the federal  requirements and public expectations, as well as the potential for funding  sources to change between the preliminary engineering and construction  phases of a project. Washington DOT officials also mentioned that using  and adopting NEPA could be advantageous because they felt more  certain about how FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements would be interpreted by  courts should a legal challenge to the environmental review process be  subsequently filed.", "While the majority of states with SEPAs allow for the full adoption of  federal NEPA reviews, some do not (see fig. 5). When separate federal  and state reviews are required, the processes are often carried out  concurrently, with joint planning processes, research and studies, and  public hearings, as well as the use of blended documents. Both Montana  and New York reported having integrated processes for state and federal  reviews, for example. Likewise, officials with California\u2019s DOT (Caltrans)  stated that Caltrans has a long-standing practice of combining NEPA and  the state\u2019s SEPA processes to make the delivery of transportation  projects more efficient. For example, Caltrans\u2019s guidance for a blended or  joint NEPA/SEPA EIS/EIS-type review describes use of a special chapter  in the joint document to address required California-specific mitigation  information. Finally, Hawaii\u2019s environmental review statute requires  coordination of state and federal reviews when both apply. The extent to  which state SEPAs, like NEPA, require coordination is discussed in the  next section of this report.", "When a project sponsor requests that a state review be adopted to satisfy  federal requirements, FHWA conducts a legal sufficiency review to  ensure that the analysis and documentation satisfy FHWA\u2019s NEPA  requirements, according to an official with FHWA\u2019s Office of Project  Development and Environmental Review. This legal review may happen  when, for example, federal funding is added to an ongoing state project or  when project requirements change, and a federal permit that was not  originally required must now be obtained. State officials in several states  we spoke with pointed to the potential for duplicative effort when ongoing  state projects are subsequently \u201cfederalized\u201d in this manner. According to  the FHWA official we spoke with, a case-by-case assessment is  necessary because each situation is different when projects have been  federalized. To avoid the risk of having to start the federal environmental  impact assessment late in the project development process, FHWA  encourages project sponsors to follow FHWA\u2019s NEPA process from the  beginning of project development. For this reason, officials in five states\u2014 Hawaii, Maryland, North Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin\u2014told us  they preferred to review projects under FHWA NEPA\u2014even in the  absence of federal funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Review Document Types Largely Mirror NEPA Review Document Types", "paragraphs": ["A majority of states we surveyed reported having state review document  types that are similar to those used for NEPA reviews (see fig. 6).

FHWA\u2019s EAs are to include brief discussions of the need for the proposed  project, project alternatives, the environmental impacts of the proposed  project and alternatives, and a listing of the agencies and persons  consulted. Officials in six of nine states where we conducted interviews  told us they use a checklist for their EA-type reviews. For example,  Washington DOT\u2019s checklist asks for narrative responses to 12 pages of  questions on topics like water, plants, and historic and cultural  preservation. Instructions direct the project sponsor\u2014often the state  DOT\u2014to answer the questions briefly with the best description possible  and to say \u201cdoes not apply\u201d if that is the case. As a result, these reviews  may look more like a documented federal CE than a federal EA. Further,  in some instances, these checklist reviews can involve less analysis than  a federal EA. A Washington DOT official told us that the checklist allows  impacts to not be assessed if they are deemed \u201cnot applicable.\u201d By  comparison, a federal EA requires more detailed documentation of  findings. In Massachusetts, the state DOT prepares a 22-page checklist  called an environmental notification form for projects meeting set criteria.  This document has attached plans and is publicly circulated. Depending  on whether the project exceeds certain thresholds, the document may  require responses to questions, according to Massachusetts DOT  officials. By contrast, New York requires more specific analysis as its  regulations require the state DOT to prepare a negative declaration that  can be supported by a NEPA FONSI.

To identify which states have requirements that were  \u201cgenerally similar\u201d to FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements overall, we determined  which states in our survey reported having environmental review  requirements that were similar or somewhat similar to 42 individual  requirements for FHWA NEPA reviews under the five NEPA principles.", "Based on our legal analysis and survey responses, for each of the five  NEPA principles the majority of states have requirements that are  generally similar to FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements overall. More  specifically, as shown in figure 7, for each of the five areas, survey results  indicated that requirements in 10 or more of the 17 state SEPAs were  generally similar to FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements overall. Some similarity  between state and federal requirements is to be expected since a majority  of SEPAs were modeled on NEPA, as we discussed above. Further,  some states may employ more stringent review processes in practice  than state statutes and regulations require in order to satisfy public  expectations or for other reasons. Based on our legal analysis and survey  responses, we found that a number of states have SEPA requirements  that are generally less stringent, however. In fact, survey results suggest  that the divergence between state and FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements may  be greatest for the NEPA principle of alternatives analysis, where 7 (of  17) states had requirements they characterized as generally less  stringent. Overall, no state reported having requirements more stringent  than FHWA NEPA for more than 4 (of 42) individual requirements within  the five NEPA principles included in our analysis. We discuss each of  these NEPA principles\u2014and the related requirements identified in the  Toolkit\u2014in more detail below.", "In some cases, the divergence between state and federal requirements is  more pronounced depending on the type of review being conducted.

The list of states with SEPAs derives largely from the  18 states identified by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) as  having SEPAs, including New Jersey, which has an executive order that  requires environmental reviews. In addition, during the course of our  work, we learned that Texas does not have a general state-level SEPA  but does have a state statute and regulations that apply to transportation  projects, and we confirmed with CEQ officials that we should include  Texas in our scope.

Our legal analysis compared key elements  of SEPAs and related state regulations with key elements of NEPA and  FHWA regulations for federal-aid highway projects. Our comparison of  NEPA and FHWA regulations with requirements in state statutes,  regulations, and executive orders focused on the key NEPA statutory and  regulatory requirements and did not systematically examine court  decisions or legislative history. We identified the key NEPA elements by  reviewing relevant federal statutes and regulations in consultation with  CEQ and FHWA. Specifically, we started with the statutory language of  NEPA, which requires agencies to prepare, for major federal actions  significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed  statement on, among other things: (1) the environmental impact of the  proposed action, (2) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be  avoided should the proposal be implemented, and (3) alternatives to the   NEPA, CEQ regulations, and\u2014for federal-aid highway  proposed action.projects\u2014FHWA regulations then specify detailed environmental review  processes, which include requirements for interagency coordination,  avoiding duplication, and participation by state and local governments as  well as the general public, among other things. In addition, the regulations  provide for more efficient methods of environmental review and a process  for determining when use of these methods is appropriate. Based on  these statutory and regulatory requirements, and in consultation with  CEQ and FHWA, we distilled 12 key elements of environmental review.  1.  Policy and purpose of the environmental review requirements  2.  Types of projects covered  3.  Level of detail (\u201cdepth\u201d) of environmental impact evaluation  4.  Level of significance (\u201cbreadth\u201d) addressed in environmental impact  evaluation  5.  Consideration of alternatives  6.  Consideration of mitigation  7.  Requirement for collaboration to enhance efficiency and avoid  8.  Requirement for agency coordination  9.  Requirement for single-process review  10. State adoption of federal NEPA reviews  11. Opportunity for public participation  12. Opportunity for judicial review of agency decisions  In additional to this legal analysis, we conducted a survey of state DOTs  in all the 18 states with SEPAs required for highway projects to compare  in more detail state environmental review requirements with FHWA\u2019s  NEPA requirements for reviews of federal-aid highway projects. Using  FHWA\u2019s NEPA Toolkit as a guide, we developed survey questions to  gather information comparing states\u2019 environmental review requirements  and practices with FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements. These requirements  align with five of FHWA\u2019s six principles of the NEPA process and reflect  key elements in our legal analyses.consideration of the social, economic, and environmental impacts of a  proposed action or project; development and evaluation of a range of reasonable alternatives to  the proposed project, based on the applicants defined purpose and  need for the project; mitigation of project effect by means of avoidance, minimization and public involvement including opportunities to participate and comment.  compensation;  interagency coordination and consultation; and  For each of these principles, we developed questions to assess the  extent to which state requirements were less stringent than, similar to, or  more stringent than FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements.survey, we conducted pretests with state DOT officials in Maryland,  Washington, and North Carolina to ensure that respondents interpreted  our questions in the way we intended. That is, we verified that the  questions were clear and unambiguous and that we used appropriate  terminology in the survey, to ensure that respondents had the necessary  information and ability to respond to the questions. Where necessary, we  revised the screening tool to improve the survey instrument in response  to feedback from the pretests and internal GAO review. We divided the  final screening-tool questions into four parts: Part I: Contact Information;  Part II: Documentation; Part III: Duplication and Coordination; and Part IV:  Environmental Review Requirements.", "We administered the survey by emailing an electronic form to state DOT  officials in all 18 states with SEPAs required for highway projects. Two states provided clarifications or supplementary information along with  their survey responses. To improve the accuracy and completeness of  the data, we used the clarifying information provided by agency officials to  update responses where necessary. Because this effort was not a sample  survey, it has no sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of  conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in interpreting a particular  question or sources of information that are unavailable to respondents  can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps  to minimize such nonsampling errors in developing the survey tool\u2014 including using a social science survey specialist to help design and  pretest the survey. We also minimized the nonsampling errors when  analyzing the data, including using an independent analyst to review all  computer programming related to the survey. Finally, there were a few  instances where state DOTs should have indicated one response to a  question and instead provided two. In these cases we followed up with  the state DOT officials to clarify their response.", "To identify which states had requirements that were \u201cgenerally similar\u201d to  FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements overall, we determined which states in our  survey reported having environmental review requirements that we found  to be similar or somewhat similar to 42 individual requirements for FHWA  NEPA reviews. We characterized state survey responses as being similar  overall if 75 percent or more of the questions about individual state  requirements under a NEPA principle were marked as \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201cmore  stringent\u201d than FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements. If 50 to 74 percent of the  requirements were marked as \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201cmore stringent,\u201d we  characterized state survey responses as somewhat similar. If 51 to 74  percent of the requirements were marked as \u201cless stringent\u201d or \u201cnot  applicable,\u201d we characterized state survey responses as somewhat less  stringent. If 75 percent or more of the requirements were marked as \u201cless  stringent\u201d or \u201cnot applicable,\u201d we characterized state survey responses as  less stringent. Then we determined that states where officials indicated  that at least half of their responses for each requirement within the  principle were similar to or more stringent than FHWA\u2019s NEPA  requirements were \u201cgenerally similar\u201d to federal requirements. For  example, regarding the consideration of impacts, we determined that  state requirements were \u201cgenerally similar\u201d overall if the state DOT  officials reported that 3 of the 5 individual requirements were at least  similar (if not identical) to FHWA\u2019s NEPA requirements: (1) identification  of impacts, as well as assessment of (2) cumulative effects, (3) context,  (4) cultural or historical impacts, and (5) social or environmental justice.", "In addition to these analyses, we interviewed state DOT officials and  officials with state natural resource agencies in 9 of the 18 states with  SEPAs. (See table 2.) We selected SEPA states for additional interviews  and site visits based on four criteria: robustness (or lack thereof), number  of active EIS reviews, \u201cuniqueness,\u201d and, in some cases, proximity to  GAO offices. Our findings for these 9 states are not generalizable to the  other 9 states with SEPAs but provide examples of varying state  requirements and practices.", "To respond to the third objective, we included questions about duplication  in our survey of state DOTs, as well as interviewing state officials and  FHWA officials at the division offices in those states we selected for  additional interviews. We have defined duplication as occurring when two  or more agencies or programs are engaged in the same activities or  provide the same services to the same beneficiaries, in accordance with  GAO\u2019s body of work on duplication in the federal government. This  report focuses on duplication that might occur between state and federal  processes for environmental review of highway projects where there is  duplication of effort. In the context of environmental review requirements,  such duplication could occur if states were required to carry out two  separate\u2014but similar\u2014analyses to satisfy federal and state  requirements, for example, but not if the same analysis could be used to  satisfy both state and federal documentary (i.e., procedural)  requirements. In our interviews with state and FHWA officials, we inquired  about duplication within and among highway projects, as well as  duplication that may occur across time within a project. We also asked  FHWA and state officials about the cost of any potential duplication (and  how such cost might be measured) and the frequency of any potential  duplication. Finally, we asked state officials about efforts to make the  environmental review process more efficient in our survey, as well as the  potential benefits of any such efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2013 to November 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
