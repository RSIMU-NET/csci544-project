The true extent of overpayments resulting from earnings that exceed agency guidelines is currently unknown. Based on available data from SSA, GAO found that about 31 percent of all DI overpayments are attributable to DI beneficiaries who worked and earned more than allowed. Moreover, GAO found that these overpayments contributed to mounting financial losses in the program. From 1999 to 2003, total overpayment debt increased from about $1.9 billion to nearly $3 billion. Three basic weaknesses impede SSA's ability to prevent and detect earnings-related overpayments. First, the agency lacks timely data on beneficiaries' earnings and work activity. Second, SSA uses inefficient processes to perform work continuing disability reviews (work CDRs). Third, the agency relies on potentially inaccurate management information to effectively monitor and oversee some parts of this workload. These weaknesses contributed to some work CDR cases GAO identified that were as much as 7 years old, resulting in potential and established overpayments as large as $105,000 per beneficiary. In addition, GAO found that SSA relies on potentially inaccurate management information to administer its work CDR workload. SSA is developing new automated systems that may potentially address some of these problems and could help the agency balance the important goals of encouraging individuals with disabilities return to work, while also ensuring program integrity.

This program has grown  in recent years and is poised to grow further as the baby boom generation  ages. Given the concerns about the long-term solvency of the DI trust fund,  it is important for SSA to ensure that only truly eligible individuals receive  benefits.", "SSA guidelines state that DI beneficiaries are permitted to earn up to $810  per month in calendar year 2004\u2014a level of earnings referred to as  substantial gainful activity (SGA)\u2014for a limited period of time without  losing eligibility for benefits. After completing a 9-month \u201ctrial work  period,\u201d beneficiaries who earn more than SGA are generally ineligible for  future DI payments, and may be overpaid if SSA does not stop their  benefits in a timely manner. The potential of having to repay a large  overpayment may discourage some beneficiaries from continuing to work,  thus running contrary to SSA\u2019s goal of helping such individuals become  self-sufficient. SSA conducts continuing disability reviews (CDR) of  beneficiaries\u2019 earnings and work activity to determine whether a claimant  remains financially eligible for DI benefits. The agency refers to these  reviews as \u201cwork CDRs.\u201d These reviews generally require SSA staff to  perform several steps to assess beneficiaries\u2019 continuing eligibility for  benefits, including mailing notices to beneficiaries requesting information  about their work activity, contacting the beneficiaries\u2019 employer(s) to  verify their monthly earnings, and assessing several variables that can  affect eligibility, including employer subsidies and work-related expenses.", "Given the importance of verifying DI beneficiaries\u2019 earnings to ensure they  receive the correct amount of benefits, the Senate Committee on Finance  asked us to (1) determine the amount of overpayments in the DI program,  particularly those attributable to earnings or work activity, and (2) identify  any vulnerabilities in SSA\u2019s processes and policies for verifying earnings  that may contribute to work-related overpayments. To answer these  questions, we used an approach similar to the methodology in our prior  reviews of SSA\u2019s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. In  particular, we reviewed DI performance data, prior reports by SSA and its  Office of Inspector General (OIG), external research studies, and our prior  reviews on the program. We analyzed DI payment data over a 5-year  period from 1999 to 2003 and examined between 5 and 7 work CDR cases  from each of the SSA field offices and program service centers we visited.  In addition, we randomly selected and reviewed 71 work CDR cases from  one of SSA\u2019s program service centers to determine if they were processed  in accordance with program guidelines. Finally, we conducted in-depth  interviews with 230 management and line staff from SSA\u2019s headquarters;  its regional offices in New York and San Francisco; 18 field offices in 6  states\u2014California, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and  Virginia; and 3 out of 8 regional program service centers. During our  meetings, we (1) examined existing work CDR procedures; (2)  documented management and staff views on the effectiveness of SSA\u2019s  work CDR processes for detecting and preventing earnings-related  overpayments; and (3) discussed potential improvements to existing  program processes, systems, and policies. We assessed the reliability of all  databases used in our review, and found them to be sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.

In fiscal year 2003, SSA paid about $70 billion to 7.5 million  disabled workers, their spouses, and dependents, with average monthly  cash benefits of about $723 per beneficiary. To be eligible for benefits,  individuals with disabilities must have a specified number of recent work  credits under Social Security when they first became disabled. Individuals  may also be able to qualify based on the work record of a deceased,  retired, or disabled parent, or a deceased spouse. Benefits are financed by  payroll taxes paid into the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund by  covered workers and their employers, based on the worker\u2019s earnings  history. To meet the definition of disability under the DI program, an  individual must have a medically determinable physical or mental  impairment that (1) has lasted or is expected to last at least 1 year or to  result in death and (2) prevents the individual from engaging in substantial  gainful activity. Individuals are engaged in SGA if they have earnings  above $810 per month in calendar year 2004. Program guidelines require  DI beneficiaries to report their earnings to SSA in a timely manner in order  to ensure that they remain eligible for benefits.", "SSA conducts work issue CDRs to determine if beneficiaries are working  above the SGA level. SSA initiates a work CDR only after the beneficiary  has completed a 9-month trial work period, during which the beneficiary is  allowed to earn more than the SGA level without affecting their eligibility  for benefits. The trial work period is one of several provisions in the DI  program intended to encourage beneficiaries to return to work. The trial  work period begins with the first month a beneficiary is eligible for DI  benefits. Once the trial work period is completed, beneficiaries are  generally ineligible for future DI benefits unless their earnings fall below  the SGA level.", "Work CDRs are triggered by several types of events, although most are  generated by SSA\u2019s Continuing Disability Review Enforcement Operation  (enforcement operation). This process involves periodic computer  matches between SSA\u2019s administrative data and IRS wage data. The  enforcement operation generates notices for cases that exceed specified  earnings thresholds, which are forwarded to 1 of 8 program service  centers for additional examination. The cases at each program service  center are then temporarily housed in a central repository (called the  computer output section) and are released to \u201cearnings reviewers\u201d for  development of work activities. Cases are generally released for  development on a first-in-first-out basis, based on how long they have been  in the central repository, and according to staff workloads. After initial  review, cases for which individuals may require cessation of benefits are  generally forwarded to a \u201cdisability processing specialist\u201d for additional  development.", "Work CDRs can also be triggered by other events. For example, SSA  requires beneficiaries to undergo periodic medical examinations to assess  whether they continue to be physically disabled. During such reviews,  Disability Determination Service staff sometimes discover evidence that  indicates the beneficiary may be working and usually forwards the case to  an SSA field office or program service center for earnings/work  development. Additional events that may trigger a work CDR include  reports from state vocational rehabilitation agencies, other federal  agencies, and anonymous tips. Finally, DI beneficiaries may voluntarily  report their earnings to SSA by visiting an SSA field office, or calling the  agency\u2019s toll free \u201c800\u201d number.", "Several SSA components are involved in processing work CDRs. While  most are initially sent to SSA\u2019s program service centers as a result of the  enforcement operation, some cases are referred to any one of SSA\u2019s more  than 1,300 field offices for more in-depth development. Field offices also  tend to be the focal points for work CDRs generated by events other than  the enforcement operation. Work CDRs can entail labor-intensive, time- consuming procedures such as reviewing folders, performing in-person  interviews, and contacting beneficiaries and their employers to verify their  monthly earnings. Staff are also required to take into consideration several  complex work incentive provisions when calculating whether earnings  exceed SGA. In addition, staff\u2014particularly in SSA field offices\u2014are also  required to balance numerous competing workloads, including processing  initial claims, serving individuals who walk into the field office without an  appointment, meeting with beneficiaries who have requested an  appointment, and processing a \u201cspecial disability workload.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overpayments in the DI Program Are Substantial and Have Increased in Recent Years", "paragraphs": ["DI overpayment detections increased from about $772 million to about  $990 million between fiscal years 1999 and 2003.

On the basis of data in  a recent study from SSA, we calculated that overpayments attributable to  work and earnings averaged about 31 percent of all DI overpayments  annually between 1999 and 2002. We consulted SSA officials about our  calculations to determine if they were accurate. These officials agreed that  the estimate is generally accurate based on limited available data, but  likely understates the true extent of the problem. In particular, SSA  officials acknowledged that their study only examined beneficiaries who  had their benefits suspended or terminated following a work CDR; it did  not consider individuals who may have been overpaid but continued to  receive benefits. A beneficiary may be overpaid, but not placed in  suspended or terminated status because (1) SSA waived the overpayment,  (2) the case was still being processed, or (3) the individual became  unemployed and returned to the DI rolls. Our review identified several  such cases in numerous field offices. For example, one case we examined  involved a beneficiary who was selected for review by the enforcement  operation every year from 1998 to 2001. Other than notations on the  individual\u2019s account that the case was selected for review, there was no  evidence that a work CDR was ever conducted. In February 2003, program  service center staff transferred the case to a field office to have the  recipient\u2019s earnings reviewed. However, field office staff were unable to  contact the recipient and the case was transferred back to the program  service center in August 2003. As of March 2004, the case was still being  reviewed and waiting final SSA action. SSA officials told us that this  individual should have had an overpayment listed for the time between  December 1999 and September 2001. However, at the time of our review,  no overpayment had yet been established and, therefore did not appear in  SSA\u2019s overpayment detection data for those years. Ultimately, we estimate  that this case will likely result in a $64,000 overpayment once it is fully  developed and completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although SSA Has Improved Its Collection Efforts, Financial Losses Are Mounting", "paragraphs": ["The increase in DI overpayments from 1999 to 2003 has contributed to  mounting financial losses in the program.

During this same period, SSA\u2019s overpayment collections increased from  about $269 million to about $431 million. Agency officials attributed the  increase in collections in part to new initiatives they have made use of. For  example, SSA has conducted debt management workshops to (1) develop  new ideas on collecting the agency\u2019s mounting outstanding debt and (2)  identify and prioritize debt that the agency should concentrate on  collecting. In addition, SSA is in the process of developing new collection  tools, such as wage garnishment to recoup overpayments, and has  published final regulations to implement this tool. However, these  improvements notwithstanding, the total overpayment debt is increasing.  (See fig. 2.)", "Increases in waivers and write-offs during this period have also  contributed, in part, to the DI program\u2019s growing overpayment debt. SSA  must waive collection of an overpayment if SSA determines that the  beneficiary was not at fault in causing the overpayment and either the  beneficiary would be financially unable to repay the overpayment or  recovery would be against equity and good conscience. The agency may  also write-off overpayments for various reasons, including when the  agency is unable to locate an individual for a prolonged period of time.  Waivers and write-offs increased from about $222 million in 1999 to about  $325 million in 2003.  The increase in waivers and write-offs is attributable,  in part, to increases in total program outlays during this period.  Ultimately, our review suggests that overpayments not only contribute to  increasing overpayment debt, but also may be a disincentive for  individuals with disabilities to return to work.

SSA officials told us that the age of  the earnings data impedes the agency\u2019s ability to effectively detect  potential overpayments in a timely manner. Moreover, because a  substantial proportion of all work CDRs in any given year are generated by  these enforcement matches, a large proportion of this workload is  dependent on outdated earnings information.

While periodic computer matches with the NDNH would  help provide more timely, comprehensive earnings data to SSA, some SSA  officials told us that the agency would still need the ability to  systematically screen the cases to identify those at high-risk for large  overpayments. The agency currently uses a screen for its medical CDR  reviews, which helps the agency identify beneficiaries who are most (or  least) likely to have medically improved. This screen helps SSA prioritize  the use of limited staff resources by scheduling beneficiaries who are  identified as least likely to improve for less frequent medical CDRs, and  using forms that are periodically mailed to them requesting information on  their medical condition. While our prior work has identified some  problems with this screening mechanism, in general SSA believes that, in  many instances, it helps the agency mitigate the need for costly, time- consuming medical examinations that may not be necessary. However, the  agency does not currently have a similar tool for its work CDRs to identify  beneficiaries with high levels of earnings or other characteristics that may  contribute to large overpayments.", "One program service center we visited is considering the use of a screen  that would give higher priority to developing cases for beneficiaries with  higher earnings, and thus the potential for larger overpayments. Some  SSA officials we interviewed told us that such a screen would help the  agency prioritize this workload and make better use of limited resources,  particularly in field offices where staff are often constrained by several  competing workloads, such as processing initial claims. Further, one  official in this program service center told us some of the other program  centers were considering implementing this screen.", "Even if a screen existed that would allow SSA to identify cases with the  greatest potential for large overpayments, the agency still lacks a timely  alert mechanism to notify field offices and program service centers about  such cases. According to some SSA officials, such a mechanism, if  created, could allow the agency to quickly notify field offices and program  service centers about cases that have been identified as high-priority for  work CDRs. SSA currently uses an alert mechanism in its SSI program to  rapidly notify field offices about recipients with high levels of earnings or  other factors that may affect their eligibility for benefits. These alerts are  generated centrally from SSA\u2019s match with the NDNH and sent  electronically to field office staff, telling them which recipients should  have their cases reviewed. However, a similar alert system does not  currently exist in the DI program. Instead, SSA field offices rely on daily  workload management listings of potential work CDR cases that are  relayed via existing agency systems. These lists summarize the cases that  are awaiting review, including the \u201cage\u201d of the case. On the basis of such  lists obtained from several field offices, we found that half of the cases  were at least 117 days old. Moreover, cases that were transferred from  program service centers were generally older\u2014some were listed as being  999 days old. In addition, because the data field for measuring the age of  cases on the workload management lists only holds a maximum of 3  characters, SSA officials told us that these cases were likely older than  indicated on the lists. In addition, we found that these lists do not allow  managers to identify cases with the greatest potential for overpayments.  As a result, staff generally review cases as they are released by managers  to be developed. While some managers and staff we interviewed told us  that they make a concerted effort to review the oldest cases first, others  told us that they generally process the cases on a \u201cfirst-in-first-out\u201d basis,  which is not necessarily related to the age of the case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in SSA\u2019s Management Information Hinder Its Ability to Effectively Monitor Work CDR\u2019s", "paragraphs": ["Our review suggests that SSA relies on potentially inaccurate data to  manage its work CDR workload. In particular, our work shows that high- level management information data on the age of work CDR cases may not  accurately reflect the true age of cases (i.e. the actual time it took to  complete these cases) and may result in cases being counted more than  once, thus distorting the information that SSA relies on to measure the  number of cases that are reviewed and completed. To test the accuracy of  high-level management data for this workload, we conducted an in-depth  examination of 71 randomly selected cases that were \u201ccleared\u201d from  SSA\u2019s Processing Center Action Control System (the system) during a 1- week period in April 2004. On the basis of our sample we estimate that,  overall, 49 percent of these cases were improperly cleared from this  system. This means that the cases were listed as having been fully  reviewed and completed, when in fact they still required additional  development. Improperly cleared cases can have several negative impacts  according to SSA officials, including the potential for contributing to large  overpayments. For example, on the basis of our sample, we estimate that  13 percent of the cases were improperly cleared from the system because  they were not fully developed and did not have a \u201cdiary\u201d attached to  them\u2014an automated notice that reminds staff to review the case after a  specified period of time. Such cases might not be selected for review again  until the next enforcement match\u2014which could be as much as 1 year\u2014 and result in overpayments if the beneficiary had earnings that exceeded  the SGA level. Most importantly, because they did not have a diary, SSA  did not have any way of monitoring these cases or ensuring that they were  properly completed. This weakness may partially explain the type of old  cases with large overpayments we identified in several SSA field offices.", "In addition to the cases without any diary, an estimated 37 percent of the  cases were incorrectly shown as cleared while still being developed in  various locations such as field offices. Although these cases had a diary\u2014 thus giving SSA some level of internal control over them\u2014our analysis  shows they could still result in management information that does not  show the true age of work CDR cases. More specifically, these types of  cases would likely result in management information that understates the  true age of such cases, and would distort the overall measurement of  progress in handling work CDR workloads. Such cases could also result in  the double counting of work CDRs. For example, if a single case was  cleared in the program center and subsequently developed and cleared in a  field office, it could be incorrectly listed as two separate work CDRs. SSA  officials also acknowledged that some of the cases we reviewed which  showed indications of being cleared multiple times could result in their  being counted as numerous separate work CDRs. Thus, existing high-level  management data may not accurately capture how many work CDRs have  actually been completed.", "We also found that SSA does not currently have the capability to track the  disposition of work CDR cases. For example, the agency is unable to  systematically track how many work CDR cases involve overpayments.  Because it lacks sufficient management information data on this workload,  the agency also does not have performance goals for work CDRs similar to  measures it maintains for its medical CDR workloads, such as the number  of work CDRs that should be completed each year.

The new automated system that SSA is developing may help the agency  address some of the weaknesses we identified, but it is too early to  determine how effective it will be. A conscious management decision to  use this system to improve DI program integrity in conjunction with more  accurate management information will be required to help detect and  prevent large overpayments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To enhance SSA\u2019s ability to detect and prevent overpayments in the DI  program, we recommend that the Commissioner of Social Security take  the following actions to improve the agency\u2019s work CDR processes:  1.  Initiate action to develop a data sharing agreement with the Office of  Child Support Enforcement to conduct batch-file periodic computer  matches with the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH). Such  matches would provide SSA with more timely data to help the agency  systematically identify DI beneficiaries who are most likely to incur  overpayments. Such a tool could also allow SSA to perform a one-time,  comprehensive match against all DI beneficiary records to identify  individuals who may be overpaid but have not yet been detected.  2.  Consider developing an enhanced screening mechanism that would  enable the agency to more effectively identify DI beneficiaries who are  most likely to incur earnings-related overpayments. This would help  the agency make more efficient use of limited staff and budgetary  resources.  3.  Study the potential for creating an alert system similar to that used in  the SSI program for alerting field offices about recipients at high risk  for earnings-related overpayments. Such a system would allow SSA to  notify field offices and program service centers about beneficiaries the  agency identifies as most likely to incur large overpayments.  4.  Consider ways to improve the accuracy and usefulness of existing  management information data. Improvements may include modifying  how the agency measures the age of work CDR cases to more  accurately reflect how long they are in process.  5.  Once the eWork system is fully implemented, SSA should consider  how it could be used to help the agency create performance goals for  its work CDR workload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SSA for review and comment.  SSA  agreed with our recommendations and, in some instances, outlined initial  plans for their implementation.", "SSA agreed with our first recommendation to develop a data-sharing  agreement with the Office of Child Support Enforcement to conduct  batch-file computer matches with the NDNH. The agency noted that it  pursued online access to the NDNH first because it was more cost  effective and expeditious. The agency also indicated that it is developing a  new computer matching agreement that supports SSA\u2019s use of the NDNH  in the DI program for purposes of identifying potential overpayments.  We  encourage SSA to ensure that any new agreement will provide for  periodic, batch-file matches to verify beneficiaries\u2019 earnings at regular,  specified intervals.", "SSA also agreed with our second recommendation to consider developing  an enhanced screening mechanism to help the agency more effectively  identify DI beneficiaries most likely to incur earnings-related  overpayments.  In particular, SSA agreed that it should pursue a screening  system similar to that currently used for medical CDRs to determine if  there is an increased likelihood of earnings-related overpayments based on  particular diagnosis codes.  It also noted that it should study ways to  improve the effectiveness of existing systems (such as the Continuing  Disability Review Enforcement Operation and the Disability Control File)  to help the agency focus on beneficiaries with the greatest potential for  overpayments. We agree that these are positive steps and that the agency  should consider how improvements to such systems might be  incorporated to emerging systems such as \u201ceWork\u201d.", "With respect to our third recommendation that SSA develop an alert  system similar to that currently used in the SSI program for alerting staff  to cases at risk for earnings-related overpayments, SSA agreed and noted  that an alert system such as the \u201cS2\u201d alert used for SSI wage discrepancies  could provide a useful model. The agency noted that such an alert could  reduce the amount of time in which a claimant would continue to receive  payments while work development is initiated. Moreover, since these  reports include the employer\u2019s name, address, and a quarterly breakdown  of the beneficiary\u2019s earnings, this detailed information would provide SSA  staff with more specific information than is currently available.  SSA also  said that an alert system could also be generated from the NDNH match  proposed in our first recommendation. We agree that an alert system  would help identify potential overpayments more quickly, particularly if it  were generated from data produced by periodic computer matches with  the NDNH.", "SSA agreed with our fourth recommendation to improve the accuracy and  usefulness of existing management information data.  SSA said that it is  working on a plan to unify the manner in which it identifies and counts  work and medical CDRs. The agency believes that it will be able to more  accurately capture workload counts and employee time consistently,  regardless of where the work is performed. While we agree that efforts to  improve existing processes and systems are necessary, it is too early to  determine if the proposed modifications will address the problems we  identified with high level management information, such as potential  double-counting of work CDRs.", "SSA also agreed with our fifth recommendation to consider how it could  use the eWork system to create performance goals for work CDRs once it  is fully implemented. The agency commented that such a measure would  give field offices and program service centers a better indication of what is  expected of them regarding processing this workload and would help  them balance the time needed to process competing workloads.", "SSA\u2019s formal comments appear in appendix II. SSA also provided  additional technical comments that we have incorporated in the report as  appropriate.", "Unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further  distribution until 30 days after the date of this report.  At that time, we will  send copies of this report to the House and Senate Committees with  oversight responsibility for the Social Security Administration.

To meet the  objectives of the review, we examined DI performance data, prior reports  by SSA and its Office of Inspector General (OIG), external research  studies, and our prior reviews of the program. We analyzed DI payment  data over a 5-year period from 1999 to 2003, and examined cases from 14  out of 18 SSA field offices we visited and 3 program service centers. In  addition, we randomly selected and reviewed 71 cases with earnings to  determine if they were reviewed and processed in accordance with  program guidelines. Finally, we conducted in-depth interviews with 230  management and line staff from SSA\u2019s headquarters; its regional offices in  New York and San Francisco; 18 field offices in 6 states; and 3 out of 8  regional program service centers. During our meetings, we (1) examined  existing work CDR procedures; (2) documented management and staff  views on the effectiveness of SSA\u2019s work CDR processes for detecting and  preventing earnings-related overpayments; and (3) discussed potential  improvements to existing program processes, systems, and policies.", "We conducted independent audit work in six states (California, Florida,  Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia) to examine SSA\u2019s  policies and procedures for conducting work CDRs, and to identify any  common weaknesses in SSA\u2019s work CDR processes. We selected locations  for field visits based on several criteria, including geographic dispersion,  states with an SSA program service center, states with large numbers of DI  beneficiaries, and states with large DI expenditures. In total, we visited 18  field offices and interviewed 161 SSA field office managers and line staff  responsible for the DI program. We visited a mix of large offices in  metropolitan areas as well as smaller offices located in the suburbs. In  addition, we visited three program service centers in Richmond,  California; Queens, New York; and Baltimore, Maryland. These program  centers were responsible for the majority of all work CDRs identified by  the enforcement operation. Where appropriate, we also visited field offices  or program centers that were conducting special initiatives or piloting  emerging computer systems that could impact how SSA conducts work  CDRs (such as the \u201ceWork\u201d system).", "During our meetings with SSA and OIG officials, we documented  management and staff views on the effectiveness of work CDR policies  and procedures and potential improvements to existing processes,  policies, and systems. In particular, we documented management and staff  views on (1) the timeliness of existing data sources to verify beneficiary  earnings, (2) the effectiveness of existing processes for identifying  individuals at high-risk for large overpayments, (3) the effectiveness of  existing computer systems for notifying staff responsible for conducting  work CDRs about cases that should be reviewed, and (4) the accuracy of  management information data used to monitor work CDRs in one large  program service center. To further assess existing program processes and  systems, at 10 offices and 3 service centers, we judgmentally selected  between 5 and 7 pending or completed work CDR cases. We generally  looked at older cases in order to understand where existing procedures  may have weaknesses. We then conducted in-depth reviews of these case  files to identify potential vulnerabilities in existing work CDR processes,  policies, and systems.", "As part of our study, we worked with SSA to draw a 1 percent sample of  all work CDR cases that were \u201ccleared\u201d from the agency\u2019s Processing  Center Action and Control System over a 1-week period in April 2004 (the  \u201cstudy population\u201d). Our objective was to determine whether work CDR  cases were cleared in accordance with agency guidelines and to assess the  accuracy of high-level management data produced by this system. This  sample resulted in a total of 151 cleared cases. We then randomly selected  71 of these 151 cases for review. As part of our review, we discovered that  there was a potential for cleared work CDR cases to appear multiple times  in SSA\u2019s Processing Center Action Control System. On the basis of our  discussion with knowledgeable SSA officials, we determined it would be  highly unlikely for cases to be listed as \u201ccleared\u201d multiple times in a 1- week time period. Therefore, we assumed that cases did not appear more  than once in the 1-week time period from which we drew our sample.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that could have been  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  using 95 percent confidence intervals. A confidence interval is an interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident  that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true  values in the study population. For this file review, the margin of error for  each percentage estimate does not exceed plus or minus 10 percentage  points, unless otherwise noted. The margin of error is the distance from  each estimate to the upper or lower boundaries of its 95 percent  confidence interval.", "To assess the reliability of the databases we used, reviewed reports  provided by SSA and its Office of Inspector General, which contained  recent assessments of these databases. We also interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials to further document the reliability of these  systems. In addition, we checked the data for internal logic, consistency,  and reasonableness.
