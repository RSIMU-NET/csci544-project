According to the Secretary of Agriculture, the  department has faced reductions in discretionary spending of about $3  billion (or 12 percent) from fiscal years 2010 to 2012. To implement these  reductions, USDA and its agencies have taken various actions to  restructure operations and reduce their staffs, including through closing  offices and offering buyout and early retirement incentives.", "In fiscal year 2012, USDA announced that eight agencies would close  offices and programs. Of these, the three agencies with the largest overall  staffing level percentage reductions were USDA\u2019s service center  agencies\u2014the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS), and Rural Development (RD). These  agencies interact directly with agricultural producers and rural  communities through an extensive field office structure.", "In its 2012 annual report, USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General said the  need to plan for reduced staff in certain USDA agencies is one of the  department\u2019s most serious management challenges. Specifically, the  report noted that USDA needs to ensure that, even as it reduces staff in  certain agencies, it maintains its ability to accomplish mission-critical  functions such as the servicing and oversight of billions of dollars in loans,  which are handled by USDA\u2019s service center agencies. The Office of  Inspector General in its 2013 update on the department\u2019s management  challenges stated that USDA should appropriately train and utilize its staff  in the face of significant staff reductions.", "Having information on human capital trends over time such as changes in  staffing levels and shifts in occupation types can be helpful in  understanding the impact of such changes on the workforce and on an  agency\u2019s ability to achieve its mission. For example, in a 2012 survey,  federal chief human capital officers noted the importance of using  workforce analytics to examine agency data and the need for data  analytics to be used as a predictive tool, particularly in the areas of  retirement and succession planning. In addition, we previously reported  that federal agencies experienced significant challenges to deploying the  right skills, in the right places, at the right time, in the wake of extensive  downsizing during the early 1990s, which was done largely without  sufficient consideration of the strategic consequences.", "You asked us to review aspects of USDA\u2019s human capital management  related to office closures and staff reduction efforts in fiscal year 2012.

We took  several steps to ensure the reliability of the data and analytical process.  We chose to report workforce data for 10 years, starting in fiscal year  2003, because this period provided a historical context for the changes  that occurred in fiscal year 2012, among other things. Most of our  workforce data are reported for career permanent employees on full- or  part-time schedules because they represent a more stable part of the  workforce.", "To determine the extent to which USDA\u2019s policy on supervisory ratios  aligned with OPM guidance in fiscal year 2012, we reviewed OPM  guidance on its Human Capital Assessment and Accountability  Framework and compared it with USDA\u2019s policy on supervisory ratios;  analyzed workforce data from OPM and USDA databases on supervisory  ratios; reviewed reports from USDA\u2019s service center agencies on their  supervisory ratios and compared them with USDA guidance on  calculating supervisory ratios, as well as standards for internal control in  the federal government; and interviewed officials from OPM, USDA, and  USDA\u2019s service center agencies.", "To determine the extent to which USDA\u2019s service center agencies  followed leading practices when closing offices and reducing staff, we  reviewed leading practices identified previously by GAO for successful  consolidations such as office closures and examined provisions in the  Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill) applicable  to FSA\u2019s office closures. We did not assess whether FSA complied with  the 2008 Farm Bill\u2019s office closure provisions. In addition, we reviewed  provisions in the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 revising the  use of voluntary early retirement authority and voluntary separation  incentive payments, which are referred to in this report as buyout and  early retirement incentives. We also reviewed regulations and guidance  from OPM on the use of buyout and early retirement incentives and  leading practices from previous GAO work on consolidating physical  infrastructure and using buyout and early retirement incentives. For both  office closures and staffing reductions, we reviewed standards for internal  control in the federal government. We compared these criteria with  information provided by USDA\u2019s service center agencies about the  actions they took to close offices and reduce staff in fiscal year 2012.

They provide financial and technical assistance to agricultural  producers and rural communities. Specifically, FSA provides payments  and loans to agricultural producers through various programs, including  farm commodity and crop disaster assistance programs authorized in the  2008 Farm Bill. NRCS provides, among other things, technical and  financial assistance to private landowners to implement conservation  practices on their land. NRCS\u2019s Soil Science Division, along with other  federal agencies, states, and other entities, makes and maintains an  inventory of the soil resources of the United States and disseminates the  results for both nonfarm and farm uses.

This initiative encompasses a number of efforts at the departmental and  agency levels. Office closures announced under the initiative in fiscal year  2012 resulted in the closure of more than 200 offices, facilities, and labs  in eight USDA agencies, including at USDA\u2019s service center agencies. As  part of this initiative:", "FSA closed 125 offices (out of about 2,100 total offices) in 32 states.  Based on information from FSA, these closures resulted in estimated  net savings, starting in fiscal year 2013, of about $2.1 million. In  choosing which offices to close, FSA officials told us they were guided  by provisions in the 2008 Farm Bill, which requires that, to the  maximum extent practicable, the agency must close offices with two  or fewer permanent full-time employees and that were less than 20  miles from another office before closing any office located more than  20 miles from another office. FSA officials also reported that they  closed unstaffed offices regardless of their distance from another  office. In addition to closing offices, FSA offered four rounds of  buyout or early retirement incentives to its employees in fiscal year  2012. With limited exceptions, three of the four rounds were offered to  staff in both headquarters operations and field locations, in some  cases subject to a priority order. The fourth offer was limited to  employees in offices selected for closures in fiscal year 2012. In  response to these incentives, OPM and USDA data indicate that 682  FSA employees accepted buyout or early retirement incentives,  which, according to FSA officials, resulted in about $20 million in cost  savings in fiscal year 2012.", "NRCS closed 24 soil survey offices (out of about 160 soil survey  offices and about 2,800 offices overall) in 21 states. According to  NRCS officials, these closures resulted in estimated savings of about  $1.3 million in fiscal year 2013. NRCS officials told us that to  determine which local soil survey offices to close, they reviewed  offices\u2019 funding, workload, and proximity to specific universities. For  regional office closure determinations, officials told us they considered  workload, proximity to transportation corridors, and equitable  distribution of local offices in each region. In addition to closing  offices, NRCS offered buyout and early retirement incentives to  employees affected by the soil survey office closures. According to  NRCS officials, 18 NRCS employees accepted buyout incentives, and  a subset of those individuals also accepted early retirement incentives  associated with its soil survey office closures in fiscal year 2012. The  savings NRCS attributed to employees accepting those incentives  was approximately $470,000 in fiscal year 2012.", "RD closed 43 offices (out of more than 400 total offices) in 17 states.", "According to RD officials, these closures resulted in estimated net  savings, starting in fiscal year 2013, of about $710,000. In choosing  which offices to close, RD officials told us that they used focus groups  and weighed multiple criteria, including whether (1) an office location  was in an isolated community, (2) a particular location served tribal  lands, and (3) other USDA agencies were contemplating a closure in  the same location. In addition, prior to the office closures, RD offered  buyout and early retirement incentives to all optional and early  retirement eligible employees, except for employees in two  occupations. OPM data indicate that 599 RD employees accepted  buyout or early retirement incentives in fiscal year 2012, which RD  officials told us resulted in about $25 million in cost savings in fiscal  year 2012.", "Prior to this initiative, USDA\u2019s service center agencies have closed  offices.

This guidance states, among other things, that an effectively  implemented workforce planning system results in the right balance of  supervisory and nonsupervisory positions to best support the agency  mission based on an analysis of customer needs and workload  distribution. OPM also provides guidance to agencies on classification of  grades and positions. For example, under the General Schedule,  agencies use a uniform set of OPM-issued standards to classify positions  into occupation series within five occupational groups, including (1)  professional and scientific positions, (2) administrative and management  positions, (3) technical and medical support positions, (4) clerical and  administrative support positions, and (5) other.", "At USDA, the Office of Human Resources Management directs  implementation of the Human Capital Assessment and Accountability  Framework and evaluates human capital management policies, among  others, to determine how effectively they support human capital efforts to  achieve program results.

The decrease in the  size of the workforces of USDA\u2019s service center agencies accelerated in  fiscal year 2012 (see figs. 1 and 2). Specifically, in each of the last 10  years, the average decrease was approximately 4.5 percent in FSA, 1.4  percent in NRCS, and 3.3 percent in RD. From fiscal years 2011 to 2012,  the decrease was 9.2 percent in FSA, 3.8 percent in NRCS, and 14  percent in RD. Other characteristics of their workforces, such as grade  levels and occupation types, largely remained the same during this  period.", "At USDA\u2019s service center agencies, workforce decreases were smaller in  headquarters operations than in field locations and smaller for career  permanent employees than for employees with other appointments, such  as temporary employees (see table 1). Specifically, from fiscal years 2003  to 2012, the size of the workforce of each of the agencies\u2019 headquarters  operations decreased at a slightly slower average annual rate than the  workforce of the agencies\u2019 field locations. According to agency officials,  workforce decreases over this 10-year period were attributed to various  factors. At FSA, these decreases were due to budget constraints; at  NRCS, officials said they were due to changes associated with the Farm  Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill) and the  2008 Farm Bill; and at RD, officials said they were due to the need to stay  within appropriated funding levels while other expenses increased, such  as those associated with information technology, office space rental  costs, and staff pay. We also reviewed the percentage change in the size  of the service center agencies\u2019 workforces from fiscal years 2011 to 2012  and found that the workforce decreases were smaller in headquarters  operations than in the field for FSA and RD, but they were larger in  headquarters operations than in the field for NRCS. Based on our  analysis, some of these changes may be due to staff reduction efforts  undertaken by the agencies, while others may be attributed to natural  attrition. As it relates to the average annual decline in the number of  employees by appointment type, the number of career permanent  employees, which make up the majority of the agencies\u2019 workforces, was  less than the average annual decline in the number of other employees,  such as temporary employees. This was also the case for the  percentage change in the size of the workforces from fiscal years 2011 to  2012. Most of the agencies\u2019 temporary employees were in field locations  in fiscal year 2012. FSA officials told us that their temporary workers  perform many of the same functions as their career permanent  employees. For example, program technicians who implement  procedures, regulations, and operations of a county office\u2019s administrative  program area, can be temporary or career permanent employees.", "From fiscal years 2003 to 2012, the average number of employees per  supervisor, characterized in a supervisor-to-employee ratio, decreased at  FSA and RD but remained relatively constant at NRCS (see fig. 3).", "NRCS officials told us that their supervisory ratio has not declined in the  past 10 years because of restructuring and additional responsibilities  assumed by its workforce as a result of the 2002 Farm Bill. During this  10-year period, there were more employees per supervisor in FSA\u2019s  headquarters operations compared with its field locations. At NRCS and  RD, there were generally fewer employees per supervisor at their  headquarters operations than at their field locations. For example, in  fiscal year 2012, the supervisor-to-employee ratio in FSA\u2019s headquarters  operations was approximately 1:5 compared with 1:4 in its field locations.  At NRCS, the supervisor-to-employee ratio in its headquarters operations  was approximately 1:6 compared with 1:14 in its field locations. At RD,  the supervisor-to-employee ratio in its headquarters operations was  approximately 1:6 compared with 1:8 in its field locations.", "The median pay grades of the workforces of USDA\u2019s service center  agencies remained relatively constant. Specifically, from fiscal years  2003 to 2012, the median pay grade for FSA stayed at pay grade 7, and  for NRCS and RD it stayed at pay grade 11. The median pay grades for  the service center agencies\u2019 headquarters operations from fiscal years  2003 to 2012 were higher than in the field locations at FSA and NRCS but  the same, at 11, at RD. For example, at NRCS, the median pay grade  from fiscal years 2003 to 2012 was 12 or 13 in the agency\u2019s headquarters  operations and 11 in its field locations. With respect to the grade  distribution of supervisors, these remained relatively constant at FSA and  RD, but the pay grades of the majority of supervisors increased at NRCS.  From fiscal years 2003 to 2012, the majority of supervisors at FSA were  in pay grades 10 to 12, and at RD, the majority of supervisors were in pay  grades 13 to 15. At NRCS, the majority of supervisors were in pay grades  10 to 12 in fiscal year 2003, but by fiscal year 2012, the majority were in  pay grades 13 to 15.

OMB  guidelines for agencies to consider when conducting a cost-benefit  analysis of federal programs say that such analysis should include a  policy rationale, explicit assumptions, an evaluation of the alternatives,  and a plan to verify program results. Further, federal internal control  standards call for federal agencies to document key decisions and to  manage and maintain the documentation and make it available for  examination. USDA has a policy on making organizational changes that  requests agencies to submit information on proposed closures that  include some elements of a business-case analysis, such as a detailed  explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the proposed closure and  verification from agency management that internal control policies have  been met. However, according to a USDA official, the Secretary of  Agriculture waived the department\u2019s requests for such proposals for the  fiscal year 2012 office closures associated with the department\u2019s  Blueprint for Stronger Service, saying that agencies had already done  work to assist in making decisions on the closures.

For example, FSA  officials told us the agency considered alternatives, such as closing more  offices than were eventually closed. RD officials told us they considered  several factors in their decision regarding selecting offices for closures,  such as the type of communities where offices were located and whether  other USDA agencies were planning to close offices at that location, and  consulted with focus groups. However, neither FSA nor RD documented  these considerations in a business-case or cost-benefit analysis. A USDA  official said the agencies did not prepare written analyses because USDA  waived the policy for the office closures associated with the department\u2019s  Blueprint for Stronger Service. The policy that was waived was USDA\u2019s  policy on making organizational changes. However, this policy does not  include all elements of a business-case or cost-benefit analysis, such as  considering alternatives and documenting underlying assumptions.  Without presenting business-case or cost-benefit analyses, FSA and RD  cannot demonstrate to their workforces, agricultural producers, and other  stakeholders the alternatives they considered in their decision making  and the steps they took to make effective use of public funds in support of  their missions. For example, representatives of employee unions at RD  told us that it was unclear how RD management chose offices to close. At  FSA, employee group representatives raised questions about why the  agency was choosing to close field offices rather than consolidate offices  above the field office level. In addition, employee group representatives  and those commenting on the proposed closures during public meetings  raised questions about whether the decisions made sense from a  budgetary perspective or whether criteria used to close FSA\u2019s unstaffed  offices took into account factors such as workload or the number of  beginning, older, and disadvantaged producers served by these offices.

For example, NRCS provided us with  information showing that the number of activities it has undertaken  associated with its technical soil services steadily increased from fiscal  years 2011 to 2013. However, these activities were only partially related  to work performed by soil survey offices, and NRCS did not provide us  with information on how those metrics were affected by its soil survey  office closures. At RD, officials told us that closing offices had helped  them with their goals to leverage resources and streamline operations,  but they could not demonstrate these benefits using specific metrics.  Similarly, FSA officials said that overall, agricultural producers\u2019  participation in FSA programs has not decreased following the office  closures, but they did not provide specific participation information in  areas where offices had closed. USDA\u2019s policy on making organizational  changes asks agencies to detail the circumstances giving rise to the  proposed changes, but it does not ask agencies to measure progress  toward office closure goals.

FSA officials told us that using this checklist  helped smooth the closure process. NRCS officials stated that the agency  used experiences from 2011 office closures in its Resource Conservation  and Development Division to inform elements of its fiscal year 2012  closures such as devising a placement strategy for affected employees.

However, documenting such deviations  requires that USDA\u2019s agencies show why it is appropriate for them to  deviate from a department-wide policy as opposed to factoring such  analysis into their supervisory ratios initially. Finally, USDA notes that the  policy was effectively communicated to all agencies and staff offices,  along with supplemental guidance on how to calculate supervisor-to- employee ratios. During our review, USDA officials provided us a  guidance document on how to calculate supervisory ratios and said that  they had provided it to the mission areas\u2019 human resources directors in  2010. However, as discussed in our report, USDA officials could not  provide documentation that the guidance was communicated to the  service center agencies, and none of the service center agencies  followed this guidance. Therefore, we continue to believe that USDA  needs to revise departmental policy targeting a uniform supervisory ratio,  communicate to the service center agencies guidance for calculating  supervisory ratios, and ensure its use.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We  chose to report workforce data for 10 years, starting with fiscal year 2003,  because this period (1) provided a historical context for the changes that  occurred in fiscal year 2012 and (2) encompassed the agencies\u2019  operations under two farm bills: the Farm Security and Rural Investment  Act of 2002 and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008  Farm Bill).", "To determine how the workforces of USDA\u2019s service center agencies  changed from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2012, we analyzed workforce  data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources Integration database and  USDA\u2019s National Finance Center; reviewed available reports, plans, and  guidance from OPM and USDA related to human capital management;  and interviewed OPM and USDA officials. Using the OPM and USDA  data, we determined the changes in the workforces of USDA\u2019s service  center agencies, including the General Schedule, Senior Executive  Service, as well as county office employees, who are not federal  employees and are, therefore, not captured in OPM\u2019s database. For  county office employees, we obtained their workforce data from USDA  directly. Our analysis focused on career permanent employees on a full-  or part-time year-round schedule. We generally excluded temporary and  term-limited employees and schedules other than full- and part-time (such  as intermittent or seasonal) because these employees are generally not  eligible for civil service benefits and represent a more transient workforce.  When reporting data on employees by location, we defined headquarters  operations to include the Washington, D.C., locality pay area and other  duty stations that are considered to be part of the headquarters  operations. For FSA, these locations include Kansas City, Missouri; St.  Louis, Missouri; and Salt Lake City, Utah. For NRCS, these include Fort  Collins, Colorado; Fort Worth, Texas; Greensboro, North Carolina;  Lincoln, Nebraska; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Portland, Oregon. For RD,  this includes St. Louis, Missouri. For the purpose of this report,  employees in all other duty stations are considered to be in field  locations. We calculated supervisory ratios by comparing the number of  supervisors or managers with the number of nonsupervisors or  managers, as defined by OPM, in accordance with the USDA\u2019s Office of  Human Resources Management\u2019s guidance. We did not independently  check the agencies\u2019 coding of supervisors.", "We completed additional analyses on the workforces of USDA\u2019s service  center agencies at the end of fiscal year 2012 because, during that year,  USDA announced the Blueprint for Stronger Service, an initiative that  included office closures and resulted, in some cases, in the offerings of  buyout and early retirement incentives. Such actions could affect the size  and composition of the workforces of USDA\u2019s service center agencies.", "We analyzed USDA\u2019s service center agencies\u2019 ethnicity and race, gender,  pay grade levels, mission-critical occupations, length of federal service,  and retirement eligibility. We used OPM\u2019s standard categories for our  analysis of ethnicity and race and gender. Our analysis of pay grade  levels included employees on the General Schedule, as well as county  office employees, whose grade levels are comparable to the General  Schedule pay plan. We grouped grade levels into three categories; the  middle range covers the median grades of NRCS\u2019s and RD\u2019s workforces,  as well as the FSA headquarters workforce. To analyze mission-critical  occupations, we obtained a list of these occupational series from the  agencies\u2019 workforce plans or agency officials. To provide more detailed  information about mission-critical occupations, we obtained position  descriptions from USDA\u2019s service center agencies. We grouped length of  federal service into five categories based on typical attrition patterns. To  determine the current and projected retirement eligibility, we used  employees\u2019 age at hire, federal government service start date, birth date,  and retirement plan coverage to calculate the date they would become  eligible for voluntary retirement with an unreduced annuity.", "We took several steps to ensure the reliability of the data and analytical  process. We discussed the reliability of the USDA data with  knowledgeable officials and collected additional data reliability information  on both OPM and USDA data through interviews with FSA, NRCS, and  RD. In our analysis of OPM and USDA data, we checked for outliers or  obvious errors and followed up with USDA when such issues were  identified. In addition, where we identified anomalies or significant change  in trends in our detailed analysis of the size of the workforces and  supervisory ratios, we corroborated these findings with agency human  capital staff and published reports. Lastly, the programming code for this  analysis was reviewed by an independent specialist to verify its technical  and logical accuracy.", "To determine the extent to which USDA policy on supervisory ratios  aligned with OPM guidance in fiscal year 2012, we reviewed OPM  guidance on its Human Capital Assessment and Accountability  Framework and compared it with USDA\u2019s policy on supervisory ratios;  analyzed workforce data from OPM and USDA databases on supervisory  ratios; reviewed reports from USDA\u2019s service center agencies on their  supervisory ratios and compared them with USDA guidance on  calculating supervisory ratios, as well as standards for internal control in  the federal government; and interviewed officials from OPM, USDA, and  USDA\u2019s service center agencies.", "To determine the extent to which USDA\u2019s service center agencies  followed leading practices to close offices and reduce staff in fiscal year  2012, we identified leading practices for both office closures and staff  reductions through the use of buyout and early retirement incentives. For  office closures, we reviewed previous GAO work on consolidating  physical infrastructure to identify four leading practices for successful  office closures. These include: (1) identify and agree upon goals, (2)  present a business-case or cost-benefit analysis, (3) identify stakeholders  and develop a two-way communications strategy, and (4) implement  consolidations using change management practices. For staff reductions,  we reviewed provisions of the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002  that revise the use of voluntary early retirement authority and voluntary  separation incentive payments, regulations and guidance from OPM on  the use of buyout and early retirement incentives, and leading practices  from previous GAO work to identify six leading practices for implementing  buyout and early retirement incentives. These include: (1) identify  reshaping goals, (2) develop strategies that fully consider alternative  methods, (3) demonstrate a clear linkage to workforce reshaping and  overarching strategic goals, (4) consider employees\u2019 needs, (5) develop a  communications strategy early in the process, and (6) establish an  evaluation system. We also reviewed standards for internal control in the  federal government. We gathered information on agency actions by  collecting documentation and interviewing officials from FSA, NRCS, and  RD. We also interviewed representatives of unions and employee  associations at FSA and RD. We assessed each agency\u2019s reported  actions against the identified leading practices to determine the extent to  which each agency\u2019s actions aligned with these practices. Because the  leading practices are not requirements, we did not perform a compliance  review. To communicate the results of our review, we used the terms,  \u201cfollowed,\u201d \u201cpartially followed,\u201d and \u201cdid not follow\u201d to reflect in plain  language the extent to which each agency\u2019s actions aligned with identified  leading practices. A determination of \u201cfollowed\u201d means that the agency  provided evidence that it had taken major actions in alignment with that  leading practice. A determination of \u201cpartially followed\u201d means that the  agency provided evidence that it had taken some actions in alignment  with that leading practice. A determination of \u201cdid not follow\u201d means that  the agency did not provide evidence that it had taken any actions in  alignment with that leading practice. To determine the number and type of  service center agency staff members who accepted buyout and early  retirement incentives, we used information provided by each agency and  analyzed workforce data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources  Integration database. Eligibility for retirement or early retirement is based  on age at hire, birth date, service computation date, and retirement plan.  Because the OPM data we have did not include the specific day of the  month for each employee\u2019s service computation date and birthday, these  results may be off by up to 1 month.", "To review FSA\u2019s fiscal year 2012 decisions related to office closures and  requirements in the 2008 Farm Bill, we compared provisions in the 2008  Farm Bill with information from FSA on each office that closed as a result  of the USDA announcement made in fiscal year 2012 related to: (1)  location and distance from the nearest FSA office; (2) the number and  type of employees; (3) the location and date of public meetings; (4) the  dates of congressional notifications; and (5) the actual date closed. To  determine the locations and distances of each closed office, we used  USDA-provided addresses to independently calculate the latitude and  longitude for each street address of each closed office and its next  closest office as identified by USDA. Using these addresses, we  independently calculated the distances between the closed and nearest  offices using our calculated latitude and longitude. In instances where  automated tools could not determine a specific location for a given  address, our analysis relied on manual determination of geocoordinates.  We did not assess whether FSA complied with the 2008 Farm Bill\u2019s office  closure provisions.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 to March 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
