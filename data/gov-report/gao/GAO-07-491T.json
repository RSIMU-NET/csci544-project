To help ensure proper implementation, the act requires that agencies annually report specific information about their FOIA operations, such as numbers of requests received and processed and median processing times. In addition, a recent Executive Order directs agencies to develop plans to improve their FOIA operations, including decreasing backlogs. GAO was asked to testify on the results of its study on FOIA processing and agencies' improvement plans. The draft report on the study is currently out for comment at the agencies involved (and is thus subject to change). For the study, GAO reviewed status and trends of FOIA processing at 25 major agencies as reflected in annual reports, as well as the extent to which improvement plans contain the elements emphasized by the Executive Order. To do so, GAO analyzed the 25 agencies' annual reports and improvement plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on data in annual reports from 2002 to 2005, the public continued to submit more requests for information from the federal government through FOIA. Despite increasing the numbers of requests processed, many agencies did not keep pace with the volume of requests that they received. As a result, the number of pending requests carried over from year to year has been steadily increasing. Agency reports also show great variations in the median times to process requests (less than 10 days for some agency components to more than 100 days at others). However, the ability to determine trends in processing times is limited by the form in which these times are reported: that is, in medians only, without averages (that is, arithmetical means) or ranges. Although medians have the advantage of providing representative numbers that are not skewed by a few outliers, it is not statistically possible to combine several medians to develop broader generalizations (as can be done with arithmetical means). This limitation on aggregating data impedes the development of broader pictures of FOIA operations, which could be useful in monitoring efforts to improve processing and reduce the increasing backlog of requests, as intended by the Executive Order. The improvement plans submitted by the 25 agencies mostly included goals and timetables addressing the four areas of improvement emphasized by the Executive Order: eliminating or reducing any backlog of FOIA requests; increasing reliance on dissemination of records that can be made available to the public without the need for a FOIA request, such as through posting on Web sites; improving communications with requesters about the status of their requests; and increasing public awareness of FOIA processing. Most of the plans (20 of 25) provided goals and timetables in all four areas; some agencies omitted goals in areas where they considered they were already strong. Although details of a few plans could be improved (for example, one agency did not explicitly address areas of improvement other than backlog), all the plans focus on making measurable improvements and form a reasonable basis for carrying out the goals of the Executive Order."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s  hearing on the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA) and agency efforts to comply with this important legislation.

Agencies receive requests,  usually in writing (although they may accept requests by telephone  or electronically), which can come from any organization or  member of the public. Once received, the request goes through  several phases, which include initial processing, searching for and  retrieving responsive records, preparing responsive records for  release, approving the release of the records, and releasing the  records to the requester. Figure 1 is an overview of the process,  from the receipt of a request to the release of records.", "During the initial processing phase, a request is logged into the  agency\u2019s FOIA system, and a case file is started. The request is then  reviewed to determine its scope, estimate fees, and provide an initial  response to the requester (in general, this simply acknowledges  receipt of the request). After this point, the FOIA staff begins its  search to retrieve responsive records. This step may include  searching for records from multiple locations and program offices.  After potentially responsive records are located, the documents are  reviewed to ensure that they are within the scope of the request.", "During the next two phases, the agency ensures that appropriate  information is to be released under the provisions of the act. First,  the agency reviews the responsive records to make any redactions  based on the statutory exemptions. Once the exemption review is  complete, the final set of responsive records is turned over to the  FOIA office, which calculates appropriate fees, if applicable. Before  release, the redacted responsive records are then given a final  review, possibly by the agency\u2019s general counsel, and then a  response letter is generated, summarizing the agency\u2019s actions  regarding the request. Finally, the responsive records are released to  the requester.", "Some requests are relatively simple to process, such as requests for  specific pieces of information that the requester sends directly to  the appropriate office. Other requests may require more extensive  processing, depending on their complexity, the volume of  information involved, the need for the agency FOIA office to work  with offices that have relevant subject-matter expertise to find and  obtain information, the need for a FOIA officer to review and redact  information in the responsive material, the need to communicate  with the requester about the scope of the request, and the need to  communicate with the requester about the fees that will be charged  for fulfilling the request (or whether fees will be waived).", "Specific details of agency processes for handling requests vary,  depending on the agency\u2019s organizational structure and the  complexity of the requests received. While some agencies centralize  processing in one main office, other agencies have separate FOIA  offices for each agency component and field office. Agencies also  vary in how they allow requests to be made. Depending on the  agency, requesters can submit requests by telephone, fax, letter, or  e-mail or through the Web. In addition, agencies may process  requests in two ways, known as \u201cmultitrack\u201d and \u201csingle track.\u201d  Multitrack processing involves dividing requests into two groups:  (1) simple requests requiring relatively minimal review, which are  placed in one processing track, and (2) more voluminous and  complex requests, which are placed in another track. In contrast,  single-track processing does not distinguish between simple and  complex requests. With single-track processing, agencies process all  requests on a first-in/first-out basis.

In many cases, the variance can  be accounted for by the types of requests that different agencies  process. For example, as discussed earlier, SSA grants a very high  proportion of requests because they are requests for personal  information about individuals that are routinely made available to or  for the individuals concerned. Similarly, VA routinely makes medical  records available to individual veterans, and HHS also handles large  numbers of Privacy Act requests. Such requests are generally  granted in full. Other agencies, on the other hand, receive numerous  requests whose responses must routinely be redacted. For example,  NSF reported in its annual report that most of its requests (an  estimated 90 percent) are for copies of funded grant proposals. The  responsive documents are routinely redacted to remove personal  information on individual principal investigators (such as salaries,  home addresses, and so on), which results in high numbers of  \u201cpartial grants\u201d compared to \u201cfull grants.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Times Vary, but Broad Generalizations Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["For 2005, the reported time required to process requests (by track)  varied considerably among agencies.

To find an arithmetic mean, one adds all the members of  a list of numbers and divides the result by the number of items in  the list. To find the median, one arranges all the values in the list  from lowest to highest and finds the middle one (or the average of  the middle two if there is no one middle number). Thus, although  using medians provides representative numbers that are not skewed  by a few outliers, they cannot be summed. Deriving a median for  two sets of numbers, for example, requires knowing all numbers in  both sets. Only the source data for the medians can be used to  derive a new median, not the medians themselves.", "As a result, with only medians it is not statistically possible to  combine results from different agencies to develop broader  generalizations, such as a governmentwide statistic based on all  agency reports, statistics from sets of comparable agencies, or an  agencywide statistic based on separate reports from all components  of the agency.", "In rewriting the FOIA reporting requirements in 1996, legislators  declared an interest in making them \u201cmore useful to the public and  to Congress, and  the information in them more  accessible.\u201d However, the limitation on aggregating data imposed  by the use of medians alone impedes the development of broader  pictures of FOIA operations. A more complete picture would be  given by the inclusion of other statistics based on the same data that  are used to derive medians, such as means and ranges. Providing  means along with the median would allow more generalizations to  be drawn, and providing ranges would complete the picture by  adding information on the outliers in agency statistics.
