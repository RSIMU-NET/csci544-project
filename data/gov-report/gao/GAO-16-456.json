Since the early 20th century, the Tongass has had a timber program based on harvesting old-growth trees, which are generally more than 150 years old. In 2010, USDA announced its intent to transition the Tongass timber program to primarily harvest young growth, in part to help conserve remaining old-growth forest while maintaining a viable timber industry. As part of the planned transition, the Forest Service and other federal agencies identified actions they would take to support several economic sectors in southeast Alaska.", "This report describes (1) steps the Forest Service has taken to assess whether its planned transition will meet the agency's goal regarding a viable timber industry in southeast Alaska, (2) the status of actions the Forest Service and other federal agencies stated they would take to support the timber industry and other economic sectors during the transition, and (3) options suggested by agency stakeholders for improving the Forest Service's management of the Tongass timber program. GAO reviewed laws and agency documents related to the Tongass and interviewed federal agency officials and representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of 30 stakeholder organizations\u2014including tribal, state, and local governments and industry and conservation entities\u2014selected to provide a range of perspectives.", "The Forest Service generally agreed with GAO's findings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service has initiated some steps to assess whether its planned transition to young-growth harvest on the Tongass National Forest will support a viable timber industry in southeast Alaska\u2014a goal the Department of Agriculture (USDA) established as part of the transition. For example, the Forest Service reported refining the data it uses to estimate the amount of young-growth timber to be available for harvest over the next 100 years. Forest Service officials stated the agency also began a study in 2015, partly in response to a recommendation that year from a USDA-convened advisory committee, to compare potential market prices for young-growth timber or products to the cost to harvest and process the timber, information that may help the agency assess the economic viability of a young-growth industry in the region. The agency expects the initial results from the study to be available in 2017.", "USDA and the Forest Service identified various actions they and other federal agencies would take to support four economic sectors\u2014timber, fishing and aquaculture, tourism and recreation, and renewable energy\u2014during the transition to young-growth harvest on the Tongass, and the agencies have taken steps to implement some of these actions. For example, USDA stated that the Forest Service would improve its planning processes to assist the owners of small timber mills in the Tongass. According to Forest Service officials and documents, the agency has lengthened the duration of some timber sales to provide small timber mills some flexibility on when to harvest in the Tongass. However, the agencies have not implemented other actions identified. For example, the Forest Service has not implemented proposed funding increases for improving fish habitat and tourism facilities in the Tongass because of other spending priorities, according to Forest Service officials.", "Representative from the 30 stakeholder organizations GAO interviewed identified options they said would improve the agency's management of the Tongass timber program. These options include improving the predictability of timber available for sale and increasing the agency's focus on small timber mills and other timber-related businesses. Forest Service officials said they have taken some steps to address these options. For example, the majority of the timber industry stakeholders GAO interviewed emphasized the importance of the Forest Service offering a predictable amount of timber for sale from year to year for the timber industry to be able to make decisions about how to retool to accommodate smaller-diameter trees\u2014which they said is important given potential changes to the industry with the planned transition to harvest young-growth trees. In an effort to improve predictability, the Forest Service has coordinated with the Alaska Division of Forestry on the timing of timber sales to try to ensure a more predictable and even flow of timber. However, stakeholders also expressed divergent opinions regarding the overall direction of the Tongass timber program, including the volume and location of timber to be harvested."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Tongass National Forest, located in southeast Alaska, covers  approximately 17 million acres and is the nation\u2019s largest national forest.

A  2013 memorandum from the Secretary of Agriculture stated that within 10  to 15 years, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of timber harvested in the Tongass would  be young growth. The memorandum also stated that the transition must  be done in a manner that \u201cpreserves a viable timber industry\u201d in southeast  Alaska. The Forest Service announced in May 2014 that it would amend  the forest plan for the Tongass to accomplish the transition. As part of  the decision-making process for the amendment, in November 2015 the  Forest Service released for public comment its proposed forest plan  amendment and accompanying environmental analyses.

For  example, some timber industry representatives\u2014citing the cost of  retooling the industry to accommodate young-growth trees and the  generally lower value of young-growth timber\u2014have questioned whether  a timber industry based on young growth is economically viable. In  contrast, some conservation organizations have expressed concern that  in its efforts to support the timber industry, the Forest Service will allow  levels of old-growth harvest during and after the transition that are  environmentally detrimental.", "Because the Tongass comprises approximately 80 percent of the land  base in southeast Alaska, its resources are important to the economic  health of the region. For example, in addition to providing timber, the  Tongass\u2019s lands and surrounding waters help support fisheries and  tourism\u2014two economic sectors that together represent approximately 25  percent of employment in the region, according to Forest Service  statistics. In announcing its planned young-growth transition, USDA  recognized that the transition could reduce timber industry employment  because it would shift the timber program away from its historical reliance  on old-growth harvest. The department stated that four agencies\u2014 USDA\u2019s Forest Service, Farm Service Agency, and Rural Development  and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development  Administration\u2014would take steps to assist the timber industry and other  economic sectors in southeast Alaska as part of the transition.

We also  reviewed data on historical timber harvest from publicly available Forest  Service reports and information on related agency expenditures and  revenues for the Tongass. We interviewed officials and obtained  information from the Forest Service\u2019s Alaska Region and the Tongass  National Forest, USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency and Rural Development,  and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development  Administration. We also interviewed representatives of a nonprobability  stratified sample of 30 Forest Service stakeholder organizations, including  tribal, state, and local government officials; representatives of the timber,  fishing and aquaculture, and tourism and recreation industries; and  representatives of conservation organizations. We selected stakeholders  to provide a range of perspectives on the Forest Service\u2019s management  of the Tongass timber program.

Documents reviewed included  the Forest Service\u2019s November 2015 draft forest plan amendment and  accompanying environmental analyses, studies conducted by the Forest  Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and documents from  timber industry and conservation organizations. To obtain additional  context on these issues, we interviewed agency officials and stakeholders  as described above. We also visited locations in the Tongass in March  and July 2015, including previously harvested areas and active harvesting  sites, as well as sites on nearby lands owned by the Sealaska  Corporation, to observe timber management practices in the region.", "To describe the actions USDA and the Forest Service stated the agencies  would take to support the timber industry and other economic sectors in  and around the Tongass, we reviewed USDA and Forest Service  documents and, in consultation with Forest Service officials, identified  three key documents identifying agency steps intended to support the  transition.

Given its size, the Tongass, within the Forest  Service\u2019s Alaska Region, is divided into 10 ranger districts. The Tongass  is approximately 16.7 million acres, about 10 million acres of which are  forested. Of the forested acres, the Forest Service classifies  approximately 5.5 million acres as being \u201cproductive forest.\u201d", "Like other national forests, the Tongass is managed for multiple uses, of  which timber harvest is one. Timber harvest on national forests is  generally carried out under timber sales conducted by the Forest Service.  To conduct a timber sale, the Forest Service identifies a sale area,  conducts the required environmental analyses, appraises the timber, and  solicits bids from buyers interested in purchasing the timber. The Forest  Service then prepares the timber sale contract and marks the sale  boundary and the trees to be cut or left. The purchaser is responsible for  cutting and removing the timber, with the Forest Service monitoring the  harvest operations.", "The Forest Service expends funds to prepare, manage, and oversee  timber sales and to conduct required environmental analyses. It also  receives revenues for the timber it sells. The Forest Service reported an  average of $12.5 million annually in timber-related expenditures for the  Tongass from fiscal years 2005 to 2014. During that period, it reported  receiving an average of $1.1 million in revenues associated with timber  harvested from the Tongass.", "The National Forest Management Act requires the Forest Service to  develop forest plans to govern management activities such as timber  harvesting. For timber harvest activities, forest plans typically identify  areas where timber harvest is permitted to occur and set a limit on the  amount of timber that may be harvested from the forest. The Forest  Service is required by the act to update forest plans at least every 15  years and may amend a plan more frequently to adapt to new information  or changing conditions. Under the current Tongass forest plan, as  amended in 2008, the Forest Service authorized up to 267 million board  feet to be harvested annually from the Tongass. The 2008 plan generally  prohibits timber harvest in roadless areas and in certain environmentally  sensitive areas, such as near streams and beaches. Forest plans are  subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, under which the agency  evaluates the likely environmental effects of its actions using an  environmental assessment or, if the actions likely would significantly  affect the environment, a more detailed environmental impact statement  (EIS).", "The Forest Service began offering timber sales in the Tongass in the  early 1900s. Timber harvest increased substantially in the 1950s,  according to Forest Service statistics, as construction of pulp mills in  Ketchikan and Sitka generated higher demand for Tongass timber (see  fig. 2). Timber harvest peaked at an annual average of approximately  494 million board feet in the 1970s. Harvest has since declined, to an  annual average of approximately 46 million board feet for 2000 through  2009 and to approximately 33 million board feet for 2010 through 2014.  Timber industry employment has also declined, from approximately 2,500  in 1982 to 249 in 2014, according to Forest Service documents.", "A number of laws and regulations have reduced the number of acres  where timber harvest is allowed on national forests, both nationwide and  in the Tongass. Specifically, according to statistics provided to us by  Forest Service officials, of the approximately 5.5 million acres of  productive forest in the Tongass, approximately 2.4 million acres are not  available for harvest because of statutory provisions, such as wilderness  designations, and another 1.8 million acres are not available for harvest  because of other factors, such as USDA adopting the roadless rule.", "From the early 1900s through 2014, approximately 462,000 acres of  timber were harvested in the Tongass, according to Forest Service  officials, a figure representing approximately 8 percent of the productive  forest originally found in the Tongass. Larger trees, which are important  for wildlife habitat and biodiversity, have been harvested at a higher rate;  the Forest Service has reported that 20 percent of Tongass acres  containing the largest classes of trees have been harvested. Many of  the areas in southeast Alaska with the largest classes of trees, however,  are located on lands not managed by the Forest Service, such as lands  owned by Alaska Native corporations or the State of Alaska. Across all  land ownerships, the Forest Service reported that 32 percent of the acres  in southeast Alaska with the largest trees had been harvested.", "In 2010, USDA announced its intent to transition the Tongass timber  program to one predominantly based on young growth. The Secretary of  Agriculture subsequently said that the transition would allow for more  ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable forest management.  In November 2015, the Forest Service released for public comment a  draft EIS that analyzed five alternatives for undertaking the transition to  young-growth harvest in the Tongass. The Forest Service expects to  issue a final EIS describing the agency\u2019s final decision regarding how it  will implement the planned transition in December 2016. Figure 3 shows  a timeline of events associated with the planned transition to young  growth.", "The draft EIS concluded that a substantial reduction in old-growth harvest  relative to what the Forest Service allowed under the 2008 forest plan  (e.g., by transitioning to young-growth harvest) would enhance the Forest  Service\u2019s old-growth conservation strategy for the Tongass over the long  term. In reaching this conclusion, the draft EIS noted that while many  wildlife species in the Tongass are associated with more than one habitat  type, most inhabit old-growth forests or prey on species that inhabit old- growth forests, and that certain areas of old-growth forest that are  particularly important to many wildlife species had been heavily  harvested. It also recognized that recent legislation had removed from  the Tongass certain old-growth reserves that had been designated as  part of the agency\u2019s old-growth conservation strategy.", "The five alternatives described different time frames for making the  transition (see app. II). In developing the alternatives, the Forest Service  established 46 million board feet as the projected annual timber sale  quantity\u2014the estimated quantity of timber that the agency expects to sell  each year during the first 15 years of the transition. The Forest Service  considered different mixes of old- and young-growth harvest over a 100- year period, with the proportion of old-growth harvest decreasing over  time until it reached the agency\u2019s target of 5 million board feet. In the  draft EIS, the Forest Service evaluated the five alternatives on a number  of factors, including the time the agency projected it would take to reduce  the annual old-growth harvest to 5 million board feet, and identified its  \u201cpreferred alternative,\u201d which the agency projected would allow it to make  the transition within 16 years after adopting the forest plan amendment  (see table 1).", "To achieve the young-growth harvest levels projected in the preferred  alternative, the Forest Service stated that it would allow some harvest in  areas where it is not allowed under the 2008 forest plan, such as certain  areas near streams and beaches. According to Forest Service officials,  these areas were often among the first to undergo old-growth harvest in  the 20th century and contain some of the most mature young-growth  stands in the Tongass. Without access to these areas, Forest Service  officials told us, it will be difficult for the agency to achieve the young- growth harvest levels associated with the preferred alternative. As a  result, Forest Service officials said, allowing limited harvest in these areas  is needed for the agency to increase its harvest of young-growth timber in  the early years of the transition sufficiently to reduce the harvest of old- growth timber.", "Timber harvest in the Tongass also affects other economic sectors in  southeast Alaska that depend on natural resources\u2014including fishing and  tourism, which, as noted, represent approximately 25 percent of  employment in the region. For example, salmon, which spawn in streams  in the Tongass, are key species for the commercial fishing industry, and  timber harvest can alter water flow and sediment runoff, both of which can  affect salmon. Timber harvest may also diminish the scenic and natural  values that attract some visitors to the region, potentially affecting the  tourism industry. Conversely, roads that are constructed as part of timber  sales may provide easier access to hunting and berry-picking sites in the  Tongass. In addition, numerous small communities are located in or  adjacent to the Tongass. The Forest Service, in its draft EIS, recognized  that its management decisions affect those communities and also that  some communities may be disproportionately affected by these  decisions.", "The USDA Investment Strategy in Support of Rural Communities in  Southeast Alaska 2011-2013 identified four federal agencies with diverse  missions\u2014the Forest Service, Farm Service Agency, and Rural  Development within USDA and the Economic Development  Administration within the Department of Commerce\u2014involved in actions  to help support the timber industry and other economic sectors as part of  the planned transition to young-growth harvest.", "The Forest Service manages 154 national forests and 20 national  grasslands for multiple uses, including timber, recreation, and  watershed management and to sustain the health, diversity, and  productivity of these lands to meet the needs of present and future  generations.", "The Farm Service Agency administers a variety of programs  benefitting farmers and ranchers, including farm commodity programs,  farm loans, and conservation programs.", "Rural Development administers financial programs to support public  facilities and services such as water and sewer systems, housing,  health clinics, and emergency service facilities. It also provides grants,  loans, and loan guarantees to farmers, ranchers, and rural small  businesses to assist in developing renewable energy systems and  improving energy efficiency.", "The Economic Development Administration fosters regional  economic development efforts by, for example, offering grants to  support development in economically distressed areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service Has Initiated Steps to Assess the Economic Viability of a Young- Growth Timber Industry in the Tongass", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service has initiated some steps to assess whether its  planned transition to young-growth harvest in the Tongass is likely to  support a viable timber industry in southeast Alaska\u2014one of the key  goals laid out in the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s 2013 memorandum  discussing the transition.

To support its planned transition to young-growth harvest,  the Forest Service identified the number of acres of young-growth forest  suitable for timber production in the Tongass\u2014251,000 acres\u2014and used  a model that projects forest growth to estimate the volume of timber those  acres will contain over the next 100 years. Using this information, the  Forest Service in November 2015 published its draft EIS that evaluated  five alternatives for amending the forest plan for the Tongass to facilitate  the transition to young-growth harvest.", "In its draft EIS, the Forest Service reported taking a number of steps to  refine its data on the amount of young-growth timber available for harvest  in the Tongass. For example, it reported updating its young-growth timber  inventory, including removing from agency databases those lands  previously managed by the Forest Service that have been conveyed to  other parties. It also reported contracting with a consultant to develop  the model used to project future growth and timber yields from young- growth timber stands in the Tongass.", "The Forest Service also recognized that a number of factors could reduce  the harvest of young-growth timber below the volume the agency  estimated to be available and took steps to account for this potential  reduction\u2014referred to as \u201cfalldown\u201d\u2014in its estimates of young growth  availability. Agency data on young-growth volume used in the draft EIS  include some timber that will not be economically feasible to harvest or  that is located in areas where harvest will not be allowed. For example, a  Forest Service official told us that some young-growth areas consist of  small or isolated areas where the volume of timber is insufficient to  warrant the cost of harvesting it. In addition, timber harvest is not allowed  in proximity to fish-bearing streams, and some young-growth areas may  contain fish-bearing streams that were not previously identified by the  agency. The official explained that factors such as these are likely to  reduce the volume of young-growth that will be harvested but are often  not discovered until the agency begins to prepare a timber sale in a  particular area. In developing the alternatives for the draft EIS, the Forest  Service reduced its estimate of the volume of young-growth timber  available to be harvested to account for such falldown. The Forest  Service also identified factors\u2014such as the agency\u2019s cost of preparing  timber sales and potential delays because of appeals and lawsuits\u2014that  could affect its ability to sell the volume of timber it projected in the draft  EIS.", "The Tongass Advisory Committee\u2014a group convened by the Secretary  of Agriculture under the Federal Advisory Committee Act\u2014also  recognized the uncertainty surrounding the volume of timber that will be  able to be harvested, and recommended in December 2015 that the  Forest Service support a stakeholder group that would monitor progress  in achieving the timber harvest levels proposed in the draft EIS. In  January 2016, Forest Service officials told us they agreed that monitoring  would be important to help the agency and its stakeholders understand  the extent to which the agency was meeting its projected harvest levels,  but had not decided on how they would do so. The officials said that they  expected the final forest plan amendment to describe the agency\u2019s  planned monitoring activities. Officials also told us that the Forest Service  intends to continue refining its young-growth timber data, noting, for  example, that in July 2015 the agency signed a cost-share agreement  with the State of Alaska to survey additional young-growth areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service Has Identified Factors Affecting the Viability of a Young- Growth Timber Industry", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the supply of timber available, the viability of a young- growth timber industry in southeast Alaska is affected by the demand for  young-growth wood, which in turn is affected by the value (i.e., market  price) of the wood products made from it; the value of these products  depends in part on the cost of producing them. Young growth has  different wood characteristics, such as appearance, than old growth,  which can affect its value. According to the draft EIS, southeast Alaska is  one of the few places in western North America that produces wood from  slow-grown, large trees (i.e., old growth). Wood from such trees may  have more attractive grain characteristics and be used for higher-value  products\u2014such as musical instruments or certain types of window frames  and doors\u2014where appearance is important. In contrast, the draft EIS  reported that wood from young-growth trees from the Tongass is more  likely to be used for lower-valued products, such as dimension lumber  (i.e., lumber used for structural framing), where appearance is not as  important. With regard to production costs, the Forest Service has  identified several challenges facing the timber industry in southeast  Alaska\u2014including higher labor and energy costs and the industry\u2019s  distance from markets in the contiguous United States\u2014that raise its  costs compared to other timber-producing areas of North America. On the  other hand, southeast Alaska is closer to Asia\u2014historically a significant  market for timber from southeast Alaska\u2014than these other timber- producing areas, which Forest Service officials told us could result in  lower relative costs to ship timber from the Tongass to Asian markets.  Forest Service officials told us they recognized these factors, and that  both the agency and the industry are exploring the types of products that  can be produced in an economically viable manner from Tongass young  growth.", "Young-growth timber harvested from the Tongass can be either shipped  unprocessed out of the region or processed into lumber or other products  in southeast Alaska. In either case, timber and products from the Tongass  compete in broad economic markets and are likely to face challenges  competing in those markets, according to the Forest Service\u2019s draft EIS.  For example:", "Young-growth logs for export. Exporting sawlogs (i.e.,  unprocessed logs) is likely to be a major component of the southeast  Alaska timber industry during the transition, according to the draft EIS.  The draft EIS reported that most timber harvested in southeast  Alaska, including from the Tongass and from lands owned by Alaska  Native corporations and the State of Alaska, is exported as sawlogs to  Asia. The transition to young-growth timber may affect this market  (e.g., by increasing the proportion of lower-value timber harvested),  but the draft EIS indicates that the agency expects that timber  purchasers are likely to continue to rely heavily on exporting sawlogs  overseas. However, the Forest Service also recognized that the ability  of purchasers to export sawlogs harvested from the Tongass is limited  under current Forest Service policy to 50 percent of timber volume  sold.", "Young-growth lumber. The Forest Service, in its draft EIS,  concluded that demand for lumber (as opposed to unprocessed logs)  produced in southeast Alaska was relatively low. The existing export  market for lumber produced in southeast Alaska is primarily for  higher-graded lumber made from old-growth trees, while the major  use for young-growth lumber processed in southeast Alaska is likely  to be for dimension lumber (i.e., lumber used for structural framing),  for which demand may be lower, according to the Forest Service. In  its draft EIS, the Forest Service assumed that Asian purchasers would  not be willing to substitute dimension lumber produced from young- growth trees for the higher-graded lumber they had previously been  purchasing. Dimension lumber produced in southeast Alaska could  also be used within southeast Alaska or shipped to the contiguous  United States. However, Forest Service officials and stakeholders  told us that these markets are already served by relatively large,  efficient mills located in the Pacific Northwest and that because  production costs are higher in southeast Alaska, it will be challenging  for dimension lumber from the Tongass to compete with lumber from  existing suppliers. In addition, the Forest Service has reported that  existing southeast Alaskan mills have limited capacity to process  young growth and will likely have to invest in new milling equipment if  they are to significantly expand their production of lumber produced  from young growth. Forest Service officials and industry  representatives also told us the industry is unlikely to invest the  needed funds without more certainty about the amount of timber that  will be offered for sale and harvested.", "Young-growth utility logs. Another potential use for Tongass young- growth noted in the draft EIS is as \u201cutility logs\u201d\u2014that is, logs of  insufficient quality to use for dimension lumber but suitable to be  made into chips or used as biofuel. Increasing the use of biofuels in  southeast Alaska could increase demand for utility logs from the  Tongass and contribute to the viability of the timber industry in the  region, according to the draft EIS. Doing so, however, would require  investment in new infrastructure to produce and use these products.  Forest Service officials told us that such investment is likely to be  difficult because of both the uncertainty of demand in the region and  the availability of large quantities of biofuel produced by facilities in  the Pacific Northwest. Consistent with these statements, the Forest  Service reported in a document developed to support the draft EIS  that it found no evidence of market demand for utility logs from the  Tongass."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service Has Begun an Effort to Compare the Potential Prices for Young- Growth Products to the Cost of Producing Them", "paragraphs": ["The viability of the timber industry depends upon the relationship between  the market price of the final product (whole logs, dimension lumber,  biomass, or other products) and the cost of producing it, including the  cost to harvest, transport, and process it. In preparing the draft EIS, the  Forest Service analyzed information regarding the economics of the  Tongass timber industry. In 2015, the Forest Service also initiated a  separate study of the costs of producing products from young-growth  wood and the resulting value. These officials told us they initiated the  study partly in response to the May 2015 draft recommendations from the  Tongass Advisory Committee and said they expect to finalize the scope  and time frames for the study in spring 2016 and to receive initial results  in 2017. The Forest Service scientists leading the study told us the  agency plans to harvest young-growth timber from randomly selected  sites within the Tongass and process the timber in several mills in  southeast Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.

Forest Service officials told us the  agency has met with small-mill owners to discuss ways to address the  mill owners\u2019 needs. As a result of this outreach, the Forest Service  lengthened the duration of some timber sale contracts for small sales;  according to Forest Service officials, small sale contracts typically last  from 1 to 3 years, but the agency lengthened the duration to 4 to  6 years for 8 of the approximately 60 small sales in the Tongass in  fiscal years 2014 and 2015. This action provided small-mill owners  with flexibility to harvest at more-advantageous times, according to  Forest Service officials.", "The 2013 Secretary\u2019s Memorandum 1044-009: Addressing  Sustainable Forestry in Southeast Alaska stated that USDA would  continue to work with Congress to exempt a limited amount of young  growth in the Tongass from the general prohibition on harvesting a  stand until it reaches its maximum growth rate. The memorandum  said providing this flexibility is essential for developing economically  viable young-growth projects within the timeframe of the transition.

However, Forest Service officials told us that  the agency did not request funding because of other spending  priorities, and that no cabins have been built since the Investment  Strategy was published in 2011. A few conservation organization  stakeholders we interviewed told us that the Forest Service\u2019s limited  progress in using young-growth timber in its own facilities hinders the  agency\u2019s ability to achieve its goal of demonstrating the economic  viability of producing young-growth products in southeast Alaska.  Forest Service officials told us that other approaches, such as  demonstrating the demand for dimensional lumber, might be a better  option than constructing cabins for showing the economic viability of  young-growth products. Forest Service officials told us the agency is  collaborating with the National Forest Foundation to work with a local  conservation group to demonstrate uses for young-growth timber,  including the construction in 2012 of a private home built primarily  from young-growth timber.", "The 2013 Secretary\u2019s Memorandum asked the Forest Service to work  with Rural Development to develop a plan by December 31, 2013, for  providing financial assistance to help the timber industry retool to  handle young-growth timber.

Similarly, the Economic Development  Administration reported awarding approximately $1.4 million in grants  in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 to support fishing and aquaculture in  southeast Alaska, most of which was awarded to the Hydaburg  Cooperative Association, a tribe in southeast Alaska, for the  renovation of a cold-storage facility to develop a specialty seafood  processing plant.", "The Investment Strategy also stated the agencies would identify and  promote ways to include aquaculture development among traditional  USDA agriculture programs. Farm Service Agency officials told us the  agency used an existing farm loan program to provide five loans since  2011 to parties entering the shellfish industry. These loans totaled  about $160,000 and were used to fund operational and capital  expenses, according to these officials.", "The Investment Strategy also stated the agencies would take steps to  restore degraded salmon streams in an effort to increase salmon  productivity.

The  Investment Strategy stated that the Forest Service proposed tripling the  annual funding for watershed restoration (i.e., actions intended to improve  fish habitat in streams and thereby support the health of fish populations)  in the Tongass to $4.6 million annually. As noted, however, Forest  Service officials estimated that agency funding for such activities  averaged approximately $1.1 million for fiscal years 2011 through 2015.

Specifically, the strategy identified  $1.9 million in planned expenditures for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and  recommended $8.4 million in additional funding for those 2 years. Forest  Service officials told us, however, that they did not request additional  funding for the Tongass and that the budget for the agency\u2019s Alaska  Region declined during this time. They estimated that the region\u2019s budget  for tourism and recreation decreased from $8.8 million in fiscal year 2010  to $6.7 million in fiscal year 2013\u2014a decline of about 24 percent. The  officials estimated that the budget for fiscal year 2014 was $7.1 million,  which was an increase of about 4 percent over the previous year\u2019s level  but lower than the 2010 funding level of $8.8 million. The selected tourism  and recreation industry representatives we interviewed expressed  concern about reduced funding, as they did not think the Forest Service  would be able to maintain the current inventory of cabins, trails, and other  recreation facilities.

These stakeholders emphasized the importance of  predictability for the timber industry to be able to make decisions  about how to retool to accommodate young-growth trees\u2014which they  said is important given potential changes to the industry as a result of  the planned transition. Options for improving predictability identified by  these timber industry stakeholders ranged from offering timber sales  under longer-term contracts\u2014as a means of providing greater  certainty over the quantity of timber they will be allowed to harvest in  future years\u2014to transferring significant acreage from the Tongass to  the State of Alaska, an entity some timber industry stakeholders  viewed as offering a more predictable timber supply than the Forest  Service. On the other hand, one of the conservation organization  stakeholders we interviewed said that the Forest Service could  improve the predictability of supply by reducing the volume of timber it  offers for sale and offering timber for sale in locations where there will  be less environmental impact, steps the stakeholder said could  reduce opposition to proposed timber sales and increase the  likelihood of sales being implemented in a timely manner.", "In an effort to improve the predictability of its timber supply, the Forest  Service is participating in the collaborative \u201call lands, all hands\u201d effort  with other southeast Alaska landowners to explore ways of achieving  greater economic efficiency by sharing infrastructure and jointly  planning projects. As part of this effort, Forest Service officials told us  they have coordinated with the Alaska Division of Forestry on the  timing of timber sales to try to ensure a more predictable and even  flow of timber offered to the timber industry. Alaska Division of  Forestry officials told us that this effort has been helpful but that  continued work will be needed to improve collaboration among  landowners on issues such as sharing costs for maintaining roads and  other infrastructure.", "Increasing focus on small timber operators. Some of the  30 stakeholders we interviewed said that the Forest Service could do  more to support the small operators that also play a role in local  economies throughout the Tongass by harvesting small amounts of  old-growth timber. These stakeholders suggested the Forest Service  take steps such as offering smaller sales and making other changes\u2014 such as allowing small operators greater use of roads constructed in  conjunction with larger sales\u2014to make it easier for smaller operators  to access timber. As previously discussed, Forest Service officials told  us they had taken several steps to assist smaller operators, including  lengthening the duration of some small timber sales. Officials told us  that for two timber sales in 2012 and 2013, they kept several roads  open for approximately 2 years after the sales were completed to  allow access to remaining timber by smaller operators.", "Improving Forest Service collaboration. Some of the stakeholders  we interviewed also said the Forest Service needed to collaborate  more with the industries and communities affected by the transition\u2014 for example, by involving community leaders earlier in the decision- making process and better considering the effects of management  decisions on specific locations\u2014if the young-growth transition is to be  successful. Similarly, the Tongass Advisory Committee emphasized  the need for the Forest Service to become more flexible and  responsive to timber industry and community interests for the  transition to be successful. To help achieve that goal, the committee  said Forest Service leadership needed to provide clear and consistent  direction to agency staff, and the agency needed to increase the use  of collaborative processes in its management decisions.", "Forest Service officials identified various approaches the agency uses  to collaborate with the industries and communities affected by the  transition. For example, they said that the agency has participated in  the Tongass Collaborative Stewardship Group, a region-wide forum  for communities and landowners to work together to align Forest  Service projects with local and regional priorities. The Forest Service  has also participated in a number of smaller collaborative groups  relating to specific geographic areas in the Tongass, including the  communities of Hoonah, Kake, and Sitka, and the Staney Creek  watershed on Prince of Wales Island. One such group, the Hoonah  Native Forest Partnership, includes the Forest Service, nonfederal  landowners in the area, and other entities, such as the Hoonah Indian  Association. The partnership formed in 2015 and is still in the early  stages of planning and identifying specific work, according to a Forest  Service official.
