The guarantee obligates SBA to repay a participating lender a specific portion of the amount of the 7(a) loan (generally between 75 and 80 percent) in the event of borrower default.  The secondary markets allow lenders to sell 7(a) loans they originate and thus obtain funds for further lending.  In most such transactions, the 7(a) loans are pooled and sold to investors as tradable financial claims on the cash flows that the pools generate.  This pooling of loans is an innovation widely applied in the secondary markets for residential mortgage loans, where whole loans are pooled to create tradable financial claims in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). SBA 7(a) loans are divided into guaranteed and unguaranteed portions, and these are pooled and sold in two separate secondary markets.  Cash flows from pools of guaranteed portions are used to back 7(a) pool certificates, which are sold in the guaranteed 7(a) secondary market; cash flows from pools of unguaranteed portions are used to back 7(a) pool securities, which are sold in the unguaranteed 7(a) secondary market.", "As agreed with your office, the objectives of this report are to (1) discuss the benefits and risks of secondary loan markets to participants; (2) identify primary benefits and risks to participants in the guaranteed 7(a) secondary market and the unguaranteed 7(a) secondary market; and (3) compare the guaranteed 7(a) secondary market with the secondary market for federally guaranteed residential mortgages, and the unguaranteed 7(a) secondary market with the secondary market for residential mortgages without a federal guarantee.  We identified these residential mortgage markets as the most valid comparisons for these objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Authorized under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 (a)), the SBA 7(a) program was established to serve small business borrowers that cannot otherwise obtain private sector financing under suitable terms and conditions.  The SBA 7(a) program is SBA\u2019s primary vehicle for providing small businesses with access to credit, whereby SBA provides partial guarantees of loans made by SBA-approved private sector lenders.  One requirement to obtain a 7(a) loan guarantee, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, is that a lender must document that the prospective borrower was unable to obtain financing under reasonable terms and conditions through normal business channels. SBA authorized secondary markets in 7(a) loans to help lenders manage their funding needs for these loans.", "The SBA guarantee encourages lenders to make small business loans by transferring most of an approved loan\u2019s credit risk from the loan originator to SBA.  The SBA guarantee eliminates credit risk not only for the lenders on the guaranteed portion of 7(a) loans but also for the investor in 7(a) preferred lenders, indicating that SBA lacked sufficient lender oversight to limit credit risk to the agency, including risk from lender concentration.  In commenting on a draft of this report, SBA stated that it has taken significant steps to improve the oversight of participating lenders, including SBLCs. We have not evaluated these initiatives, but they appear to be the type of actions that could mitigate credit risk to the agency resulting from lender concentration. pool certificates.  In addition to the full faith and credit of the U. S. government, the 7(a) pool certificates also carry SBA\u2019s timely payment guarantee, which ensures that investors will be paid on scheduled dates when collections from borrowers are not timely.", "SBA 7(a) loans are heterogeneous in that they differ in many respects, such as interest rates; repayment schedules; maturity; loan collateral type, quality, and marketability; and type of business to which the loans are made.  SBA 7(a) loans are made to a diverse range of small businesses with widely differing financial profiles and credit needs, such as restaurants, consumer services, professional services, and retail outlets.", "The dollar volume of 7(a) loans that SBA can guarantee each year is based on congressional appropriations that subsidize the 7(a) guarantee program.  For the fiscal year that ended September 30, 1997, SBA approved nearly $9.5 billion in loans--the highest amount to date, and an increase of over 20 percent from the previous fiscal year.  As of December 31, 1997, there was $21.5 billion in outstanding 7(a) loans.", "According to SBA, about 8,000 lenders are authorized to participate in the 7(a) loan program.  They range from institutions that make a few 7(a) loans annually to more active institutions that originate hundreds of 7(a) loans annually.  Most are insured depository institutions, such as banks and savings and loan associations.  Nondepository lenders include Business and Industrial Development Companies, chartered under state statutes; insurance companies; and SBLCs licensed and regulated by SBA. At the end of 1997, SBLCs accounted for about 19 percent of outstanding 7(a) loans.  SBA has established three classifications of lenders within the 7(a) program--regular, certified, and preferred--each having different levels of authority in processing loans.  SBA completely analyzes regular lenders\u2019 loans and decides on their guarantee.  The agency authorizes certified lenders to perform their own credit analyses and preferred lenders to make eligibility and creditworthiness determinations as well as approve their own loans without SBA review.", "SBA 7(a) loans differ from other small business loans in some respects. Our 1996 report indicated that 7(a) loans tend to be larger, have longer maturities, and have higher interest rates than small business loans in general.  Typically, loans with features such as longer terms and no prepayment penalties warrant higher interest rates.  SBA figures showed the average maturity of 7(a) loans sold in the secondary market in 1997 was three times longer than for conventional commercial and industrial loans under $1 million.  Also, average interest rates for SBA loans were 67 basis points higher for fixed-rate loans, and 178 basis points higher for variable rate loans, than for respective categories of conventional commercial and industrial loans under $1 million.", "In the primary market, single-family residential mortgages differ from 7(a) loans in a number of dimensions that directly affect their respective secondary markets.  A majority of residential mortgages have fixed interest rates, and those with adjustable rates have interest rate caps that limit interest rate risk to borrowers.  In contrast, 7(a) loans consist primarily of variable rate loans without interest rate caps.  As a result, lenders face more interest rate risk on residential mortgages than on 7(a) loans. Residential mortgage loans are more homogeneous than 7(a) loans because the terms are standardized, and collateral, residential property, is the same.", "In order to provide a perspective of how the 7(a) markets compare with other secondary markets, we compared the two secondary markets in 7(a) loan portions to the secondary markets for single-family residential mortgages as follows:", "The secondary market for single-family residential mortgages which has federal mortgage insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a government corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  These mortgages are fully insured in the event of borrower default.  Lenders who originate FHA- insured mortgages can pool them and issue MBS guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), another government corporation within HUD, which, for a fee, guarantees timely payment of principal and interest to investors. We compared this secondary market to the guaranteed 7(a) secondary market.", "The secondary market in conventional, single-family residential mortgages that have loan amounts, or other characteristics that preclude purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  These are called nonconforming mortgage loans.  In this secondary market, state-chartered private corporations-- referred to as private-label conduits--pool mortgages they purchase and issue MBS.  We compare features of this market to the unguaranteed 7(a) loan secondary market.", "The benefit to individual lenders of selling loans in a secondary market depends in part on demand for that lender\u2019s loans and availability and costs of the lender\u2019s alternative funding sources.

We also reviewed research conducted by SBA, HUD, other federal agencies, and others on the workings of the 7(a) markets; secondary markets for conventional small business loans; and residential mortgage loan secondary markets.  We analyzed data on the 7(a) program from SBA as well as publicly available information on the residential mortgage market.  We also talked to SBA officials and officials of its fiscal and transfer agent, Colson Services, Corp.; Ginnie Mae; HUD; the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders; the Bond Market Association; the American Bankers Association; the Independent Bankers Association; participating 7(a) lenders and poolers; other participants in the small business loan markets; the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO); the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). dollar level can sell them to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), two private corporations with federal charters. These two corporations are called government-sponsored enterprises (the enterprises) and with a majority of their mortgage purchases, they pool the mortgages and issue MBS backed by these loans. These enterprises normally provide corporate guarantees on MBS they issue, which eliminate credit risk for MBS investors.  This secondary market has features that we compare to the guaranteed and unguaranteed secondary markets in 7(a) loans. comparative purposes in this report.  The secondary market in residential mortgages is divided into three broad parts.  The first part is based on federally insured/guaranteed mortgages provided by FHA or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In this market, residential mortgage loans are pooled to create tradable financial claims in the form of securities, with pool guarantees from Ginnie Mae.  A majority of mortgages backing Ginnie Mae MBS are FHA-insured mortgages.  We deemed this secondary market analogous to the guaranteed 7(a) market for purposes of this report.  A second part of the secondary market is for mortgages that conform to underwriting standards created by the enterprises.  Although the government does not guarantee these mortgages, the private sector perceives the federal connections of the enterprises as providing an implicit guarantee and takes into account their pool guarantees.  The last part of the secondary residential mortgage markets includes nonconforming mortgages that are fully private and pooled without implicit or explicit government guarantees.  We deemed this secondary market analogous to the unguaranteed 7(a) secondary market for this report\u2019s purposes.", "In our review of disclosures made to investors in guaranteed 7(a) pool certificates, we relied on SBA regulations and information obtained in discussions with SBA and Colson officials.  For unguaranteed pool securities, we reviewed offering statements from an issuer of SEC- registered, publicly offered 7(a) pool securities, but we did not obtain offering statements or materials for 7(a) pool certificates or 7(a) pool securities that were not SEC registered.  We used information from financial industry publications, Ginnie Mae disclosure forms and offering statements to determine financial disclosure information provided on the various forms of MBS.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., between September 1997 and December 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We provided copies of a draft of this report to SBA for review and comment.

The resulting liquidity can reduce regional imbalances or cyclical swings in loanable funds. Borrowers can benefit from increased credit availability, and competition among lenders can provide borrowers with lower interest rates.

However, the less alike the loans are, the more troublesome it can be to estimate cash flows or the likelihood of losses. Although more precise cash flow estimates improve investors\u2019 ability to estimate or measure risk, they may also lower returns because investors want to be compensated according to the degree of risk they undertake.

For example, a lender that has access to adequate funding to meet the demand for loans, consistent with its business plan, may lack funding-related incentives to participate in secondary loan markets.  The benefit of secondary markets to individual lenders also depends on whether holding loans on the balance sheet or selling them in the secondary market can best increase returns on invested capital and/or lower risks for the lender.

In 1997, the guaranteed 7(a) secondary market served as a funding source for many lenders, particularly for about 50 institutions that generally lacked deposit bases, according to an SBA official.  The 7(a) secondary markets can also help qualified borrowers by providing a means to lower interest rates or to make 7(a) loans available at more favorable terms.

The heterogeneity of 7(a) loans makes estimation of risks difficult for investors and limits the overall benefits of the secondary markets.  Another limiting factor is the fact that interest rate risk in the 7(a) markets is less because most 7(a) loans have variable interest rates pegged to current prime market rates. Interest rate risk is less likely to be a factor for most depositories because few 7(a) loans have fixed interest rates.", "SBA faces the possibility of a concentration of credit risk from both 7(a) secondary markets.

A sharp increase in loan defaults by, or the failure of, one such lender could be costly to SBA, which lacks controls for concentration risk.  Moreover, our 1998 report cited inadequacies in SBA\u2019s efforts to ensure sound SBLC lending practices. While the participation of rating agencies in the unguaranteed marketplace encourages lenders to follow prudent lending practices, this factor alone may not adequately limit SBA\u2019s credit risk from lender concentration.

Perhaps of greater importance were weaknesses in oversight of SBLCs, which are licensed, regulated, and supervised by SBA.  In our 1998 review of 5 of SBA\u2019s 69 district offices, we found that SBA had not conducted the regular, periodic reviews of lender compliance with its 7(a) loan standards or met its own standards for SBLC oversight.  In commenting on this report (see app. IV), SBA stated that it has since reviewed all preferred lenders, and that the Farm Credit Administration, through an agreement with SBA, has completed the on-site portions of the SBLC reviews.

Compared to the secondary markets for 7(a) loans, the secondary markets for residential mortgages operate with greater incentives for lenders to sell the loans they originate. A comparatively greater proportion of mortgage lenders has an economic incentive to sell loans in the secondary market because they rely on secondary mortgage markets as their most important source of funding.  In addition, depository institutions\u2019 needs to manage interest rate risk associated with mortgage loans, coupled with risk-management opportunities provided by the secondary markets, provide an important incentive for those lenders to sell mortgage loans they originate.  These factors, as well as the comparatively larger size of the primary and secondary markets in residential mortgages, contribute to larger percentages of residential mortgages being sold in secondary markets compared to 7(a) loans sold in 7(a) secondary markets. In the secondary mortgage markets, investors are better able to estimate cash flows and risks from investments backed by pools of mortgage loans. Investors are comparatively less able to reliably estimate cash flows and risks from investments backed by 7(a) loans because they lack historical data on the performance of similar loans under varying economic conditions and because the loan pools are heterogeneous.", "Nearly all federally insured single-family mortgages originated in 1997 were sold on the Ginnie Mae secondary market, compared to about 45 percent of the guaranteed portions of 7(a) loans on its respective secondary market.  In the secondary market for conventional single-family residential mortgages without federal insurance, also known as the conventional conforming market, about 46 percent of the mortgages originated in 1997 and eligible for purchase by the enterprises was sold compared to about 11 percent of unguaranteed portions of 7(a) loans originated that year.  Among single-family conventional residential mortgages originated in 1997 and not eligible for purchase by the enterprises, about one-third were sold in this secondary market, called the nonconforming market.  The percentage of conventional mortgages, both conforming and nonconforming, that were originated and sold in secondary markets was much greater than that for the unguaranteed portions of 7(a) loans.  In addition, a greater percentage of fixed-rate conventional mortgage loans was sold in secondary markets than variable- rate loans.", "Greater homogeneity of single-family residential mortgage loans compared to 7(a) loans contributes to a higher percentage of loans sold in secondary markets.  Similarities among residential mortgage loans, such as being backed by the same types of collateral, along with standard loan terms, increases the ability of secondary market investors to evaluate cash flows and loan collateral values and therefore the various risks associated with purchasing MBS.", "Finally, the bigger sizes of the primary and secondary markets in residential mortgages relative to the respective markets in 7(a) loans contribute to the larger percentages of residential mortgages sold in secondary markets.

Mortgage companies include independent firms without deposit bases as well as subsidiaries of depository institutions.  They originate about three- fourths of federally insured, and about one-half of conventional, single- family mortgage loans.  Because they can use the proceeds of their secondary market loan sales to finance more mortgage loans, the secondary mortgage markets allow mortgage companies to compete in the primary market for loan origination and servicing, even though they do not have a deposit base to finance the mortgages on their balance sheets.

Long-term, fixed-rate loans generate interest rate risk for lenders who depend on a deposit base for funding loans because increases in short-term funding costs are not accompanied by increases in interest payments on existing loans.

In addition, for adjustable-rate mortgages, FHA limits the degree to which interest rates paid by the borrower can increase to a maximum of 1 percentage point annually and 5 percentage points over the life of the mortgage loan, which acts to limit interest rate risk to the borrower but shifts this risk to the lender.  As a result, FHA-insured adjustable-rate mortgages also entail interest rate risk for lenders.

Lenders establish underwriting standards, which include maximum loan-to-value ratios and loan payment-to-income ratios.

Private-label conduits also rely on private mortgage insurance and use the same techniques as the enterprises to manage their exposure to credit risk.  The conduits, however, use forms of credit enhancement, such as subordination, not normally used by the enterprises.  As previously mentioned, credit enhancement is used to maintain scheduled payments to investors if borrowers go into default or are late in making payments and to bring securities to investment-grade ratings, as they act to mitigate the investor\u2019s credit risk.

SBA first authorized the sale of unguaranteed portions of 7(a) loans on the secondary market in 1992, 8 years after pooled guaranteed portions were authorized to be sold.  Recognizing that nondepository institution lenders lack customer deposits to fund their 7(a) lending, SBA initially allowed only those lenders to securitize their unguaranteed portions.  In 1997, about $290 million in unguaranteed portions of SBA loans were sold on the secondary market compared to $2.7 billion dollars in guaranteed portions.

This total includes about $1.2 billion in securitized unguaranteed portions of SBA loans.", "As discussed elsewhere in these reports, the securitization of small business loans is slowed by characteristics of those loans that inhibit analysis by rating agencies and investors.  The loans are not homogeneous, underwriting standards vary across originators, and information on historical loss rates is typically limited. To the extent that it is cost effective, one or more credit enhancements can be included in each securitization transaction to compensate for these characteristics.  Credit enhancements are payment support features that cover defaults and losses up to a specific amount on loans backing a security, thereby reducing investor need for costly loan-specific information.  In other words, credit enhancements act to increase the likelihood that investors will receive interest and principal payments even in the event that full payment is not received on the underlying loans.  However, the higher the level of credit enhancement needed to sell the securities, the lower the net proceeds from the sale of the securities and the weaker the incentive for lenders to securitize their loans.", "Securitizations of unguaranteed portions of 7(a) loans may be limited, in part, by the relatively small number of lenders with sufficient loan volume to create pools to back the securities.  According to Moody\u2019s Investors Service, pool size typically ranges from 250 to 2,000 loans.  (Although SBA sets no minimum number of loans for these pools, the more loans there are in a pool, the less risky the securities backed by that pool tend to be.  Less risk translates to lower credit enhancement requirements and therefore less cost for enhancement, resulting in more profit for the issuer.)
