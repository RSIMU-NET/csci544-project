GAO requested interviews with representatives of all the 11 selected U.S. airlines; 10 agreed to be interviewed and one airline declined. GAO also interviewed DOT officials, consumer advocates, and other aviation industry stakeholders. DOT reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments that GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2010, selected U.S. airlines have introduced a variety of new fees for optional services and increased some existing fees. For example, each of the 11 U.S. airlines that GAO examined introduced fees for \u201cpreferred\u201d seating, which may include additional legroom or a seat closer to the front of the economy cabin. Some of these airlines have also introduced new fees for other optional services, such as fees for carry-on baggage and priority boarding. Since 2010, many of the selected airlines have also increased existing fees for some optional services, including fees for checked baggage and for changing or cancelling a reservation. From 2010 to 2016, U.S. airlines' revenues from these two fees\u2014the only optional service fees for which revenues are separately reported to the Department of Transportation (DOT)\u2014increased from $6.3 billion in 2010 to $7.1 billion in 2016 (in constant 2016 dollars).", "Airline officials cited competition from other airlines and customer demand, among other things, as factors they consider when deciding whether and how much to charge for optional services. According to officials from 9 of the 10 selected airlines GAO interviewed, the process of \u201cunbundling\u201d allows passengers to customize their flight by paying for only the services that they value. Airline officials said that charging fees for optional services allows the airlines to offer lower base airfares to customers. For customers traveling with bags, however, GAO's review of airline-related economic literature showed that on average customers who paid for at least one checked bag paid more in total for the airfare and bag fees than they did when airfares included checked baggage. Officials from the 10 airlines said they also consider customer demand and willingness to pay when setting prices for optional services, and officials from 8 of these airlines noted that competitors' prices for similar services are another factor used in determining the amount of fees.", "Since 2010, DOT has taken or has proposed a range of actions to improve the transparency of airlines' fees for optional services. These actions include: (1) monitoring and enforcing airlines' compliance with existing transparency regulations; (2) collecting, reviewing, and responding to consumers' complaints; (3) collecting additional data on revenue generated from fees; and (4) educating airlines and consumers about existing regulations and consumer rights related to optional service fees. Consumer and industry stakeholders, such as online travel agents' representatives, told GAO that DOT's regulations requiring certain airlines to disclose optional service fees on their websites have improved consumer transparency. However, these stakeholders also told GAO that there are additional transparency challenges, such as when consumers search for and book flights through online travel agents. Because optional services are not always available for purchase and because fees for such services are not always disclosed through online travel agents, these stakeholders argue that consumers are not always able to determine the full cost of their travel and compare costs across airlines before they purchase their tickets. While transparency challenges still exist, DOT has ongoing regulatory proceedings, some in response to prior GAO recommendations that may resolve some of these issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, U.S. passenger airlines have increasingly \u201cunbundled\u201d  optional services, charging fees for a variety of services that were  previously included in the price of the ticket. For example, optional service  fees can include charges for such things as checked bags, early  boarding, seat selection, meals, or other amenities. In addition to these  services that were previously included in the ticket price, the airline  industry has long charged fees for other optional services, such as  unaccompanied minors, or changing or canceling a reservation. Optional  service fees are an important source of revenue for airlines. According to  the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation  Statistics (BTS), from 2010 to 2016, U.S. airlines generated more than  $44 billion in revenues from baggage fees, reservation-change fees and  cancellation fees alone.

In July 2010, we reported that information about airlines\u2019 optional  service fees and their associated rules are not fully disclosed to  consumers, making it difficult for consumers to compare the total cost of  flights across different airlines. We made four recommendations to DOT  to improve the transparency of information on airline-imposed fees,  including that DOT require airlines to disclose certain airline-imposed  optional service fees, and disclose applicable government-imposed fees  that may be eligible for refunds on unused nonrefundable tickets. DOT  has implemented both of these recommendations but has not yet  implemented our recommendations to require airlines to disclose  baggage fees and policies along with fare information across all sales  channels used by the airline, and to separately report to DOT the  revenues from all optional service fees paid by passengers.

These airlines transported over 80 percent of U.S. domestic  passengers in 2016. We obtained 2010 and 2017 airline data and  analyzed how these fees have changed since 2010. Specifically, we took  screen captures of airlines\u2019 webpages listing optional services and fees  on March 31 and April 1, 2017. We then compared this information to the  2010 optional services and fee information that we collected as part of our  2010 review of airline fees. We requested interviews with representatives  of all the 11 selected U.S. airlines; 10 airlines agreed to be interviewed  and one airline declined.

Since the U.S. airline industry was deregulated in 1978, the  industry\u2019s earnings have been volatile. In calendar years 2008 and 2009,  the U.S. passenger airline industry incurred nearly $4.4 billion in  operating losses, due largely to high jet fuel prices\u2014airlines\u2019 biggest  operating expense in 2008\u2014combined with a severe economic downturn  that reduced passenger traffic. In response to these and other economic  challenges, airlines began in 2008 to \u201cunbundle\u201d optional services from  the base ticket price, thereby charging separate fees for services that  were previously included in the ticket price. Revenues from fees for  optional services continue to grow. In fiscal year 2016, airlines reported  $200 billion in revenue, about $7.1 billion of it from the two optional  services fees for which revenues are separately reported to DOT\u2014$4.2  billion in baggage fee revenue and $2.9 billion from fees for changing  reservations.", "The passenger airline industry is primarily composed of network (or  \u201clegacy\u201d), low-cost, and regional airlines. Network airlines were in  operation before the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and support large,  complex hub-and-spoke operations with thousands of employees and  hundreds of aircraft. These airlines provide service at various fare levels  to a wide variety of domestic and international destinations. Low-cost  airlines generally entered the market after deregulation and tend to  operate less costly \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d service using fewer types of aircraft.  Regional airlines generally employ much smaller aircraft (up to 100 seats)  and provide service under \u201ccode-sharing\u201d arrangements with larger  network airlines for which they are paid on a cost-plus or fee-for- departure basis to provide network capacity. Both network and low-cost  airlines charge fees for a variety of optional services. Regional airlines  may also charge optional fees, such as baggage fees; however, those  fees are generally determined by the network airline in the code-sharing  partner agreement. While charges for some services\u2014such as  unaccompanied minors, reservation changes or cancellations, and  oversized or overweight baggage\u2014have existed in the airline industry for  many years, other services, such as wireless internet access and on- demand entertainment access, are new. See figure 1 for examples of  optional service fees.", "Some optional services can be purchased in advance when booking  airline tickets. For example, customers can purchase optional services  when booking tickets directly from the airline (i.e., from the airline\u2019s  website, by calling the airline\u2019s call center, or from the airline\u2019s ticket  counter at the airport). Customers who purchase tickets from third parties,  such as online travel agents (e.g., Priceline or Expedia) and traditional or  corporate travel agents, may also have the option to purchase some  optional services when booking tickets, but this option varies depending  on the airline and third party. Customers may also obtain some  information about flight schedules, fares, and some optional services from  metasearch companies (e.g., Google or Kayak); however, the information  on optional services available through these websites varies. Generally,  online travel agencies, traditional or corporate travel agents, and  metasearch companies obtain airfare and optional service fee information  from global distribution systems, which are companies that package  airline information so that travel agents can query and \u201cbook\u201d (i.e.,  reserve and purchase) flights for airline customers.", "DOT has authority to investigate whether a U.S. air carrier, foreign air  carrier, or ticket agent has been, or is engaged, in an unfair or deceptive  practice or an unfair method of competition in air transportation or the  sale of air transportation. Upon finding that a U.S. air carrier, foreign air  carrier, or ticket agent is engaged in such a practice or method, DOT has  the authority to order the regulated entity to stop the practice or method.  Under this authority, in April 2011, DOT issued \u201cConsumer Rule 2\u201d which  included several provisions related to increasing the transparency of  airfares and optional service fees for consumers. This rule\u2014which  became completely in effect in January 2012\u2014requires, among other  things, that certain U.S. and foreign air carriers disclose information about  their optional service fees on their websites and refund passengers\u2019  baggage fees if their bags are lost.

For example, several network airlines\u2014including  Alaska, American, and Delta\u2014created fees for upgrading to preferred  seats, which are more desirable seats in the economy cabin of the  aircraft, such as those located in an exit row, toward the front of the  aircraft or with additional legroom. Preferred seats may also include  priority boarding or food and beverages, depending on the airline. The  characteristics of preferred seats differ among airlines, even when the  products\u2019 names sound similar. For example, both American and  Hawaiian have a product called Preferred Seating, but American\u2019s  product refers to standard legroom in more favorable locations, whereas  Hawaiian\u2019s product refers to more legroom and priority boarding, among  other things. In addition, some airlines offer more than one type of  preferred seat. For example, in addition to its Preferred Seating product,  American also offers a product called Main Cabin Extra, which includes  additional legroom and priority boarding. As of July 2010, Frontier,  JetBlue, and Spirit had already instituted fees for preferred seats, and  Allegiant started offering preferred seats to its passengers in 2014.  Southwest, however, does not have any assigned seating and therefore  does not sell preferred seating. Instead, Southwest allows some  customers to pay for early boarding, which increases the customer\u2019s  ability to select a desired seat. Table 2 shows airlines\u2019 different  approaches to charging fees for preferred seating.", "The pricing of preferred seats is not always apparent to customers on  airlines\u2019 websites, unless the customer selects or begins to book a  specific flight. For example, some airlines, like Spirit and United, specify  the range of prices, which may vary based on the route. Other airlines,  like Alaska and Frontier, provide the minimum possible price but do not  specify the maximum a customer might pay for the preferred seat. One of  the selected airlines in our review, Delta, did not have preferred-seating  prices available to customers browsing the website. All of the selected  airlines provide detailed pricing on preferred seats if the customer selects  or begins to book a specific flight.", "From 2010 to 2017, U.S. airlines introduced other new fees such as fees  for carry-on bags, beverages, wireless internet access, and priority  boarding. For example, three low-cost airlines implemented new fees for  carry-on bags. Spirit introduced a fee for bringing a large bag into the  cabin in 2010, as did Allegiant in 2012 and Frontier in 2013. None of the  network airlines currently charge for carry-on bags. Allegiant and Frontier  also began to charge customers for non-alcoholic beverages in 2012 and  2013, respectively, while Spirit already charged for these products. Since  2010, some U.S. airlines began charging for services that were not  previously available. For example, Southwest first offered and charged for  wireless internet access in 2011, and JetBlue began charging for  expedited security screening and early boarding in 2011.", "While some customers are electing to pay extra for optional services,  others are purchasing tickets that are priced lower and include optional  service restrictions. For example, since 2015, American, Delta, and  United have introduced Basic Economy fares. Passengers choosing to  purchase Basic Economy tickets are assigned seats after checking in,  meaning that they might not be seated with the rest of their travel group;  board the aircraft last; cannot upgrade seats or class of service; and  cannot change their flights. In addition, American and United Basic  Economy passengers may not stow belongings in overhead  compartments and are limited to one carry-on bag that fits under the seat  in front of them.", "In yet another purchasing option, since 2010 several U.S. airlines have  introduced packages of optional services that are sold together as a  bundle instead of individually and can be purchased on top of or along  with the base fare. The contents of these bundles vary greatly among  airlines. For example, Frontier has two packages that include carry-on  and checked bags, seat selection, and priority boarding; one of the  packages also allows customers to change or cancel their tickets for full  refunds. Other airlines\u2019 bundles include the base ticket as well as other  optional services, such as JetBlue\u2019s \u201cBlue Plus\u201d that adds one checked  bag to the basic fare. On some airlines, bundled packages also overlap  with preferred seating; for example, on Hawaiian, an Extra Comfort seat  provides a seat with additional legroom, priority boarding and security  screening, entertainment pack, and the use of a pillow and a blanket.

Delta  and Hawaiian did not increase their fee for first and second checked  bags; however, they eliminated a $3 discount that was previously  available for paying bag fees online in advance of a flight. Among low- cost U.S. airlines with which we spoke, Allegiant, Frontier, and Spirit each  increased the fee range for the first and second checked bags from 2010  to 2017. These three airlines charge varying baggage fees based on  when the passenger pays the fee; specifically, paying a bag fee online  and in advance of the flight is less expensive than paying the bag fee at  the airport on the day of travel.

One airline  official explained that customers make purchasing decisions based  primarily on the base ticket price\u2014the cost of flying from one point to  another. According to this airline official, lowering the base fare therefore  helps an airline compete with other airlines. Some airline officials cited  other ways in which unbundling can lower ticket prices. For example, one  airline official said that baggage fees have prompted customers to travel  with fewer bags or no bags. As a result, the plane weighs less, which  reduces fuel costs and, in turn, can allow the airline to reduce the base  ticket price. Four other airline officials said that the lower base fares  resulting from unbundling optional services have made flying more  affordable to more people, thereby increasing the number of people who  decide to travel by air.", "Officials from two airlines said that airfares have decreased over time,  and an official from Airlines for America (A4A)\u2014the U.S. airline trade  association\u2014cited BTS data during a May 2017 congressional hearing to  show that consumers are paying less for airfare than they had previously;  however, these data have some limitations.

But,  the fares include only base fares plus applicable government taxes and  do not include all optional service fees. As a result, they do not represent  the total amount that some customers may be paying to travel. In  addition, according to DOT officials, DOT does not weight one-way tickets  differently than round-trip tickets when calculating the average fares. DOT  officials told us that customers are more likely to purchase one-way  tickets now than they were 10 years ago because airlines no longer  charge a premium for one-way tickets. As a result, a higher share of one- way tickets would result in lower average fares. Lastly, it is difficult to  determine all the factors that could have caused this decrease in airfare,  as several economy-wide changes, including those in energy prices,  affect fares.", "However, some studies have examined the effect bag fees may have had  on ticket prices. To examine this issue, we conducted an economic  literature search for any published, peer-reviewed studies that examined  the introduction of bag fees by U.S. airlines and the effect on fare prices.  The three studies that met our criteria (as described in appendix II) found  that although the introduction of bag fees may have led to a decrease in  average fares, the total price paid by customers who checked a bag may  not have decreased on average. Specifically, these studies found that  charging separately for bags reduced fares by less than the new bag fee  itself. As a result, customers who paid for checked bags paid more on  average for the combined airfare and bag fee than when the airfare and  bag fee were bundled together. Conversely, passengers who did not  check bags paid less overall. The results of these three studies are  summarized below.", "The authors of a 2012 study measured the impact of baggage fees on  airline fares using DOT data from 2006 to 2009. They noted that  airlines introduced bag fees to generate additional revenues without  increasing fares, which would adversely affect demand. They found  that for an airline charging a bag fee, a one-dollar increase in those  fees resulted in a $0.24 decrease in fares, which means that a  passenger checking one bag, would pay $0.76 more on these airlines.  According to the authors, these results imply that airlines with bag  fees lower fares to appear more competitive and then make up the  lost revenue when passengers pay to check bags.", "In a 2015 study, the authors analyzed DOT quarterly data from 2008  to 2009 and found that adoption of a bag fee resulted in about a 3  percent reduction in average airfares. Analyzing non-stop flights and  those with connections separately, they found that a bag fee led to a  2.7 percent and a 2.4 percent average-fare reduction for non-stop and  connecting flights, respectively. The authors pointed out that, since  these declines translated into an amount that was less than the bag  fee, on average the combined total of the fare and bag fee  increased. However, according to the authors, the decline could be  greater than the bag fee for some passengers because the decline in  average fare varies with route characteristics.", "In another 2015 study, the authors studied a sample of U.S. domestic  routes over the period 2007\u20132010, which covers the period when bag  fees were first introduced (in 2008) and when many carriers increased  bag fees (in 2010). To analyze the effect of bag fees on passenger  demand and fares, the authors focused on a set of domestic airport- to-airport routes where passengers could choose between airlines  that charged fees for checked baggage and Southwest, which allowed  passengers one or two \u201cfree\u201d checked bags. The authors found that a  one-dollar increase in bag fees led to an $0.11 reduction in fares and  a loss of 0.6 passengers. On the other hand, they found that a one- dollar fare increase resulted in a loss of seven passengers. Thus, they  determined that bag fees allowed airlines to increase their revenues  with a much lower reduction in passenger demand than a fare  increase. Finally, their evidence suggests that there is an overall  increase in total fares for passengers checking bags.", "Airline officials also said they charge separately for optional services to  meet the needs of their customers. According to officials from 9 of the 10  selected airlines we interviewed, unbundling allows passengers to  customize their flights by paying for only the services that they value\u2014a  benefit that one official cited as the overriding impetus for unbundling.  That official described unbundling as an effort to make the airline\u2019s entire  product line of services available to customers and provide passengers  with the ability to tailor their travel experience. Similarly, another airline  official explained that they aim to cater to a broad range of customers and  unbundling allows passengers to decide on the price and service level  that is right for them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airlines Cited Many Factors That Affect How They Price Optional Services", "paragraphs": ["Airline officials from the 10 U.S. airlines that we interviewed cited various  factors that contribute to their decisions about how to price optional  services.", "Customer demand and willingness to pay: Officials from all 10  airlines that we interviewed said that customer demand and the price  that customers are willing to pay for an optional service are important  factors in pricing an optional service. Customers\u2019 willingness to pay  varies. Hence, when the price rises, some consumers who are not  willing to pay a higher price stop purchasing, resulting in some loss of  demand. Higher prices may thus result in higher or lower revenue  depending on the extent to which the demand is reduced. For  example, one airline official described how the airline would consider  increasing the price for a preferred seat if the demand were high  enough, indicating that there may be some customers willing to pay  more for a preferred seat. An official from a different airline said that it  conducts market testing to determine what optional services  customers are interested in, and it may test products at different  prices to determine the optimal price.", "Competitors\u2019 prices for similar services: Officials from 8 of the 10  airlines that we interviewed said that they consider competitors\u2019  pricing for similar services when they set fees for optional services, to  ensure that their own product is priced competitively. One airline  official said that because commercial aviation is a highly competitive  industry, the official\u2019s company closely monitors the market and  makes adjustments to the price of services, as needed. Industry  stakeholders with whom we spoke, as well as consumer advocates,  believed that competition is a key factor in how airlines set fees for  optional services.", "Customer service and satisfaction: Officials from 5 of the 10  airlines we interviewed said that customer service and satisfaction are  factors in how they set prices. Officials from one airline stated that  they try to keep optional service fees relatively low to prevent  passengers from feeling overcharged. In at least one case, an airline  official told us that this airline sets the price of one type of fee to  prevent too many people from purchasing the service. For example,  this airline official told us they set the price for wireless internet access  high enough so that relatively few passengers will pay for it because  too many users can affect the speed and quality of the service.  Officials from 6 airlines said that they conduct customer surveys and  adjust the price of optional services based on survey feedback.", "Cost: Officials from 3 of the 10 airlines that we interviewed said that  the airlines\u2019 cost to deliver a service is a major factor in how they  charge for that service. One of these officials said that this airline  conducts a business case analysis when developing a new product to  ensure that the revenues from the new optional service exceed its  cost. Officials from 3 additional airlines cited cost as a minor factor.  Officials from 2 of these airlines said they incorporate cost into  optional service pricing only for products for which cost is relatively  easy to measure, such as food and beverages. Conversely, officials  from 4 airlines did not cite cost as a factor in pricing optional services.", "Even airline officials who said that cost factors into their pricing  decisions highlighted the complexity of calculating the precise cost of  delivering many services. For example, one airline official explained  that calculating the cost of cancelling a reservation requires  consideration of the cost of the reservation system, corporate  overhead, and possibly opportunity costs if the seat could not be re- sold. Another official from the same airline said that they closely track  costs but do not necessarily have the ability to assign a specific cost  to the provision of an optional service. This comment was echoed by  several airline officials who said that calculating the cost of checking  baggage, for example, requires consideration of a multitude of factors,  including labor, ground infrastructure, and fuel costs.", "In addition, one airline official said that the airline does not always  incur costs when offering some optional services, for example  allowing a passenger to select a seat in a preferred location, such as  a window seat or toward the front of a cabin, but the airline will sell the  service because customers value it enough to pay for it. Industry  stakeholders echoed the view that the cost of delivering optional  services plays a minimal role in airlines\u2019 pricing decision of optional  services. One industry stakeholder we spoke with agreed and stated  that the competitors\u2019 prices and what customers are willing to pay are  more important factors in how airlines set prices for optional services  than the cost of delivering a product; this stakeholder said that the  pricing of optional services is ultimately based on what will deliver the  most revenue to the airline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOT Has Made Progress in Increasing Transparency of Optional Service Fees, but Consumer and Industry Groups Raised Some Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOT Has Monitored and Enforced Compliance with Transparency Regulations, Collected Consumer Complaints, and Provided Guidance and Information to Airlines and Consumers", "paragraphs": ["DOT has taken a range of actions to improve transparency of U.S. airline  fees for optional services since 2010, as described below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Monitoring and Enforcing Compliance with Transparency Regulations", "paragraphs": ["DOT conducts different compliance inspections of U.S. airlines to monitor  compliance with its regulations on a variety of consumer traveler issues,  including issues related to transparency of optional service fees.", "Since 2012, DOT has completed 19 compliance inspections of U.S.  and foreign airlines according to documentation the department  provided to us.

As part of these inspections, DOT inspectors review  records onsite at airlines\u2019 headquarters as well as information on  airlines\u2019 websites.

According to DOT officials, under  DOT\u2019s process for handling complaints, when a complaint is received, a  DOT official will review and categorize the information by type of  complaint. DOT reviews the complaint to see whether a regulation applies  and, regardless whether it does, forwards all complaints to the applicable  airline for the airline to respond to the consumer. Airlines are required to  acknowledge each complaint within 30 days of receipt and provide a  substantive written response to each complainant within 60 days of  receipt. After receiving and reviewing the complaint, if DOT determines  the airline is in fact violating a regulation, DOT will ask for a copy of the  airline\u2019s correspondence with the complainant. According to DOT officials,  airlines generally respond to these requests in a timely fashion. A  consumer complaint regarding compliance issues with an existing  regulation can trigger an investigation in which DOT looks for egregious  or repeated violations; a pattern of violations can lead to enforcement  action. For example, in 2016, DOT issued a consent order against  VivaAerobus, a foreign airline, after DOT found that the airline was not  disclosing baggage and other optional service fees in accordance with  regulations.

Currently, U.S. airlines are required  to report this revenue in one of four separate accounts: baggage fees,  reservation change and cancellation fees, other transport-related fees,  and miscellaneous fees. Because revenues from baggage fees and  reservation change and cancellation fees have their own accounts, the  revenues from these particular fees can be tracked. However, according  to DOT documentation, revenues from other optional service fees are  reported either in the transport-related or miscellaneous fees accounts,  which include revenue from optional services as well as from other  sources. For example, according to DOT guidance, the transport-related  revenue category includes not only revenue from all onboard sales (such  as, food, drink, entertainment, and wireless internet access) but also  revenue from fuel or airplane parts sold to other airlines. Similarly,  according to DOT\u2019s guidance, the miscellaneous category includes, for  example, revenue for transporting unaccompanied minors and pets, as  well as revenue from sales of miles to airlines, credit card companies,  hotels, rental cars, or other business partners that are frequent flyer  partners. From 2010 to 2016, revenue for the transport-related account  increased by 10 percent, from $36.5 billion to $40.1 billion in constant  2016 dollars. At the same time, revenue from the miscellaneous account  increased by 87 percent, from $3.3 billion to $6.2 billion in constant 2016  dollars; this 87 percent increase was the largest increase of all four  accounts. Over the same years, U.S. airlines\u2019 total operating revenues  increased from $192.3 billion to $200.4 billion in constant 2016 dollars.  Because the DOT data do not separate the revenue reported from  optional service fees from the other types of revenues that are reported in  the transport-related and miscellaneous fees accounts, we could not  determine how much of the total revenue reported in these accounts  should be attributed to optional service fees.", "In 2010, we reported on this issue and stated that without complete data it  is difficult for policy makers and regulators to determine total revenues  from optional service fees and the fees\u2019 effect on the industry. We  concluded that without collecting revenue from optional service fees in a  separate account, it was difficult to determine the amount of total optional  service fee revenues that airlines collect. We recommended that DOT  require airlines to report all optional service fees paid by passengers  related to their trip into a separate category, exclusive of baggage fees  and reservation change and cancellation fees (for which separate  categories already exist). Citing our recommendation, DOT initiated a  rulemaking in 2011 that proposed requiring airlines to report optional  service fee revenues in 23 separate categories. However, the final rule  has not yet been published and DOT has not taken any recent action on  this rulemaking. According to DOT officials, DOT rulemakings are  currently being evaluated in accordance with Executive Orders 13771  and 13777; thus, the schedules for many ongoing rulemakings are still  to be determined.", "In our 2010 review we also found differences in how airlines report some  optional services fee revenues. More specifically, in 2010, we found that  airlines were reporting revenues from the same optional service fees into  different accounts. Based on responses from our selected airlines, this  issue persists. For example, we found that some airlines accounted for  revenues from unaccompanied minor fees as transport-related revenue  while others reported them as miscellaneous operating revenue, and two  airlines reported fees for unaccompanied minors as revenue from  reservation cancellation fees. We also found differences in how airlines  reported revenue from preferred seating, upgraded seats, seat selection,  and priority security screening. In some cases, we found airlines reported  fees inaccurately despite guidance, and in others, it was not clear from  DOT\u2019s guidance how certain fees should be categorized. DOT\u2019s guidance  has not been updated since 2009, and according to officials, there are no  current plans to do so. As previously discussed, since 2010 airlines have  introduced a number of new fees and products for optional services, and  determining how to report revenue from these fees into the existing four  accounts may not be clear. However, even if DOT were to revise its  guidance and provide more detailed information on how to categorize  different fees, it would still not be possible to understand how much  revenue is generated just from optional service fees because airlines  would still be required to report this information in accounts that include  revenue from other non-fee sources. Implementation of our 2010  recommendation that DOT require airlines to report all optional service  fees, exclusive of baggage fees and reservation-change and cancellation  fees, into a separate category would provide airlines with a clearer  understanding of how to report revenue from specific optional service  fees and provide the missing data on how much revenue is generated  from optional service fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Educating Airlines and Consumers", "paragraphs": ["DOT has taken several actions to educate airlines and consumers about  existing regulations and consumer rights related to optional service fees,  for example:  In 2011, after the issuance of Consumer Rule 2, DOT conducted  informational sessions with the airlines about the requirements of the  new regulations.

According to these officials, the type of optional services available for  purchase differs by airline and by distribution channel. Officials from the  remaining 6 airlines told us that they sell products primarily through direct  channels (i.e., their own websites or customer service) because (1) they  have more control over how those products are marketed to consumers  and (2) the third-party websites have technical limitations in how they can  display and sell optional service products. For example, one airline official  stated that his airline can better differentiate its products from other  airline\u2019s products on its own website than on an online travel agency or  metasearch company site. In addition, officials from the International Air  Transport Association (IATA) told us that the industry as a whole is taking  steps to develop standards and capabilities for optional services to be  more widely available for purchase through GDSs and online travel  agencies.", "In 2010, we recommended that DOT require airlines to disclose baggage  fees and policies along with fare information across all sales channels  used by the airline.

In  addition, the proposed rulemaking would only require that information  about baggage fees be made available, not other types of optional  service fees.

Representatives from two consumer  groups whom we interviewed said that even though airlines are required  to have a \u201cstatic page\u201d on their website listing all optional service fees,  these lists can be lengthy and can include several different fees with  different associated rules that the consumer would need to interpret and  understand.

Specifically, the European Union (EU), Canada, Malaysia, and the United  Kingdom (UK) have all enacted laws that include provisions related to  increasing the transparency of airline optional service fees. For example,  in 2008, the EU enacted Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 on Common  Rules for the Operation of Air Services in the Community, which  established, among other things, specific requirements related to  disclosing information about airline optional service fees. The law  requires that airlines display the final price of a ticket, inclusive of all  applicable taxes, charges, surcharges and fees unavoidable and  foreseeable at the time of publication. The law also requires that the final  price is disclosed at all times during the booking process and that the  applicable conditions are published. In addition, airlines must disclose  optional service fees in a clear, transparent, and unambiguous way at the  start of the booking process, such as through a separate link on the  airline\u2019s website, and airlines must ensure that optional services are only  offered on an \u201copt-in\u201d basis. As shown in table 4, other countries have  implemented similar laws. In addition, in 2017, Canada introduced  consumer protection legislation related to air transportation that would  require, among other things, that the Canadian Transportation Agency  promulgate regulations establishing air passenger rights.", "There are some differences between the U.S. and foreign laws. For  example, Part V, Division III of Canada\u2019s Air Transportation Regulations  requires advertisements of air services to specify all optional services  offered, as well as their price or range of prices, including applicable  taxes and fees charged by government or public authority. In addition, the  regulations prohibit information being provided in an advertisement in a  manner that would interfere with the ability of anyone to readily determine  the price for the air service, including for any optional incidental service.  The Canadian law does not otherwise impose specific requirements as to  how this information is to be made available to consumers. According to  officials from Canadian Transportation Agency, airlines can decide how  they want to communicate this information to the consumer. Also,  according to officials from the European Commission, a 2014 European  Court of Justice decision determined that airlines cannot charge for  bringing hand bags or carry-on luggage into the plane\u2019s cabin. According  to officials, the court\u2019s rationale for the decision was that airlines do not  provide the passenger any services regarding carry-ons, as passengers  carry their own bags.", "Officials from the regulatory bodies that we interviewed said that they  monitor airline compliance with consumer transparency laws through  various methods. For example, according to a European Commission  official, the European Commission and the authorities of EU member  states (countries) monitor airline compliance with consumer transparency  laws and have carried out several reviews to determine the level of  compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 in different EU countries.  According to documentation provided by the European Commission, in  2013, the European Commission, in conjunction with national authorities,  initiated reviews of 552 websites and found that 382 websites were not  compliant with the EU consumer transparency law. One problem they  found was that optional services, including fees for baggage, insurance,  and priority boarding, were not being offered on an \u201copt-in\u201d basis. In  addition, the European Commission conducted a \u201cfitness check\u201d of  aviation regulations in 2013 to determine whether the airline consumer  transparency laws and other consumer protection laws, were meeting  their objective and whether any changes to these laws were needed.  According to documentation provided by the European Commission, the  review found that the laws were meeting their objectives, but that EU  member states faced some challenges with enforcing these laws and  could benefit from further coordination and sharing of best practices in  this area. According to an official from the European Commission, it has  also recently begun an evaluation of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 to  determine whether there are any areas of the law that could be improved.", "Similarly, officials from the UK and Canada have taken actions to assess  compliance with existing consumer transparency laws. Officials from the  United Kingdom\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA) told us that in 2010  and 2011 they reviewed the websites of the top 20 airlines flying from the  UK and two smaller UK airlines to assess compliance with Regulation  (EC) No 1008/2008. According to UK CAA officials, at that time, they  discovered that most airlines were not in compliance and all the airlines  had to make some changes to their websites. Issues included failing to  include unavoidable taxes, fees and charges in the headline price, pre- selecting optional extras and not separately disclosing information about  optional service fees. UK CAA officials notified airlines that were not in  compliance and provided them with information on the steps that the  airlines needed to take to ensure that their advertisements met the  requirements of the law. According to UK CAA officials, most of the  airlines agreed to amend their websites; however, there were three  airlines where the UK CAA had to take enforcement action to achieve  compliance. According to UK CAA officials, compliance with the EU law  has improved since 2010, and most airlines now have a link posted early  in the booking process to baggage fees and other optional service fees.  The UK CAA has also completed reviews of travel agents\u2019 websites to  assess compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, according to UK  CAA officials. Canadian officials told us that the Canadian Transportation  Agency monitors and enforces airline compliance with consumer  transparency laws. To do so, they conduct periodic carrier inspections to  assess compliance with Canada\u2019s Air Transportation Regulations and  conduct targeted investigations when needed. The Canadian  Transportation Agency also reviews international tariffs to determine  whether they set out all the information required by regulation and to  assess whether airline policies with regard to optional service fees are  clear, reasonable and not unduly discriminatory, according to Canadian  officials. Malaysian officials that we spoke with stated that they are in the  process of developing processes for monitoring and enforcing compliance  with Malaysia\u2019s consumer protection code.", "Officials from some of the regulatory bodies whom we interviewed said  that they have taken other actions to educate airline consumers about  consumer transparency laws related to optional service fees. For  example, the UK CAA posts information on its website about existing  optional service fees for the 20 largest airlines that travel to and from the  UK, and the document is updated twice a year. According to UK CAA  officials, they make this information available on their website to inform  UK consumers about these fees and help consumers compare different  optional service fees across different airlines. Similarly, the Malaysian  Aviation Commission has a \u201cKnow Your Rights, Before You Fly\u201d  webpage, where, according to Malaysian officials, they post information  for consumers, including their rights related to airline optional service  fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives for this report were to describe: (1) how selected U.S.  airlines have modified their offering and pricing of optional services since  2010, (2) the factors that selected U.S. airlines consider when  determining whether and how much to charge for optional services, and  (3) the actions the Department of Transportation (DOT) has taken since  2010 to improve the transparency of optional service fees and views of  selected aviation stakeholders about these actions. We also described  the actions taken by selected regions or countries to improve consumer  transparency related to airline optional service fees and presented this  information in appendix I.", "To identify the ways in which selected U.S. airlines modified their offering  and pricing of optional services since 2010, we first selected U.S.  passenger airlines to examine. We used data from DOT\u2019s Bureau of  Transportation Statistics (BTS) on passenger enplanements and airline  operating revenues. For the passenger data, we used the T-100  database, which includes traffic data for U.S. airlines traveling to and from  the United States. These data represent a 100 percent census of all  traffic. For the financial data, we used Form 41 quarterly financial filings to  BTS, specifically Schedule P-1.2. We relied on the most recent available  BTS data at the time we developed our airline selection. To assess the  reliability of the BTS enplanements and operating revenue data, we  reviewed documentation about the quality control procedures applied by  BTS; analyzed the summary data for obvious errors; and interviewed BTS  officials about how the data are collected, validated, stored, and  protected. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of identifying airlines to include in our selection for this audit  work. We selected U.S. passenger airlines that: (1) reported annual  operating revenues of at least $20 million in calendar year 2015, (2) had 1  million or more domestic passengers in calendar year 2015, (3) had at  least 1,000 scheduled passengers in the third quarter of 2016, and (4)  operate under their own brand. This selection process resulted in a list of  12 U.S. passenger airlines: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American  Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue  Airways, Sun Country Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United  Airlines, and Virgin America. Collectively, the selected airlines transported  81.15 percent of U.S. domestic passengers in 2016 and accounted for  99.88 percent of baggage fees and 99.98 percent of rebooking and  cancellation fees charged by all U.S. airlines in 2016. During the course  of our review, Alaska Air Group, which owns Alaska Airlines, purchased  Virgin America. As a result, we eliminated Virgin America from our  selection of airlines mid-way through our review and report on 11 selected  airlines.", "We identified the types of optional services offered by the 11 selected  airlines by reviewing webpages on airlines\u2019 websites, which are required  to prominently display optional services and fees. We accessed the  airlines websites and took screen captures of the webpages with optional  service fee information on March 31 and April 1, 2017, so that our  analyses of the website content would be as comparable as possible. We  also returned to airlines\u2019 websites at later points to collect additional  information. We compared the optional service fee information that we  gathered from our review of airlines\u2019 websites to optional service fee  information that we collected as part of our 2010 review of airline fees to  assess how these fees had changed since 2010.", "We corroborated information obtained from our review of airline\u2019s  websites through interviews with officials from 10 of the 11 selected  airlines. We requested interviews with representatives from all 11  selected airlines but one airline declined to be interviewed. As a result  we interviewed officials from 10 of the 11 selected airlines. In  interviewing the airline officials, we used a semi-structured interview  instrument, which contained questions pertaining to the types of optional  service fees and bundled fare products that airlines have introduced since  2010, the factors that airlines consider when setting fees, and airlines\u2019  views on advantages and disadvantages to consumers of unbundling  optional services. During our interviews, we also asked airlines if they  would be willing to share cost information on optional services with us,  and all 10 airlines declined to provide us with such proprietary  information; or said that they do not collect specific cost information on  optional services; or said that they collect cost information only in limited  circumstances, such as food and beverage costs, which would not have  been useful for this report. In addition to answering our interview  questions, we asked the 10 airlines to provide information on when they  first began charging for specific optional services, how much those fees  were at the time that they were first introduced, and how revenue from  those fees are categorized and reported to BTS. Nine of the 10 airlines  that we interviewed provided this information. One of the responsive  airlines did not provide a complete response, but the overall responses  were sufficiently detailed to address our objective.", "In addition to obtaining fee information, we analyzed airline financial  information reported to BTS by airlines from calendar year 2010 through  calendar year 2016\u2014the most recent available\u2014to analyze how revenue  generated from optional service fees had changed from 2010 to 2016. We  analyzed revenue data from baggage fees and reservation-change and  cancellation fees, which are the two types of optional service-fee  revenues that airlines are required to report to BTS in separate accounts.  All other optional service-fee revenue is reported in accounts that include  other airline revenue sources. We assessed the reliability of the BTS\u2019s  operating revenue data as discussed above and determined that they  were reliable for the purpose of reporting overall trends in revenue from  baggage and reservation-change and cancellation fees for 2010 through  2016.", "To identify the factors that airlines consider when setting optional service  fees, we interviewed officials from the 10 selected U.S. airlines that  agreed to speak with us about the factors airlines consider when deciding  whether to separate optional service fees from the base fare price and  determining how much to charge for a given optional service. We also  interviewed selected aviation stakeholders that included three airline  trade associations; four consumer groups; three global distribution  systems (GDS) companies; a travel trade association representing GDSs,  online travel agents, and metasearch companies; and two other industry  stakeholders to obtain their views on factors that airlines consider when  setting fees (see table 5). We selected the three airline trade associations  that represent different airlines (i.e., domestic airlines, international  airlines, and regional airlines). We selected four consumer group  associations that represent a range of types of airline consumers (i.e.,  business travelers and leisure travelers) and that recently published  articles on consumer transparency issues related to optional service fees.  With regard to the GDSs, we selected the three largest GDS companies  in the United States. To obtain the perspective of companies that provide  information or sell airline tickets through indirect distribution methods, we  also selected the travel trade association which represents GDSs, online  travel agents, and metasearch companies. Finally, we selected two  industry stakeholders because they have observed how the airline  industry has changed since 2010 and cover the breadth of the airline  industry.", "We also conducted an economic literature search for studies that have  examined the effect of baggage fees on base ticket prices. The literature  search was performed in March 2017, using keyword and controlled- vocabulary searches in bibliographic databases including Transportation  Research International Documentation, Academic OneFile, Scopus, and  WorldCat. The terms included, but were not limited to, keywords such as  \u201cairline\u201d or \u201cair carrier,\u201d \u201cbaggage fees\u201d or \u201cancillary fees,\u201d \u201cunbundling\u201d or  \u201cde-bundling,\u201d combined with \u201cimpact\u201d or \u201caffect\u201d or \u201ceffect\u201d and \u201cticket  price\u201d or \u201cbase fare\u201d or \u201cairline pricing.\u201d We limited our search to studies  published after 2010 because baggage fees were first introduced in 2008.  The literature search generated 11 initial results. We vetted this initial list  by examining the abstracts for those that addressed our objectives and by  determining which studies had appeared in peer-reviewed journals. We  identified 5 studies that met these criteria. After performing a secondary  review of these studies to assess the soundness of the studies\u2019  methodologies and to confirm the relevance to our objectives, we  excluded 2 of these studies. This resulted in the following 3 studies being  included in our report.", "Henrickson, Kevin E. and John Scott, 2012, \u201cBaggage Fees and  Changes in Airline Ticket Prices,\u201d in James Peoples (ed.), Pricing  Behavior and Non-Price Characteristics in the Airline Industry  (Advances in Airline Economics, Volume 3) Emerald Group Publishing  Limited, 177\u2013192.", "Brueckner, Jan K., Darin N.

In addition, we identified four DOT proposed rules and  one request for information related to transparency of optional service  fees and followed up with DOT regarding the status of these ongoing  rulemakings and request for information. We also reviewed DOT  guidance, directives, policies, and other documentation clarifying the requirements of various regulations and describing the roles and  responsibilities of DOT\u2019s Office of Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings  (OAEP) and Aviation Consumer Protection Division (ACPD) related to  monitoring, investigating, and enforcing airline compliance with  regulations related to airline optional service fees. To understand how  OAEP and ACPD monitor compliance with existing optional service fee  regulations and respond to consumer complaints about optional service  fees, we interviewed officials from OAEP and ACPD about existing  regulations; the policies, compliance, and enforcement activities  undertaken by these offices; and the process for responding to  complaints. In addition, we also interviewed officials from BTS about their  guidance and process for collecting optional service fee revenue data  from airlines. As described above, we asked officials from the 10 airlines  that agreed to be interviewed about how they report revenue from certain  optional service fees to DOT\u2019s BTS. We summarized this information and  identified fees that airlines commonly reported in different categories. To  understand how different stakeholders view actions DOT has taken to  improve transparency of optional service fees, we interviewed  stakeholders described in table 5. In addition, during our interviews with  officials from the 10 selected U.S. airlines that agreed to speak with us,  we obtained their views on DOT\u2019s actions and obtained information about  how their airlines comply with DOT regulations related to optional service  fees. We also conducted an analysis of the contracts of carriage for all  the 11 airlines in our selection. This helped us to corroborate information  we obtained from our interviews with airline officials about their optional  service refund policies. These contracts of carriage were all accessed  and downloaded on March 14, 2017, so that our analyses of the contract- of-carriage content would be as comparable as possible. To assess the  readability of the contracts of carriage, we converted the files to Microsoft  Word documents and ran the Flesch-Kincaid Grade-Level test, which is  included in the Microsoft Word software.", "Finally, we reviewed documents and interviewed officials from four  selected foreign governments\u2014the European Union, Canada, the United  Kingdom, and Malaysia\u2014that have taken actions to improve consumer  transparency related to airline optional service fees. Specifically, we  interviewed officials from the European Commission, Canadian  Transportation Agency, United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority, and the  Malaysian Aviation Commission. We based our selection of foreign  governments on various factors including whether the region or country  has implemented or is considering implementing laws related to  increasing consumer transparency of airline\u2019s optional service fees, and  recommendations from our interviews with DOT and industry officials and  stakeholders. We interviewed officials about existing laws related to  consumer transparency of optional service fees, how these laws are  monitored and enforced, and the effects of these laws on the airline  industry and airline consumers. In addition, we used these interviews to  corroborate information obtained from our document reviews.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2016 to September  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
