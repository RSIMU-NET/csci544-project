Although deploying wireless E911 and NG911 is the responsibility of state and local governments, FCC is required by law to report annually on the funds states collect to provide 911 services such as E911. The Next Generation 911 Advancement Act of 2012 required GAO to review states\u0092 collection and use of 911 funds.

Wireless E911 deployment usually proceeds through two phases: Phase I provides general caller location information by identifying the cell tower or cell site that is receiving the wireless call; Phase II provides more precise caller-location information, usually within 50 to 300 meters. Currently, according to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), nearly 98 percent of 911 call centers, known as Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), are capable of receiving Phase I location information, and 97 percent have implemented Phase II for at least one wireless carrier. This represents a significant improvement since 2003 when implementation of Phase I was 65 percent and Phase II was 18 percent. According to NENA's current data, 142 U.S. counties (representing roughly 3 percent of the U.S. population) do not have some level of wireless E911 service. The areas that lack wireless E911 are primarily rural and tribal areas that face special implementation challenges, according to federal and association officials.", "According to data collected by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), all 50 states and the District of Columbia reported collecting--or authorizing local entities to collect--funds for wireless E911 implementation, and most states reported using these funds for their intended purpose. Six states--Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, New York, and Rhode Island--reported using a total of almost $77 million of funds collected for 911 implementation for other purposes (e.g., transferring 911 funds to the general fund) in 2011. Using funds in this way is permissible by state law in these states, but it creates the risk of undermining the credibility of 911 fees in those states. The manner in which FCC collects and reports information on state 911 funds limits the usefulness of its annual report. In particular, contrary to best practices for collecting and analyzing data, FCC uses only open-ended questions to solicit information from states, lacks written guidelines for interpreting states' responses and ensuring that results can be reproduced, and does not describe the methodology used to analyze the data it collects. As a result, FCC is missing an opportunity to analyze trends and to provide more detailed aggregated information that would be useful to decision makers.", "Next Generation (NG911) will enable the public to reach PSAPs through voice and data, such as text messages, but stakeholders have identified a variety of technical, regulatory, and funding challenges to implementing it. For example, many of the existing state and federal regulations governing 911 were written before the technological capabilities of NG911 existed. The federal government is taking steps to help states address challenges. In particular, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has focused on research through the NG911 Initiative, and FCC released a 5-point plan to encourage NG911 implementation. FCC's plan includes (1) developing location accuracy mechanisms for NG911; (2) enabling consumers to send text, photos, and videos to PSAPs; (3) facilitating the completion and implementation of NG911 technical standards; (4) developing a governance framework for NG911; and (5) developing a funding model for NG911. FCC also released a report in March 2013 that detailed specific recommendations to Congress for a legal and regulatory framework for NG911."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FCC should follow best practices for data collection and analysis to improve its current method of collecting and reporting information on state 911 funds.

However, in some cases, response services need to  be able to automatically identify the caller\u2019s location, such as in the case  of a 911 caller who cannot speak because he is suffering a heart attack or  a caller reporting an accident along a highway who does not know the  exact location. Basic 911 service provided Americans with an easily  remembered universal number that connects the caller to an emergency  response center. Enhanced 911 (E911) service is a technological  improvement that automatically provides the street address and callback  number of a wireline caller or, in the case of wireless E911, the  approximate geographic location of the mobile phone used to place a 911  call and the callback number of the person calling. The continuing  evolution of communications technologies and wireless phones has  implications for 911 services. Since 911 call centers predominantly use  older, analog-based infrastructure and equipment, the current E911  system is not designed to accommodate emergency communications  from the range of new technologies in common use today, including text  and picture messaging and Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony  (e.g., Skype). In response to changing technologies, the Department of  Transportation (DOT) launched the Next Generation 911 (NG911)  Initiative, which has focused on the research required to develop an  NG911 system. With NG911 services, the public could reach 911 call  centers through various modes, including voice and data, and transmit  multi-media information such as video. Deploying and operating wireless  E911 (and NG911 going forward) is the responsibility of government  entities at the state, county, or local level, although the federal  government has taken steps to facilitate the nationwide deployment.", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is required by law to  report to Congress on the identity of the states, territories, or political  subdivisions (such as counties or localities) that collect taxes, fees, or  other charges for emergency communications such as E911. This  reporting includes the amount of those revenues used for purposes other  than the ones specified by the state\u2019s method of funding 911. FCC has  been preparing these mandated reports since 2009 based on states\u2019  responses to FCC\u2019s public notices seeking relevant information.

To provide  context for our review, we also examined the progress of E911  implementation and federal efforts in this area. This report presents  information on (1) the progress that has been made in implementing  wireless E911 in the last decade, (2) the extent to which states are  collecting and using 911 funds for 911 purposes and the usefulness of  FCC\u2019s annual reports on states\u2019 911 funds, and (3) challenges to  implementing NG911 services and federal efforts to facilitate its  deployment.", "To address these issues, we analyzed county and state-level E911  implementation information collected by the National Emergency Number  Association (NENA) as of December 2012, reviewed our previous  reports on wireless E911 implementation, analyzed FCC\u2019s 2010 through  2012 annual reports on state collection and distribution of 911 and E911  fees and charges, reviewed states\u2019 responses to FCC\u2019s information- collecting effort associated with these reports, and analyzed comments  submitted by government, industry, and association officials in response  to FCC\u2019s public notice on NG911. In assessing the usefulness of FCC\u2019s  reporting, we reviewed best practices set forth in our previous reports.  To determine the reliability of the data used in FCC\u2019s annual reports, we  reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed cognizant officials  about their processes for reviewing the data and ensuring their accuracy.  We determined that the NENA E911 implementation data and, with  certain exceptions subsequently noted in this report, the information  related to FCC\u2019s reports to Congress are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We gathered further information from state  officials in the states that reported using E911 funds for other purposes  during calendar year 2011: Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, New York,  and Rhode Island.NG911 pilot project and visited Illinois, where we interviewed officials  from the state 911 office, officials associated with a regional NG911   We interviewed officials associated with a Texas  project, and representatives from rural counties in southern Illinois that  have not begun E911 implementation. We chose to visit Illinois because  stakeholders mentioned its regional NG911 project and because the state  had reported using E911 funds for other purposes in its 2010, 2011, and  2012 reports to FCC. We interviewed Texas officials with responsibility for  the state\u2019s NG911 pilot project because Texas received the largest 911  grant from the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) and because stakeholders mentioned that the state was making  progress on implementing NG911. We selected these states for the  specific reasons noted above and the information we obtained is not  generalizable to any other states.

With wireline E911 service, emergency  calls are automatically routed to the appropriate 911 call center, and the  call taker receives the telephone number and street address of the caller.  In 1996, FCC adopted rules for wireless E911. Wireless E911 technology  provides emergency responders with the location and callback number of  a person calling 911 from a mobile phone. Implementing wireless E911  involves deploying technologies that are able to calculate the geographic  coordinates of the caller\u2019s location at the time of the call and display these  coordinates as a location the call taker can understand. When a wireless  caller dials 911, the call must be routed along the networks of both a  wireless telephone company and a wireline telephone company before  terminating at a call center, known as a Public Safety Answering Point  (PSAP). There are more than 6,000 PSAPs nationwide, often at a county  or city level. PSAPs vary in size and technical sophistication. Some large  urban PSAPs have dozens of call takers and split the functions of call  taking and dispatching the proper emergency responder. Smaller PSAPs  are sometimes staffed by only two or three call takers who also handle  dispatch. In some rural areas, the PSAP may be the sheriff\u2019s office.", "As shown in figure 1, the wireless carriers, local exchange carriers, and  PSAPs must have appropriate equipment and interconnections for  wireless E911 calls to be sent to and received by PSAPs with the caller\u2019s  location information. For example, wireless carriers must finance the  implementation of a caller location solution and test their equipment to  verify its accuracy. Local exchange carriers are generally responsible for  ensuring that all the necessary connections between wireless carriers,  PSAPs, and databases have been installed and are operating correctly.  The original E911 system was designed to carry only the caller\u2019s  telephone number with the call, and the associated fixed address was  obtained from an established database. Wireless E911, however,  requires more data items, and the mobile caller\u2019s location must be  obtained during the call and delivered to the PSAP separately using  additional data delivery capabilities. To translate the latitude and  longitude location information into a street address, PSAPs usually must  acquire and install mapping software. PSAPs may also need to acquire  new computers to receive and display this information. Getting PSAPs the  technology needed to receive wireless E911 location information is  primarily a state and local responsibility because PSAPs serve an  emergency response function that has traditionally fallen under state or  local jurisdiction. As a result, states and local jurisdictions establish  timetables for implementation by their PSAPs and fund the equipment  upgrades needed by their PSAPs for E911 service.", "The only federally mandated time frames for implementing wireless E911  technologies are those placed on wireless carriers by FCC. In 1996, FCC  responded to the rising number of mobile telephone subscribers and the  resulting increase in wireless 911 calls by adopting rules for wireless  E911 that established a two-phase implementation approach for the  wireless carriers and set deadlines for wireless carriers regarding their  part in E911 deployment.months of a request from a PSAP, wireless carriers be prepared to  provide the PSAP with the wireless phone number of the caller and the  location of the cell site receiving the 911 call (Phase I information); and  (2) by October 2001, or within 6 months of receiving a request from a  PSAP, wireless carriers be prepared to provide the PSAP with the  geographic coordinates of the caller\u2019s location with greater precision,   FCC required that (1) by April 1998, or within 6  generally within 50 to 300 meters (Phase II information). As we reported  in 2006, most states and the District of Columbia collect fees to cover the  costs of implementing wireless E911. States collect fees on a variety of  telecommunications services including wireline, wireless, \u201cprepaid  wireless,\u201d and VoIP.", "DOT has recognized the relationship between wireless E911 services and  highway safety and, in 2001, contracted with NENA to develop a  state/county database that tracks E911 implementation. As part of the  contract, NENA created a database of counties, including information  about implementation of wireless E911, which is updated with data  gathered directly from state and county representatives. Now completely  funded by NENA, the database is accessible through  http://www.nena.org.", "The New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008  (NET 911 Act) requires FCC to submit an annual report to Congress  detailing the status in each state of the collection and distribution of fees  or charges for the support or implementation of 911 or E911 services to  ensure transparency and accountability. The annual reports are to include  findings on the amount of revenues obligated or expended by each state  or political subdivision thereof for any purpose other than the purpose  specified in the state or local law adopting the fee or charge. FCC has  submitted four reports to Congress covering the state activities of  calendar years 2008 to 2011. In addition, the National 911 Program\u2014 housed within NHTSA\u2019s Office of Emergency Medical Services\u2014has  helped to provide federal leadership and coordination in supporting and  promoting optimal 911 services.\"  Because of changes in the public\u2019s use of communications technology  and the aging infrastructure of the legacy 911 network, 911 services are  transitioning to an NG911 system that uses Internet Protocol (IP)-based  technology to deliver and process 911 traffic. Such a system will provide  increased capabilities as shown in table 1. With NG911, PSAPs are  expected to be able to process all types of emergency communications  including voice, data, and video. According to NENA, Emergency  Services IP Networks are among the basic building blocks required for  NG911. They are managed, multipurpose networks that support public  safety communications services and use broadband technology capable  of carrying voice plus large amounts of data using Internet protocols and  standards. As part of the NG911 Initiative, DOT has created an NG911  system design and tested it to show that the design will be capable of  accommodating communications from a wider range of devices including  cellular calls, instant messaging, wireline calls, \u201ctelematics\u201d (automatic  crash notification data directly from the vehicle), VoIP calls, and live video  feeds.", "In September 2009, NHTSA and NTIA announced more than $40 million  in grants to help PSAPs implement E911 and NG911 technologies. To be  eligible for the program, the applicant had to certify that the state and  other taxing jurisdictions within the state had not used designated E911  funds for any other purpose than for which they were designated within  180 days preceding the application date. The grant period concluded at  the end of 2012. In all, NHTSA and NTIA awarded grants ranging from  $200,000 to $5.4 million to 30 states and territories to help implement  NG911 services.

According to the National 911 Program, rural  agencies may lack the funding resources needed for technology  upgrades, equipment, and training. Rural and tribal areas typically are  large geographically but less densely populated than urban areas. In  addition, because it may take first responders longer to reach the scene  of an emergency, call-takers in PSAPs serving rural areas may be  required to stay on the phone longer with callers or provide more  extensive emergency instruction to callers until help arrives. Furthermore,  federal and local officials told us about the following specific challenges  facing rural and tribal areas:", "Tribal lands face special challenges related to 911 services because  of several barriers to improving telecommunications on tribal lands.  We have previously reported that the barriers to improving  telecommunications on tribal lands most often cited by tribal officials,  service providers, and others we spoke with were the rural, rugged  terrain of tribal lands and tribes\u2019 limited financial resources. These  barriers increase the costs of deploying infrastructure and limit the  ability of service providers to recover their costs, which can reduce  providers\u2019 interest in providing or improving telecommunications  services. Other barriers include the shortage of technically trained  tribal members and providers\u2019 difficulty in obtaining rights of way to  deploy their infrastructure on tribal lands.", "The limited emergency response resources typical of rural areas can  be relatively quickly overwhelmed in disasters or large-scale incidents,  according to the National 911 Program. For example, officials from  rural counties in one state told us that their PSAPs were overwhelmed  with multiple calls following a recent derailed train incident. These  calls paralyzed their 911 systems and prevented other 911 calls from  reaching the PSAPs during the incident.", "According to FCC officials, network-based \u201ctriangulation\u201d\u2014a solution  used by some wireless carriers to determine a caller\u2019s location\u2014 depends on the ability of three cell towers to access the caller\u2019s   Network-based triangulation can be particularly  mobile device.challenging in rural areas that have fewer cell towers than more  densely populated areas.", "According to rural officials in one state we contacted, some homes in  rural areas do not have addresses and some streets do not have  names.

We have previously  reported that while open-ended questions may be unavoidable when  engaged in exploratory work and can be useful to obtain responses that  might further clarify the meaning of answers to close-ended questions,   When answering open- open-ended questions have several limitations.ended questions, respondents may provide wide-ranging responses that  vary and may result in inconsistent information, making it very difficult to  consistently and completely tabulate or aggregate responses. Closed- ended questions, on the other hand, can yield data that may be easier to  meaningfully track and compare. FCC asks states to report, among other  things, the amount of 911 fees or charges imposed and the total amount  collected. States\u2019 responses to this question varied widely and  respondents often omitted relevant information. For example, some states  clearly identified the services\u2014wireline, wireless, pre-paid, and VoIP\u2014to  which fees applied, while other states did not specify the services to  which fees applied. Because states were not specifically asked whether  they collected fees for specific services, it is unclear whether these counts  are inclusive or exclusive of these specific services. If FCC had asked  closed-ended questions that required respondents to address such  distinctions, FCC would have been better able to consistently track fees  for various services over time, which could address matters such as  whether 911 funding is evolving with changing technology. However,  since this information has not been asked in a way that it can be tracked,  trend analysis is not possible.", "Moreover, when reporting the total amount of funds collected, states vary  widely in their manner of reporting. Some states provide a total amount  without any distinguishing features. Some states break out the amount  collected by state and local authorities; others break out the amount  collected by type of service. Some states provide an actual number  whereas others provide an estimate. Because of the open-ended  question format, it is nearly impossible to aggregate these results in a  useful manner. FCC does provide all state responses in an appendix to  its annual reports, and FCC officials stated that doing this facilitates public  review and discussion. The inclusion of these state submissions can  support public review, particularly in examining the relationship among  responses in a particular state. However, the provision of the state reports  may not readily lend itself to obtaining specific or discrete types of  information from the responses to the open-ended questions. For  example, one item asks whether the state has written criteria regarding  the allowable uses of the collected funds. This item is embedded in a  request for multiple pieces of information. If any interested parties wanted  to know how many states and which ones reported having written criteria,  they would have to read through all the responses to that item for all  submitting entities to obtain the information sought. A closed-ended item  could readily capture which state does and does not have written criteria.", "We have previously reported that with open-ended questions, the  responses are often textual and not easily tabulated, and a process called  \u201ccontent analysis\u201d must be used to classify or code the responses. As  part of the process of conducting content analysis, a coding manual  should be prepared for use by those classifying the responses. A good  coding manual is viewed as indispensible in ensuring coding of the  highest quality, and an important measure for judging the quality of a  content analysis is the extent to which the results can be reproduced.  However, FCC officials told us that, while they describe the methodology  used to collect the data from states, they do not have an internal written  coding manual or similar document that describes how the content of a  state\u2019s responses are interpreted or coded. FCC officials noted that this  had not been problematic to date because the same FCC staff members  had conducted the analysis each year but indicated that development of  such a manual would be helpful to ensure future continuity. Because  there is no written documentation on how this analysis was conducted,  nor the decisions rules that FCC followed in developing its summary  classification of responses, there is no basis for independently  reproducing the results of FCC\u2019s analysis.", "We also found that FCC has not been consistent in how it makes certain  characterizations in its report. For example, we identified three states\u2014 Georgia, Maine, and New York\u2014that provided similar responses each  year but FCC characterized the responses differently in different years.  For example, Maine reported that it had transferred funds from the 911  fund to the general fund in calendar years 2010 and 2011 as part of a  statewide personnel reduction initiative, as described above. FCC  characterized Maine as using 911 funds for other purposes in its 2012  report but not in its 2011 report. In another example, Georgia reported  that 911 fees on prepaid wireless devices remained in the state\u2019s general  fund rather than being allocated for 911 use in its 2010, 2011, and 2012  reports to FCC. FCC identified Georgia as having used funds for other  purposes in its 2010 and 2012 reports but not in its 2011 report. FCC  officials acknowledged that these three states should have been identified  as using funds for other purposes in its 2011 report, but that officials  corrected this in the 2012 report. However, FCC did not indicate in the  2012 report that a mistake was made in the 2011 report. A reader who  noted that the states were not listed as having used funds for other  purposes in the 2011 report, might believe that these states changed their  practices from one year to the next, when, in fact, the states reported  essentially the same information each year.", "We also identified inconsistent characterizations in FCC\u2019s summary table,  which indicates whether states used 911 fees or charges for other  purposes. In 2012, FCC used four ways of coding whether states used  funds for other purposes\u2014\u201dYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cNo information,\u201d and \u201cDNP\u201d  (defined in FCC\u2019s report as \u201cdid not provide\u201d). However, \u201cDNP\u201d was used  in three very different circumstances: when the state did not submit a  report to FCC, such as in Louisiana and the District of Columbia; when  the state did not provide an answer to the question of whether the state  used funds for other purposes; or when the state indicated that all or a  portion of the funds are controlled by local entities and that the state could  not be certain how the funds were used. As an example of this last case,  several states indicated that local entities control some expenditure  decisions, which in some cases received the \u201cDNP\u201d designation, but in  other cases received the designation \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cNo information.\u201d If FCC had  written guidelines for interpreting state responses, it could have ensured  more consistent characterization of state responses.", "According to FCC\u2019s Information Quality Guidelines\u2014which are meant to  ensure that all data FCC disseminates reflect a level of quality  commensurate with the nature of the information\u2014quality is  demonstrated through the incorporation of a methodological section or  appendix that describes, at a minimum, the design and methods used  during the creation, collection, and processing of the data, as well as the  compilation or analysis of the data in products including reports prepared   In its annual reports, FCC included a detailed description  for Congress.of its methodology for collecting responses from states. For example,  FCC describes how, in addition to the public notices, FCC sent letters to  the Office of the Governor of each state and territory and the Regional  Directors of the Bureau of Indian Affairs requesting the information sought  in the public notices. FCC sent second notice letters and placed calls to  those states and territories that had not responded. However, FCC has  not published its methodology for how the report\u2019s analysis was  conducted. In particular, FCC has not included in its annual report a  description of the decision rules used in determining whether a state used  911 funds for other purposes. As stated in the previous section, FCC  does not have an internal written procedures manual or similar document  that describes how the content of a state\u2019s responses are interpreted or  coded. If FCC had one, it could use information from that coding manual  to explain its analysis and decision rules in its annual report.", "The lack of a description of the methodology for FCC\u2019s analysis is  particularly problematic as FCC officials told us that FCC changed its  method of making analysis decisions in its most recent report. FCC  officials stated that based on their experience with the first three  information collections and associated reports, FCC revised the questions  included in their 2012 information request. Specifically, one question was  modified to elicit specific information on the programs and activities for  which 911 funds were used along with how those programs and activities  support 911. According to FCC officials, this modification enabled FCC to  classify states\u2019 responses with greater accuracy. While FCC\u2019s 2012 report  clearly states that modifications were made to the questions and each  annual report includes the questions included in that year\u2019s information  request, the effects of these changes are not clear to the reader. In some  cases, this methodological change resulted in differing characterizations  from reports issued in 2011 to 2012, and it is not clear to the reader  whether states no longer characterized as having used funds for other  purposes had changed their practices of using funds for other purposes  or whether the different characterization was a result of FCC\u2019s change in  methodology. For example, in FCC\u2019s 2011 report, FCC identified both  Virginia and West Virginia as states that had used 911 funds for other  purposes. However, based on the additional information provided by  these states in 2012, FCC determined that Virginia and West Virginia  spent 911 funds in accordance with their respective state statutes  governing 911 funding and therefore were not identified as using funds for  other purposes. According to FCC officials, in gathering information for  2012, FCC asked additional questions to identify the specific uses of  911/E911 funds that were authorized under state law. They also  characterized a state as using E911 funds for purposes other than E911  only if the state reported that is used 911/E911 funds for purposes not  designated by the state\u2019s funding statute. Because FCC has not  published its methodology for analysis and decision rules for determining  whether a state used 911 funds for other purposes and further never  explicitly stated that a different method was used in 2012, this lack of  disclosure could lead report users to misinterpret the results shown in the  report. In particular, although it would appear that as time has passed,  fewer states were using funds for other purposes, at least some of this  difference is attributable to FCC\u2019s change of methodology.", "We have previously reported that results-oriented organizations make  sure that the information they collect are sufficiently complete and  accurate to support decision making. FCC officials stated that seeking  narrative responses from each state and publishing those responses  demonstrate transparency. However, several pages of individual and  varied responses may have limited usefulness to decision makers, who  may need high-level descriptions and aggregated information.  Furthermore, FCC is missing an opportunity to analyze funding trends  because its method of asking questions does not result in answers that  can be readily tracked from year to year. FCC is also missing an  opportunity to provide more detailed aggregated information in its  reports\u2014such as amounts of fees, services covered, and total amount of  funds collected\u2014that would be helpful to decision makers who are trying  to understand current methods of financing 911.

As such, PSAP calls  currently cannot be transferred so PSAPs have limited means to act as  back-up for one another when operations in one part of the country  become overloaded or shut down because of circumstances such as  hurricane evacuations or wildfires, according to DOT\u2019s Research and  Innovative Technology Administration. With respect to regulatory  challenges, current laws and regulations in most states do not effectively  enable the implementation of new technologies or allow the level of  coordination and partnerships among government and public safety  stakeholders, service and equipment providers, PSAPs, and 911  authorities that is necessary to implement IP-enabled 911 systems,  according to NHTSA.

The project  includes connecting 21 PSAPs through an Emergency Service IP  Network, creating identical data centers in 2 counties, and obtaining  NG911 equipment and information for a 15-county region in southern  Illinois. Similarly, the state of Texas is conducting an NG911 project that  is partially funded with federal grants from NHTSA and NTIA.

For  NG911 to avoid the slow start that wireless E911 experienced, networks  will need to be formed that will require regulatory changes at multiple  levels of government. Although NG911 is still in nascent form, FCC, DOT,  and others in the federal government are working together to conduct the  research and planning needed to provide the foundation for states to  address the technology, regulatory, and funding challenges to implement  NG911 more efficiently than they implemented E911. Notably, FCC\u2019s  March 2013 report identified potential steps for Congress to take to create  a legal and regulatory environment that will assist states, PSAPs, service  providers and other stakeholders in accelerating the nationwide transition  from legacy 911 to NG911.
