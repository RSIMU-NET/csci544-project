Through the federal-state partnership established under the CZMA, GAO found that NOAA has taken actions, including:", "Financial incentives. NOAA has targeted some of its financial incentives for activities aimed at addressing the impacts of climate change. For example, NOAA designated coastal hazards\u2014physical threats to life and property, such as sea level rise\u2014as the focus of CZMA competitive grants. States competed for a total of $1.5 million in grants in fiscal year 2016. Officials from all 25 state programs that GAO interviewed said funding provided by NOAA has been critical for planning projects related to ecosystem resilience, but also expressed concern that the amount of funding is insufficient to address states' needs in implementing projects. For instance, officials from 15 state programs further indicated that coastal zone management grants have been a primary source of funding from NOAA, but that they generally cannot be used to purchase land or for construction projects, activities states identified as important for improving coastal resilience.", "Technical assistance. NOAA has provided assistance largely through technical information, guidance, and training to help states better understand and address the potential impacts of climate change on marine coastal ecosystems. For example, NOAA helped develop an interactive digital tool to simulate different sea level rise scenarios. NOAA also developed guidance to help identify ways ecosystems may be used to enhance the resilience of coastal areas, such as using natural shorelines to buffer the effects of erosion. In addition, NOAA developed training on topics such assessing the vulnerability of coastal areas. State managers GAO interviewed had generally positive views of the technical assistance provided by NOAA. For example, officials from all 25 state programs said that the technical information NOAA provides has generally helped them incorporate climate information into their state programs.", "National Estuarine Research Reserve System. NOAA, in partnership with coastal states, manages 25 marine-based estuary reserves, in part, to study natural and man-made changes to estuaries (bodies of water usually found where rivers meet the sea), including the potential impacts of climate change. For example, in 2014, one state used its research reserve to study and map marsh migration patterns across the state's coastline to determine how these ecosystems may respond to rising sea levels.

This assessment further indicated  that less acute effects from changes in the climate, including sea level  rise, could also have significant long-term impacts on the people and  property along marine coastal states. In 2013, we concluded that the  increasing number and severity of weather-related events are a key  source of fiscal exposure for the federal government. For example, in  2013, Congress appropriated about $50 billion for expenses related to the  consequences of Superstorm Sandy, which caused significant damage to  hundreds of thousands of homes and properties in mid-Atlantic and  northeastern coastal states. Limiting the federal government\u2019s fiscal  exposure by better managing climate change risks has been on our high  risk list since 2013, in part, because of concerns about the increasing  costs of disaster response and recovery efforts.", "Coastal ecosystems provide a variety of environmental and economic  benefits, including protecting shorelines from erosion and inundation,  reducing flood and storm damage, providing habitat for commercially and  recreationally important species, and offering opportunities for recreation  and commerce.

Recognizing this role, in October 2014, the Executive Office of  the President released the Priority Agenda: Enhancing the Climate  Resilience of America\u2019s Natural Resources, which identified enhancing  ecosystem resilience, among other things, as a national priority for federal  agencies in managing the effects of climate change. The priority agenda  defined \u201cresilience\u201d as the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to  changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from  disruptions.", "Enhancing resilience also means reducing potential future losses rather  than waiting for an event to occur and paying for recovery afterward, as  we found in 2013. Enhancing resilience may create additional up-front  costs, but it may also reduce potential future damages from climate- related events that could otherwise constrain federal programs.

For example, climate scientists have indicated high  confidence that climate change will increase the frequency and intensity  of coastal storms, but the exact location and timing of these events is  unknown. Similarly, the effects of sea level rise are expected to vary  considerably from region to region and over a range of temporal scales,  according to the assessment.", "The 2014 National Climate Assessment further indicated that marine  coastal ecosystems are dynamic and sensitive to small changes in the  environment, including warming air and ocean temperatures and sea- level rise. Climate change may cause shifts in species\u2019 distributions and  ranges along coasts that may impact ecosystem character and  functioning, according to the assessment. For example, eel grass, one  type of submerged vegetation that provides coastal protection from storm  surges, may die if water temperatures exceed its maximum tolerance  level. Ecosystems along the coast are also vulnerable to climate change  because many have been altered by human stresses, and climate change  will likely result in further reduction or loss of the services that these  ecosystems provide, according to the assessment.", "The federal government has a limited role in project-level planning central  to helping increase the resiliency of marine coastal ecosystems to climate  change because state and local governments are primarily responsible  for managing their coastlines. However, the federal government plays a  critical role in supporting state government efforts to increase resiliency to  climate change, according to the President\u2019s State, Local, and Tribal  Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. The  federal role includes ensuring that federal policies and programs factor in  potential risks from climate change, providing financial incentives for  enhancing resilience, and providing information and assistance to help  states and others better understand and prepare for climate risks.", "NOAA, as a key federal agency whose mission is, in part, to manage and  conserve marine coastal ecosystems, has identified enhancing  ecosystem resilience as an important part of its broader goal of building  community resilience. NOAA works toward this goal, in part, through its  administration of the CZMA. Specifically, NOAA\u2019s Office for Coastal  Management administers the National Coastal Zone Management  Program. To participate, states are to submit comprehensive  descriptions of their coastal zone management programs\u2014approved by  states\u2019 governors\u2014to NOAA for review and approval. As specified in the  act, states are to meet the following requirements, among others, to  receive NOAA\u2019s approval for their state programs: designate coastal zone boundaries that will be subject to state define what constitutes permissible land and water use in coastal propose an organizational structure for implementing the state  program, including the responsibilities of and relationships among  local, state, regional, and interstate agencies; and demonstrate sufficient legal authorities for the management of the  coastal zone in accordance with the program, which includes  administering land and water use regulations to control development  to ensure compliance with the program and resolve conflicts among  competing uses in coastal zones.", "The act provides the states flexibility to design programs that best  address states\u2019 unique coastal challenges, laws, and regulations, and  participating states have taken various approaches to developing and  carrying out their programs. States\u2019 specific activities also vary, with some  states focusing on permitting, mitigation, and enforcement activities, and  other states focusing on providing technical and financial assistance to  local governments and nonprofits for local coastal protection and  management projects. If states make changes to their programs, such as  changes to their coastal zone boundaries, enforceable policies, or  organizational structures, states are to submit those changes to NOAA for  review and approval. NOAA officials are responsible for, among other  things, approving state programs and any program changes;  administering federal funding to the states; and providing technical  assistance to states, such as on the development of 5-year coastal zone  enhancement assessment and strategy reports that identify states\u2019 priority  needs and projects.", "One primary incentive to encourage states to develop coastal zone  management programs and participate in the National Coastal Zone  Management Program is states\u2019 eligibility to receive federal grants from  NOAA to support the implementation and management of their programs.  Specifically, NOAA provides two primary types of National Coastal Zone  Management Program grants to participating states:", "Coastal zone management grants support the administration and  management of state programs and require states to match federal  contributions.", "Coastal zone enhancement grants support improvements in state  programs in specified enhancement areas. Coastal zone  enhancement grants do not require state matching funds and include  both formula and competitive grants for projects of special merit. To  be eligible for coastal zone enhancement grants, state coastal zone  management programs are to develop an assessment of each of nine  enhancement areas for their state every 5 years, including those  areas that are a priority for the state. In conjunction with the  assessment, state programs are to also develop a strategy for  addressing the high priority needs for program enhancement within  one or more enhancement area(s). NOAA reviews and approves  this \u201cassessment and strategy\u201d document for each state and, if  approved, states are eligible for formula grants and may also apply  annually for competitive grants.", "In fiscal year 2016, a total of almost $50 million was allocated to the 22  participating marine coastal states for these two types of grants. By  statute, a maximum of $10 million of the amount appropriated for CZMA  management grants may be used for the coastal zone enhancement  formula and competitive grants. States received a maximum of  approximately $0.9 to $2.7 million per state for the two types of grants  under the National Coastal Zone Management Program in fiscal year  2016. In addition, the CZMA authorizes NOAA to provide technical  assistance, including by entering into financial agreements, to support the  development and implementation of state coastal zone management  program enhancements.", "The CZMA also established the National Estuarine Research Reserve  System\u2014a network of 28 coastal estuary reserves (25 of which are  located in marine coastal states) managed through a state-federal  partnership between NOAA and coastal states. NOAA provides financial  assistance, coordination, national guidance for program implementation,  and technical assistance, and coastal states are responsible for  managing reserve resources and staff, providing matching funds, and  implementing programs locally. The reserve system was established on  the principle that long-term protection of representative estuaries provides  stable platforms for research and education and the application of  management practices that will benefit the nation\u2019s estuaries and coasts,  according to its 2011-16 strategic plan.", "State coastal zone managers may take various actions to manage marine  coastal ecosystems and help increase their resilience to the potential  effects of climate change. For example, managers may target land  acquisition and conservation activities to areas of higher ground adjacent  to coastal wetlands, mangroves, and other natural habitats to allow the  habitats to migrate so they do not disappear if sea levels rise. In addition,  state coastal zone managers may remove physical barriers, such as  concrete structures, that prevent beach migration over time in favor of  installing living shorelines along areas with a low impact from waves.   Living shorelines are natural habitats, or a combination of natural habitat  and manmade elements, put in place along coastal shorelines to reduce  shoreline erosion. Management decisions about what actions may be  appropriate for a specific area often depend upon detailed information  about the current and expected future conditions of the area in question,  such as shoreline elevation data, expected rates of sea level rise, and  how the ecosystem may be expected to respond to future environmental  changes. As we concluded in our 2009 report on climate change and  strategic federal planning, new approaches may be needed to match new  realities, and old ways of doing business\u2014such as making decisions  based on the assumed continuation of past climate conditions\u2014may not  work in a world affected by climate change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Is Taking a Variety of Actions to Support States\u2019 Efforts to Enhance Marine Coastal Ecosystem Resilience, and States Have Generally Positive Views of NOAA\u2019s Actions", "paragraphs": ["NOAA is taking a variety of actions under the CZMA to support states\u2019  efforts to make their marine coastal ecosystems more resilient to climate  change, and states generally view NOAA\u2019s actions as positive steps.

In so doing, NOAA indicated that coastal zone enhancement  competitive grants would be focused on projects that will further support  approved state strategies related to this enhancement area. NOAA also  increased the total amount available for these competitive grants from $1  million in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 to $1.5 million for fiscal year 2016.  NOAA officials said that many of the applications they received in 2015  and 2016 were for projects that were intended to directly or indirectly  address climate risks and enhance the resilience of states\u2019 coastal  ecosystems. For example, in 2015, NOAA awarded one grant for about  $200,000 to a state to undertake a mapping study to identify vulnerable  habitats along its coastline and use the results of the study to prioritize  those habitats considered most vulnerable to climate change for the  state\u2019s restoration and resilience efforts.", "In addition, starting in fiscal year 2015, NOAA initiated a Regional Coastal  Resilience Grant Program to fund projects that focus on regional  approaches to helping coastal communities address vulnerabilities to  extreme weather events, climate hazards, and changing ocean conditions  using resilience strategies. State and local governments, nonprofit  organizations, and others are eligible to apply for these grants. NOAA  awarded six applicants grants totaling $4.5 million in each of fiscal years  2015 and 2016, according to NOAA officials. Projects eligible for grants  may be targeted to a variety of efforts that support resilience, including  actions focused on marine coastal ecosystem resilience. For example, in  2016, NOAA awarded one grant for nearly $900,000 to a regional  partnership of state governments, nonprofit organizations, and academia  involved in a project aimed at mitigating the impacts of weather events on  natural resources, among other things. Specifically, the project intends to  assess potential coastal storm impacts and increase the implementation  of nature-based infrastructure approaches to buffer the effects of coastal  storms, among other things.", "Officials from all 25 state coastal zone management programs said that  financial assistance provided by NOAA has been critical for planning  projects designed to enhance marine coastal ecosystem resilience and  reduce the potential impacts of climate change. Officials from nearly all  state coastal zone management programs expressed concern, however,  that the amount of financial assistance available is insufficient to address  states\u2019 needs in implementing projects. For example, officials from 15 of  the 25 state programs said that coastal zone management grants have  been the primary source of funding from NOAA that they have used for  efforts related to ecosystem resilience. However, these grants generally  cannot be used to purchase land or for construction projects\u2014activities  the states identified as important for improving the resilience of their  coastlines. In addition, officials from 20 of the 25 state programs said  that they have had to leverage funds from multiple sources, such as state  funds, nonprofit organizations, or other federal agencies, to implement  projects aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience. NOAA officials agreed  that there is a high demand for funding for these types of projects, noting,  for example, that the Regional Coastal Resilience Grant Program  received 132 qualified applications requesting a total of $105 million  during its first application period in fiscal year 2015, when a total of $4.5  million was available for the grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Through its administration of the National Coastal Zone Management  Program, NOAA has also provided technical assistance to coastal states  to help them understand and address the potential impacts of climate  change on marine coastal ecosystems.

For instance, through their reviews of states\u2019 5-year coastal  zone enhancement assessment and strategy reports, NOAA officials said  they identify information needs and priorities of state coastal zone  management programs. For example, NOAA officials said they found that  states had a common interest in knowing more about valuing the  economic benefits of coastal ecosystems, such as estimating the financial  benefit that ecosystems provide for flood control. As a result, NOAA  officials said they presented information on this topic at a 2016 annual  meeting with state coastal zone managers. This type of information can  help states develop cost-benefit analyses that may more accurately  capture the value of services provided by coastal ecosystems\u2014as  opposed to man-made infrastructure such as seawalls and levees\u2014when  states are exploring options for coastal projects, according to the officials.  NOAA officials also said they share the states\u2019 needs and priorities that  they identify with other NOAA offices, as well as with external partners  such as other federal agencies and nonprofit organizations, to increase  the awareness of state program needs and priorities and facilitate  coordination and the alignment of resources across programs.", "NOAA provides a wide range of technical assistance in the form of  technical information, guidance, and training related to better  understanding and addressing the potential impacts of climate change on  marine coastal ecosystems, including:", "Technical information. NOAA has provided various types of  technical information to states to help them understand and  incorporate climate information into their state coastal zone  management programs. For example, in 2007, in partnership with  nonprofit entities, NOAA helped develop a publically available  repository of information\u2014called the Digital Coast\u2014to help state  coastal zone managers and others analyze potential climate risks and  determine how to address those risks. The Digital Coast provides  information and tools on such topics as climate models and statistical  analyses that coastal managers can use to incorporate climate  information into their management activities. For instance, the Digital  Coast contains an interactive tool that allows users to estimate sea  level rise and simulate different sea level rise scenarios using  elevation and surface data to help identify coastal areas that may be  affected by rising sea levels in a changing climate. Coastal zone  managers from one state said they used this tool to determine the  vulnerability of their state\u2019s shoreline to potential sea level rise, which  has helped them better target financial assistance to areas they  identified as most vulnerable.", "Officials from all 25 state coastal zone management programs said  that the technical information NOAA provides has generally helped  them incorporate climate information into their state programs.  However, officials from 20 of the 25 state programs said they often  need more local or site-specific information for planning and  implementing projects. The information NOAA provides is mostly at a  national or regional scale, given staffing and resource levels,  according to NOAA officials. These officials added that data available  through the Digital Coast may be used as a starting point for coastal  managers to modify and build in more site-specific elements. For  example, one state customized a Digital Coast tool for estimating sea  level rise to create a map outlining potential coastal flooding areas  under various sea level rise scenarios at a site-specific scale within its  state.", "Guidance. NOAA has developed several guidance documents to help  state coastal zone managers and others identify specific ways marine  coastal ecosystems may be used to help withstand the potential  impacts of climate change and enhance the resilience of coastal  areas. For example, in 2015, NOAA developed its Guidance for  Considering the Use of Living Shorelines to provide information on  how to use natural ecosystems, such as oyster reefs or marshes, to  reduce coastal erosion caused by intense storms, wave erosion, or  sea level rise. In addition, in 2016, NOAA issued a Guide for  Considering Climate Change in Coastal Conservation. The guide  provides coastal managers a step-by-step approach to considering  climate change in coastal conservation planning, with links to relevant  tools, information, and other resources.", "Officials from 19 of the 25 state coastal zone management programs  said NOAA\u2019s guidance was generally useful, but officials from 14 of  these programs said that NOAA\u2019s guidance alone is not sufficient to  plan or implement actions that enhance ecosystem resilience and  address climate change risks. Officials from one state, for example,  said that NOAA\u2019s guidance on using living shorelines is helpful for  general purposes such as educating the public on the benefits of this  technique, but that the guidance does not cover all shoreline types,  such as gravel beaches, exposed rocky shores, or tidal flats. NOAA  officials said that using living shorelines as a strategy to enhance  coastal resilience is a relatively new technique, and as coastal  managers gain more experience with its use on different types of  shorelines, NOAA plans to incorporate this information into the  assistance it provides to coastal states. NOAA officials also said that  the guidance was not intended to be a comprehensive source of  technical information on living shoreline techniques, but rather to  provide information on key technical and policy considerations in  planning and designing shoreline management projects.", "Training. NOAA has developed instructor-led and online training on  topics such as the use of marine coastal ecosystems for improving  community resilience and understanding how to use the tools found in  the Digital Coast as a way to plan for and take action to address the  potential impacts of climate change. For example, from 2014 to 2016,  NOAA provided training to over 250 state coastal zone managers and  other state practitioners across the country on identifying various  types of flooding in coastal areas and methods for mapping potential  flooding scenarios. Similarly, during the same time period, NOAA  officials said they offered 11 3-day climate adaptation workshops  across the country that covered a variety of climate-related topics  including methods for assessing the vulnerability of coastal areas and  options for using ecosystems, such as wetlands, to provide flood  protection.", "Officials from 16 of the 25 state coastal zone management programs  told us that they viewed the training provided by NOAA on topics  related to climate change and ecosystem resilience as helpful. NOAA  officials said they take steps to ensure their training topics meet  states\u2019 needs by discussing potential training topics with state coastal  zone managers before developing courses and by collecting  participant feedback after training courses are provided.
