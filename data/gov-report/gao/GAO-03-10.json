Resource distribution to VHA's health care networks is mostly formulaic, determined primarily by the distribution of the veterans being served. VHA offices involved in budget formulation and strategic planning provide guidance to health care networks in developing their financial and strategic plans. Integrating performance information into resource allocation decisions is apparent at the health care network level during budget execution. Health care network managers told us that they use an internal data system as a tool to decide how to allocate resources to their facilities and programs. They also use various communication methods to share information on performance measures, and are held responsible for meeting those measures. Network managers provided specific examples where performance information influenced their resource allocation decisions. For example, one performance target specifies that all diabetic veterans are expected to receive retinal eye exams. An ophthalmologist must interpret the results of such an exam; however, most outpatient clinics do not have the resources to maintain an ophthalmologist on staff. One network invested in machines that record test results and transmit them to an ophthalmologist at another location, thereby increasing the network's capacity for meeting this performance target. While budget and performance integration has improved, VHA managers still face additional challenges. VHA's budgeting and planning processes are not directly linked, but VHA officials noted that steps are being taken to better integrate them. Also, VHA does not use the most complete information available when making resource allocation decisions to its health care networks, so the link between resources and results could be improved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the past decade, the Congress and the executive branch have  sought to improve federal management and instill a greater focus on  results. Through enactment of a number of major management reforms, the  Congress has created a statutory framework with the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) as its centerpiece. One of  GPRA\u2019s major purposes is to encourage a closer and clearer linkage  between planning, performance\u2014i.e., results\u2014and the budget process.  Each administration takes a slightly different approach to implementing  results management.  Improving the integration of budget and performance  is a high priority initiative included in the President\u2019s Management Agenda.  A central piece of that is the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB\u2019s)  new diagnostic tool, the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART).  PART is  designed to provide a consistent approach to reviewing program design,  planning, and goals development as well as program management and  results.  OMB expects to use PART assessments in considering department  and agency budget submissions for the fiscal year 2004 President\u2019s Budget  request to the Congress.", "In a number of different reports to the Congress, GAO has examined  different aspects of the resources-to-results linkage.  A series of three  reports described agencies\u2019 progress over a 4-year period in linking  performance plans, budgets, and, in the most recent report, financial  statements.  We found that between fiscal years 1999 and 2002, agencies  made significant progress in showing a direct link between expected  performance and requested program activity funding levels through  structural changes or cross-walks\u2014the first step in defining the  performance consequences of budgetary decisions. We concluded that  additional effort was needed to more clearly describe the relationship  between performance expectations, requested funding, and consumed  resources.  Furthermore, we said that the uneven extent and pace of  developing these relationships were reflective of mission complexity and  differences in operating environments across the government.  Finally, we  observed that describing the planned and actual use of resources in terms  of measurable results was an essential long-term effort that would take  time, and adaptation on the part of all agencies.", "In another approach to defining performance and resource integration, we  developed a framework of budget practices that we believe can contribute  to an agency\u2019s capacity to manage for results. We viewed these practices as  desirable dimensions of budgeting that could be implemented in many  different ways to reflect the characteristics and circumstances of a  particular agency. Both our assessments of performance and budget  account alignments and the framework of budget practices have led to the  next phase of work and the subject of this report.  This report\u2014one of a  group of three\u2014looks at the resources-to-results link from the perspective  of agency managers charged with making the linkage happen.", "The objectives of this report on the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),  and its two companion studies on the Administration for Children and  Families and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, are to document what  managers in these three agencies considered successful efforts at creating  linkages between planning and performance information to influence  resource choices and the challenges they face in doing so.  We neither  evaluated their choices nor critiqued their processes.  Instead, we asked  managers to describe when and how planning and performance  information was included in the budget cycle, to explain what strategies  were used and why, and to provide evidence that there was a related  programmatic effect.  A third purpose was to show that there are multiple  ways to get at these linkages, and that there can be successful applications  even if progress in budget and performance integration is uneven.", "Budgeting is and will remain an exercise in political choice, in which  performance can be one, but not necessarily the only, factor underlying  decisions.  However, efforts to infuse performance information into  resource allocation decisions can more explicitly inform budget  discussions and focus them\u2014both in the Congress and in agencies\u2014on  expected results, rather than on inputs.

Headed by  the Under Secretary for Health, VHA employed approximately 180,000  health care professionals to serve about 4.3 million veterans in fiscal year  2002.  VHA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 budget included $21.3 billion in discretionary  funds from the VA/HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development)  appropriations act and an additional $142 million from an emergency  supplemental enacted in August 2002.", "VHA developed its six strategic goals to support VA\u2019s GPRA goals.  These  strategic goals are as follows:   put quality first until first in quality;  provide easy access to medical knowledge, expertise, and care;  enhance, preserve, and restore patient function;  exceed patients\u2019 expectations;  maximize resource use to benefit veterans; and  build healthy communities.", "VHA\u2019s strategic planning document describes strategies to show how each  goal will be met.  The administration then develops performance measures  to support the strategies identified.", "VHA is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and has 21 Veteran Integrated  Service Networks (networks) located throughout the country.  The  networks are the basic budgetary and decision-making units of VA\u2019s health  care system.  They have responsibility for making a wide range of decisions  about health care delivery options, including contracting with private  providers for health care services and generating revenue by selling excess  services.  A network director, who reports to the Deputy Under Secretary  for Health for Operations and Management, heads each network.  This  organization is illustrated in figure 1, with offices we talked to regarding  VHA\u2019s budget and planning processes shaded.", "The VHA Office of Quality and Performance develops and recommends  performance measures (mentioned above) to the Under Secretary for  Health.  A Performance Management Work Group, comprised of a variety  of VHA staff with different subject matter expertise, provides overall  guidance with regard to the measures and helps to prioritize them.  VHA\u2019s  Office of Policy and Planning prepares VHA\u2019s contribution to VA\u2019s 5-year  Strategic Plan, as well as the Network Strategic Planning Guidance, which  is used by networks to prepare their strategic planning documents.

In 1995, the 172 independent VA Medical  Centers were reorganized into 22 networks, headed by network directors.   Network directors are accountable for a variety of functions, such as  contracting, budgeting, and planning for the medical facilities within their  purview.  Under this reorganization, VHA management anticipated that  network directors could manage the distribution of the networks\u2019  resources to maximize the advantages to veterans within their service  areas.  Furthermore, the administration expected to perform less  operational decision making and oversight at the central office level.  Along  with the decentralization, VHA shifted its service delivery focus from  inpatient hospital care to outpatient care; between fiscal years 1995 and  2001, the average number of hospital inpatients declined from 31,137 per  day to 13,452 per day.

For the fiscal year 2004  budget and beyond, officials expected to use the actuarial projections  to calculate the entire workload, not just the potential increase.  We  made changes in our report language to reflect this process. 2. VA noted that it does not include all Priority 7 veterans in its VERA  calculations because it does not want to provide financial incentives  that encourage network managers to provide care to Priority 7 veterans  at the expense of higher-priority veterans.  As we recommended in our  February 2002 report, networks with a disproportionately large  number of Priority 7 veterans already have fewer resources under  VERA to treat higher-priority veterans on a per-patient basis.  To  remedy this problem, we recommended that VA align measures of  workload with actual workload served, regardless of veteran priority  group.  Doing so will help provide comparable resources for  comparable workload.  Thus, we maintain that complete information  allows agencies to better consider the relative priorities of programs  and activities. 3. VA also noted that the funds it received under the Emergency  Supplemental appropriation were not intended for homeland security- related activities.  We changed our report language appropriately.", "VA\u2019s second enclosure was a report that describes the actuarial model it  uses to project the demand for health services.  This report was prepared  for the Senate Appropriations Committee, in response to a congressional  mandate identified in S. Rpt. 107-156.  During our fieldwork, we were told  that there was no documentation available regarding this model.  We  received the documentation when the draft report was sent for agency  comment and therefore did not review the model and its ability to project  VA\u2019s workload.", "The third enclosure focuses on VA\u2019s budget account restructuring for its  fiscal year 2004 budget submission.  VA notes that this structure will allow  it to more readily determine the full cost of each of VA\u2019s programs and make  resource decisions based on programs and their results rather than on  other factors.  We did not review this new structure or its ability to more  effectively link resources with results since the outcome will not be  available until the administration\u2019s budget proposal is released in early  2003.", "As agreed with your office, we will distribute copies of this report to the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, appropriate congressional committees, and  other interested parties.
