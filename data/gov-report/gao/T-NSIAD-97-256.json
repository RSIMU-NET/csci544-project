It incorporates features such as the elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers. NAFTA also supports the objective of locking in Mexico\u2019s self-initiated, market-oriented reforms. By removing barriers to the efficient allocation of economic resources, NAFTA was projected to generate overall, long-run economic gains for member countries\u2014modest for the United States and Canada, and greater for Mexico. For the United States, this is due to the relatively small size of Mexico\u2019s economy and because many Mexican exports to the United States were already subject to low or no duties. Under NAFTA, intra-industry trade and coproduction of goods across the borders were expected to increase, enhancing specialization and raising productivity. Although a substantial majority of economic studies concluded that only modest economic and employment effects were likely, NAFTA generated a heated public debate before the agreement\u2019s passage by Congress in 1993. NAFTA critics asserted that up to 1 million U.S. jobs would be lost, while the President projected that the agreement would generate 200,000 U.S. jobs.", "NAFTA also included procedures first to avoid, and then to resolve, disputes between parties to the agreement.

(See apps. I-III.) A significant factor influencing trade was the severe 1994-95 Mexican financial crisis.This growth in total trade has been accompanied by an increase in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit with its NAFTA partners, from $8.6 billion to $34 billion, as import growth outpaced export growth. U.S. investment in Mexico has grown since NAFTA\u2019s implementation.

ITC concluded that NAFTA has significantly affected the aggregate levels of U.S. trade with Mexico, but not with Canada.", "In its sectoral analyses, ITC found changes in trade, employment, and earnings that were due to NAFTA in a limited number of sectors. Among the nearly 200 sectors whose trade ITC modeled, U.S. exports to Mexico increased significantly in 13 sectors due to NAFTA, while no sector showed decreased exports to Mexico due to NAFTA. U.S. imports from Mexico increased significantly in 16 sectors after the effects of other influencing factors were taken into account, while U.S. imports from Mexico decreased significantly in 7 sectors due to NAFTA. In an econometric analysis of 120 industrial sectors, ITC found that 29 industries had changes in hourly earnings and employment levels. Among these 29 sectors, hours worked most often increased due to NAFTA, while hourly earnings were more often found to decrease. In their qualitative sectoral analysis, ITC industry experts found that employment declined due to NAFTA in 2 out of 68 sectors: the apparel and women\u2019s non-athletic footwear sectors.

They found that NAFTA has on average boosted export growth by about 7 percentage points each year since implementation, for a cumulative expansion of exports of about $5 billion through 1995. U.S. import growth from Mexico on average has been about 2 percentage points greater each year, for a cumulative impact of about $1.8 billion in additional imports. The DRI assessment found larger trade effects than the Federal Reserve study. The DRI study used a model of the Mexican economy to evaluate NAFTA\u2019s impact on bilateral trade with the United States, but excluded the petroleum sector. It found that in 1996, NAFTA increased U.S. exports to Mexico by $12 billion and imports from Mexico by $5 billion. The estimated trade impacts were then applied to a DRI macroeconomic model of the U.S. economy to simulate their impact on U.S. GDP and investment.

In recognition of the anticipated dislocation of some workers, the NAFTA Implementation Act established the NAFTA-TAA program in 1994. The program was designed to assist workers in companies affected by U.S. imports from Mexico or Canada or by shifts in U.S. production to either of those countries. The program is authorized to continue until September 30, 1998. NAFTA-TAA benefits include basic readjustment services; employment services; training; job search allowances; relocation allowances; and the feature that most distinguishes the program from basic unemployment insurance, income support for up to 52 weeks after exhaustion of unemployment insurance when enrolled in training.", "As of September 4, 1997, NAFTA-TAA certifications (verification of potential job losses since NAFTA\u2019s implementation) have been issued for 1,206 worker groups in firms located in 48 states. Department of Labor statistics indicate that 142,884 workers have been certified as eligible for NAFTA-TAA benefits due to (1) increased imports from Canada or Mexico or (2) a shift in U.S. production to Canada or Mexico. Of these certifications, 623 were based on a shift of production to Canada or Mexico, 380 were based on increased customer imports, 167 were based on increased company imports, and 36 were based on high and rising aggregate imports from Canada or Mexico. As shown in table 1, the top five sectors in terms of worker group certifications and the number of workers covered were apparel, electrical and electronic equipment, lumber and wood products, fabricated metal products, and industrial/commercial machinery, and computer equipment. The top 10 states with NAFTA-TAA workers covered by certifications were Texas (12,797), Pennsylvania (12,788), North Carolina (12,001), New York (11,924), California (7,773), Georgia (6,556), Indiana (6,077), Tennessee (5,786), Arkansas (5,397), and New Jersey (4,788).", "Because of the intense interest in NAFTA\u2019s impact on U.S. labor and the difficulty in calculating such impact, analysts have used NAFTA-TAA data as a proxy for job dislocations attributable to NAFTA. NAFTA-TAA certifications are not an accurate measure of jobs lost due to NAFTA, however, because certifications are likely to either underrepresent or overrepresent the actual number of jobs affected. On the one hand, NAFTA-TAA certifications are not required to be caused by, or linked to, NAFTA\u2014they can be due to general trade effects between the United States and Canada or Mexico. In addition, NAFTA certifications represent potential job losses, not the actual number of jobs lost. These factors could potentially lead to the NAFTA-TAA figures being overstated. On the other hand, not all categories of workers potentially affected are covered by the program (for example, some services workers). Additionally, some researchers have questioned whether employees of small, nonunionized firms are fully aware of program benefits and are thus not being served by the program. Further, workers may opt to apply for other programs, particularly given the strict training requirement for NAFTA-TAA. These factors could potentially lead to understatement. While NAFTA-TAA is fully operational, little evaluation has been done of how effectively the program serves to provide retraining and adjustment assistance to affected workers.", "The NAFTA implementing legislation established an additional program to deal with job dislocation effects from NAFTA: the U.S. Community Adjustment and Investment Program under the North American Development Bank. The program was designed to provide loans and loan guarantees (up to $22.5 million, according to authorizing legislation) to businesses seeking to locate or expand existing operations in communities with job losses caused by NAFTA. It was to be implemented by a program office in Los Angeles, two advisory committees, and an ombudsman appointed by the President. However, during the first 3-1/2 years of NAFTA, no loans were approved under the program. The Treasury Department issued its first designation of qualifying communities on August 1, 1997.

The ITC reports that NAFTA had no discernable impact on GDP after 3 years. The President\u2019s report finds that the short-term, transitory GDP gain from NAFTA was $13 billion in 1996, which represents less than 0.2 percent of U.S. GDP. Both estimates can be considered consistent with pre-NAFTA projections that the likely long-term impact of NAFTA would be a modest, positive increase in GDP\u2014between 0.02 and 0.5 percent.", "Several of the reports include conclusions about NAFTA\u2019s impact on U.S. aggregate employment. However, there is widespread consensus among many economists that aggregate employment is primarily determined by demographic conditions and macroeconomic factors such as monetary policy or interest rates. These economists would argue that trade agreements, such as NAFTA, primarily impact labor markets by shifting the composition of employment, potentially altering wages and income distribution, rather than affecting the overall level of employment in the country.", "The President\u2019s report as well as the EPI study rely on the job-multiplier approach to estimate the potential job impact of changes in the nation\u2019s trade balance. This approach is questioned by many economists for computing the employment impacts of trade. Furthermore, as an application of this methodology, the President\u2019s and EPI\u2019s analyses both exaggerate their estimates of NAFTA\u2019s job impact. For example, the President\u2019s report did not calculate any job losses associated with increased U.S. imports from Mexico due to NAFTA. Likewise, the job losses estimated by EPI are exaggerated, since some of the increase in U.S. imports from Mexico displaces imports from other nations rather than U.S. production.", "The impact of NAFTA on wages, low-skill workers, and income inequality is a controversial issue related to NAFTA\u2019s impact on the economy. ITC analyzed the impact of NAFTA on sectoral wages but did not attempt to determine the impact on low-skill workers or income inequality. The President\u2019s report largely recapped the ITC analysis. While the critique associated trade expansion with two decades of declining real wages, it did not analyze NAFTA\u2019s specific impact.", "An important methodological issue in analyzing NAFTA is how Mexico\u2019s 1994-95 financial crisis is treated. Estimates of NAFTA\u2019s impacts over its first 3 years differ greatly based on how the crisis is considered in the analysis. ITC\u2019s and the President\u2019s reports explicitly excluded its effects in their analysis, while the EPI study did not. While separating the crisis\u2019 impact from that of NAFTA has merit, events in Mexico leading to the financial crisis and the response to the crisis are intertwined with NAFTA. The financial crisis tested whether NAFTA succeeded in locking in Mexico\u2019s market-opening reforms. Mexican government officials noted that they met their NAFTA obligations rather than institute immediate tariff increases on U.S. products, as had occurred during a previous crisis in 1982. Furthermore, they undertook additional market-opening measures such as privatizing government-owned ports and railroads, according to Mexico\u2019s Trade and Commerce ministry."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms for Avoiding and Settling Disputes", "paragraphs": ["NAFTA contains mechanisms to help avoid trade disputes and settle them effectively when they do arise.

The official told us these guidelines are currently being revised.", "Concerns about an independent commission. A panel of experts and officials at the environmental commission we spoke with stressed the importance of improving the commission\u2019s independence and its ability to autonomously decide to undertake a study or a work program. Problems associated with this issue arose during the annual program and budget review process in which Mexican government officials withheld their support and approval for a project to study the environmental effects of NAFTA in certain sectors.
