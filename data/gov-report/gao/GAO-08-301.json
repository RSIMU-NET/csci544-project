The overall estimate comprises individual estimates for FEMA's assistance programs plus any related tasks assigned to other federal agencies (mission assignments) and FEMA administrative costs. The methods used to develop these estimates differ depending on program requirements including, in some cases, historical knowledge. FEMA officials told GAO that cost estimates are updated on a continuing basis. Decision makers need accurate information to make informed choices and learn from past experience. FEMA officials stated that by 3 months after a declaration estimates are usually within 10 percent of actual costs--which they defined as reasonable. GAO's analysis showed that decision makers did not have cost information within this 10 percent band until 6 months after the disaster declaration. These results cannot be generalized since this comparison could only be made for the 83 (24 percent) noncatastrophic natural disaster declarations for which final financial decisions had been made. Disaster coding issues also hamper FEMA's ability to learn from past experience. For example, in several instances the code for the incident type and the description of the disaster declaration did not match. Officials described several ways in which FEMA has learned from past disasters and improved its management of disaster-related resources. For example, FEMA uses a national average to predict costs for expected applicants for Individual Assistance. FEMA has also taken several actions to professionalize and expand the responsibilities of its disaster comptrollers. Nonetheless, FEMA could further learn from past experience by conducting sensitivity analyses to identify the marginal effect various factors have on causing fluctuations in its estimates. FEMA could improve its management of disaster-related resources by developing standard procedures for staff involved in entering and updating cost estimate data in its database."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The mission of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is to  lead the nation in mitigating, responding to, and recovering from major  domestic disasters, both natural and man-made, including terrorist  incidents.

More recently, the House  Committee on Appropriations expressed its concern about FEMA\u2019s ability  to manage resources in a manner that maximizes its ability to effectively  and efficiently deal with disasters. One aspect of particular concern to the  committee is how FEMA makes projections of funding needed in response  to any given disaster or to address future disasters.

Much like its FEMA predecessor, EP&R\u2019s mission was to help the  nation to prepare for, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from  disasters. While FEMA moved intact to DHS and most of its operations  became part of the EP&R Directorate, some of its functions were moved  to other organizations within DHS. In addition, functions that were  formerly part of other agencies were incorporated into the new EP&R  organization. After FEMA moved into DHS it was reorganized numerous  times. FEMA\u2019s preparedness functions were transferred over 2 years to  other entities in DHS, reducing its mission responsibilities. However,  recent legislation transferred many preparedness functions back to  FEMA. Today, once again, FEMA\u2019s charge is to lead the nation\u2019s efforts to  prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the  risk of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters,  including catastrophic incidents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disaster Declaration Process", "paragraphs": ["The Robert T.

Working with potential applicants following a disaster, program staff will  develop overall estimates for Public Assistance costs for each category of  emergency and permanent work, as authorized. Costs for Public  Assistance are shared between the federal and state governments. The  minimum federal share is 75 percent; the President can increase it to 90  percent when a disaster is so extraordinary that it meets or exceeds  certain per capita disaster costs, and to 100 percent for emergency work in  the initial days after the disaster irrespective of the per capita cost. Later,  the overall estimate is refined to reflect the estimates for individual  projects. The Public Assistance program uses many methods to develop  these estimates. Common methods include time and materials estimates  and competitively bid contracts. Public Assistance officials told us that  they rely heavily on the applicants\u2019 (state government agencies, local  governments, etc.) prior experience and historical knowledge of costs for  similar projects. For small projects (those estimated to cost less than  $59,700 in fiscal year 2007, adjusted annually), applicants can develop the  estimates themselves\u2014FEMA later validates their accuracy through a  sample\u2014or they can ask FEMA to develop the estimates. According to a  senior Public Assistance official, most applicants choose the latter option.  For large projects (estimated to cost more than $59,700 in fiscal year 2007,  adjusted annually), Public Assistance staff are responsible for working  with applicants to develop project worksheets, which include cost  estimates.", "According to senior program officials, Individual Assistance cost  estimates depend on individuals\u2019 needs. Using demographic, historical,  and other data specific to the affected area, as well as a national average  of costs, Individual Assistance staff project program costs. Depending on  the type of Individual Assistance provided, estimates are refined as  individuals register and qualify for certain types of assistance or as FEMA  and the state negotiate and agree upon costs. For housing and other needs  assistance\u2014such as disaster-related medical, dental, and funeral costs\u2014 estimates are based on the number of registrations FEMA receives, the  rate at which registrants are found eligible for assistance, and the type and  amount of assistance for which they qualify. For fiscal year 2007, federal  costs for housing assistance were limited to $28,600 per individual or  household. This amount is adjusted annually. Other needs assistance is a  cost-share program between the federal and state governments with the  federal share set at 75 percent of costs. Disaster unemployment assistance  is provided to those unemployed because of the disaster and not otherwise  covered by regular unemployment insurance programs. The amount  provided is based on state law for unemployment insurance in the state  where the disaster occurred. The state identifies any need for crisis  counseling services and FEMA works with the state mental health agency  to develop the estimate for that. Individual Assistance officials also told us  that although they set aside $5,000 for legal services FEMA is rarely billed  for these services.", "Hazard Mitigation Grant Program costs are formulaic and based on a  sliding scale. If a grantee (state or Indian tribal government) has a  standard mitigation plan, the amount FEMA provides to the grantee is a  statutorily set percentage of the estimated total amount provided under  the major assistance programs. This percentage ranges from 7.5 to 15  percent and is inversely related to the total; that is, when overall  assistance estimates are higher, the percentage available for Hazard  Mitigation grants decreases. Costs for Hazard Mitigation grants are shared  among the federal government, grantees, and applicants (e.g., local  governments), with a federal share of up to 75 percent of the grant  estimate. FEMA calculates and provides an estimate of Hazard Mitigation  funding to grantees 3, 6, and 12 months after a disaster declaration. The 6- month figure is a guaranteed minimum. At 12 months FEMA \u201clocks in\u201d  the amount of the 12-month estimate unless the 6-month minimum is  greater.", "Cost estimates for mission assignments are developed jointly by FEMA  staff and the performing agencies. Among the information included in a  mission assignment are a description of work to be performed, a  completion date for the work, an estimate of the dollar amount of the  work to be performed, and authorizing signatures. Mission assignments  may be issued for a variety of tasks, such as search and rescue missions or  debris removal, depending on the performing agencies\u2019 areas of expertise.  The signed mission assignment document provides the basis for obligating  FEMA\u2019s funds. When federal agencies are tasked with directly providing  emergency work and debris removal\u2014known as direct federal assistance  mission assignments\u2014costs are shared in the same manner as Public  Assistance grants.", "Estimates for FEMA\u2019s administrative costs are developed by financial  management staff in the joint field office.

However, as figure 2 illustrates, our analysis of the  83 noncatastrophic natural disaster declarations with actual or close to  actual costs shows that on average 3-month estimates were within 23  percent of actual costs and the median difference was around 14 percent.  Although the average (mean) difference did not achieve the 10 percent  band until approximately 1 year, the median difference reached this band  at 6 months.", "These results, however, cannot be generalized to disaster declarations for  which all financial decisions have not been made since we were only able  to compare estimates to actual costs for about one-quarter of the  noncatastrophic natural disasters declared from 2000 through 2006. From  2000 through 2006, there were 347 noncatastrophic natural disasters. As of  June 30, 2007, 83 of these (approximately 24 percent) had actual or near  actual costs to which we could compare estimates, as figure 3 illustrates.  Fourteen disasters were \u201creconciled,\u201d meaning that all projects were  completed and the FEMA-State Agreement was closed and 69 disasters  were \u201cclosed,\u201d meaning that financial decisions had been made but all  projects were not completed. The rest of the disasters (264) were  \u201cprogrammatically open,\u201d meaning financial decisions were not  completed, eligible work remains, and estimates are subject to change.

However, the  way FEMA records disaster information, specifically the way in which it  codes the disaster that occurred, inhibits rather than facilitates this  learning process. The combination of a single-code limit to describe  disasters, inconsistent coding of disasters with similar descriptions, and  overlapping codes means that the data are not easily used to inform  estimates and other analyses. Such issues mean that we could not  compare estimated and actual costs by type of disaster.

As shown in table 1,  there are 27 different incident codes in the DFSR database. We found  problems with these data. First, the coding of incident type did not always  match the description of the disaster. For example, 31 declarations are  coded as tsunamis, but many of these are described\u2014and should be  coded\u2014as something else. Second, each disaster declaration can be coded  with only one incident type even though most descriptions list multiple  types of incidents. We found declarations with similar descriptions coded  differently\u2014FEMA has no guidance on how to select the incident type  code to be used from among the types of damage. For example, a number  of declarations are described as \u201csevere storms and flooding\u201d or \u201csevere  storms, flooding, and tornadoes,\u201d but sometimes these were coded as  flooding, other times as severe storms, and still other times as tornadoes.", "Any coding system should be designed for the purpose it must serve. From  the point of view of looking at the cause of damage (e.g., water, wind,  etc.), many of the 27 incident codes track weather events but do not  necessarily capture or elaborate on the type of information relevant to  FEMA\u2019s mission of providing disaster assistance. Moreover, they are not  all mutually exclusive and thus some codes could be consolidated or  eliminated.

Furthermore, based on past experience, Individual Assistance officials  adjust cost estimates for different points in time during the 60-day  registration period. Individuals with greater need tend to apply within the  first 30 days of the registration period, according to Individual Assistance  officials.

For  example, the President may amend the disaster declaration to authorize  other types of assistance, revise the federal portion of the cost share for  Public Assistance, or cover the addition of more counties. Also, hidden  damage might be discovered, which would increase cost estimates.  Fluctuations in estimates also may occur with events such as the  determination of insurance coverage for individuals and public structures  or higher-than-estimated bids to complete large projects (Public  Assistance). Changes in the state or local government housing assistance  strategies can also drive changes in costs.", "However, that these are beyond FEMA\u2019s control does not mean FEMA has  no way to improve its estimates. FEMA could conduct sensitivity analyses  to understand the marginal effects of different cost drivers, such as the  addition of counties to a declaration, revisions to the cost share, or the  determination of insurance coverage, and to provide a range for the  uncertainty created by these factors. We recently reported that as a best  practice sensitivity analysis should be used in all cost estimates because  all estimates have some uncertainty. Using its experiences from prior  disasters, FEMA could analyze the underlying causes of changes in  estimates. This could help FEMA develop and provide to policymakers an  earlier and more realistic range around its point estimate.", "In addition, there are other areas where FEMA has greater control. FEMA  could review the effect its own processes have on fluctuations in its  disaster cost estimates and take actions to better mitigate these factors.  For example, FEMA officials told us that mission assignments are  generally overestimated but these are not corrected until the performing  agencies bill FEMA. We previously reported that when FEMA tasks  another federal agency with a mission assignment, FEMA records the  entire amount up front as an obligation, but does not adjust this amount  until it has received the bill from the performing agency, reviewed it, and  recorded the expenditure in its accounting system. The performing  agency might not bill FEMA until months after it actually performs the  work. If upon reviewing supporting reimbursement documentation FEMA  officials determine that some amounts are incorrect or unsupported,  FEMA may retrieve or \u201ccharge back\u201d the moneys from the agencies. In  these instances, agencies may also take additional time to gather and  provide additional supporting documentation. We made several  recommendations aimed at improving FEMA\u2019s mission assignment  process and FEMA officials told us that they are reviewing the  management of mission assignments.", "One official posited that overestimates of mission assignments could have  caused the overall estimates to take longer than expected to reach the 10  percent band FEMA officials defined as a reasonable predictor of actual  costs. If a review of the mission assignment process shows this to be the  case, FEMA should take steps\u2014such as working with performing agencies  to develop more realistic mission assignment estimates up front and  ensuring that these agencies provide FEMA with bills supported by proper  documentation in a timely manner\u2014to improve this process and lessen its  effect on the overall estimates. If, however, the overestimation of mission  assignments is not driving these changes, FEMA should focus on  identifying what is and take appropriate actions to mitigate it. Another  area that could warrant review is the determination of eligible costs for  Public Assistance. For example, after Public Assistance projects are  completed, FEMA sometimes adjusts costs during reconciliation to  disallow ineligible costs or determine that other costs are eligible.  Focusing on this issue earlier in the process might lead to a more accurate  determination of costs eligible for reimbursement and so improve  projections.", "FEMA could also expand its efforts to better consider past experience in  developing estimates for new disasters. For example, in tracking incident  types, FEMA could improve both the accuracy and the usefulness of the  data for its analytic and predictive purposes. A review and revision of  incident type codes to reflect the cause(s) of damage would tie the data  and coding to their purposes. This could permit making comparisons  among similar disasters to better inform and enhance both cost estimates  and decision making. Also, FEMA could ensure that for past declarations  in the DFSR database, as well as for future declarations, incident codes  match the related descriptions and are consistently entered. This effort  could be aided by revising the DFSR database to allow for multiple  incident types for each declaration to better reflect what occurred. Other  opportunities may also exist for the assistance programs. For example, in  predicting costs for the Individual Assistance program, the usefulness of a  national average should be examined. The substitution or addition of more  geographically specific indicators might better predict applicant costs.", "In some ways, FEMA recognizes the value of using past experience to  inform current estimates. For example, it draws upon the experience of its  disaster comptrollers and staff in the Disaster Relief Fund Oversight  Branch to question estimated costs. In addition, the aforementioned model  to predict hurricane costs shows that FEMA recognizes that similar  disasters may lead to similar costs, which can be analyzed and applied to  better predict costs. According to FEMA officials, they are considering  expanding the model to predict costs from other potentially catastrophic  disasters, such as earthquakes. In the same vein, we believe that FEMA  could expand upon this effort to better predict costs for other types of  disasters, particularly those that are noncatastrophic and recur more  frequently.", "FEMA\u2019s opportunities to learn from past experience, especially from its  disaster cost data, could be hampered by some costs that are no longer  distributed to individual disaster declarations. FEMA officials told us that  they use a \u201csurge account\u201d to support federal mobilization, deployment,  and preliminary damage assessment activities prior to a disaster  declaration. FEMA records subsequent costs by declaration. In the past  these surge account costs were distributed on a proportional basis to each  disaster declared in the year\u2014so the data for the 83 disaster declarations  we were able to review do include these costs. However, FEMA no longer  does this. FEMA officials told us that they determined that there was no  obvious benefit to distributing surge account costs to subsequent  declarations, especially in potential hurricane events that might result in  multiple declarations. We note that costs in the surge account have  increased significantly in recent years. For fiscal years 2000 through 2003,  annual obligations in the surge account were less than $20 million each  year; after 2004 they increased to over $100 million each year, according to  FEMA data as of June 30, 2007. In fact by that date surge account costs  for fiscal year 2007\u2014three-quarters through the fiscal year\u2014had already  reached $350 million. No longer distributing these costs to disasters poses  an analytical challenge for FEMA\u2019s learning as costs for current and future  disasters are not comparable to those that occurred in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities to Improve Management of Disaster- Related Resources", "paragraphs": ["To improve data reliability, FEMA could also develop standard operating  procedures and training for staff entering and maintaining disaster  estimate data in the DFSR database. In a recent review of FEMA\u2019s day-to- day operations we found that it does not have a coordinated or strategic  approach to training and development programs. Further, FEMA officials  described succession planning as nonexistent and several cited it as the  agency\u2019s weakest link. We have previously reported that succession  planning\u2014a process by which organizations identify, develop, and select  their people to ensure an ongoing supply of successors who are the right  people, with the right skills, at the right time for leadership and other key  positions\u2014is especially important for organizations that are undergoing  change. Like the rest of the government, FEMA faces the possibility of  losing a significant percentage of staff\u2014especially at the managerial and  leadership levels\u2014to retirement. About a third of FEMA\u2019s Senior  Executive Service and GS-15 leaders were eligible to retire in fiscal year  2005, and Office of Personnel Management data project that this  percentage will increase to over half by the end of fiscal year 2010. Since  FEMA relies heavily on the experience of its staff, such a loss could  significantly affect its operations. Furthermore, according to FEMA  officials with whom we met, there are no standard operating procedures  or training courses for staff who are involved in entering and maintaining  disaster cost estimate data in the DFSR database that would help mitigate  this loss of knowledge and ensure consistency among staff in regional  offices and in headquarters. Standard operating procedures also might  reduce the coding errors described earlier.", "FEMA may be able to improve its management of disaster-related  resources by reviewing the reasons why \u201colder\u201d disaster declarations  remain open and take action to close and reconcile them if possible. By  finalizing decisions about how much funding is actually needed to  complete work for these open declarations, FEMA will be better able to  target its remaining resources. FEMA officials told us that it takes 4 to 5  years to obligate all funding related to an average disaster declaration but  we found the average life cycle to be longer\u2014a majority of the  noncatastrophic natural disasters declared from 2000 through 2002 (5 to 7  years old) are still open (see table 2).", "We previously reported that in November 1997, FEMA\u2019s Director chartered  three teams of Office of Financial Management staff\u2014referred to as  closeout teams\u2014to assist FEMA regional staff and state emergency  management personnel in closing out funding activities for all past  disasters. Their primary goal was to eliminate remaining costs for these  disasters by obligating or recovering funds. We found that these teams  were effective in doing so. According to FEMA officials, the closeout  teams no longer formally exist because they had successfully closed out  funding activities for past disasters. FEMA now relies on regional offices  to perform this function, and several use teams similar to the closeout  teams to undertake this work.", "Given its mission, FEMA tends to focus much of its resources on disaster  response and recovery. For example, as we previously reported, all FEMA  employees are expected to be on call during disaster response and no  FEMA personnel are exclusively assigned to its day-to-day operations.  Indeed, FEMA officials have said that what FEMA staff label \u201cnondisaster\u201d  programs are maintained on an ad hoc basis when permanent staff are  deployed, and the agency does not have provisions for continuing  programs when program managers are called to response duties. Without  an understanding of who holds a mission-critical position for day-to-day  operations and what minimum level of staffing is necessary even during  disaster response, business continuity and support for the disaster-relief  mission are put at increased risk. FEMA staff\u2019s strong sense of mission is  no substitute for a plan and strategies of action. It is likely, therefore, that  the tasks necessary to close disasters become subordinated to responding  to new disasters. This contributes to a situation in which disaster  declarations remain open for a number of years. However, closing and  reconciling declarations is not merely a bookkeeping exercise. Given the  multiple claims on federal resources, it is important to provide decision  makers with the best information possible about current and pending  claims on those resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities to Improve Budgeting for Disaster Relief", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s annual budget requests and appropriations for disaster relief are  understated because they exclude certain costs. Currently, annual budget  estimates are based on a 5-year historical average of obligations, excluding  costs associated with catastrophic disaster declarations (i.e., those greater  than $500 million). This average\u2014which serves as a proxy for an estimate  of resources that will be needed for the upcoming year\u2014presumes to  capture all projected costs expected not only from future disasters but  also those previously declared. However, as demonstrated by FEMA\u2019s  receipt of supplemental appropriations in years when no catastrophic  disasters occurred, it does not do so. Excluding certain costs associated  with previously declared catastrophic disasters results in an  underestimation of annual disaster relief costs for two reasons. First,  because FEMA finances disaster relief activities from only one account\u2014 regardless of the severity of the disaster\u2014the 5-year average as currently  calculated is not sufficient to cover known costs from past catastrophic  disasters. Second, from fiscal years 2000 through 2006, catastrophic  disasters occurred in 4 out of 7 years, raising questions about the relative  infrequency of such events. Excluding costs from catastrophic disasters in  annual funding estimates prevents decision makers from receiving a  comprehensive view of overall funding claims and trade-offs. This is  particularly important given the tight resource constraints facing our  nation. Therefore, annual budget requests for disaster relief may be  improved by including known costs from previous disasters and some  costs associated with catastrophic disasters.", "Funding for natural disasters is not the only area where a reexamination of  the distribution between funding through regular appropriations and  funding through supplemental appropriations might be in order. In our  work on funding the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), we also noted that  the line between what is funded through regular, annual appropriations  and supplemental appropriations has become blurred. The Department of  Defense\u2019s GWOT funding guidance has resulted in billions of dollars being  added for what DOD calls the \u201clonger war against terror,\u201d making it  difficult to distinguish between base costs and the incremental costs to  support specific contingency operations."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given FEMA\u2019s mission to lead the nation in mitigating, responding to, and  recovering from major domestic disasters, many individuals as well as  state and local governments rely on the disaster assistance it provides. The  cost estimates FEMA develops in response to a disaster have an effect not  only on the assistance provided to those affected by the disaster but also  on federal decision makers, as supplemental appropriations will likely be  needed. As such, it is imperative for FEMA to develop accurate cost  estimates in a timely manner to inform decision making, enhance trade-off  decisions, and increase the transparency of these federal commitments.", "We were able to identify ways in which FEMA has learned from past  disasters; however a number of opportunities exist for FEMA to continue  this learning and to improve its cost estimation process. For example,  FEMA could better ensure that incident codes are useful and accurate. In  addition, a number of factors can lead to revisions in its estimates but  FEMA can mitigate these factors by conducting sensitivity analyses and  reviewing its estimation processes to identify where improvements could  be made. To further facilitate learning, FEMA needs to better ensure that it  has timely and accurate data from past disasters and this report suggests  several ways in which FEMA could do so. FEMA can also explore refining  its learning, for example, by using geographically specific averages to  complement the national averages it uses. In addition, to facilitate analysis  by making current disaster cost data comparable to past disaster data,  FEMA could resume distribution of surge account costs to disasters, as  appropriate.", "FEMA has also taken steps to improve its management of disaster-related  resources, such as \u201cleaning forward,\u201d professionalizing and expanding the  responsibilities of its disaster comptroller cadre, and developing a model  to predict costs for category 3 or higher hurricanes prior to and during  landfall. However, additional steps would further improve how FEMA  manages its resources. For example, to improve data reliability FEMA  could develop standard operating procedures and training for staff  entering and maintaining disaster estimate data in the DFSR database.  Also, although FEMA officials told us that it takes 4 to 5 years to finish all  work related to an average disaster, our analysis of FEMA\u2019s data shows  that a majority of disasters declared from 2000 through 2002 were still  open\u2014that is they had work ongoing\u2014during our review. In the past  FEMA formed teams to review these \u201colder\u201d disasters, which resulted in  the elimination of remaining costs for these disasters by obligating or  recovering funds. A similar effort today could have the same effect. Also,  FEMA relies on supplemental appropriations both to cover the costs of  providing assistance for new disasters and known costs from past  disasters.
