Since then, important progress has been made. However, retirements and the potential loss of leadership and institutional knowledge, coupled with fiscal pressures, underscore the importance of a strategic and efficient approach to acquiring and retaining individuals with critical skills. As a result, strategic human capital management remains on GAO's High-Risk List.", "This testimony is based on a large body of GAO work issued from May 2008 through May 2019. This testimony, among other things, focuses on key human capital areas where some actions have been taken but attention is still needed by OPM and federal agencies on issues including: (1) addressing critical skills gaps and (2) recruiting and hiring talented employees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and individual agencies, has identified skills gaps in numerous government-wide occupations. According to GAO's 2019 analysis of federal high-risk areas, skills gaps played a role in 17 of the 35 high-risk areas. Causes vary but these skills gaps often occur due to shortfalls in one or more talent management activities such as robust workforce planning. Staffing shortages and the lack of skills among current staff not only affect individual agencies but also cut across the entire federal workforce in areas such as cybersecurity and acquisition management. Additionally, the changing nature of federal work and the high percentage of employees eligible for retirement could produce gaps in leadership and institutional knowledge, and threatens to aggravate the problems created from existing skills gaps. For example, 31.6 percent of permanent federal employees who were on board as of September 30, 2017, will be eligible to retire in the next 5 years with some agencies having particularly high levels of employees eligible to retire.", "GAO's work has identified a range of problems and challenges with federal recruitment and hiring efforts. Some of these problems and challenges include unclear job announcements and a lengthy hiring process. Further, the federal workforce has changed since the government's system of current employment policies and practices were designed. Strategies that can help agencies better manage the current and future workforces include:", "Manage the timing of recruitment . To address issues of funding uncertainty at the beginning of the fiscal year, agencies should recruit continuously, starting the hiring process early in the school year.", "Write user-friendly vacancy announcements . GAO has reported that some federal job announcements were unclear. This can confuse applicants and delay hiring. OPM stated that when hiring managers partner with human resources staff, agencies can develop more effective vacancy announcements.", "Leverage available hiring and pay flexibilities . To help ensure agencies have the talent they need, they should explore and use all existing hiring authorities. A variety of special pay authorities can help agencies compete in the labor market for top talent, but GAO has found that agencies only use them for a small number of employees.", "Increase support for an inclusive work environment . An increasingly diverse workforce can help provide agencies with the requisite talent and multidisciplinary knowledge to accomplish their missions.", "Encourage rotations and other mobility opportunities. Upward and lateral mobility opportunities are important for retaining employees, but few employees move horizontally because managers are sometimes reluctant to lose employees.", "Without these measures, the federal government's ability to address the complex social, economic, and security challenges facing the country may be compromised."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, GAO has made numerous recommendations to agencies and OPM to improve their strategic human capital management efforts.

The government\u2019s system of  current employment policies was designed generations ago for a  workforce and type of work that largely no longer exist. Much has  changed since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Classification  Act of 1949 laid the foundation of much of today\u2019s federal personnel  system. Agencies\u2019 missions have evolved and employees\u2019 expectations  of work and the workplace are changing. Further, an increasingly volatile  world makes understanding and responding to evolving trends and issues  essential. As we have long reported, strategic human capital  management plays a critical role in maximizing the government\u2019s  performance and assuring its accountability to Congress and to the nation  as a whole.", "Strategic human capital management has been a GAO high-risk area  since 2001. Since then, Congress, the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), and some individual agencies have made progress towards  addressing the government\u2019s human capital challenges. As we reported  in March 2019, although progress has been made toward improving the  government\u2019s human capital efforts, the area remains high-risk because  more work is needed to address government-wide mission critical skills  gaps. As our 2019 analysis of all federal high-risk areas shows, skills  gaps played a role in 17 of the 35 governmentwide high-risk areas we  have identified.", "In December 2016, OPM finalized revisions to its strategic human capital  management regulation that include the new Human Capital Framework.", "This framework is to be used by agencies to plan, implement, evaluate,  and improve human capital policies and programs. Additionally, the  revised regulation provides that agency human capital policies and  programs must monitor and address skills gaps within government-wide  and agency-specific mission-critical occupations by using comprehensive  data analytic methods and gap closure strategies. The revised regulation,  which became effective on April 11, 2017, also requires that agencies  conduct a quarterly, data-driven review process known as HRStat,  which, as we reported in 2015, could be an important tool in reviewing  key performance metrics related to closing skills gaps.", "This statement among other things focuses on key human capital areas  where some actions have been taken but attention is still needed by OPM  and federal agencies on issues including (1) addressing critical skills  gaps, and (2) recruiting and hiring talented employees. The statement is  based on our large body of work on federal human capital management  issued primarily between May 2008 and May 2019. More detailed  information on our objectives, scope, and methodology for that work can  be found in the issued reports. We conducted the work on which this  statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OPM and Agencies Need to Strengthen Efforts to Identify and Close Mission-Critical Skills Gaps", "paragraphs": ["The federal government faces long-standing challenges in strategically  managing its workforce. We first added federal strategic human capital  management to our list of high-risk government programs and operations  in 2001. Because skills gaps within individual federal agencies\u2014as well  as across the federal workforce\u2014can lead to costly, less-efficient  government, the issue has been identified as the focus of the Strategic  Human Capital Management GAO high-risk area since February 2011.  Our experience has shown that the key elements needed to make  progress in high-risk areas are top-level attention by the administration  and agency leaders grounded in the five criteria for removal from the  High-Risk List, as well as any needed congressional action. The five  criteria for removal are: (1) leadership commitment, (2) agency capacity,  (3) existence of a corrective action plan, (4) program monitoring, and (5)  demonstrated progress.", "Although Congress, OPM, and individual agencies have made  improvements since 2001, federal human capital management remains a  high-risk area because mission-critical skills gaps within the federal  workforce pose a high risk to the nation. GAO, along with OPM and  individual agencies, has identified mission critical skills gaps in numerous  government-wide occupations. These skills gaps both within federal  agencies and across the federal workforce impede the government from  cost-effectively serving the public and achieving results. For example, the  difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled health care providers and  human resource staff at Veterans Health Administration\u2019s (VHA) medical  centers make it difficult to meet the health care needs of more than 9  million veterans. As a result, VHA\u2019s 168 medical centers have large  staffing shortages, including physicians, registered nurses, physician  assistants, psychologists, physical therapists, as well as human resource  specialists and assistants.", "In October 2017, we reported that the VHA, within the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA), has opportunities to improve staffing, recruitment,  and retention strategies for physicians that it identified as a priority for  staffing, or mission-critical. For 2016, the top five physician mission- critical occupations were primary care, mental health, gastroenterology,  orthopedic surgery, and emergency medicine. However, VHA was unable  to accurately count the total number of physicians who provide care in its  VA medical centers (VAMC). Additionally, VHA lacked data on the  number of contract physicians and physician trainees. Five of the six  VAMCs in our review used contract physicians or physician trainees to  meet their staffing needs, but VHA had no information on the extent to  which VAMCs nationwide use these arrangements. We also reported that  VHA had not evaluated the effectiveness of its physician recruitment and  retention strategies. One such strategy\u2014hiring physician trainees\u2014was  weakened by ineffectual hiring practices, such as delaying employment  offers until graduation.", "In February 2018, we reported that the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) had taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment  codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland  Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014; however, its  actions were not timely and complete. While DHS has implemented four  of our six recommendations from this report, two recommendations  remain open. For example, DHS has not yet completed its efforts to  identify all of the department\u2019s cybersecurity positions and accurately  assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. Further, it  has not yet fully developed guidance to assist DHS components in  identifying their cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of  critical need that align to the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education framework. Without ensuring that its progress in identifying and  assigning codes to its positions is accurately reported and it has guidance  to fully assist components, DHS will not be positioned to effectively  examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify its critical skill gaps, or  improve its workforce planning.", "In March 2019, we reported that 24 federal agencies generally assigned  work roles to filled and vacant positions that performed information  technology, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions as required by the  Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015. However,  most agencies had likely miscategorized the work roles of many IT  positions. Until agencies accurately categorize their positions, the  agencies may not have reliable information to form a basis for effectively  examining their cybersecurity workforce, improving workforce planning,  and identifying their workforce roles of critical need.", "Skills gaps caused by insufficient number of staff, inadequate workforce  planning, and a lack of training in critical skills are contributing to our designating strategic human capital management and other areas as high  risk. (See table 1.) Skills gaps affect individual agencies but also cut  across the entire federal workforce in areas such as cybersecurity and  acquisition management. As our 2019 analysis of federal high-risk areas  shows, in addition to Strategic Human Capital Management, skills gaps  played a role in 16 of the other 34 high-risk areas we have identified.", "Insufficient numbers of staff with critical skills can be related to staff  retirements as well as to inadequate recruitment and hiring. Moreover, if  not carefully managed, anticipated retirements could widen skills gaps or  open new ones, adversely affecting agencies\u2019 capabilities. As shown in  figure 1, more than 31 percent of federal employees on board by the end  of fiscal year 2017 will be eligible to retire in the next 5 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Strategies and Practices for Recruiting, Incentivizing and Engaging the Current and Future Federal Workforce", "paragraphs": ["In March 2019, we reported on key talent management strategies that  can help agencies better manage the current and future workforce.  Below we focus on nine selected practices we identified related to  recruiting, incentivizing, and engaging the federal workforce:  Cultivate a diverse talent pipeline. In our prior work, we have noted the  importance of active campus recruiting that goes beyond infrequent  outreach to college campuses. Active campus recruiting includes  developing long-term institutional relationships with faculty,  administrators, and students. In addition, OPM guidance emphasizes that  agencies should develop an inclusive approach to their talent acquisition  strategies. This includes developing strategic partnerships with a diverse  range of colleges and universities, trade schools, apprentice programs,  and affinity organizations from across the country.", "Recruit continuously and start the hiring process early in the school  year. The ability to hire students is critical to ensuring that agencies have  a range of experience levels for succession planning and a talent pipeline  to meet mission requirements. One of the key challenges agencies face  in recruiting students is managing the timing of recruitment. The federal  fiscal year begins on October 1\u2014about when private sector firms we  interviewed start recruiting on campus. Frequently, however, federal  agencies have been unable to hire at this time of year because of the  limitations of budget uncertainty. Yet if agencies wait to start the recruiting  and hiring process until they receive funding, many graduates will have  taken other job opportunities.", "Agencies can overcome these timing challenges by recruiting  continuously and starting the hiring process early in the school year. To  recruit continuously, Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs) from the U.S.  Departments of Agriculture and Homeland Security said that they  advertise funding-conditional positions throughout the year.", "Write user-friendly vacancy announcements. We previously reported  that some federal job announcements were unclear. This can confuse  applicants and delay hiring. In July 2018, OPM officials stated that  agencies can develop more effective vacancy announcements when  hiring managers partner with human resource (HR) staff. According to  OPM, hiring managers can work with HR staff to identify the critical  competencies needed in the job, develop a recruiting strategy, and  ensure the job announcement accurately and clearly describes the  required competencies and experience. To promote collaboration  between hiring managers and HR staff, OPM is training agencies on the  role of hiring managers in writing vacancy announcements, according to  OPM officials.", "Strategically leverage available hiring and pay flexibilities. To help  ensure agencies have the talent they need to meet their missions, we  have found that federal agencies should have a hiring process that is  simultaneously applicant friendly, sufficiently flexible to enable agencies  to meet their needs, and consistent with statutory requirements, such as  hiring on the basis of merit. Key to achieving this is the hiring authority  used to bring applicants onboard.", "In March 2019, we reported that CHCOs cited the complex competitive  examining process as a cause of the lengthy hiring time. This has been  a long-standing concern. In our 2002 report on human capital flexibilities,  we noted that for many years prior, federal managers had complained  that competitive examining procedures were rigid and complex.  Agencies can use a number of additional hiring authorities beyond  competitive examining. These authorities can add flexibility to the process  and CHCOs have expressed a desire for more. However, we previously  found that agencies relied on only a small number of available  authorities. In fiscal year 2014, of the 105 hiring authority codes used in  total, agencies relied on 20 hiring authority codes to make around 90  percent of the new appointments.", "We recommended in 2016 that OPM use information from its reviews of  agencies\u2019 use of certain hiring authorities to determine whether  opportunities exist to refine, consolidate, or expand agency-specific  authorities, and implement changes where OPM is authorized, including  seeking presidential authorization or developing legislative proposals if  necessary. OPM agreed with our recommendation and has made  progress in these areas, although more work is needed to follow through  on planned actions to streamline authorities.", "For example, in December 2018, OPM said that it continues to research  and examine streamlining opportunities, such as those identified in its  July 2018 study on excepted service hiring authorities. However, OPM did  not provide a time frame for implementation. In addition, in its March 2019  Congressional Justification for the Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request,  OPM included legislative proposals for new hiring authorities, such as  authority for short-term appointments to allow agencies to appoint and  compensate highly qualified experts to help agencies meet critical needs  as well as a change to the criteria for granting direct hire authority.", "A variety of special pay authorities can help agencies compete in the  labor market for top talent, but agencies only use them for a small number  of employees. In fiscal year 2016, these incentives were used for less  than 6 percent of employees. In December 2017, we reported that  agencies can tap an array of special payments when they need to recruit  or retain experts in engineering, cybersecurity, or other in-demand  fields. These payments include, for example, incentives for recruitment  or retention, or higher rates of pay for critical positions. We found that  agencies reported that these payments were helpful, but few documented  their effects, and OPM had not assessed their effectiveness. Further, in  our March 2019 report, we found that less than 5 percent of employees  received payments for recruitment or retention annually in the past 10  years.", "In December 2017, we made three recommendations to OPM, including  for it to track the effectiveness of special payment authorities. OPM  partially concurred with this recommendation, saying that agencies are in  the best position to take this action. In December 2018, OPM stated that it  established a baseline to measure changes in the use of special payment  authorities over time, and that it is focused on government-wide, mission- critical occupations to help identify trends where there may be recruitment  and retention difficulties. However, documents OPM provided gave no  information on actions taken on this recommendation. We will continue to  monitor OPM\u2019s actions to implement this recommendation. This is one of  18 priority recommendations in GAO\u2019s Priority Recommendations letter to  OPM.", "Use relevant assessment methods and share hiring lists. In March  2019, we reported that CHCOs and OPM officials we interviewed stated  that roadblocks to hiring the right skills include issues with assessment  methods. Specifically, agencies may use methods that are less relevant  for assessing the desired skills or agencies may experience issues  incorporating multiple assessments in the hiring process. For example,  one CHCO we interviewed said that her agency uses multiple-choice  questions to assess candidates, but essay questions more effectively  assess the skills she seeks. OPM issued guidance to agencies on how to  use additional assessment methods, including how to rank applicants.", "Additionally, federal employee and management group representatives  we spoke with said agencies could reduce the time of the assessment  process by sharing hiring lists. The Competitive Service Act of 2015  allows agencies to share hiring lists, but agencies have only started to  pilot the practice within departments, according to OPM officials we spoke  with for our March 2019 report. OPM and agencies discussed sharing  hiring certificates with the CHCO Council, and OPM is planning virtual  training sessions on this topic. However, one federal employee group  representative noted that to be consistent with merit principles, agencies  may need to refresh the list every 2 to 3 months to give new candidates  the opportunity to enter the application pool.", "Highlight agency mission and link to employees\u2019 work. Agencies can  help counter negative perceptions of federal work by promoting their  missions and innovative work, according to experts and CHCOs we  interviewed for our March 2019 report. For example, DHS\u2019s CHCO told  us that DHS provides \u201cDay in the Life\u201d information on its work to promote  public awareness of how its everyday tasks tie in with its mission of  protecting the United States.", "In addition, we have previously reported that high-performing  organizations create a \u201cline of sight\u201d between individual performance and  organizational results by aligning employees\u2019 daily activities with broader  results. Agencies can motivate and retain employees by connecting  them to their agency\u2019s mission, according to human capital experts and  federal employee and management group representatives we  interviewed. Employee responses to Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey  (FEVS) indicate the federal government appears to be performing well in  this area. In 2017, 84 percent of employees knew how their work related  to the agency goals and priorities.", "Increase awareness of benefits and incentives, such as work-life  programs. As shown in figure 2, the majority of federal employees were  satisfied with compensation, and employees who participated in work-life  programs were satisfied with those incentives. However, OPM\u2019s 2018 Federal Work-Life Survey Governmentwide Report found that one of the  most commonly reported reasons employees do not participate in work- life programs is lack of program awareness among employees and  supervisors.", "Increase support for an inclusive work environment. An increasingly  diverse workforce can help provide agencies with the requisite talent and  multidisciplinary knowledge to accomplish their missions. In January  2005, we reported fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace could help  organizations reduce costs by reducing turnover, increasing employee  retention across demographic groups, and improving morale. We also  reported that top management commitment is a fundamental element in  the implementation of diversity management initiatives.", "Encourage details, rotations, and other mobility opportunities. In  March 2019, we stated that CHCOs, human capital experts, and federal  management groups said upward and lateral mobility opportunities are  important for retaining employees. CHCOs also said that in some cases,  lateral mobility opportunities such as rotations, details, and opportunities  to gain experience in other sectors can help employees gain new skills  more cost-effectively than training, particularly for rapidly changing skill  sets such as those related to the sciences. Further, we previously  reported that effective interagency rotational assignments can develop  participants\u2019 collaboration skills and build interagency networks.", "However, according to OPM data, few employees in 2017 moved  horizontally because, according to federal manager group representatives  and our previous work, managers are sometimes reluctant to lose  employees. (See table 2.)", "We have previously made recommendations that could help address  these challenges. For example in 2015, we recommended that OPM  determine if promising practices, such as providing detail opportunities or  rotational assignments to managerial candidates prior to promotion,  should be more widely used across government. OPM partially  concurred with this recommendation and agreed to work with the CHCO  Council to explore more government-wide use of rotational assignments.  However, OPM noted that agencies already have authority to take these  actions. In June 2019, OPM officials told us they had discussed the  scalability of promising practices for supervisors\u2014specifically, details and  rotational assignments and a dual career ladder\u2014with members of the  CHCO Council. OPM found these practices were being used at some  agencies, but has not determined if these practices may be beneficial to  other agencies.", "In conclusion, OPM has instituted numerous efforts to assist agencies\u2019 in  addressing mission-critical skills gaps within their workforces. This  includes providing guidance, training and on-going support for agencies  on the use of comprehensive data analytic methods for identifying skills  gaps and the development of strategies to address these gaps. However,  as of December 2018, OPM had not fully implemented 29 of our  recommendations made since 2012 relating to this high-risk area. We will  continue to monitor OPM\u2019s efforts to implement our recommendations.  Further, we have reported on numerous talent management strategies  that can help agencies better manage the current and future workforce.  Without these measures, the federal government\u2019s ability to address the  complex social, economic, and security challenges facing the country  may be compromised.", "Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member Sinema, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
