DOD leadership has encouraged its hiring personnel to use these flexibilities, such as direct hire authorities, to reduce the length of the hiring process. From fiscal year 2014 to 2018, DOD used hiring flexibilities for 90 percent of its approximately 44,000 civilian acquisition workforce hiring actions (see figure).", "DOD also increased its use of recruitment and retention flexibilities for its civilian acquisition workforce, increasing the dollar amount authorized from $13.9 million in fiscal year 2014 to $33.7 million in fiscal year 2018.

HCI regularly monitors the overall health of the acquisition workforce, including by reviewing workforce metrics on a quarterly basis, but does not regularly monitor the military departments' use of human capital flexibilities. For example, GAO found the Air Force and Navy used direct hire authorities twice as often as the Army in fiscal year 2018. Without efforts to gain such insights through monitoring, HCI may be missing opportunities to identify challenges, inconsistencies, or needed improvements in using these tools. With regard to assessing the use of human capital flexibilities, HCI intends to study how long it takes to hire personnel when using the flexibilities.

For example, we found that the Air Force  and Navy used direct hire authorities twice as often as the Army in fiscal  year 2018. Further, while DOD leadership has emphasized that using  hiring flexibilities improves DOD\u2019s ability to recruit and hire high-quality  talent in a timely manner, HCI is not yet able to assess how effective the  hiring flexibilities have been in achieving these goals. This is because  DCPAS has not yet developed a plan to consistently measure how long it  takes to hire new personnel across the department. Similarly, DCPAS has  not yet established metrics to assess the quality of the new personnel  DOD hires. DCPAS has efforts underway to address these issues and  plans to start using these metrics in 2019."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HCI Does Not Regularly Monitor Usage of Hiring Flexibilities", "paragraphs": ["DOD policy states HCI should implement strategies and policies to help  attract and retain acquisition workforce personnel. To this end, HCI  officials told us they monitor the overall health of the acquisition workforce  in various ways, including outreach to the DACMs on workforce  challenges, as well as holding knowledge-sharing events, such as a May  2018 acquisition workforce human capital symposium. Additionally, HCI  reviews and reports statistics on workforce size, workforce gains and  losses, and other workforce-related metrics on a quarterly basis. For  example, in its fiscal year 2019 first quarter assessment, HCI reported  data on the current size of the acquisition workforce; acquisition  workforce education and certification levels; and workforce gains, losses,  retirement eligibility and attrition rates, among other things, both on a  DOD-wide basis as well as by acquisition career field. HCI officials told us  they use these data to identify potential or emerging workforce  challenges. HCI officials noted that if they identify any issues, they further  analyze data to identify the root cause of the issues.", "HCI officials acknowledged, however, that HCI does not regularly collect  or review data on the defense components\u2019 specific use of hiring,  recruitment, and retention flexibilities as part of its quarterly assessments.  HCI officials stated that they collect and review hiring flexibilities data on  an as-needed basis, such as in preparation for DOD acquisition workforce  governance forums, including senior steering board and workforce  management group meetings, in which the use of the flexibilities will be  on the agenda, or in response to Congressional requests. HCI officials  also noted that because the use of hiring, recruitment, and retention  flexibilities are made at the command level within the military  departments, the military departments are better positioned to regularly  monitor usage. However, the military departments are not in a position to  identify variations in usage rates across DOD\u2019s civilian acquisition  workforce, which are significant. For example, we found that the Air Force  and the Navy used direct hire authorities for 85 percent and 84 percent of  their respective hiring actions in fiscal year 2018, while the Army used  direct hire authorities for 42 percent of its hiring actions that year.", "Similarly, some career fields use the hiring flexibilities at higher rates than  others. While hiring flexibilities comprised 95 percent of total civilian  acquisition workforce hiring actions in fiscal year 2018, the auditing and  purchasing career fields used hiring flexibilities for only 68 percent and 62  percent of their respective hiring actions that year. Without regularly  monitoring usage rates for hiring flexibilities across the civilian acquisition  workforce, HCI lacks visibility into these types of variations and  opportunities to investigate and address them, as appropriate.", "Lastly, HCI focuses its efforts on those recruitment and retention  flexibilities funded by DAWDF because HCI is responsible for DAWDF\u2019s  management. Based on DAWDF reports and DCPDS data, we found that  the amount of dollars obligated for DAWDF-funded recruitment, retention,  and recognition initiatives in 2017 was $15 million or about two-thirds of  the total dollars authorized for the recruitment and retention flexibilities for  DOD\u2019s civilian acquisition workforce in fiscal year 2017. The remaining  amount (about one-third) was funded by other sources, such as the  military departments\u2019 operations and maintenance appropriations, but is  not included as part of HCI\u2019s annual review.", "Since 2002, we have repeatedly found that agencies should strategically  manage their use of human capital flexibilities\u2014including hiring,  recruitment, and retention flexibilities\u2014to address human capital  challenges. Additionally, federal internal control standards state that an  agency\u2019s management should obtain relevant data on a timely basis to  effectively monitor activities to achieve objectives. Based on these  standards, in May 2018, we recommended that DOD\u2019s defense  laboratories routinely monitor data on its use of hiring authorities. DOD  concurred with our recommendation and planned to determine the  appropriate data to be collected and establish routine reporting  requirements.

We have previously found that  time-to-hire and quality-of-hire are useful metrics that help agencies  evaluate their hiring efforts, which can include the use of hiring  flexibilities. To this end, DCPAS collects and reports time-to-hire data to  measure DOD\u2019s progress in improving hiring practices. For example,  according to DCPAS, from fiscal year 2016 through 2018, DOD took an  average of 127 days to hire civilian personnel under the traditional hiring  method compared to an average of 110 days when using DOD direct hire  authorities. DCPAS also noted variations in time-to-hire across the  direct hire authorities, reporting that DOD took anywhere from 77 to 111  days to hire civilian personnel using the 14 DOD direct hire authorities  applicable to the civilian acquisition workforce. For the expedited hiring  authority for acquisition positions\u2014the direct hire authority used most  frequently to hire civilian acquisition workforce personnel\u2014DCPAS  reported an average time-to-hire of 106 days from fiscal year 2016  through 2018.", "While these time-to-hire metrics could be helpful in determining which  direct hire authorities most effectively expedite the hiring process, HCI  officials told us they do not use these metrics to inform management  decisions for the civilian acquisition workforce because they are not yet  consistently measured. DCPAS officials explained that the military  departments and their major commands developed their own approaches  for inputting and reporting time-to-hire data based on their individual  needs and data systems. HCI and DCPAS officials acknowledged that  this resulted in different ways to record and track the data, which in turn  prevented meaningful comparisons between the time-to-hire metrics  produced by each of the components.", "According to HCI and DCPAS officials, this difference, in part, is  attributable to the variation in how DOD personnel input certain data. For  example, one human resource specialist may initiate a request for a  personnel action\u2014which is generally the starting date for time-to-hire  metrics\u2014on the day the hiring manager submits a job description, while  another human resource specialist may initiate a request for personnel  action after the job announcement has been posted publicly. Moreover,  our analysis of DCPAS data for all DOD civilian personnel hires from  fiscal year 2014 to 2018 shows that about 36,000 of 420,000 personnel  actions, or about 9 percent, were initiated on or after the individuals\u2019 start  dates, producing a zero or negative time-to-hire figure. DCPAS officials  told us they omit these figures when they report time-to-hire metrics. Until  time-to-hire metrics are consistently measured DOD-wide, HCI will not be  able to use this data to assess which direct hire authorities have most  effectively expedited the hiring process, which DOD components have  been the most successful in using these authorities, or identify potential  issues in using these authorities.", "In September 2018, to address inconsistent time-to-hire methodologies  across DOD, we recommended that the DOD Chief Management Officer  require that all DOD human resource providers adopt consistent time-to- hire measures. DOD concurred with our recommendation, and in June  2019, DCPAS officials told us they were in the process of developing a  plan to implement consistent time-to-hire metrics across the department.  DCPAS officials anticipate completing the plan by July 2019 and will start  implementation after DOD leadership approves this plan. HCI officials told  us that they plan to use the time-to-hire metrics to assess the civilian  acquisition workforce\u2019s hiring efforts, including the use of flexibilities,  when the metrics are comparable.", "Similarly, HCI officials told us that they cannot systematically assess  quality-of-hire across the civilian acquisition workforce because DCPAS  has not developed guidance that outlines how quality-of-hire should be  measured. DOD\u2019s June 2018 civilian human capital operating plan  outlines an initiative to improve the quality of civilian hires, among other  things. As part of this initiative, DCPAS is to establish quality-of-hire  metrics using data collected from an OPM hiring satisfaction survey tool.  Using the OPM survey, DOD\u2019s hiring managers are to rate the  performance of new employees 6 months after they are hired. DCPAS  officials stated that various DOD components have used the survey since  2011, but acknowledged hiring managers completed the survey for only 1  percent of all DOD hires in fiscal year 2018. In March 2019, USD (P&R)  leadership issued a memorandum to DOD human capital offices  encouraging wider implementation of the survey, including outlining roles  and responsibilities and milestones for implementation. Starting in fiscal  year 2020, USD (P&R) plans to set quality-of-hire goals using the fiscal  year 2019 survey results and incorporating these into future civilian  human capital operating plans.
