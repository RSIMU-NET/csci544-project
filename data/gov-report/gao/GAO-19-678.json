Much of the growth occurred from the end of fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2018, when the account grew by approximately $630 million.", "The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has developed limited management oversight guidance for the FMS transportation accounts, which has contributed to the substantial balance growth. DSCA internal guidance requires daily and annual reviews of the accounts to monitor for significant changes in account balances and to ensure the accounts maintain a \u201chealthy\u201d level. However, internal guidance does not define a significant change or \u201chealthy\u201d level, such as a target range for the account balances. This has led to inconsistent reviews and limited oversight of the recent balance growth. DSCA also has no internal guidance on how to perform certain aspects of its annual reviews or what information to include in the resulting reports. As a result, DSCA officials have produced reports with incomplete information, such as on the causes for trends in the account balances, undermining DSCA management's ability to make informed decisions about the accounts.", "DSCA's processes for setting the FMS transportation fee do not ensure that aggregate fees approximate aggregate costs. For its transportation fee rate reviews, DSCA sends requests to the military departments for historical cost and fee data that lack specificity, such as on timeframes, sampling methodology, and data sources. As a result, DSCA has analyzed data that are not timely or systematically sampled. In addition, military department officials reported difficulty providing the requested data in part because DSCA's guidance did not specify data sources. Consequently, for the most recent review, Air Force and Navy were unable to find sufficient matching cost and fee data for DSCA to consider them usable. Further, DSCA has established no goals for rate reviews and has no written procedures to follow in performing them.

The Department of State (State)  and several components of the Department of Defense (DOD) share  responsibility for the program, including the Defense Security Cooperation  Agency (DSCA), which administers the program. To cover the costs of  operating the FMS program, DOD charges purchasers certain overhead  fees, including a transportation fee to cover any costs to DOD of  transporting items. Such transportation fees are collected into a series of  transportation accounts in the FMS trust fund. According to DOD, the  FMS program is intended to operate on a \u201cno profit, no loss\u201d basis,  meaning that purchasers should not be charged excessive fees and fee  revenue should cover the program\u2019s operating costs. The fee DOD  charges the purchaser for each individual shipment need not equal  DOD\u2019s costs for transporting that individual shipment, but DOD aims to  set fees such that the total amount of fees paid by all FMS purchasers  approximately equals the costs to DOD for all shipments over time,  according to DOD officials. Setting fees accordingly should result in  relatively low balances in the FMS transportation accounts. Our 2018  review of other FMS overhead fee accounts found that DSCA had  allowed those account balances to grow substantially in recent years due  in part to weaknesses in DSCA\u2019s management oversight.", "House Report number 114-537 and Senate Report number 114-255  include provisions for us to, among other things, review DSCA\u2019s  management and use of fees and to determine whether these fees are  generating excess funds.

In fact, the FMS transportation account  was at risk of insolvency starting in fiscal year 2009. In response, DSCA  redistributed $80 million in fiscal year 2009 and $50 million in fiscal year  2011 from the FMS administrative fee account to the main FMS  transportation account to ensure it contained sufficient funding to pay  transportation bills.

According to DSCA officials, demand for transportation of FMS  purchases through DTS is unpredictable, and the accounts\u2019 balances may  experience volatile swings due to inconsistencies involved in billing the  accounts. For example, delays in billing or reporting a particular shipment  can result in DOD collecting the fee into the transportation accounts and  reimbursing the transportation cost from the accounts at different times.  Further, the fees collected and the costs expended for an individual  shipment may differ because DOD uses different factors to calculate the  transportation fee to charge the purchaser (e.g., the item\u2019s value) than it  uses to calculate the cost to bill the FMS transportation accounts (e.g.,  the shipment\u2019s origin, destination, and weight, among other factors).", "Despite this volatility over time, from fiscal years 2014 to 2018, collections  consistently exceeded expenditures, which drove the substantial balance  growth.

According to DSCA officials, they only  report redistributions in the year that they occur.", "In addition to not including this information in its annual reports, DSCA  has not assessed the need for other redistributions of funds between the  FMS fee accounts since it last redistributed funds from the FMS  administrative account to the main FMS transportation account in fiscal  year 2011. DSCA officials indicated they intend to return the funds to the  administrative account but have not done so because they have no  urgency, given that the FMS administrative account balance has been  consistently above its lower bound in recent years. As of the end of fiscal  year 2018, the FMS administrative account balance was approximately  $4.7 billion, which was approximately $3.1 billion more than the account\u2019s  lower bound that DSCA determined was necessary to support FMS  operations.", "The lack of specific internal guidance on how to assess and report  redistributions has resulted in incomplete reports to DSCA management,  which inhibits DSCA management\u2019s ability to make informed decisions in  overseeing the FMS fees. In particular, without reports that clearly state  the amount of redistributed funds and their source(s), and assess their  continued need, DSCA management is less informed when determining  whether and when to redistribute funds, including whether to return  previously redistributed funds.", "According to our User Fee Design Guide, assigning costs to identifiable  users can promote equity and more informed rate-setting; however,  redistributing fees from the FMS administrative account to the main FMS  transportation account has intermingled funds that have different  sources. DOD charges the FMS administrative fee to all FMS  purchasers while DOD charges the FMS transportation fee to only certain  purchasers for the portion of the transportation of their FMS items that uses DTS. Distributing funds from the FMS administrative account to the  main FMS transportation account intermingled these fees, which has two  main effects. First, not returning redistributed funds if the transportation  account no longer needs them raises concerns regarding the fees\u2019 equity  in ensuring only the beneficiaries of a service pay for the cost of providing  it.

According to  DSCA officials, they intend to write a memo to DFAS related to each  instance of a BPC-specific transportation account closure instead of  providing DFAS written guidance to follow in any such instance because  DSCA officials prefer providing specific directions to DFAS regarding  moving such funds. DSCA officials said they do not need specific internal  guidance to ensure they direct DFAS to complete such fund transfers  because DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  would ensure that DSCA does so when that office reviews all DOD  accounts.

As a result,  according to Army officials, the data Army provided to DSCA included a  mix of different partners and cases of different dollar values; however, no  systematic sampling methods were used that would have ensured that the resulting data were indicative of overall Army shipments during the  time period covered. Also, DSCA\u2019s request did not specify a time period  the data should cover. Army provided data for cases that likely were at  least 5 to 7 years old. According to DSCA officials, if the rate review is to  analyze case-level data, such as Army provided, it is necessary to  analyze data on cases for which the FMS agreements were signed  multiple years prior, because shipments may not take place until multiple  years into cases. However, the Army officials we spoke to about the data  Army provided were unaware how long ago the shipments occurred for  the related cases, and stated that some may have occurred years before.  TRANSCOM pricing changes annually, so cost information that is multiple  years old and not adjusted to reflect such changes would be unlikely to  predict future costs.

When briefing DSCA management on the review, DSCA officials  reported a concentration of undercharges in two of the rates. As a  result, DSCA decided to increase these two rates such that, if the new  rates had applied to the full sample DSCA analyzed, fees on the  cases in the full sample would have exceeded costs by 14 percent.  Our analysis of the sample showed that while these two rates had the  largest difference in value between the costs and fees, other rates  also had large differences within this sample. Specifically, one other  rate had a larger percentage of undercharges and three of the other  rates had percentages of overcharges exceeding 1,000 percent.

Total fees for this portion of the sample were 90  percent higher than the related total costs. Based on this limited data,  DSCA decided to decrease all of its transportation fee rates such that,  if the new rates had applied to the full sample DSCA analyzed, fees  would still have exceeded costs by 77 percent, with five of the seven  fee rates still exceeding the cost by more than 100 percent for that  sample. DSCA officials stated that their intent in this rate review was  to lower the rates modestly to see their effect on the account  balances; however, their ability to accurately meet this goal is reduced  by its lack of specificity and the limited analysis DSCA performed.", "Given that the data DSCA analyzed for both these reviews was not  generalizable to all shipments, the above percentages do not indicate that  the rates overall would have affected fees in these exact ways.

Air Force officials said that the months of work put into  responding to each of DSCA\u2019s rate review requests seemed like a waste  of resources because their data has consistently shown that the  transportation fees collected were drastically higher than the related costs  and yet the fee remained unchanged for years.

However, our  analysis raises concerns about the extent to which the current rate  structure may have negative implications for the transportation fee\u2019s  equity, efficiency, and revenue adequacy. We have previously reported  that fee design should balance ways to encourage greater efficiency,  equity, and revenue adequacy while reducing administrative burden on  the agency and payers of the fees, as shown in Table 4. These factors  interact and often conflict with each other so that tradeoffs among these  factors should be considered when designing a fee\u2019s structure.", "The current transportation fee rate structure limits DSCA\u2019s administrative  burden because it relies on only a few factors, which involve easily  accessible data, but these factors vary considerably from those  TRANSCOM uses to price its transportation. The FMS transportation fee  amount charged to purchasers is generally based on three factors, which  should be identified in FMS agreements: (1) the price of the item; (2) the  foreign destination rate area; and (3) the extent of U.S. government  responsibility for transporting the item (e.g., to an inland destination in the  continental United States or to a foreign inland or port destination). At  the time of the FMS agreement, DSCA and the military departments lack  information about other factors that would make it easier for DOD to set  fee rates such that fees would approximate the actual cost of the  transportation. For example:", "Mode. DOD may not know how it will move the items at the time of  the FMS agreement, and costs vary depending on the mode of  transportation, such as by air or a surface vessel.", "Route. Although DOD should be aware of the final destination for  items, DOD may be unaware of where the shipment will originate or  the specific route the items will take, and transportation costs can vary  depending on the specific route. For example, to transport goods in a  20-foot container on a surface vessel door-to-door from a location on  the East Coast of the United States to Afghanistan in fiscal year 2018,  TRANSCOM rates ranged from $548.85 to $1,077.03 per  measurement ton shipped, depending on the specific route, whereas  DSCA\u2019s fee rates would be constant and applied to the price of the  items.", "Also, even if DOD knew the exact mode and route, approximating the  exact cost for each shipment would be difficult because TRANSCOM  updates its rates annually, and shipments often occur years after signing  the FMS agreement.", "The distinct factors used to determine the fee and cost for FMS  transportation make it difficult for the cost and fee to align, which has  potential implications for the fee\u2019s equity. Although the data DSCA  obtained from the military departments for its fiscal year 2018 rate review  was unsuitable for that purpose because it was not timely or statistically  sampled, we performed extensive data reliability procedures to determine  that the individual cost and fee data points are reliable and as a result  analyzed these data to obtain insights into the extent to which the cost  and fee were aligned within that sample. As shown in figure 9, we found  extreme differences between the transportation cost billed to the FMS  transportation accounts and the fee the purchaser paid. Within this  nongeneralizable sample, costs and fees were within 10 percent of each  other for only 30 of the 1,152 cases or shipments (3 percent), whereas  the difference was more than 1,000 percent higher or lower for 492 of the  cases or shipments (43 percent). In addition, we identified five instances  of the difference between the cost and the fee exceeding 1,000,000  percent. Although these data were not systematically sampled to ensure  they would be indicative of the full population of shipments, the high  incidence of such large differences is concerning. Within this sample, we  also found that certain countries were either always over-charged or  always under-charged. Since the rate review data are not generalizable,  this pattern may or may not be consistent across FMS shipments.  However, such a pattern could plausibly occur due to the differences  between TRANSCOM\u2019s and DSCA\u2019s rate areas.", "Potential concerns about the fee structure\u2019s efficiency and revenue  adequacy also stem from the difficulty in aligning the current fee structure  with related costs.", "Efficiency. The large disparities between cost and fee in the current FMS  transportation fee rate structure may be leading some FMS purchasers to  choose not to use DTS. According to Army officials, some FMS  purchasers choose to use their own freight forwarders instead of DTS  because of a perception that the FMS transportation fee is too high.  These decisions could have broader effects on DTS. According to  TRANSCOM, the additional demand from FMS purchasers allows  TRANSCOM to better leverage DTS, such as by filling excess capacity  with paying cargo and supporting training needs to maintain combat  readiness.", "Revenue adequacy and stability. The potentially large differences  between the transportation cost and fee resulting from the current FMS  transportation fee rate structure has led to large fluctuations in collections  and expenditures over time. For example, in fiscal years 2009 and 2011,  DSCA had to redistribute a combined $130 million into the main FMS  transportation account from the FMS administrative fee account to cover  costs and avoid insolvency.", "Around the time of the fiscal year 2009 rate review, DSCA began  reviewing the fee rate\u2019s structure as part of an overall attempt to address  issues related to the transportation account nearing insolvency. As part of  that review, DSCA worked with the military departments and TRANSCOM  to assess factors such as administrative burden, data availability, and  ability to more accurately charge transportation costs to FMS purchasers,  which would have enhanced the fee\u2019s equity and efficiency. Specifically,  they considered the benefits and costs of six alternative rate structures:", "Three of the six options would have involved replacing the rate-based  fee for some or all shipments, by charging actual transportation costs  or estimating likely actual costs per type of item. According to  documentation from this review, the DOD agencies said these three  options would have placed high administrative burdens on the military  departments and required changes to military department or  TRANSCOM information systems.", "The other three options the DOD agencies considered would have  modified the structure of the current rate-based fee to take into  account additional factors, such as transportation method (e.g., air)  and item weight, or creating additional rate areas to target specific  locations where costs of transportation were higher. The agencies  determined that some of these options would have a lower  administrative burden than the first three options.", "However, DSCA decided to maintain its current fee rate structure and  address the potential insolvency through other approaches such as by  redistributing funds from the FMS administrative fee account to the  transportation account.

The fees  collected from these estimated prices and the  costs to transport these items are paid in and  out of the FMS transportation accounts.  These prices are not location-specific  because DOD charges each purchaser of this  item the same estimated price. According to  DOD officials, such items are often low- weight, high-cost items, such as missiles, for  which the usual transportation fee rate could  greatly overcharge the FMS purchaser.", "DSCA\u2019s internal guidance for how to estimate these transportation prices  includes limited information and does not take into account key  information for accurately estimating transportation costs. Specifically, the  guidance lists certain types of transportation cost elements to include and  not to include in these price estimates. For example, estimated port  handling costs should be included while security costs should be charged  to the FMS purchaser separately. The guidance also indicates the  estimates should be on a per-item basis with two potential prices to  transport each item, one for any transportation within the United States  and one for transportation to any foreign destination. Other key factors in  transportation costs, such as the transportation mode or specific origin or  destination, are not considered. Also, DOD charges these prices per item,  although economies of scale can be gained by transporting batches of the  same item together.", "The lack of specificity in DSCA\u2019s internal guidance has led the military  departments to adopt inconsistent estimation processes that may not lead  prices to approximate actual costs. These inconsistent processes could  lead DOD to charge FMS purchasers more or less than DSCA intends  and ultimately affect account balances. For example:  Origin and destination. The three military departments take different  approaches to compensate for having to estimate the cost of transporting  an item without knowing its specific origin and destination. Although all  military departments follow the same general process of estimating  potential transportation costs for commonly used origin and destination  ports and averaging these to attempt to estimate these prices, they all  use different locations to create their estimates, which leads to different  pricing. For example, one command within Army uses a central location  within the United States as the origin for its estimates to simulate an  average of potential costs for transportation from any continental United  States location. However, according to Army officials, another command  within Army attempts to ensure that the transportation price estimated will  cover costs by simulating a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d by basing its estimates  on locations distant from each other.", "Batch shipments. The military departments also vary in terms of how  they estimate per item costs for items that could often be transported in  batches. Air Force and Navy calculate how many of an item can fit in a  container, and then divide the average price estimated to transport such a  container by this batch size to determine final pricing, but Army does  not. When Air Force and Navy estimate prices this way, they do not  require shipments to be transported in a container of this size or for  purchasers to buy or receive these items only in batches of this size,  which could lead the price charged to vary greatly from the actual costs.  For example, for one type of missile, Air Force determined that 20 of them  could fit in a container and therefore divided the average price it had  estimated to transport a container by 20 before submitting the price to  DSCA. Therefore, if only one of the item were purchased, instead of the  20 built into the estimate, the transportation cost could be about 20 times  the fee.", "The lack of specificity of DSCA\u2019s guidance has also led to large changes  in one of the military departments\u2019 estimated prices after staff turnover.  According to the Air Force official who prepared Air Force\u2019s 2018 updates  to these prices, that was the first year that official estimated these prices  after another Air Force official had done so through 2015. The new Air  Force official said that Air Force had not updated its prices during the  previous 3 years because it lacked rates to estimate the costs of  transporting explosive materials by ocean vessel. After receiving  guidance from DSCA to exclude these rates from their estimates, the new  Air Force official updated the prices for 2018. When doing so, this Air  Force official found that some of the updated price estimates were much  higher than the prior prices due to increased port handling rates, whereas  the prices to transport items to foreign destinations were at times lower  due to lower air rates used in the estimates. For example, the price to  transport a certain item within the continental U.S. had been set at  $278.00 per item for 2015 through 2017, and the 2018 price estimate was  $8,447.00. DSCA initially accepted the updated prices, but Air Force later  rescinded them after foreign partner countries voiced concerns about the  increased prices affecting existing contracts and Air Force was unable to  prove that the new estimates better approximated actual costs without the  ability to compare actual bills with the price estimates. According to the  responsible Air Force official, the calculation process from 2015 was used  to recalculate the 2018 prices and was again used for 2019, albeit with  current fiscal year rate information, due to continued uncertainty  regarding this process.", "Since late 2016, the military departments have voiced concerns to DSCA  regarding the difficulty of following DSCA\u2019s internal guidance to estimate  these transportation prices. In particular, in late 2016, Army officials  developed a white paper for DSCA that described challenges developing  these estimated prices posed by updates to how TRANSCOM calculates  its transportation pricing. In September 2018, Air Force officials also  raised various concerns regarding the accuracy of the prices, such as  concerns about how the batch size of a shipment affects per item costs  and the lack of key details affecting transportation costs. Military  department officials said they would prefer more specific guidance from  DSCA that could help them to more uniformly calculate these prices. In  January 2019, DSCA officials stated they were at an early stage of  exploring possible changes to the information required to calculate these  types of transportation prices. In May 2019, DSCA officials stated that  they were still working to define the problem and how it could be  addressed. Further research into the military departments\u2019 difficulties in  establishing these price estimates and the costs and benefits of the  methodologies they use would better inform DSCA on what pricing  process could most accurately reflect costs moving forward."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FMS is one of the primary ways the U.S. government engages in security  cooperation with its foreign partners, by annually selling them billions of  dollars in defense items and services. When transporting FMS items on  their behalf, DOD charges purchasers a transportation fee such that,  according to DOD, it should involve \u201cno profit, no loss\u201d\u2013foreign partners  should not be charged excessive fees and fee revenue should cover the  program\u2019s operating costs. However, from fiscal year 2007 to 2018, the  FMS transportation accounts experienced substantial balance growth of  over 1300 percent. To address risks such as the historical unpredictability  of collections and expenditures prior to recent dramatic account growth,  DSCA implemented processes to conduct daily and annual management  oversight of the accounts. However, the effectiveness of these processes  is limited by a lack of specific internal guidance. In particular, although the  daily reviews are meant to keep DSCA aware of significant changes in  the accounts and ensure that they maintain healthy balances, DSCA has  not specified what should be considered as significant changes or how to  calculate healthy target levels for the accounts. Lack of rigorous annual  review processes has also led the annual reports provided to DSCA  management to be missing key details. In particular, they have contained  incomplete information on the causes for account trends and have  omitted information on the source of $130 million that had been  redistributed into this fee account from the FMS administrative fee  account in fiscal years 2009 to 2011 to address a danger of insolvency  that the FMS transportation accounts no longer face. The resulting  reports inhibit DSCA management\u2019s ability to oversee the accounts at a  time when they have grown so quickly. In addition, a lack of clear internal  guidance explaining how to assess when redistributions are needed and  when to return unused BPC-specific transportation funds may lead to a  surplus of funds in the FMS transportation accounts that could be used  for other purposes.", "Similarly, DSCA has established a process to review FMS transportation  fee rates but this process has several weaknesses that may skew  DSCA\u2019s rate setting decisions. DSCA\u2019s rate review process involves  analysis of historical cost and fee data provided by the military  departments, but due to unclear requests to the military departments, the  process is burdensome and leads to data that are untimely and  unsystematically sampled. Although DSCA requested such data from the  military departments five times between fiscal years 2007 to 2018, DSCA  only conducted rate reviews using these data twice because DSCA did  not prioritize use of its resources for the other reviews. In addition, for the  two reviews it did conduct, DSCA never used Air Force or Navy data  because unclear guidance from DSCA and difficulties finding sufficient  data across disparate DOD information systems limited the data Air Force  and Navy could provide. Further, DSCA based their reviews on minimal  internal guidance and used limited analysis and unclear criteria upon  which to set new rates.", "The current rate review process and the overall fee rate structure reduce  DSCA\u2019s administrative burden, but raise various concerns regarding the  fee\u2019s equity, efficiency, and revenue stability. DSCA also has similarly  unclear internal guidance for the military departments for situations when  the FMS purchaser is charged a set transportation price per item instead  of a transportation fee rate. By strengthening these rate setting  processes, DSCA would enhance its ability to manage account balances  and to make timely decisions to ensure the FMS transportation fee rate is  set to cover related transportation costs but not overcharge FMS  purchasers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following 10 recommendations to DOD:  The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA clarify  internal guidance for daily account reviews by specifying criteria for the  level (such as percentage or dollar amount) of change in transportation  account balances that would require DSCA to contact DFAS for further  examination. (Recommendation 1)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  establish a methodology to calculate a target range, with desired upper  and lower bounds, for FMS transportation account balances that could be  used to better inform DSCA\u2019s account reviews. (Recommendation 2)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  modify the internal guidance for the annual review process to include the  specific steps DSCA officials should take in preparing the annual report,  including ensuring that they incorporate rigorous analysis into the annual  reports. (Recommendation 3)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  develop internal guidance related to the redistribution of funds between  the FMS trust fund fee accounts. Such internal guidance could include  criteria for when to consider redistributing funds between accounts and  for when to return those funds, how to analyze the amount of any  redistributions needed, and how to clearly report any redistributions to  DSCA management. (Recommendation 4)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  assess whether funds redistributed from the administrative account to the  transportation account should be moved back to the FMS administrative  account and document this decision. If the Director of DSCA determines  that the funds should be moved back to the FMS administrative account,  the Director should ensure the movement of funds in accordance with this  decision. (Recommendation 5)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  develop internal guidance for the steps that DSCA, in combination with  DFAS, should undertake when a BPC-specific transportation account  closes to help ensure that any remaining unused funds are transferred to  the miscellaneous receipts of the U.S. Treasury in accordance with DOD  officials\u2019 stated intention to do so. (Recommendation 6)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA create  specific internal guidance for how and from where data should be  obtained to be used for its transportation fee rate reviews and the  timeframes the data should cover to ensure DSCA has a systematic  sample upon which to base its rate setting decisions. This updated  internal guidance should be based on consultations with the military  departments, DFAS, and TRANSCOM on which sources of transportation  cost and fee data are the most reliable and comparable for use in its FMS  transportation fee rate reviews. (Recommendation 7)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  develop specific internal guidance to follow when performing  transportation fee rate reviews. Such internal guidance could specify  when these reviews should occur; a process to obtain management  commitment to complete a review before DSCA requests that the military  departments compile data for it; and a process for performing the reviews  that includes developing clear, documented goals and an appropriate  level of analysis to best ensure that DSCA\u2019s analysis meets those goals.  (Recommendation 8)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  conduct a review of the current structure of the FMS transportation fee  rate, in consultation with other relevant DOD agencies, to determine if  other rate structures could better balance considerations related to  administrative burden, equity, efficiency, and revenue adequacy.  (Recommendation 9)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA clarify  internal guidance for the military departments on how to calculate the  estimated actual transportation prices to charge FMS purchasers for  certain items, such as by specifying a calculation methodology. This  updated internal guidance should be based on consultations with the  military departments, TRANSCOM, and any other relevant DOD  components on which sources of data and which calculation  methodologies would be most accurate.

We chose to review  data from these fiscal years based on data availability. To determine the  reliability of these data, we reviewed the data for internal consistency by  reviewing for duplicate entries, gaps, and obvious errors, and we  compared the data to similar data obtained for a prior review of two other  FMS fees. We also reviewed relevant documentation, including annual  account assessments conducted by DSCA and the internal control  procedures for conducting such reviews. Lastly, we interviewed DFAS  and DSCA officials to clarify questions about how to interpret the data.  We did not conduct any independent testing of the data obtained from  DFAS to determine whether the amounts reflected correct payments  made toward accurate billings. As such, when presenting collections and  expenditures, we note that they reflect the amount of funds in the  aggregate moved into and out of the FMS transportation accounts. We  determined the collections, expenditures, and balance data to be reliable  for the purpose of showing the movement of funds in and out of the FMS  transportation accounts and the accounts\u2019 balances over time.", "To analyze trends in collections into and expenditures from the FMS  transportation accounts, such as in figures 4 and 6, we adjusted the data  to remove the effects of two redistributions from the FMS administrative  fee account that took place in fiscal years 2009 and 2011, as well as  amounts that were moved into certain new Building Partner Capacity  (BPC) transportation accounts to initially fund them in fiscal years 2012  and 2015. We reviewed documentation related to the two redistributions  of funds from the FMS administrative fee account to the transportation  account and the initial funding amounts allocated to new BPC  transportation accounts, and interviewed DFAS and DSCA officials to  understand how they accounted for these fund movements.", "To assess the extent to which DSCA established and implemented  policies and procedures to help ensure management oversight of the  FMS transportation accounts, we reviewed DSCA internal guidance  included in DSCA\u2019s Managers\u2019 Internal Control Program (MICP)  procedures for daily and annual FMS transportation account reviews,  federal internal control standards, our prior report on federal user fees,  and documentation showing how DSCA officials implemented those  procedures. We also interviewed DSCA officials responsible for these  reviews.", "Daily reviews. We reviewed a DSCA spreadsheet in which DSCA  officials documented the daily reviews they conducted in fiscal year  2018. We chose to review this one fiscal year of data because it was  the most recent complete fiscal year and would thereby be most  relevant to current implementation. We also analyzed these data  against the related MICP procedures, interviewed relevant DSCA and  DFAS officials, and requested documentation of related  correspondence to determine the extent to which DSCA consistently  took any actions in response to these reviews. Because the data in  these daily reviews is sourced from the same balance data in DIFS as  we analyzed for our first objective, we compared the data between the  two sources to ensure its consistency, and interviewed DFAS and  DSCA officials about how these data were pulled for the daily reports.  Based on these steps, we determined these data to be sufficiently  reliable for assessing DSCA\u2019s implementation of the daily review  process.", "Annual reviews. We reviewed the annual reports DSCA created for  fiscal years 2015 to 2018\u2014all of the years for which DSCA created  such reports\u2014and interviewed DSCA officials about their process for  creating these reports and other aspects of the MICP procedures for  the annual review. To determine the extent to which the annual  reports accurately convey information about the causes of trends in  the accounts, we compared account expenditures data to oil price  data for fiscal years 2007 to 2018. We performed this analysis  because DSCA\u2019s annual reports cite declining oil prices as a factor  contributing to the increasing account balances in the FMS  transportation accounts. For data on oil prices, we analyzed data from  the U.S. Energy Information Agency on Cushing, Oklahoma, West  Texas Intermediate oil prices by month, which is an established  source for these data that is used commonly as a global benchmark  for oil prices. As such, we determined these data to be reliable to use  for this purpose. We also reviewed legislation that changed the rates  the Department of Defense (DOD) can charge for FMS air shipments,  and interviewed DSCA and U.S. Transportation Command officials  about the effect and timing of this legislative change. We also  reviewed the fiscal year 2015 to 2018 annual reports for the FMS  transportation and administrative accounts to determine whether the  redistributions that had been made from the FMS administrative  account to the FMS transportation accounts were clearly reported,  and reviewed related internal guidance in DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulations.", "For BPC-specific transportation accounts, we reviewed DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulations and related DSCA documentation against  federal internal control standards regarding the clarity of internal control  guidance. We also interviewed DSCA officials and received written  responses to questions from DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) regarding the process DSCA should follow when  any of the BPC-specific transportation accounts close.", "To review the extent to which DSCA processes ensure that transportation  fee rates are set appropriately, we reviewed DSCA guidance and  interviewed DSCA and military department officials about the different  processes DSCA uses to set transportation fees. For the transportation  fee rate review, we reviewed DSCA\u2019s MICP procedures and the requests  DSCA sent to the military departments for data to analyze in its rate  reviews against the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards  No. 4, our prior report on federal user fees, and federal internal control  standards. To understand the reliability of the data the military  departments submitted to DSCA and what these data showed in terms of  the alignment between transportation costs and fees, we reviewed the  data, including by performing internal consistency checks on the data,  such as by reviewing it for duplicate entries, gaps, or obvious errors. We  also reviewed any military department procedures for compiling these  data and interviewed or received written responses from military  department officials responsible for compiling the data. Based on these  steps, we determined that these data were reliable for our purposes of  making some comparisons between costs and fees for the sample  provided. However, as noted earlier in this report, the departments could  only provide partial data, which they did not select using systematic  sampling techniques to ensure the data were indicative of the full  population of shipments. Therefore, we determined that these data were  unsuitable for DSCA\u2019s purpose of making fee-setting decisions.", "We also reviewed DSCA documentation of the analysis it performed for  its 2009 and 2018 transportation fee rate reviews, including analysis  spreadsheets and briefings to DSCA management on the reviews\u2019  results. Regarding instances when DOD charges FMS purchasers  estimated transportation prices instead of a transportation fee rate, we  reviewed DSCA guidance on this process in the Security Assistance  Management Manual against related federal internal control standards.  We also reviewed any internal guidance the military departments have  developed to further guide these estimation processes, examples of the  military department estimation processes, and other documents that  showed concerns regarding these processes that the military  departments had previously raised to DSCA.
