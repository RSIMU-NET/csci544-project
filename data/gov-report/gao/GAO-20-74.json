In 2012, statutory changes limited eligibility for the program in the contiguous United States to those communities receiving EAS in fiscal year 2011. Further statutory changes set a maximum average per-passenger subsidy, and a minimum number of passengers, that some communities would have to meet to retain eligibility. DOT also resumed enforcing the $200 per-passenger subsidy cap for certain communities. While these changes limited eligibility, in some cases the changes also gave DOT the option of providing waivers\u2014most of which DOT granted. Thus, as noted, the overall number of communities receiving EAS remained about the same; however, EAS expenditures increased from $161 million in fiscal year 2010 to $277 million in fiscal year 2018 (see figure). DOT officials said this increase was due, in part, to factors affecting the entire airline industry, such as increased labor wages.", "Community officials and air carriers GAO interviewed cited several challenges associated with EAS and suggested options for reform. For example, some carriers said it was difficult to find and retain pilots due to an insufficient supply of qualified pilots. At the same time, pilot wages have increased, making it difficult to provide quality service without exceeding the subsidy caps. Some carriers and community officials noted that the $200 subsidy cap has not changed for several years to account for inflation or these increased costs. To address these and other challenges, stakeholders suggested a number of options, such as indexing the $200 subsidy cap to inflation or allowing communities that lost eligibility to re-apply for the program. Several of these reforms would result in additional program costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As part of the 1978 deregulation of the U.S. airline industry, Congress  established the Essential Air Service (EAS) program to ensure that  communities continued to have access to the nation\u2019s air transportation  system. To accomplish this access, the Department of Transportation  (DOT) selects air carriers willing to provide commercial air service with  subsidies to eligible communities that would not otherwise receive it.  During fiscal year 2018, the program received $288 million in  appropriations, and at the end of fiscal year 2018, 108 communities were  receiving service under the program in the contiguous United States, and  65 communities were receiving service in Alaska and Hawaii. We have  previously reported that Congress should consider re-examining the  program\u2019s objectives, given changes in the airline industry and other  factors. Since 2010, several legislative changes have been enacted that  have limited access to EAS subsidies by, among other things, changing  eligibility requirements. Despite these changes, program costs have  continued to rise, prompting questions about whether additional  modifications should be made to EAS to make it more cost-effective and  to improve service to small communities.", "Section 452 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 includes a provision  for us to examine the EAS program. This report discusses: what EAS communities and available studies indicate is the economic  effect of air service on small communities; how federal laws enacted since 2010 and DOT\u2019s issuance of waivers  have affected EAS and air service to communities funded through the  program; and  challenges that selected communities and air carriers face with EAS  and options they identify for EAS reform.", "To address all three objectives, we interviewed representatives, such as  airport managers and local government officials, from 17 selected  communities who have participated in EAS within the contiguous United  States. Of these communities, 14 are currently part of the EAS program,  and three were previously eligible to receive subsidized air service  through the EAS program. We selected these communities based on  several factors, including that those selected provide a mix of  communities that participated in the Alternate Essential Air Service  (AEAS) program and those that did not, a mix of those that received  waivers and those that did not, a range in the distance from larger  airports, and geographic dispersion throughout the contiguous United  States. We asked community representatives about the economic effect  of air service on the local economy, the effect of statutory changes since  2010 on air service to their communities, actions they have taken to  increase enplanements or reduce ticket prices, the challenges they  currently face in the EAS program, and options for future reform of the  program. See appendix I for a list of communities we interviewed.", "To determine what available studies indicate regarding a link between air  service and the economies of small communities, we reviewed 13  economic studies that examined whether the availability and extent of air  service was associated with economic growth in a local area.

Out of our larger  search results, we identified 13 relevant studies. We focused primarily on  studies that were empirical and published between 2008 and 2018. By  using varied model structures and techniques, most of the studies we  reviewed examined whether the level of airline activity\u2014such as  enplanements or number of flight departures\u2014appeared to influence local  economic factors. Economic factors analyzed in these studies included  growth in population and employment as well as the level or growth of  per-capita income and regional economic output. For each of the 13  identified studies, an economist reviewed the study and prepared a  summary of the findings that were elicited from the study. Then the  studies and findings were then reviewed by a senior social science  analyst. In addition, for the 6 studies where we cite specific findings, a  second economist conducted an additional review to verify the  appropriateness of the study.", "To determine how federal laws enacted since 2010 and the issuance of  waivers have affected EAS and air service to communities funded  through the program, we reviewed relevant federal laws and DOT orders  to identify changes since 2010 related to EAS and to determine the  number of communities that lost eligibility as a result of those changes.  We reviewed appropriations and expenditures data to determine how  EAS funding levels have changed since 2010. While we did not  independently assess the accuracy of the data, we compared the data to  previously reported figures and presented the data to relevant  stakeholders; we determined the data to be reliable for our purposes. We  also reviewed waivers that DOT has granted to EAS-subsidized  communities to determine how many waivers DOT granted and the  reasons it did so, and we interviewed DOT officials to obtain information  about the process used to grant waivers.", "To identify the challenges that communities and air carriers face with EAS  and options that exist for EAS reform, we interviewed representatives of  communities as described above as well as representatives of 10 of the  11 air carriers that are currently providing EAS in the contiguous United  States. We requested interviews with all 11 air carriers; 10 agreed to be  interviewed and one declined. (See appendix I for a list of the air carriers  we interviewed.)

As of October 1, 2018, 108  communities within the contiguous United States (as well as 65 in Alaska  and Hawaii) were receiving EAS (see fig.1).", "To be eligible for EAS, a community must: be located more than 70 miles from the nearest large or medium hub  require a subsidy per passenger of $200 or less, unless the  community is more than 210 miles from the nearest large or medium  hub airport or unless DOT decides to issue a waiver; have a subsidy per passenger of less than $1,000 during the most  recent fiscal year at the end of each EAS contract, regardless of the  distance from a hub airport; have had an average of 10 or more enplanements per service day  during the most recent fiscal year, unless the community is more than  175 driving miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport or  unless DOT is satisfied that any decline below 10 enplanements is  temporary; and have received subsidized EAS in fiscal year 2011 or were provided a  90-day termination notice by an air carrier, and the Secretary required  the air carrier to continue such service to the community.", "EAS is funded through appropriations from a combination of discretionary  funding provided through annual appropriations acts, and overflight fees,  which are collected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from  foreign aircraft traveling over U.S. airspace without taking off or landing in  the United States. Historically, the amount of overflight fees provided to  EAS has been $50 million per year, but the FAA Modernization and  Reform Act of 2012 directed that all overflight fees be directed to EAS, an  action that which resulted in an increased proportion of the program being  funded by overflight fees (see fig. 2).", "The minimal level of service each community is required to receive\u2014the  minimum number of roundtrips and passenger seats that must be  provided, certain characteristics of aircraft to be used, and the maximum  number of permissible stops to a medium or large hub airport\u2014are all  established in law. In general, current law requires that an EAS carrier  provide the following:  service to a hub airport, defined as an FAA-designated medium- or  large-hub airport;  two daily round trips, 6 days a week, with not more than one  intermediate stop to the hub;  flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of  passengers with connecting flights and at prices that are not  excessive compared to prices of other air carriers for like service  between similar places;  service in an aircraft with an effective capacity of at least 15  passengers, under certain circumstances, unless the affected  community agrees in writing to the use of smaller air craft;  service in an aircraft with at least two engines and using two pilots;  and  service with pressurized aircraft under certain circumstances.", "DOT awards contracts to individual air carriers to serve EAS communities  on a rolling basis throughout the year. According to DOT officials, DOT  takes the following steps:", "DOT issues a request for proposals to all carriers to provide air  service to an eligible community.", "Air carriers submit proposals that include the size of the aircraft to be  used, the frequency of service, potential hubs, and the amount of  subsidy required. Air carriers request subsidies at a level to cover the  difference between their projected revenues and expenses, and to  provide a profit. While there are no limits on the amount of subsidy  that a carrier can request in its proposal, a community can become  ineligible for EAS if the annual subsidy exceeds $1,000 per passenger  regardless of distance from the nearest hub airport or $200 per  passenger if it is located fewer than 210 miles from the nearest large  or medium hub airport.", "DOT reviews the proposals and selects an air carrier to provide air  service to the community, generally for a contract period ranging from  2 to 5 years. When selecting air carriers to provide service to EAS  communities, DOT is directed by statute to consider five factors:  service reliability, contracting and marketing arrangements with a  larger carrier at the hub, \u201cinterline agreements\u201d with a larger carrier  at the hub, whether the air carrier has included a plan in its proposal  to market its service to the community, and user preferences. In  addition, the Secretary may consider the relative subsidy  requirements of the carriers. By statute, the subsidy is set at an  amount to cover the difference between the carrier\u2019s projected costs  of operation and its expected passenger revenues, while providing the  carrier with a profit element typically equal to 5 percent of total  operating expenses.", "DOT awards a contract and pays air carriers based on the number of  flights completed in the prior month. Air fares on EAS routes are set at the  air carrier\u2019s discretion without input from DOT.", "In 2003, the Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act  established the AEAS, which allows communities to forgo subsidized EAS  for a prescribed amount of time in exchange for a grant to spend on  options that may better suit their transportation needs. For example, a  community under AEAS may use the grant to purchase an aircraft to  meet transportation needs or may receive some flexibility on operating  requirements. Under AEAS, the community must still adhere to EAS eligibility requirements, and the maximum annual grant amount may not  exceed the annual EAS subsidy at the time of application to the program  or what DOT would pay to maintain EAS at the eligible community. For  example, if an air carrier received a subsidy of $1 million per year to serve  a community and the community decides to leave EAS and enter AEAS,  then the grant amount to the community under AEAS may not be more  than $1 million per year. As of September 2019, 8 of the 108 EAS  communities in the contiguous United States were participating in the  AEAS.", "In addition, federal funds are available to support airports\u2014including  airports that receive subsidized EAS\u2014through the Airport Improvement  Program (AIP). AIP grants are awarded to public entities to make capital  improvements\u2014such as runway and taxiway improvements. The level  of AIP funding that an airport receives is based on the number of annual  enplanements at the airport. For fiscal year 2018, airports with 10,000 or  more passengers were entitled to at least $1 million; airports with  between 8,000 and 10,000 passengers were entitled to $600,000, and  airports with fewer than 8,000 passengers were eligible for $150,000.  Thus, the number of enplanements at an airport receiving subsidized EAS  may affect the amount of AIP funds for which the airport is eligible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EAS Can Provide a Number of Benefits to Communities", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the 14 communities receiving EAS that we interviewed cited  several economic benefits of the local air service they receive:", "Economic development, including the ability to attract and retain  businesses and professionals: When asked what benefits they  received from local air service, officials from all 14 communities  mentioned that having access to reliable air service through EAS was  crucial for economic development in their community, including the  ability to attract and retain businesses and professionals. In three of  the communities, officials told us that the first question a business  asks when deciding to locate to the area is if air service is available.", "Increased tourism to the community: When asked about benefits,  officials in 6 of the 14 communities mentioned that EAS helps to bring  tourists to the community. One community official told us that having  access to air service through EAS was a key factor in the community\u2019s  being selected to host the Boy Scout Jamboree, which brought 8,000  volunteers and 45,000 Boy Scouts to the area.", "Creation of jobs related to air service: Officials from 4 of the 14  communities also mentioned that EAS brought jobs related to air  service to the community, including TSA personnel, airport  employees, airline employees, and concessionaire employees such  as those at fixed-based operators and airport restaurants. In  addition, some community officials told us that having air service in  the community creates other types of jobs and supports area  industries, such as hotels, restaurants, and rental car companies.", "Further, community officials told us that EAS provides other benefits in  addition to economic benefits. Officials from 11 of the 14 communities  mentioned that EAS allows residents to more easily travel and be  connected to the rest of the world. Officials in 3 communities said that  residents use EAS to travel to larger cities for medical services that are  not available locally, such as procedures and appointments with  specialists.", "Officials whom we interviewed in three communities that lost eligibility for  subsidized EAS told us that losing air service has had a negative  economic effect. For example, officials in one community told us that the  lack of air service has decreased the ability of local businesses, hospitals,  and colleges to recruit for professional-level jobs, such as physicians and  professors, who have travel needs to maintain proficiency in their field. An  official from another community told us that losing EAS led to decreased  enplanements, which, in turn, reduced the amount of AIP funding that the  airport receives. With less AIP funding, the airport is not able to pay for  improvements that would attract or enable air carriers to serve the  community.", "Most of the studies we reviewed found there to be a correlation between  aviation activity and economic development. Specifically, several of the  findings indicate that greater aviation activity in a region is correlated with  some increase in the growth in population, employment, or per capita  incomes. The size of the influence in these findings was relatively small  but statistically significant. For example, one study found that a 1 percent  rise in passengers per capita was associated with 0.055 percent rise in  output per capita and another study found that a 10 percent increase in  number of nonstop destinations served from an airport was associated  with a 0.13 percent increase in employment and a 0.2 percent increase in  average wage.", "One study that specifically examined the effect of subsidized air service  found that the availability of EAS was related to a small but statistically  significant increase in per-capita income in the local market. Specifically,  this study found that a 1 percent increase in traffic at an airport receiving  subsidized EAS was related to a 0.12 percent increase in per-capita  income. Further, another study that focused solely on small airports  found airport activity was associated with higher per-capita income, while  another study found that more rural areas experienced an even greater  benefit of nearby aviation activity than did more urban areas.

Some of the increased program  expenditures were due to increased costs of certain critical resources  over the last several years, such as pilots\u2019 salaries.

For example, some regional airlines that  serve EAS communities have experienced financial difficulties, and in  some cases, contracts with new carriers have increased in price to factor  in costs associated with replacing the previous carrier\u2019s service. DOT  officials noted that larger air carriers that serve many markets have more  options available to help offset industry-wide cost increases, such as  increasing fares on more commercially viable routes, whereas some of  the smaller carriers that primarily service EAS markets have fewer  options on the revenue side to offset cost increases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EAS Program Stakeholders Cited Challenges to Retaining Eligibility and Suggested Options for Reform", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Communities and Air Carriers Reported Challenges That Include Maintaining Quality Air Service and Dealing with a Shortage of Qualified Pilots to Serve EAS Routes", "paragraphs": ["Community officials and air carriers that we interviewed described several  challenges they face with regard to maintaining viable service.

Some community  officials also said good quality service involves seamless connections to  large hubs with regional jets. When a carrier does not provide what  communities and passengers see as quality service, the number of  enplanements decreases because people stop using the service. As a  result, the carrier may decrease the number of flights per day to make the  service financially viable. However, the reduction in frequency could  further degrade the quality of service. Carrier representatives explained  that many factors affect the quality of service carriers are able to provide  and communities explained that unreliable service can result in several  problems for them.", "Decline in Enplanements: Officials in most of the communities (15 of  17) said that a lack of quality service from the carrier had been a  challenge and in many instances (14 of 17) had led residents to opt to  travel to an alternative larger airport for service. The resulting decline  in the number of enplanements can put a community at risk of losing  EAS eligibility because it may not be able to achieve an average of at  least 10 enplanements per service day or stay under the $200  subsidy-per-passenger cap. Officials from one community said that its  EAS carriers\u2019 cancelled flights and lack of interline agreements with  mainline airlines had resulted in customers choosing to drive 80 miles  to fly out of a large hub airport rather than use the local airport.", "Providing Service within Subsidy Caps: Four of the carriers we  interviewed said that increased costs\u2014such as those resulting from  increased pilot wages\u2014make it difficult to provide service within the  subsidy caps, which have not been increased to account for inflation.  An official from one carrier said that factors such as the increasing  costs for pilots and an insufficient number of aircraft operating with  less than 50 seats make it difficult for a community airport to comply  with the $200 subsidy-per-passenger cap. According to  representatives of the carrier, in some instances, they are paying their  pilots 75 percent more than they were 5 years ago. They said that to  compensate, the carrier may have to raise fares, a step that could  lead to losing passengers and potentially put communities at risk of  losing eligibility for EAS.", "Loss of Customers\u2019 Confidence: Three of the carriers we interviewed  said that when they were selected to replace carriers that had not  provided reliable service to a community, it took time to regain the  community\u2019s confidence and attract people to use their EAS air  service. If these air carriers had not been able to regain the  community\u2019s confidence and increase enplanements, the community  may have lost eligibility for EAS.", "Loss of AIP Funding: A decline in the number of enplanements may  also lead to a reduction in AIP funding available to the airport. AIP  funding is important for small communities that have fewer financial  resources than large- or medium-sized airports. AIP funding can  help airports make improvements that could attract more business,  such as from commercial and business aviation.", "Pilot shortage: Aviation stakeholders have voiced concerns that there is  an insufficient supply of qualified pilots to support current and future  demand from U.S. regional and mainline airlines. In May, 2017, the  Working Group on Improving Air Service to Small Communities found that  as a result of the pilot shortage, there were too few pilots to fly all the EAS  routes. In June 2018, we found that labor market indicators for the pilot  occupation were consistent with the existence of a pilot shortage.  Carriers and community officials that we interviewed cited the following as  issues related to the pilot shortage.", "Difficulty Retaining Pilots: Officials from 6 of the 10 carriers we  interviewed said that it has been a challenge to retain sufficient pilots  to provide the air service they have committed to providing under  EAS. Pilots often start their careers with smaller air carriers that may  serve EAS communities, and after a few years in the business, pilots  are hired by larger airlines offering higher pay and more opportunities  for advancement. Officials from 3 of the 10 carriers we interviewed  said that they have responded to the pilot shortage by operating eight-  or nine-seat aircraft under Part 135 regulations, which allows them  to use pilots that have less flight time as first-officers. This increases  the pool of pilots who can fill first-officer positions and gives these  pilots the opportunity to build flight hours toward their Airport  Transport Pilot license.", "Reduced Service Quality: Officials from 15 of the 17 communities we  spoke with said that a shortage of pilots has been a challenge.  Specifically, the pilot shortage has resulted in a reduction in service  quality for some EAS communities because the air carrier has not  been able to attract enough pilots to provide reliable service. Six of 17  communities told us that their enplanements declined and that some  had lost service for a period of time due to a lack of pilots. For  example, an official from one community said their carrier ended  service to the community in 2014 due the industry-wide pilot shortage.", "Airport costs: Air carriers must pay fees to use airport facilities. Fees are  charged for landing, counter and gate space, parking, and other airport  facilities. These varied fees are part of carriers\u2019 operating costs. Officials  from 3 of the 10 carriers we talked to said that these airport costs may be  difficult to cover because carriers serving the EAS program use relatively  smaller aircraft with fewer passengers, and therefore, the carrier must  charge more per passenger to cover the costs. For example, an official  from one carrier we interviewed said that a community wanted to have an  EAS flight that flew into Las Vegas; however, the airport in Las Vegas  charged a single-aisle 9-seat aircraft the same landing fee as any other  single-aisle aircraft, some of which can hold hundreds of passengers.", "Production and supply of small aircraft: Because there is a lack of  availability of aircraft between 19 and 50 seats, in some cases, DOT,  airlines, and communities have to choose service with a plane that is  either too small or too large for demand. Manufacturers have said they  are generally not producing this size aircraft because there is less  demand and higher costs since they must certify them under Part 25  regulations for scheduled commercial service as opposed to the lower  costs incurred under Part 23 regulations.", "Insufficient or Excess Capacity: Officials from 12 of the 17  communities we interviewed said that the declining production and  supply of 19- to 50-seat aircraft has been a challenge for the EAS  program. Officials from 2 communities we interviewed said they have  moved to larger 50-seat aircraft, which means the communities might  have too much capacity. On the other hand, officials from 11 of the 17  communities we interviewed expressed concerns about receiving  service from a carrier that operates aircraft with less than 15 seats  because, according to six communities we spoke with receiving air  service from a carrier that only operates eight- or nine-seat aircraft  may not provide sufficient capacity to allow the community to fulfill the  EAS annual enplanement requirements, and thus, the community  could lose eligibility for EAS. In addition, officials from 5 of the 17  communities were concerned that some people have an aversion to  or difficulty getting into small aircraft that could deter them from using  the service.", "Financial Effects on Air Carriers: Officials from 5 of the 10 carriers we  interviewed said that the lack of available aircraft between 19 and 50  seats is a challenge. For example, an official from one carrier was  concerned that operating eight- or nine-seat aircraft may limit their  ability to serve EAS communities whose enplanements are increasing  because the carriers would have to add seat capacity either through  increased frequency of flights or larger aircraft they do not currently  own in order to decrease the subsidy-per-passenger costs. However,  if the carrier uses an aircraft with 50 or more seats, the carrier must  have sufficient increasing demand to fill that plane on a regular basis  to justify the capital expenditure and increased costs to operate.  Furthermore, according to officials from another air carrier, eight- or  nine-seat aircraft were not designed to operate with the frequency that  small carriers are using them, which can reduce reliability and  increase maintenance and operating costs.", "Driving Distance Calculation: While communities that we interviewed  cited several specific benefits of the local air service they receive, as  previously discussed, some expressed concerns about specific aspects of  the program. Officials from 5 of the 17 communities we interviewed said  that DOT\u2019s calculation of the shortest driving distance between the  community and the nearest large- or medium-hub can affect their  eligibility requirements. DOT relies on the driving distance calculation to determine which communities are subject to the 10-enplanement and  $200 subsidy-cap requirements. According to community officials, the  easiest, safest, and quickest route from the community to the airport may  be further than what DOT has calculated as the shortest driving distance,  which could make the community exempt from these requirements. For  example, one community official we spoke with told us that most people  in the community take the expressway to the nearest hub airport, which is  further from the center of the community to the airport than the two-lane  route DOT uses in its calculation. An official from another community we  interviewed said that DOT should take into account the time required to  drive the route and the safety of the roadway when calculating the  distance for EAS eligibility. The official explained that the route should  take 2 hours to drive but often takes much longer due to traffic and  delays, and expressed concerns that the route is very dangerous.", "Carrier Contracts: Contracts in the EAS program are in the form of DOT  Orders announcing the carrier selected to serve a route and the subsidy  awarded to the carrier. The Orders contain information such as the  annual subsidy rate, the time frame for service, and various carrier  requirements. Officials from 6 of the 17 communities we interviewed said  that the structure of DOT\u2019s contracts with EAS carriers can present a  challenge because the communities feel they provide little to no leverage  over a carrier that provides unreliable service. Officials from five  communities said that EAS contracts do not include performance  requirements or have penalties if the carrier does not meet service quality  standards or targets. As previously discussed, officials from 15 of the 17  communities we interviewed told us that they had not received quality  service at some point in the EAS program, which can result in declining  enplanements and, ultimately, the community losing eligibility for the EAS  program. However, if a community wants to have DOT cancel a contract,  the community might lose air service if there is not another carrier  interested in providing service.", "DOT has stated that the EAS program already provides financial  incentives for carriers to provide reliable service. For example, DOT  states that its \u201cno fly, no pay\u201d policy encourages carriers to complete flights because DOT reimburses carriers only for flights that they actually  operated. Further, DOT also believes that carriers have financial  incentives to increase completion rates above the rate estimated in their  proposals. Because carriers frequently account for predictable flight  cancellations they have an incentive to beat their estimate. Furthermore,  carriers have the financial incentive to provide quality service to avoid  losing enplanements and maintain a financially viable service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Suggested Several Options for Changing the EAS Program to Improve Service, but Some Would Likely Increase Costs", "paragraphs": ["The communities and air carriers we interviewed suggested potential  reforms to EAS that they believed would improve service to their  communities. Several of these changes would likely result in increased  program costs.", "Change the subsidy cap: Officials from two communities and four  carriers we interviewed said that the $200 per-passenger-subsidy cap  should be changed, either by indexing the cap to inflation or  increasing the cap temporarily for a community to allow a carrier more  flexibility to develop a market for new service in a community or to  account for higher labor costs. Since the subsidy cap is established in  statute, revising it would require a legislative change. An official from  one community said that increasing the cap for inflation would allow a  carrier to use a larger aircraft, thereby improving use of the airport.  One air carrier official said the cap needs to be increased to reflect  rising labor costs. In its October 2014 notice of enforcement policy,  DOT said that while it recognized the cap has not kept pace with  inflation, the requirements of the statute did not provide DOT with the  discretion to adjust the subsidy cap amount or refrain from  enforcement. However, DOT issued waivers to 34 communities that  did not meet the $200 subsidy cap from 2014 through 2019.", "If the subsidy cap were tied to inflation since its inception in 2000, the  cap would be $283 in 2018. Of the 55 communities that were subject  to the subsidy cap in 2018 because they are within 210 miles of a  medium- or large-hub airport, 39 were under the subsidy cap and 16  exceeded it. Our analysis shows that if the subsidy cap were adjusted  for inflation, an additional 10 communities would fall under the subsidy  cap, and only 6 communities would exceed it. See figure 5.", "Renegotiate EAS agreements: Officials from 3 of the 10 carriers we  interviewed said they should be permitted to request additional funds  from DOT during the course of a contract. In 2009, we reported that  allowing air carriers to renegotiate EAS contracts in response to rising  costs would enable carriers to continue rather than file a Notice of  Termination. As previously discussed, carriers we interviewed cited  airport and operating costs as challenges they have encountered over  the course of an EAS contract. Legislation passed in 2003 explicitly  provided DOT with the option of adjusting the subsidy paid to an EAS  carrier if the carrier\u2019s expenses substantially increased. However,  DOT officials said that to date no carrier has petitioned for such an  increase.", "Revise DOT\u2019s calculation of the driving distance: As mentioned  earlier, to determine whether an EAS community is subject to the 10- enplanement-per-day and subsidy-cap requirements, DOT must  determine the shortest driving distance from the center of the  community to the nearest large- or medium-hub airport. Officials from  four of 17 communities we interviewed suggested that DOT adjust its  calculation to account for local factors, such as the time required to  drive the shortest route, the condition of the road, and the most  common route that members of the community use to get to the  nearest large- or medium-hub airport. Considering these factors could  result in communities not being subject to the limit on eligibility of  requiring an annual subsidy per passenger of $200 or less, if the more  commonly used or faster route is more than 210 miles from the  nearest large or medium hub airport.", "Allow communities to regain eligibility: Officials from two communities  and two carriers we interviewed suggested that subject to the  availability of funds, communities that lost eligibility for the EAS  program should be allowed to regain it if they are having difficulty  obtaining air service without a subsidy. Officials from one community  and one carrier we interviewed said communities that lost EAS  eligibility as a result of unreliable service from their carrier should not  be penalized by losing EAS program eligibility. According to DOT,  they consider such circumstances when deciding to grant a  community a waiver. In other instances, communities lost eligibility  because they were not receiving EAS in fiscal year 2011. An official  from one carrier suggested communities that regain eligibility could  pay a co-share of the subsidy costs, possibly limiting the effect on the  cost of the program.", "Some of the options that communities and carriers suggested, such as  revising DOT\u2019s process for carrier selection and restructuring DOT\u2019s  contracts with carriers could address the challenges in the EAS program  but not necessarily increase program costs.", "Revise DOT\u2019s process for carrier selection: Officials from 3 of the 17  communities and 4 of the 10 carriers we interviewed suggested that  DOT adjust its method for carrier selection to account for factors such  as the carrier\u2019s financial viability, ability to comply with enplanement  requirements, and agreements with mainline carriers, as well as the  number of available pilots and mechanics in order to ensure that  carriers are capable of providing good service to EAS communities. In  addition, officials from one community also suggested that DOT give  more weight to community preferences regarding carrier selection.  While DOT is required to consider factors such as service reliability,  interline agreements, and carrier financial and operating fitness when  selecting a carrier, most of the communities we interviewed cited the  quality of service they have received through the EAS program as a  challenge.", "Include performance measures in DOT\u2019s contracts with air carriers:  Officials from four communities and one carrier suggested that DOT  include performance measures in EAS contracts to ensure carriers  are held accountable for providing a given level of service and subject  to penalties for not meeting service quality targets. For example, one  community official suggested that on-time performance and  percentage of flights cancelled could be included as performance  measures for EAS carriers. Officials from three communities and one  carrier suggested that DOT include more requirements for service to  EAS communities. For example, DOT could require that EAS carriers  provide service to large-hub airports and have agreements with  mainline carriers that could enhance quality of service; however, an  official from one air carrier told us the carrier was reluctant to enter  into agreements with smaller air carriers that serve EAS communities  because they did not want their reputation to be negatively affected if  the air carrier did not provide reliable service. An official from another  carrier suggested that it is beneficial for carriers to enter into longer  contracts because they can spend more time building the air service  market for the communities they serve rather than renewing contracts.  The officials said that for longer contracts DOT should include  performance measures that require the carrier to provide a minimum  level of reliable service or lose the route.", "Limit airport fees for EAS carriers: Officials from 3 of the 10 carriers  we interviewed thought DOT should limit fees airports charge to EAS  flights, such as landing fees and gate charges in order to increase the  financial viability of EAS routes. Airport fees can be based on any  number of factors including weight and number of seats on the  aircraft. According to FAA\u2019s policy on establishing airport charges, it  recognizes airports are allowed to charge fees to help ensure their  financial viability and at the same time those fees should be  reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory. FAA\u2019s policy further  indicates that the issue of rates and charges is best addressed at the  local level by agreement between users and airports.", "Change EAS from a carrier subsidy program to a community grant  program: Officials from three communities we interviewed thought that  similar to AEAS, DOT could consider providing a grant to a  community in lieu of traditional EAS to allow the community more  control over the service they receive. For example, an official from  one community said that they liked the additional control the AEAS  program has given the community over the service and that AEAS  gives the community more weight with the carrier when there is a  complaint about the service. Officials from three air carriers told us  that a potential downside to this option is that it would be more  complicated because carriers would need to work with individual  communities for payment instead of just DOT.
