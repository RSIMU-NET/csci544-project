EPA carries out a large part of its mission by awarding grants and contracts to states, public and private entities, and other federal agencies. More than 70 percent of EPA\u2019s budget is used to award grants and contracts. Once a grant or contract is completed or terminated and once the applicable budget or project period has expired, the agency must determine if the required work was completed and then close out the project, which includes making any final payments due the recipient. One of the primary purposes of closing out grants and contracts is to ensure that any unliquidated obligated funds are recovered and used for environmental programs, as permitted by statute. The unliquidated funds from completed grants and contracts represent millions of dollars that potentially could be recovered, deobligated, and used to provide EPA with additional resources needed to fund other environmental programs. The timely closeout of grants and contracts is also an important financial management practice to ensure that the terms of the contracts and grants are accomplished.", "The timely closeout of inactive grants and contracts\u2014those completed grants and contracts whose required time period for closeout has expired\u2014is a long-standing management problem for EPA.

Also identified as a separate material weakness was the untimely closeout of construction grants for wastewater treatment facilities. Government entities were provided with these grants to improve water quality. In 1994, EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that a significant number of inactive contracts needed to be closed out. EPA has developed several initiatives to reduce the number, or backlog, of inactive grants and contracts requiring closeout.", "This report responds to your request that we (1) identify EPA\u2019s efforts to close out inactive grants and contracts; (2) identify the progress that EPA has made in reducing the number of inactive grants and contracts, identify the number of remaining inactive grants and contracts, and identify the dates by which they are expected to be closed out; and (3) determine the amount of unliquidated obligations for inactive grants and contracts.", "To respond to these objectives, we reviewed documents, interviewed EPA officials, and reviewed a random sample of grant and contract files.

The Grants Administration Division\u2019s grant management functions are performed through EPA\u2019s 10 regional Grants Management Offices and two Grants Operation Branches in Washington, D.C. Three Office of Acquisition Management contracting offices, located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Washington, D.C., perform most of the agency\u2019s contracting activities.", "The closeout of federal grants and contracts is required within specified time periods after the grants and contracts are completed or terminated. EPA\u2019s Final Closeout Policy for Assistance Agreements establishes the agency\u2019s policy for closing out all completed grants. The grants addressed in this policy include nonconstruction grants, such as grants to states for conducting air quality monitoring activities or grants to universities for conducting environmental research. Completed nonconstruction grants should be closed out within 180 days after all of their terms and conditions have been satisfied. Construction grants are used for designing and constructing wastewater treatment facilities to improve water quality in specific geographical areas. The required closeout time frame for construction grants varies, depending on the last grant action (e.g., final audit resolution, project returned unaudited by the Office of Inspector General, final debt collection, or forgiveness or dismissal of debt). Generally, the closeout for construction grants should begin within 6 months of the last grant action.", "Contracts are used by EPA for obtaining goods and services, such as the services of contractors who remove hazardous waste at abandoned industrial sites. The Federal Acquisition Regulation sets the time standards for closing out completed contracts. These standards, which depend on the nature of the contract, range from 6 to 36 months after the physical completion of the contract. In addition to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, EPA refers to its Acquisition Handbook in implementing the agency\u2019s closeout procedures for managing contracts. The regulations and handbook provide for uniform and systematic procedures for promptly closing out completed contracts. Closeout actions may begin when a contract is physically completed, which occurs when the contractor delivers all goods or performs all services as required. A contract is also considered complete when EPA gives the contractor notice of complete contract termination.", "A significant number of inactive grants and contracts were not closed out in a timely manner and grew into a significant work backlog. In 1996, there were nearly 18,000 inactive nonconstruction grants requiring closeout, and at the end of fiscal year 1990, there were 5,860 construction grants requiring closeout. In 1994, EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that approximately 2,000 inactive contracts required closeout."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Taken Several Actions to Close Out Inactive Grants and Contracts", "paragraphs": ["EPA has taken an aggressive approach to reducing the backlogs of inactive grants and contracts awaiting closeout. During the past 6 years, EPA has implemented several initiatives to address these backlogs and avert future ones. For example, EPA has developed automated systems to monitor the closeout process and streamlined closeout procedures to avoid unnecessary delays. These initiatives generally involved headquarters-developed strategies that required implementation by other organizational units. These units are in EPA\u2019s regional grants management or contracting offices that have primary responsibility for closing out the inactive grants and contracts. The initiatives vary in terms of scope and length of time, but they all attempt to focus management\u2019s attention on the issue of closing out inactive grants and contracts. The agency has developed a strategy for eliminating the backlog of nonconstruction grants and preventing a future backlog. A separate strategy was developed to reduce the backlog of wastewater treatment construction grants that were not closed out.", "While EPA has devoted considerable effort and resources to these initiatives, the closeout requirements and strategies that it developed have not been consistently implemented. While reviewing randomly selected files, we found that closeout procedures were not followed at times and that the strategies to avert a future backlog of grants requiring closeout were not implemented as required. For example, notification letters to alert grantees of the required reports for the closeout process were not always sent at the required intervals, and closeout strategies developed at the regional offices did not specifically describe how the plans for regional strategies would operate.

To clarify and emphasize closeout requirements for grants, EPA, in 1992, issued a policy\u2014the Final Closeout Policy for Assistance Agreements\u2014to all EPA organizations that were responsible for closing out grants. This document sets forth the agency\u2019s policy for closing out completed grants for all EPA programs. To ensure the timely closeout of grants, the policy requires that the agency\u2019s offices and grant recipients take certain actions within specified time frames. These time frames include those for agency offices to obtain required documents from grant recipients and take actions to complete closeouts. For example, 90 days before a grant ends, EPA is required to notify the grant recipient of the closeout requirements.", "The 1992 policy specifies that completed grants should be closed out within 180 days after all of their terms and conditions have been satisfied. For example, one grant that we reviewed, made to a Georgia county organization for providing environmental information to teachers, was completed in January 1996 and was closed in May 1996 when the organization received information that the program had been conducted as described in the project plan and that other terms of the grant were fulfilled. To ensure the timely submission of required documents showing that a grant\u2019s conditions have been satisfied, the 1992 policy contains a schedule for sending notification letters to the grant recipient requesting these documents. For example, a notification letter that provides instructions and lists the documents that the recipient must submit as a part of the closeout process should be mailed 90 days prior to the grant\u2019s ending date. Subsequent notification letters are required if the documents have not been received.", "EPA also implemented a policy in January 1998 to expedite the closeout of grants that expired prior to October 1, 1990. This policy provided that EPA could request required documents for several grants from the same grantee and that if the documents were not available or the grantee was no longer in existence, the grants could be closed without the required documents consistent with EPA\u2019s regulations. To avert a future grant backlog, the agency developed a strategy that includes identifying the required closeout documents for individual grants before the grants are awarded, requiring each grants management office to develop a closeout strategy, and streamlining closeout procedures to improve the effectiveness of the closeout process.", "Other ongoing initiatives taken by EPA include developing a pending grants closeout database to improve and track closeout information for EPA\u2019s headquarters program and grants management offices, pilot testing an automated notification system to provide EPA with information on required reports for closing out inactive grants, and tracking and monitoring grants by their required closeout dates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Closeout Procedures and Plans for Nonconstruction Grants Were Not Consistently Followed or Implemented", "paragraphs": ["EPA did not always follow its procedures when closing out nonconstruction grants. Grants were closed out without the information needed to determine whether their objectives were accomplished or whether expenditures were made according to plans and requirements. For example, EPA\u2019s closeout procedures require that the grant project officer certify that the project has been completed in accordance with the conditions of the grant award. During our review of 15 randomly selected grant files, we found that only 2 files showed evidence that the final certifications were made by the project officers. In addition, a follow-up letter requesting required reports was sent to the grant recipient for only one file. Appendix I contains additional information on the results of our file reviews.", "EPA also closed out a number of pre-1990 inactive grants without required documentation by using its January 1998 policy to expedite the closeout of older grants. Agency officials could not identify the number of grants that were closed out under this policy. The implementation of the policy resulted in deviations from the agency\u2019s closeout procedures that might not have been needed if the grants had been closed out in a timely manner. Deviations from EPA\u2019s closeout procedures were attributed to such factors as EPA\u2019s not having received the final certification of a project\u2019s completion from the project officer or EPA\u2019s missing some required closeout reports (e.g., the final financial status report or federally owned property report). EPA officials cited these factors as some of the primary impediments they encountered when closing out the older grants.", "The strategy to avert a future backlog was also not consistently implemented. The regional grants management offices were required to prepare individual plans for averting a backlog, but our review of these plans showed that most generally restated the 1992 final closeout policy. As a result, the issues facing individual grants management offices were not addressed. Some submitted plans provided no assurance that another backlog would be averted because they lacked specific guidance on how they would operate. For example, the majority of the plans did not identify a specific strategy or methodology that would be used to accomplish closeout goals, and some did not contain any closeout strategy. Additional information on the lack of follow-through on closeout procedures or plans by EPA is found in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategies Have Not Resulted in the Closeout of All Construction Grants", "paragraphs": ["EPA has developed two closeout strategies for construction grants during the past 8 years. The objectives of the first strategy, developed in 1990, were not attained, and actions called for in the second strategy, developed in 1997, were not fully implemented. The construction grants program provided grants to municipalities for individual projects to improve water quality. Fiscal year 1990 was the final year that funding was authorized for the program. At the end of that year, 5,860 grant projects totaling $34 billion were yet to be completed and closed out. After 1990, state revolving funds were to provide loans for community wastewater treatment facilities. To close out these grant projects, in November 1990, EPA developed a closeout strategy that contained eight action initiatives to expedite the closeout process. The plan had a goal of closing out all grants by September 30, 1997. If all the initiatives had been implemented successfully, a substantial portion of the plan could have been completed by fiscal year 1996, and project audits and closeouts would have occurred shortly thereafter to reach the goal for fiscal year 1997. This goal presumed that EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General would take the steps necessary to eliminate the audit backlog and accelerate the audit process. Completed project grants were submitted to the Office of Inspector General for a decision on whether to audit the projects, and the Office had 3 years to make these decisions. To accelerate these audits, the Office of Inspector General had changed its audit-screening process in fiscal year 1995 by identifying 1,400 projects that were subject to review to determine whether an audit should be performed. The remaining projects did not have to be screened and could be closed without an audit. As a result, regional offices had an increased number of grants that they could close without a decision or audit by the Office of Inspector General.", "In June 1997, EPA issued a second closeout strategy, which recognized that all construction grants would not be closed out by the end of fiscal year 1997 for a variety of reasons. The plan stated that 497 of the 5,860 original remaining construction grants would not be closed out by the end of fiscal year 1997 and that a concerted effort would be required to close out these grants to prevent additional delays after fiscal year 1997. This closeout strategy also called for several initiatives, including reviewing the workload for grants in each region and identifying impediments to closing grants. Following the assessments, agreements were to be made between headquarters and the regions on plans to complete the closeouts and address the identified impediments. While EPA headquarters officials discussed impediments with EPA regional personnel, the actions to address impediments were not documented in regional agreements, and all of the impediments were not resolved. The plan also called for an assessment of key headquarters processes affecting the regional closeouts, but this too was not performed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Taken Efforts to Reduce the Number of Inactive Contracts Needing Closeout", "paragraphs": ["EPA took several actions to reduce the number of contracts that require closeout after we and the Office of Inspector General reported on the number of contracts that required closeout. In 1994, EPA officials distributed a memorandum instructing contracting offices to place special emphasis on decreasing the closeout backlog and closing out the older contracts. EPA also required contracting offices to establish annual goals for the number of contracts to be closed. For example, each contracting office submitted its closeout goals to the Office of Acquisition Management for fiscal year 1998. These goals were broken out by the age of the contracts\u2014those that were more than 10 years old, from 5 to 10 years old, and less than 5 years old. In total, all locations planned to close out 347 contracts during fiscal year 1998. As of October 1998, EPA did not know if this goal had been attained.", "During our review, EPA also took several other actions to help reduce the inventory of inactive contracts. First, EPA verified and is correcting the information in its automated database on the status of contracts, which supports its closeout activities. As a result, officials believe they have more accurate management information on the remaining contracts to be closed. Second, EPA established goals for a \u201creasonable number\u201d of contracts to be closed at each contracting location and is establishing expectations for when each location should reach these levels. Third, EPA is revising its closeout procedures, which the agency hopes will make it easier to close out more low-dollar-value contracts without a detailed audit. Audits can add significant time to the closeout process, and because the audits are generally conducted by other agencies, EPA has limited control to accelerate the audit process. EPA\u2019s acquisition regulations now allow a quick closeout\u2014without a detailed audit\u2014for contracts with total costs of $2 million or less. By contrast, the Federal Acquisition Regulation generally allows for quick closeouts if a contract\u2019s indirect costs are $1 million or less, regardless of the contract\u2019s total costs. EPA plans to eliminate the $2 million criterion in its regulation and use the $1 million indirect cost criterion specified in the general Federal Acquisition Regulation.

These disputes may result in lengthy administrative appeals.

This requirement adds time to the closeout process. For contract audits received in 1997, the average time between the dates when the audit was requested and received was 869 days. Adding to the closeout difficulty, cost reimbursement contracts are generally more complex than fixed-price contracts and require more closing documents. In reducing the number of contracts to be closed out, EPA has focused more on the fixed-price contracts, which are easier to close out because they do not require detailed audits and involve less documentation. From October 1993 through August 1998, EPA closed out 1,165 fixed-price contracts and 949 cost-reimbursement contracts.", "A second source of difficulty is the age of the remaining contracts, 37 percent of which have been inactive for over 5 years. The Federal Acquisition Regulation provides that once a contracting officer receives evidence of physical completion, an agency should close out a cost-reimbursement contract within 36 months and a fixed-price contract within 6 months.
