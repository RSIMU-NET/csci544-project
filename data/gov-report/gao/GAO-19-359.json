Tribal energy projects can help tribes fund programs and services that improve tribal members' quality of life. Federal agencies are large consumers of energy in the United States, spending about $6 billion in 2017 on energy for their facilities. Congress has provided a mechanism for agencies to support development and use of tribal energy by authorizing agencies to give preference to majority tribally owned suppliers when purchasing energy. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to use the preference.", "This report examines, among other objectives, the extent to which GSA, DOD, and DOE have used the tribal energy preference.

The section of the act that includes the preference provides federal agencies with mechanisms that can support development and use of tribal energy resources. The mechanisms include grants to assist tribes in developing their energy resources and authorization for agencies to give preference to majority tribally owned sources in federal energy purchases, so long as they pay no more than prevailing market prices and obtain no less than prevailing market rate terms and conditions. According to DOE, tribal lands account for 2 percent of U.S. land but contain about 6.5 percent of all utility-scale U.S. renewable energy potential.", "GSA, DOD, and DOE officials identified five instances in the past when a tribe bid for a federal energy contract, and the agencies did not use the preference in any of those instances. GSA awarded a contract to tribes in two of the instances. In the first instance, the tribe submitted the best bid. In the second, GSA officials attempted to use the preference by limiting the energy contract solicitation solely to tribal sources, according to a stakeholder that worked on the project, but the GSA Administrator expressed concern about limiting competition in that manner. GSA instead used the small business preference authority, through which the tribe ultimately won the contract. DOD and DOE received the other three bids, which did not lead to contracts because either the cost was too high or the bid was not needed by the agency, according to agency officials. Federal officials noted that use of the preference is discretionary. EPACT05, which says agencies \u201cmay give preference,\u201d does not require use of the preference, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation does not specifically address the preference.", "In November 2016, GAO reported that one reason federal agency officials cited for not using the preference was uncertainty about how to do so. GAO recommended that GSA develop guidance to clarify use of the preference across the federal government. GSA agreed that such guidance would be beneficial but stated that the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is the regulatory body empowered to address this issue. In April 2017, GSA presented the council with a business case on the issue. However, GSA officials told GAO that the council determined that the preference has limited application government-wide because it mainly affects GSA, DOD, and DOE, and that, accordingly, the council declined to issue regulations and recommended GSA consider nonregulatory paths. GSA then added the preference language to the form it will use if it delegates purchasing authority in the future.", "In 2018, federal agency officials told GAO they were uncertain how to use the preference. According to GSA and DOD officials, other statutes that authorize agencies to apply preferences for acquisition of goods and services from specific sources include more specific requirements in their statutory language, making them easier to apply. GSA officials noted that the Small Business Act, as amended, contains specific requirements and measurable goals that increase contracts awarded to small businesses. DOD officials stated that the agency might use the tribal energy preference if EPACT05 had similar requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To the extent that Congress wants to further encourage use of tribally owned energy sources, it should consider amending EPACT05 to provide more specific direction to federal agencies for implementing the tribal energy preference, to include consideration of additional incentives or requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Development of energy resources can be vital for the livelihood, well- being, and long-term economic sustenance of some tribes and their  members, in part because energy development provides opportunities to  improve living conditions and decrease high levels of poverty. Tribal lands  have considerable mineral energy resources, such as oil, gas, and coal.  These lands also have resources with significant potential for the  development of renewable energy, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and  biomass. Tribes may seek opportunities to use these resources to provide  revenue for their government operations and social service programs,  create high-quality jobs, and increase access to reliable and affordable  energy for tribal buildings and individual homes. According to the  Department of the Interior, oil and gas resources are among the largest  revenue generators for tribal lands.", "Tribes are also developing renewable energy projects that range from  facility- and community-scale production, such as rooftop solar panels or  a wind turbine to power a community center, to utility-scale production of  hundreds of megawatts of electricity. However, tribes pursuing utility- scale projects need a customer to purchase their power for such projects  to be economically feasible. According to the Department of Energy  (DOE), in fiscal year 2017, the government spent about $6 billion on  energy for roughly 3.2 billion square feet of buildings and facilities, with  the Department of Defense (DOD) accounting for over half of that  spending. By statute, the General Services Administration (GSA) has  primary authority for entering into energy contracts for federal agencies.", "GSA has delegated this authority to DOD and DOE so that they may also  enter into energy contracts.", "In a 2016 law, Congress noted that \u201cthrough treaties, statutes, and  historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a  unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and  Indians.\u201d The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) includes several  mechanisms that can support tribes in developing their energy resources.  For example, the act provides for federal grants, loans, and technical  assistance to tribes and tribal energy resource development organizations  to carry out energy projects and to process, use, or develop tribal energy  resources. Furthermore, EPACT05 authorizes federal agencies and  departments to meet their own considerable energy needs by giving  preference to majority tribally owned energy suppliers, with certain  requirements, and provides an incentive for using renewable energy  produced on tribal lands. However, we found in November 2016 that no  agencies had used the tribal energy preference, partly because no  government-wide guidance existed on when and how federal agencies  should use the preference. We recommended that GSA develop such  guidance for contracting officials purchasing energy, as discussed later in  this report.", "You asked us to provide information on federal energy purchases from  tribes and federal agency efforts to implement the tribal energy  preference. This report examines (1) potential limiting factors for federal  energy purchases from tribal sources, and suggestions for addressing  them, that federal officials, tribal representatives, and stakeholders have  identified; and (2) the extent to which GSA, DOD, and DOE have used  the tribal energy preference to meet federal energy needs.", "To identify potential limiting factors associated with federal energy  purchases from tribal sources and suggestions to address those factors, we interviewed 22 officials who GSA, DOD, and DOE identified as  knowledgeable of their respective agencies\u2019 energy purchases, and a  non-generalizable sample of five representatives of tribes or tribal entities  and eight other stakeholders using standard question sets. We selected  our sample of interviewees based on their knowledge of and experience  with tribal energy development, federal energy purchases, and tribal  interactions with federal agencies. Specifically, we selected  representatives of tribes that have sought partnership with the federal  government, have current utility-scale energy projects, or are working to  develop tribal energy projects, as well as representatives that other  interviewees recommended. In addition, we selected other stakeholders  to interview that worked with or assisted tribes with energy projects (e.g.  legal counsel, private energy developers). Information from tribal  representatives and stakeholders we interviewed presents a range of  informed views but cannot be generalized to other tribal representatives  or stakeholders.", "To examine the extent to which GSA, DOD, and DOE have used the tribal  energy preference to meet federal energy needs, we reviewed available  agency information and interviewed agency officials concerning the use of  the preference since its establishment in 2005. We also reviewed the  status of our past recommendation to GSA to develop guidance on how  to use the preference, as well as any guidance available from other  agencies with purchasing authority. If an agency had guidance on how to  use the preference, we compared agency actions to communicate this  guidance with federal internal control standards for information and  communication. In addition, we interviewed agency officials to  understand how agencies would use the preference when entering into  federal energy contracts with tribal sources.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to April 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

According  to DOE, while tribal lands account for only 2 percent of all U.S. land, tribal  land contains an estimated 50 percent of potential uranium reserves, 30  percent of coal reserves west of the Mississippi, and 20 percent of known  oil and gas reserves. Furthermore, DOE\u2019s National Renewable Energy  Laboratory also reports that these tribal lands contain about 6.5 percent  of all utility-scale potential U.S. renewable energy resources. Ninety  percent of this potential renewable energy capacity is for solar energy.  According to the laboratory, tribal lands have the potential for over 6,000  gigawatts of utility-scale solar photovoltaic capacity. To put this in  perspective, a single gigawatt of power running at full capacity has  approximately enough energy potential to power over 800,000 homes.  However, 86 percent of tribal lands with energy potential are  undeveloped, according to DOE.", "In July 2018, DOE announced the release of its Tribal Energy Atlas and  an accompanying report on the renewable energy potential on tribal  lands. The atlas, developed by the National Renewable Energy  Laboratory, is an interactive, web-based geospatial application that  provides information about energy resource potential on tribal lands (see  fig. 1). According to DOE, the atlas is the first of its kind; further, it is  available to tribal energy project planners, technicians, and investors to  assist with analyzing energy options on tribal lands.", "Previously, DOE had identified multiple tribal lands with undeveloped  energy resources that could potentially meet DOD energy needs.  Specifically, in a May 2013 report, DOE identified 15 reservations that  had, among other things, the potential to meet DOD energy needs and  were near existing transmission lines that could be used to transport the  energy from the reservation to the installation. The report was based on  a DOE survey of DOD installations that could have an interest in  purchasing energy from tribal sources based on the tribes\u2019 proximity to  the installations and the tribal energy sources\u2019 potential to meet  installation energy needs, among other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Policy Act of 2005", "paragraphs": ["EPACT05 has several provisions related to tribal energy resource  development.

In addition to these statutory and regulatory  authorities, the acquisition and supply of energy for federal agencies is  governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is issued  and maintained by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR  Council). The process GSA has prescribed for entering into federal  energy contracts varies by location, depending on market conditions and  state law. In traditional energy markets, retail customers such as GSA,  DOD, and DOE are typically required to contract with the local utility  operating in the area for energy. In deregulated markets, these  agencies publicly issue requests for proposals for energy, and energy  providers engage in a competitive bidding process for federal energy  contracts. Federal officials seeking to enter into energy contracts may  specify energy of certain types (for example, renewable sources may be  given priority) in the requests for proposals, and the energy contracts are  typically awarded to the best-value provider who meets the requirements  of the request for proposal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Officials, Tribal Representatives, and Stakeholders We Interviewed Identified Potential Limiting Factors and Suggestions for Federal Energy Purchases from Tribes", "paragraphs": ["Federal officials, tribal representatives, and stakeholders we interviewed  identified a number of factors that have the potential to limit federal  government energy purchases from tribal sources, and they offered  suggestions to address some of these factors. The factors, which  sometimes overlapped, included requirements to purchase from  monopoly utilities, difficulty entering the market at the prevailing rate,  access to transmission infrastructure, access to capital, and technical  capacity.", "Requirements to purchase from monopoly utilities. In traditional  regulated energy markets, retail customers, including federal agencies,  generally can only purchase energy from the local monopoly utility in that  region. According to officials from GSA, DOD, and DOE, this  requirement prevents agencies from purchasing from tribes. A  representative we interviewed from one tribal energy corporation  concurred with the agency officials\u2019 assessment. That tribal energy  corporation currently sells energy in wholesale markets and is interested  in selling energy to federal agencies, but it has not succeeded in doing so  because agencies typically make purchases as retail, not wholesale,  customers, according to the tribal representative. Nonetheless,  according to the tribal representative, retail customers, including federal  agencies, may have the option to purchase electricity as wholesale  customers in traditional markets if the entity is large enough, which would  allow them to purchase from sources such as the tribal corporation.", "GSA officials told us that purchasing energy as a wholesale customer  may not be in the best interest of the federal government, given the  associated technical requirements, including connecting to the grid in  ways GSA is not currently equipped for, and regulatory risk, such as  managing power in a way not required of retail customers. In particular,  GSA officials expressed concern about the regulatory requirements  associated with reselling any potential excess energy that may come with  a wholesale purchase. Additionally, DOE officials said there might be cost  considerations related to achieving and maintaining status as a wholesale  customer, as well as risks in giving up retail customer status, including the  loss of the utility\u2019s obligation to service the agency\u2019s facilities because it is  no longer a retail customer. In addition, according to DOE officials,  switching from retail to wholesale purchasing has historically presented  significant litigation risk, such as the utility challenging the legal and  technical basis for the government\u2019s change from retail to wholesale  customer.", "Difficulty entering the market at the prevailing rate. According to GSA  procurement guidance, the contracting process for public utility services  should obtain the best-value product for the government, which GSA  officials said typically awards the contract to the lowest-cost provider that  also meets technical requirements, potentially limiting federal agency  opportunities to purchase energy from tribes. In particular, tribes may find  it difficult to enter the energy market at competitive rates, according to  four federal officials and one stakeholder. For example, two DOE officials  provided examples of DOE receiving bids from tribes for federal energy  contracts but stated that both bids were unsuitable because their price  was higher than the market rate. One DOE official said that tribes  developing renewable energy projects would have to compete with lower- cost natural gas and hydroelectric energy, which could prevent tribes from  meeting the prevailing market rate. To help foster the success of such  tribal projects, one DOE official and one stakeholder suggested allowing  federal agencies to purchase energy from tribes at rates that exceed the  prevailing market rates.", "However, some tribes have successfully entered the energy market and  have sold energy at competitive rates. For example, representatives we  interviewed from one tribe and a renewable energy development  corporation owned by several tribes said they anticipate that their current  or future projects will allow them to sell energy at competitive rates, and  at least two tribes have entered into contracts with the federal  government. Moreover, since the beginning of 2017, DOE has seen an  increased interest from tribes in renewable energy projects because the  price of renewable energy has become more competitive with other,  lower-cost forms of energy, according to DOE officials. As tribes develop  more renewable energy projects, there may be additional opportunities for  federal agencies to purchase from tribes, which will also help these  agencies meet federal renewable energy goals.", "Access to transmission infrastructure. Lack of access to energy  transmission infrastructure may prevent tribes from transmitting their  energy off tribal lands, according to 10 federal officials, tribal  representatives, and stakeholders whom we interviewed. One DOE  official said the biggest challenge in contracting for energy with tribes can  be getting a physical connection to transmit power between the tribal  energy providers and a federal building. Federal officials from GSA and  DOE noted that there are few federal buildings close to tribal lands,  making transmission from those lands to federal buildings more complex  and expensive. A 2013 Edison Electric Institute report said that the cost of  new construction of overhead transmission lines can range from  $174,000 to $11 million per mile. DOE\u2019s Tribal Energy Atlas may assist  tribes in overcoming this factor because it provides information on  existing infrastructure, including transmission lines, giving tribes access to  data they need to make informed decisions about their energy  development options. Further, tribes are not limited to developing energy  projects on their own lands, which can eliminate issues with proximity to  federal purchasers. For example, one tribe near San Diego partnered with  a private developer to build a wind farm in Illinois to sell energy to GSA.", "The purchase was the largest wind energy purchase from a single source  in federal contracting history, according to GSA officials.", "Access to capital. Tribal energy development may be hindered because  of difficulty obtaining access to capital, potentially limiting federal energy  purchases from tribes. For example, one industry official we interviewed  who worked with a tribe in the process of developing a wind farm on its  reservation said the tribe does not have the necessary capital to connect  to the local transmission infrastructure. As a result, it cannot provide  power beyond the reservation. Likewise, nine federal officials and  stakeholders whom we interviewed said securing financing for energy  development could be difficult for some tribes. To overcome this potential  limitation, one group of tribes combined their resources and formed a  multi-tribal power authority, which allowed them to raise the necessary  capital to take on a larger-scale project while maintaining tribal ownership  and creating jobs in the tribal communities. The multi-tribal authority plans  to develop one of the largest wind farms in the country and sell the  energy at a competitive price, according to representatives from a  renewable energy development corporation owned by several tribes.", "Another option for tribes to address this limitation is tribes leasing their  land to private developers to operate and maintain energy projects,  thereby benefiting from their energy resources without having to raise the  capital needed to develop them but still receiving additional benefits for  the tribal community. For example, one tribal representative and one  stakeholder mentioned that training and educational programs for tribal  members could be part of these agreements between private developers  and tribes.", "Technical capacity. Some tribes may not have the technical capacity to  develop their energy resources, which can also limit federal energy  purchases from tribal sources, according to tribal representatives and  stakeholders we interviewed. For example, one tribal representative and  four stakeholders we interviewed said that some tribes lack experience  with energy development, which potentially limits their ability to take on  large-scale projects that could meet federal energy needs. Two  stakeholders noted the importance of tribes having access to  professionals with experience in running energy development projects to  help overcome this potential limitation.", "Federal agencies offer programs that could assist tribes with building  technical capacity. For example, the Department of the Interior provides  technical and financial assistance to tribes for the exploration,  development, and management of tribal energy resources. In addition,  DOE offers grants and education through webinars, forums, and  workshops. For example, DOE in August 2018 selected 15 tribal projects  to receive funding for developing their energy resources to reduce or  stabilize energy costs, as well as to increase energy security and  resilience on tribal lands. DOE has also provided technical assistance,  technology and market analysis, and capacity building for tribes, as well  as webinars on utility-scale energy development, fundamentals of energy  markets for tribes, and effective tribal project partnerships. However,  DOE\u2019s efforts have focused primarily on reducing tribal energy costs and  assisting tribes in developing energy for use on reservations, rather than  on selling energy to outside sources, according to DOE officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA, DOD, and DOE Have Not Used the Tribal Energy Preference Since Its Establishment, and EPACT05 Is Not Specific about Its Use", "paragraphs": ["Since the establishment of the tribal energy preference, GSA, DOD, and  DOE have not entered into an energy contract with a tribe using the  preference. The preference and other tribal energy resource development  provisions added in the tribal energy section of EPACT05 provide federal  agencies with mechanisms to support tribal energy development and use.  As noted previously, the section provided for grants to assist tribes in  developing their energy resources, authorization for federal agencies to  give preference to tribal energy sources when contracting for energy, and  double credit towards mandated renewable energy goals when federal  agencies contract for energy produced on tribal lands. GSA, DOD, and  DOE officials we interviewed identified five instances in the past when a  tribe bid on a federal energy contract, and agencies did not use the tribal  energy preference in any of these instances. Two of the instances led to  contracts with GSA because, in one of those instances, officials said that  the tribe submitted the best bid, and in the other, GSA used the small  business preference authority instead, as discussed further below. The  other three instances were bids to DOD and DOE; these instances did not  lead to contracts because either the cost was too high or the proposal  was unsolicited and not needed by the agency, according to agency  officials.", "Officials from GSA and DOD noted that EPACT05 makes use of the  preference discretionary because it says that federal agencies \u201cmay give  preference\u201d to a majority tribally owned energy source. Officials from  DOD said they cannot authorize agency officials to use the preference  without a policy or FAR requirement to use the preference. DOD officials  said they follow FAR regulations and guidance when implementing policy  and guidance for the agency, but the FAR has no provisions specifically  addressing the preference. Similarly, GSA officials told us they would be  hesitant to use the preference because they believe it limits competition  solely to tribal sources, which may not be in the best interest of the  federal government. GSA officials attempted to use the preference to limit  an energy contract solicitation solely to tribal sources in 2014, according  to a stakeholder that worked on the project, but the GSA Administrator  expressed concern about limiting competition in that manner. The  stakeholder noted that GSA instead decided to open the solicitation to  small businesses, and the tribe ultimately won the contract through the  small business preference authority.", "When we reported on implementation of the tribal energy preference in  November 2016, we found that federal agencies had not used the  preference because of uncertainty about how to do so and lack of  guidance. Because GSA has primary energy purchasing authority for  the federal government, we recommended that GSA develop  implementing guidance to clarify how contracting officials across the  federal government should use the preference. GSA partially agreed with  the recommendation, stating that guidance would be beneficial, but GSA  officials stated that government-wide rulemaking from the FAR Council, of  which GSA is a member, is necessary to clarify how agencies should use  the preference. Subsequently, GSA officials told us that in April 2017,  GSA presented the FAR Council with a business case that included an  analysis of the problem we identified. After reviewing the business case,  the FAR Council determined the preference has limited application  government-wide. GSA officials told us that the FAR Council declined to  pursue regulatory changes to the FAR because, according to the council,  the preference only impacts agencies responsible for entering into federal  energy contracts, mainly GSA, DOD, and DOE. Further, the FAR Council  recommended that GSA consider nonregulatory paths, in keeping with  Executive Order 13771, which aims to reduce costs associated with  regulatory compliance. In response to the FAR Council\u2019s  recommendation, GSA added the preference language from EPACT05 to  the form it uses to delegate purchasing authority to other federal agencies  that may seek this authority in the future.", "As we reported in November 2016, DOE in 2013 issued agency-specific  guidance on use of the preference, such as for limiting competition to  qualified majority tribally owned suppliers for the purchase of renewable  energy and energy by-products. DOE distributed the tribal energy  preference guidance through a February 2013 acquisition letter.  However, in our interviews with officials responsible for purchasing  energy in nine DOE offices, we found that officials in five of these nine  offices were unaware of the DOE guidance or unaware of the preference.  DOE headquarters officials stated that the agency did not take further  action to communicate the guidance or ensure relevant officials were  aware of it after its initial distribution. Under federal standards for internal  control, management should internally communicate the necessary  quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. According to DOE  documentation, the objectives of the guidance are to promote tribal  renewable energy development, reaffirm the federal government\u2019s trust  responsibility to tribes, and reinforce key national policy objectives such  as the acquisition and use of clean energy products. DOE officials agreed  that officials responsible for purchasing energy should be aware of the  agency\u2019s guidance and the preference. For example, officials from one  DOE office stated that its contracting officials are aware of the preference  because it has included the preference language in its requests for  proposals. By taking steps to communicate the guidance to all DOE  officials responsible for purchasing energy, DOE will be better positioned  to ensure that these officials are aware of the preference, which may  increase its use.", "In addition, officials from GSA, DOD, and DOE who are responsible for  purchasing energy told us they are still uncertain about how they would  use the preference. For example, officials from GSA stated that they  would use the preference as a tiebreaker at a minimum, but they also  noted that ties are unlikely and they had not seen any ties in bids to  provide energy in the last 4 years. They also noted that they would rely on  GSA\u2019s legal and acquisition policy offices for any instruction regarding  using the preference. Similarly, DOD officials responsible for energy  purchases stated they would have to consult with DOD\u2019s acquisition  policy office, which stated that DOD does not have guidance and could  not authorize use of the preference without a requirement in the FAR, as  discussed previously. Likewise, DOE officials were unclear about how  they would use the preference, stating that they would use the preference  by awarding the energy contract to a tribe if the tribe had the lowest bid.  However, the agency would not need to use the preference in such  situations because the agency generally awards contracts to the lowest  bidder, according to DOE officials.", "According to officials from GSA and DOD, other statutes that authorize  agencies to apply preferences for acquisition of goods and services from  specific sources include more specific requirements in their statutory  language, making the requirements easier to apply. For example, GSA  officials explained that the specific requirements and measurable goals  set under the Small Business Act, as amended, increases contracts  awarded to small businesses. In contrast, EPACT05\u2019s tribal energy  provision does not contain analogous specific requirements for how  agencies should use the preference. DOD officials stated that the agency  would potentially pursue using the tribal energy preference if EPACT05  required a certain amount of energy contracts to go to tribes, similar to  the Small Business Act\u2019s requirements for small businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Energy resources on tribal lands present an opportunity for individual  tribes that pursue development of these resources to improve their  socioeconomic status by generating income, jobs, and associated  economic development.
