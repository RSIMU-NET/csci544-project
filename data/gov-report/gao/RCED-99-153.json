The goals and measures define the level of performance and activities for specific programs. For example, the performance goal for reducing recreational boating fatalities from 819 in fiscal year 1997 to 720 or fewer in fiscal year 2000 will be accomplished by the core activities of several U.S. Coast Guard programs\u2014boating safety grants provided to the states, regulations developed by the Recreational Boating Safety program, and boat inspections conducted by the Coast Guard auxiliary.", "The plan\u2019s goals and measures are objective, quantifiable, and measurable. For all except a few performance goals, DOT\u2019s plan includes projected target levels of performance for fiscal year 2000; for several goals, the plan includes multiyear targets. For goals that have no targets, an appendix to the plan explains why a target was not included. For nearly all of the goals and measures, the plan includes graphs that show baseline and trend data as well as the targets for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. The graphs clearly indicate trends and provide a basis for comparing actual program results with the established performance goals. For example, the performance goal for hazardous materials incidents has a graph that shows the number of serious hazardous materials incidents in transportation from 1985 through 1997. The graph also includes target levels for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 so a reader can conclude that this goal is not new in the fiscal year 2000 plan. If only a fiscal year 2000 target is indicated on a graph, the reader can assume that this is a new goal; however, this point is not explicit. The plan could be improved by indicating new goals that do not have a counterpart in the previous version.", "In addition, the plan includes performance goals to resolve a few mission-critical management challenges identified by us and/or DOT\u2019s OIG.(See app. I.) For example, we reported that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had encountered delays in implementing security initiatives at airports. The plan includes a performance goal to increase the detection rate of explosive devices and weapons that may be brought aboard aircraft, which will help measure progress in implementing the security initiatives. However, for the majority of the management challenges that have been identified, the plan does not include goals and measures. For example, the plan lists several activities to address problems with FAA\u2019s $41 billion air traffic control modernization program, which since 1995 we have identified as a high-risk information technology initiative. The plan could be improved by consistently including goals and specific measures for addressing the challenges.", "In addition, the plan could be improved by more fully explaining how the Department will address certain financial management challenges identified by the OIG. For example, the OIG reported that the Department\u2019s accounting system could not be used as the only source of financial information to prepare its financial statements. The fiscal year 2000 plan does not address this issue. Additionally, we question whether the plan includes the most current or complete milestones for solving long-standing financial management weaknesses. For example, the plan states that in fiscal year 1999, FAA\u2019s new cost accounting system will capture financial information by project and activity for all of FAA\u2019s projects. However, according to FAA\u2019s fiscal year 1998 audit report, the cost accounting system that was scheduled to be operational by October 1, 1998, will not be fully implemented until March 31, 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s plan includes strategic outcomes for each of the Department\u2019s five strategic goals. For example, for the strategic goal of safety, the Department aims to achieve six strategic outcomes\u2014such as reducing the number of transportation-related deaths, the number and severity of transportation-related injuries, and the number of reportable transportation incidents and their related economic costs. The plan then lists specific annual performance goals that the Department will use to gauge its progress. However, in a few cases, the strategic outcomes have no related annual performance goals. For example, a strategic outcome related to mobility\u2014to provide preventative measures and expeditious responses to natural and man-made disasters in partnership with other agencies to ensure that the Department provides for the rapid recovery of the transportation system\u2014cannot be logically linked to any annual performance goals. The plan could be improved by including at least one annual performance goal for each strategic outcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crosscutting Programs", "paragraphs": ["For each performance goal, the plan typically mentions those federal agencies that have outcomes in common with the Department. The plan also indicates goals and measures that are being mutually undertaken to support crosscutting programs. For example, the plan states that both FAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have complementary performance goals to decrease by 80 percent the rate of aviation fatalities by the year 2007. However, the plan could be improved by describing the nature of the coordination and consistently discussing the Department\u2019s contribution to the crosscutting programs.

We observed that the fiscal year 1999 plan could have been improved by (1) explaining how the management challenges are related to the rest of the performance plan and by including goals and specific measures for addressing the challenges; (2) consistently linking strategic goals, program activities, and performance goals; and (3) indicating interagency coordination for the crosscutting programs and consistently discussing the Department\u2019s contribution to these programs. Among the improvements, the fiscal year 2000 plan describes the management challenges facing the Department, explains activities that will be undertaken to address them, and provides page citations for specific performance goals that address the challenges discussed elsewhere in the plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOT\u2019s Performance Plan Provides a Specific Discussion of the Strategies and Resources the Department Will Use to Achieve Its Goals", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s plan provides a specific discussion of the strategies and resources that the Department will use to achieve its performance goals. The plan covers each program activity in the Department\u2019s $51 billion proposed budget for fiscal year 2000. An appendix to the performance plan lists the Department\u2019s program activities and proposed funding levels by strategic goal. These funds are also mentioned in the discussions of strategic goals in the body of the plan.", "For each performance goal, the plan lists an overall strategy for achieving it, as well as specific activities and initiatives. For example, DOT expects to increase transit ridership through investments in transit infrastructure, financial assistance to metropolitan planning organizations and state departments of transportation for planning activities, research on improving train control systems, and fleet management to provide more customer service.", "However, our work has identified problems associated with some strategies. The plan identifies the rehabilitation of approximately 200 airport runways in the year 2000 as one of the activities contributing to the performance goal concerning the condition of runway pavement. We reported that there is a lack of information identifying the point at which rehabilitation or maintenance of pavement can be done before relatively rapid deterioration sets in. As a result, FAA is not in a position to determine which projects are being proposed at the most economical time. We have also reported on strategies for addressing the performance goal of reducing the rate of crashes at rail-grade crossings, some of which are included in the performance plan. For example, the plan addresses two strategies noted in our report\u2014closing more railroad crossings and developing education and law enforcement programs\u2014but does not address the installation of new technologies.", "For each performance goal, the plan also describes external factors, called special challenges, that can affect the Department\u2019s ability to accomplish the goal. For example, the performance goal for passenger vessel safety includes the external factors of (1) the remote and unforgiving environment at sea and human factors, which play an important role in maritime accidents; (2) the complexity of the operation and maintenance of passenger vessels; and (3) foreign and international standards that apply to vessels. The plan describes how particular programs, such as the marine safety program, will contribute to reducing the number of casualties associated with high-risk passenger vessels. The plan also indicates activities to address the external factors, including conducting oversight of technologically advanced vessels, such as high-speed ferries, and implementing and marketing the International Safety Management Code.", "In discussing corporate management strategies, the plan briefly describes how the Department plans to build, maintain, and marshal the resources, such as human capital, needed to achieve results and greater efficiency in departmental operations. The corporate strategies are broadly linked to the strategic goals. For example, the plan states that the human resource management strategy supports the strategic goals by ensuring that DOT\u2019s workforce has the required skills and competencies to support program challenges. The plan lists four key factors that will contribute to this corporate strategy: workforce planning that will identify the need for key occupations; managing diversity; learning and development activities to support employees\u2019 professional growth; and redesigning human resource management programs, such as personnel and payroll processing.", "In some cases, the plan lists specific programs under the corporate strategies but does not consistently identify the resources associated with them. For example, the plan discusses the completion of all remediation or appropriate contingency plans to make the computer systems ready for the year 2000 so that there are no critical system disruptions. However, there is no discussion of the resources needed to support this strategy.", "The discussion of strategies and resources in DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan is much improved over the fiscal year 1999 plan. We observed that the fiscal year 1999 plan generally did a good job of discussing the Department\u2019s strategies and resources for accomplishing its goals. However, we noted that the plan could have been improved in several ways, such as by more clearly describing the processes and resources required to meet the performance goals and recognizing additional external factors\u2014such as demographic and economic trends that could affect the Department\u2019s ability to meet its goals. DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2000 plan contains such information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT\u2019s Performance Plan Provides General Confidence That the Performance Information Will Be Credible", "paragraphs": ["The Department\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan generally provides a clear and comprehensive discussion of the performance information. The plan discusses the quality control procedures for verifying and validating data, which, it says, DOT managers follow as part of their daily activities, as well as an overall limitation to DOT\u2019s data\u2014a lack of timeliness\u2014and how the Department plans to compensate for this problem. In addition, for each performance measure, the plan provides a definition of the measure, data limitations and their implications for assessing performance, procedures to verify and validate data, the source database, and the baseline measure\u2014or a reason why such information is missing. For example, the plan defines the performance measure for maritime oil spills\u2014the gallons spilled per million gallons shipped\u2014as counting only spills of less than 1 million gallons from regulated vessels and waterfront facilities and not counting other spills. The plan further explains that a limitation to the data is that they may underreport the amount spilled because they exclude nonregulated sources and major oil spills. However, the plan explains that large oil spills are excluded because they occur rarely, and, when they do occur, they would have an inordinate influence on statistical trends. The plan also explains that measuring only spills from regulated sources is more meaningful for program management.", "However, in some cases, we found additional problems with DOT\u2019s data systems that could limit the Department\u2019s ability to assess performance. For example, the performance measure for runway pavement condition\u2014the percentage of runway pavements in good or fair condition\u2014is collected under FAA\u2019s Airport Safety Data Program. We reported that this information provides only a general pavement assessment for all runways. This information is designed to inform airport users of the overall conditions of the airports, not to serve as a pavement management tool. We further noted that these assessments are made by safety inspectors who receive little training in how to examine pavement conditions. The performance plan acknowledges our concerns and states that FAA will update its guidance for inspecting and reporting the condition of runway pavement and will ensure that inspectors are aware of the guidance. However, as of March 1999, FAA had not updated its guidance for inspectors. According to the National Association of State Aviation Officials, which is under contract to FAA to conduct inspections and provide data on runway conditions, new guidance would require additional training for all inspectors, which is not provided for in the contract. In addition, we discuss problems with DOT\u2019s financial management information later in this report.", "The discussion of data issues in DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan is much improved over that in the fiscal year 1999 plan and is well on its way to addressing the weaknesses that we identified in the fiscal year 1999 plan. We observed that the fiscal year 1999 plan provided a general discussion of procedures to verify and validate data, which was not linked to specific measures in the plan. For most measures, information about the data\u2019s quality was lacking. Among the improvements in the fiscal year 2000 plan is detailed information about each performance measure, which includes information on verification, validation, and limitations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Observations on DOT\u2019s Implementation of Performance-Based Management", "paragraphs": ["DOT is making good progress in setting results-oriented goals, developing measures to show progress, and establishing strategies to achieve those goals.

The Department\u2019s September 1997 strategic plan and performance plan for fiscal year 1999 were both considered among the best in the federal government. And, as discussed in this report, DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan improves upon the fiscal year 1999 plan. Furthermore, our work has shown that prior to these Department-wide efforts, several of DOT\u2019s agencies made notable efforts in becoming performance-based.", "For example, in reviewing programs designated as pilots under the Results Act, we noted the successful progress of the Coast Guard\u2019s marine safety program. We reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s pilot program became more performance-based, changing its focus from outputs (such as the number of vessel inspections) to outcomes (saving lives). The Coast Guard\u2019s data on marine casualties indicated that accidents were often caused by human error\u2014not by deficiencies in the vessels. Putting this information to use, the Coast Guard shifted its resources and realigned its processes away from inspections and toward other efforts to reduce marine casualties. We reported that the marine safety program not only improved its mission effectiveness\u2014for example, the fatality rate in the towing industry declined significantly\u2014but did so with fewer people and at lower cost.", "Additionally, in 1997, we cited the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as a good example of an agency that was improving the usefulness of performance information. The agency\u2019s fiscal year 1994 pilot performance report provided useful information by discussing the sources and, in some cases, the limitations of its performance data. In 1998, we again cited NHTSA as a good example of an agency that was developing performance measures for outcome goals that are influenced by external factors. Additionally, in 1997, we reported that the Federal Railroad Administration had shifted its safety program to focus on results\u2014reducing railroad accidents, fatalities, and injuries\u2014rather than the number of inspections and enforcement actions.", "The fiscal year 2000 performance plan indicates that the Department is taking further steps to instill performance-based management into its daily operations. According to the plan, DOT has incorporated all of its fiscal year 1999 performance goals into performance agreements between the administrators of DOT\u2019s agencies and the Secretary. At monthly meetings with the Deputy Secretary, the administrators are expected to report progress toward meeting these goals and program adjustments that may be undertaken throughout the year.", "Finally, some individual agencies in DOT have developed performance information that includes leading indicators associated with the Department-wide goals. For example, the Department\u2019s fiscal year 2000 budget submission for FAA\u2019s facilities and equipment includes 10 performance goals\u2014such as reducing the rate of accidents or incidents in which an aircraft leaves the pavement\u2014related to reducing the fatal accident rate for commercial air carriers. According to DOT\u2019s performance plan, such indicators will be used to help assess the results of DOT\u2019s programs and provide a basis for redirecting them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Implementing Performance-Based Management", "paragraphs": ["A key challenge that DOT faces in implementing performance-based management is the lack of accountability for its financial activities. In fact, serious accounting and financial reporting weaknesses at FAA led us to designate FAA\u2019s financial management as a high-risk area. From an overall perspective, DOT\u2019s accounting information system does not provide reliable information about the Department\u2019s financial performance. DOT\u2019s OIG has consistently reported that it has been unable to express an opinion on the reliability of DOT\u2019s financial statements because of, among other things, problems in the Department\u2019s accounting system. Although the fiscal year 1998 audit report stated that FAA is making significant progress, it cited deficiencies that include inaccurate general ledger balances and unreconciled discrepancies between the general ledger balances maintained in FAA\u2019s accounting system and subsidiary records. The OIG also cited problems with the Department\u2019s accounting systems that prevented the systems from complying with the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996. The OIG concluded that for the Department\u2019s systems to comply with the requirements of the act, the Department needs, among other things, to modify its accounting system so that it is the only source of financial information for the consolidated financial statements. Concerns have also been expressed by the OIG about the number and total dollar amount of adjusting entries made outside the accounting system to prepare the financial statements. For example, FAA made 349 adjustments to its accounting records, which totaled $51 billion, in the process of manually preparing its fiscal year 1998 financial statement.", "DOT is taking actions to correct the financial reporting deficiencies that were identified by the OIG. On September 30, 1998, the Department submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a plan that identified actions by DOT, especially FAA and the Coast Guard, to correct the weaknesses reported in the OIG\u2019s audits. For example, the plan called for DOT to complete physical counts of and develop appropriate support for the valuation of property, plant, equipment, and inventory at FAA and the Coast Guard.", "Furthermore, the Department\u2019s ability to implement performance management is limited by the lack of a reliable cost accounting system or an alternative means to accumulate costs. As a result, DOT\u2019s financial reports (1) may not be capturing the full cost of specific projects and activities and (2) may lack a reliable \u201cStatement of Net Cost,\u201d which includes functional cost allocations. The lack of cost accounting information also limits the Department\u2019s ability to make effective decisions about resource needs and to adequately control the costs of major projects, such as FAA\u2019s $41 billion air traffic control modernization program. For example, without good cost accounting information, FAA cannot reliably measure the actual costs of its modernization program against established baselines, which impedes its ability to effectively estimate future costs.
