However,  problems such as inadequately trained technologists or poorly functioning  equipment can lead to duplicative or inaccurate imaging tests,  unnecessary exposure to radiation, missed or inaccurate diagnoses, and  inappropriate treatment. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and  Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) required that beginning January 1, 2012,  suppliers of the technical component of ADI services\u2014specifically CT,  MRI, and NM, including positron emission tomography (PET)\u2014be  accredited by a designated accrediting organization in order to receive  Medicare payment for these services. The requirement applies to ADI  services provided in office settings, including physician offices and  independent diagnostic testing facilities (IDTF), which are paid under the  physician fee schedule.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers and  oversees the MIPPA accreditation requirement on behalf of the Secretary  of Health and Human Services and has selected four organizations to  serve as designated accrediting organizations\u2014the American College of  Radiology (ACR), the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (IAC), The  Joint Commission, and RadSite. In order to become accredited, ADI  suppliers must select one of the accrediting organizations and undergo an  accreditation review process to demonstrate that they meet the  organization\u2019s standards. Although the accreditation requirement has the  potential to improve the quality and safety of ADI services, it could  potentially disrupt Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to ADI services if some  suppliers are unwilling or unable to become accredited and, as a result,  stop furnishing ADI services to Medicare beneficiaries.", "MIPPA mandated that we issue a preliminary report in 2013 and a final  report in 2014 on the effect of the accreditation requirement administered  by CMS. Our first report, issued in May 2013, assessed CMS\u2019s standards  for the accreditation of ADI suppliers as well as its oversight of the  accreditation requirement. We found that CMS did not establish  minimum national standards for the accreditation of suppliers of ADI  services, but rather relied on its selected accrediting organizations to  establish their own standards for quality and safety. We also found that  CMS\u2019s oversight of the accreditation requirement was limited, as the  agency focused its initial oversight efforts on ensuring that claims were  paid only to accredited suppliers. We recommended, among other things,  that the Administrator of CMS determine the content of and publish  minimum national standards for the accreditation of ADI suppliers and  develop an oversight framework for evaluating accrediting organization  performance. The Department of Health and Human Services, which  oversees CMS, concurred with our recommendations. This final report  examines the effect, if any, of the accreditation requirement on  beneficiary access to ADI services provided in the office setting.", "To examine the effect the accreditation requirement may have had on  beneficiary access to ADI services in the office setting, we identified  trends in the number of these services provided to Medicare  beneficiaries\u2014an indicator of access\u2014before and after the accreditation  requirement went into effect. We examined these trends for each of the  three ADI modalities\u2014CT; MRI; and NM, including PET\u2014using Medicare  Part B Carrier claims from 2009 through 2012, which were the most  recent data available at the time of our analysis. We limited our analysis  to the technical component of those services that were provided in the  office setting, as the professional component is not subject to the  accreditation requirement. We further limited the ADI services in our study  to those Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes that are subject to  ADI accreditation, according to CMS. We excluded certain codes to  ensure that our results reflected trends in the number of ADI services  rather than changes in billing practices. Specifically, because CPT codes  can change over time, we excluded any codes from CMS\u2019s list that were  not billed at least once each year from 2009 to 2012. We also excluded  CPT codes for any services that were combined, or \u201cbundled,\u201d with  another service at any time during our study period. After these  exclusions, the codes we analyzed represented 171 of the 219 CPT  codes (78 percent) subject to the ADI accreditation requirement and   75 percent of Medicare-covered ADI services in 2012 that were subject to  the requirement. Using claims data for these CPT codes, we analyzed  trends in the number of ADI services provided to Medicare beneficiaries,  both at the national level and separately for urban and rural areas  nationwide, before and after January 1, 2012, the date the accreditation  requirement went into effect. Specifically, we examined the total number  of CT, MRI, and NM/PET services in the office setting per 1,000 Medicare  fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries each year from 2009 to 2012. In  2012, approximately 21 percent of ADI services included in our study  were provided in the office setting, while the remaining 79 percent were  provided in the institutional setting. Although our analyses provide insight  into the extent to which the accreditation requirement may have affected  access to ADI services in the office setting, we did not determine whether  a given level of utilization indicated sufficient access or whether changes  in ADI service use were medically appropriate. We assessed the reliability  of the data from CMS that we analyzed by reviewing relevant  documentation and examining the data for obvious errors. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our study.", "We also interviewed CMS officials, representatives of IAC and ACR\u2014the  two CMS-approved accrediting organizations that accounted for about   99 percent of all accredited suppliers as of January 2013, accredited ADI suppliers to obtain their perspectives on the effect of  accreditation on beneficiary access to ADI services.

NM uses radioactive materials in conjunction with  an imaging modality to produce images that show both structure and  function within the body. During an NM service, such as a PET scan, a  patient is administered a small amount of radioactive substance, called a  radiopharmaceutical or radiotracer, which is subsequently tracked by a  radiation detector outside the body to render time-lapse images of the  radioactive material as it moves through the body. Imaging equipment  that uses ionizing radiation\u2014such as CT and NM\u2014poses greater  potential short- and long-term health risks to patients than other imaging  modalities, such as ultrasound.

While the specific standards  used by accrediting organizations vary, MIPPA requires all accrediting  organizations to have standards in five areas: (1) qualifications of medical  personnel who are not physicians and who furnish the technical  component of ADI services, (2) qualifications and responsibilities of  medical directors and supervising physicians, (3) procedures to ensure  that equipment used in furnishing the technical component of ADI  services meets performance specifications, (4) procedures to ensure the  safety of beneficiaries and staff, and (5) establishment and maintenance  of a quality-assurance and quality control program.

CMS also has requirements for accrediting organizations. For example, accrediting organizations are  responsible for using mid-cycle audit procedures, such as unannounced  site visits, to ensure that accredited suppliers maintain compliance with  MIPPA\u2019s requirements for the duration of the 3-year accreditation cycle.
