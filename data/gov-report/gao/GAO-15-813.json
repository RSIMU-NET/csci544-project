Specifically, to date, Treasury has implemented six of our nine  recommendations for CPP. For example, Treasury implemented our  recommendation that it apply lessons learned from the implementation of  CPP to similar programs, such as the Small Business Lending Fund  (SBLF), by including a process for reviewing regulators\u2019 viability  determinations for all eligible applicants for SBLF. Specifically, Treasury  included additional evaluation by a central application review committee  for all eligible applicants who had not been approved by their federal  regulator. Treasury also took steps to provide information from its  evaluation to the regulator when their views differ. These steps should  help ensure that applicants will receive consistent treatment in investment  decisions across different regulators.", "However, Treasury has not implemented three of our CPP-related  recommendations\u2014one remains open and two have been closed. In  2012, we recommended that Treasury consider analyzing and reporting  on remaining and former CPP participants separately. In particular, we  noted that the remaining CPP institutions tended to be less profitable and  hold riskier assets than other institutions of similar asset size. For  example, the remaining CPP institutions had significantly lower returns on  average assets and higher percentages of noncurrent loans than former  CPP and non-CPP institutions. They also held less regulatory capital and  reserves for covering losses. Although our analysis found differences in  the financial health of remaining and former CPP institutions, we noted  that Treasury\u2019s quarterly financial analysis of CPP institutions did not  distinguish between them. By not distinguishing between remaining and  former CPP participants, Treasury misses an opportunity to provide  greater transparency about the financial health of institutions remaining in  CPP. Treasury stated that it would carefully consider our recommendation  and emphasized its ongoing commitment to keeping the public informed  of its progress in winding down CPP. While Treasury reported generally  on the results of its CPP auctions and the status of institutions remaining  in the program, as of August 2015, it had not yet considered analyzing  and reporting on remaining and former CPP participants separately and it  is not likely to do so, according to Treasury. Treasury believes that  providing information about the financial position of institutions remaining  in CPP is unnecessary because it is publicly available to interested  parties through regulatory filings or other sources.", "We closed two recommendations for Treasury to periodically collect and  review certain information from the bank regulators on the analysis and  conclusions supporting their decisions on CPP repayment requests to  help ensure consistency of the CPP repayment process. Treasury did  not take actions that would address the recommendations because it  believed these recommendations raised questions about how to balance  the goals of consistency with the need to respect the independence of  regulators. Although we disagreed with Treasury\u2019s position, we closed  these two recommendations as not implemented because Treasury  officials stated that since it is winding down the program, only a few  remaining CPP participants are likely to make full repayments. Thus we  determined that implementation of these recommendations is not as  critical as it was at the time we made them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Implemented the Majority of Recommendations for MHA", "paragraphs": ["Since 2009, we have made 27 recommendations aimed at improving  MHA\u2019s TARP-funded housing programs. As of August 2015, Treasury  had implemented 19 of them. Examples of more recent actions Treasury  has taken to implement these recommendations include the following:  In June 2010, we recommended that Treasury expeditiously finalize  and implement benchmarks for performance measures under the first- lien modification program, as well as develop measures and  benchmarks for the recently announced HAMP-funded homeowner  assistance programs. Since June 2011, Treasury has been  reporting in its MHA program performance reports on the performance  of the largest MHA servicers in three categories: (1) identifying and  contacting homeowners, (2) homeowner evaluation and assistance,  and (3) program management and reporting. Treasury established  quantitative and qualitative benchmarks for each of the three  performance categories for HAMP first-lien modifications and other  TARP-funded MHA programs. In the same report, we recommended  that Treasury expeditiously implement a prudent design for the  remaining TARP-funded housing programs. In July 2013, Treasury\u2019s  MHA risk assessment included measuring internal control activities for  2MP, PRA, and HAFA.", "In June 2012, we recommended that Treasury and FHA update their  estimates of participation in the FHA Short Refinance Program and  use the updated estimates to reassess the terms of the letter of credit  facility to help ensure that the program is cost-effective. After FHA  provided Treasury with updated participation estimates, Treasury  amended the letter of credit facility in March 2013, reducing the  authorized amount by $7 billion to $1 billion. Treasury also reduced  the cap on administrative fees that could be charged by $92 million  (from $117 million to $25 million). In March 2015, Treasury amended  the purchase agreement for the letter of credit facility for a second  time, reducing the amount by an additional $900 million ($1 billion to  $100 million). As a result of these two actions, Treasury deobligated  approximately $7.9 billion in total, disallowing its use for future  obligations.", "In July 2012, we recommended that Treasury expeditiously conduct a  comprehensive risk assessment of HAMP Tier 2, using the standards  for internal control in the federal government as a guide. In April  2013, Treasury conducted a risk assessment of MHA programs,  including HAMP Tier 2, based on internal control standards. The risk  assessment included identifying the types and potential impacts of  risks on the MHA program and appropriate mitigating steps taken to  address those risks.", "In February 2014, we recommended that Treasury issue clarifying  guidance to servicers on providing effective relationship management  to borrowers with limited English proficiency (LEP). Treasury had  previously issued guidance to servicers requiring them to develop and  implement a policy to identify the requirements and appropriate  caseload for the relationship manager position, including a provision  for providing effective relationship management to borrowers whose  primary language is a language other than English. In April 2014,  Treasury issued guidance requiring servicers to ensure that staff are  able to effectively communicate with all borrowers, including LEP  borrowers, by either employing multilingual individuals or engaging an  outside vendor to provide interpretation services.", "Treasury has not implemented 8 of the 27 recommendations related to  MHA\u2019s TARP-funded programs. Six of these recommendations remain  open, including 4 of which Treasury has taken some action. Finally, we  closed the remaining 2 TARP-funded housing program recommendations  as not implemented.", "The four recommendations that Treasury has taken some action to  address are as follows:  In June 2010, we recommended that Treasury expeditiously report  activity under PRA, including the extent to which servicers determined  that principal reduction was beneficial to investors but did not offer it,  to ensure transparency in the implementation of this program feature  across servicers. Starting with the monthly MHA performance report  for the period through May 2011, Treasury began reporting summary  data on the PRA program. Specifically, Treasury provides information  on PRA trial modification activity as well as median principal amounts  reduced for active permanent modifications. In addition, Treasury\u2019s  public MHA loan-level data files include information on the results of  analyses of borrowers\u2019 net present value under PRA and indicate  whether principal reduction was part of the modification. While this  information would allow interested users with the capability to analyze  the extent to which principal reduction was beneficial but not offered  overall, it puts the burden on others to do the analysis and report the  results publicly. Also, the publicly available data do not identify  individual servicers and thus cannot be used to assess the  implementation of this program feature across servicers.", "Treasury officials stated that they believe they have implemented this  recommendation through the reporting described previously.  Moreover, the officials stated that it would be neither useful nor helpful  to provide these data broken out by specific identified servicer.  Because servicers may choose to implement the PRA program under  individually developed terms, Treasury officials stated that broken out  data would not permit a proper comparison. However, our  recommendation was intended to ensure transparency in the  implementation of this program feature across servicers, which would  require that information be reported on an individual servicer basis to  allow comparison between servicers and highlight differences in the  policies and practices of individual servicers. As such, we maintain  that Treasury has partially implemented this recommendation and  should take action to fully implement it.", "In February 2014, we recommended that Treasury ensure that the  compliance agent assess servicers\u2019 compliance with LEP relationship  management guidance, once it was established. Treasury issued  clarifying LEP guidance to MHA program servicers in April 2014. In  July 2015, Treasury officials stated that they had reached out to the  seven largest MHA servicers to obtain their policies on implementing  the guidance and confirmed that such written policies are consistent  with MHA guidance on LEP.", "In October 2014, we recommended that Treasury conduct periodic  evaluations using analytical methods, such as econometric modeling,  to help explain differences among MHA servicers in redefault rates.  Such analyses could help inform compliance reviews, identify areas of  weaknesses and best practices, and determine the need for additional  program policy changes. Treasury conducted an analysis to  compare redefault rates among servicers and to determine whether  servicers\u2019 portfolio of HAMP-modified loans performed at, above, or  below expectations for the metrics analyzed.", "Despite these analyses, Treasury officials maintained that such an  analysis is inherently challenging and limited and therefore would not  repeat it. Treasury officials gave several reasons for not periodically  repeating this analysis. First, they cited data limitations, including a  lack of loan origination and current credit profile data. However,  Treasury does have access to variables that both it and we have  identified in the past as being important for predicting redefault,  including the size of any change in payments, delinquency duration,  and credit scores and loan-to-value ratios at origination.", "Second, Treasury indicated that excluding loans due to missing  observations could lead to unintended consequences. However, such  limitations are not unusual when researchers conduct this type of  analysis and researchers can employ measures to correct for or  identify biases in the data. In addition, Treasury conducted such  analyses when designing the program. Further, Treasury has relied  on this dataset to identify factors that they believe influence redefault.   And finally, we determined that the existing data are sufficiently  reliable to allow for more sophisticated analytical methods such as an  econometric analysis that could control for certain differences among  servicers.", "Third, Treasury noted that it can rely on compliance reviews, including  a review of sampled loans at individual servicers, to ensure that  servicers followed program guidance. However, more rigorous  analytical methods are a useful tool to supplement and inform ongoing  compliance efforts, which by themselves may not detect significant  variations in performance across servicers. Such methods would also  be useful in identifying areas of weaknesses and best practices and  the potential need for additional program policy changes. Treasury  disagreed and for the reasons discussed above, questioned the  usefulness of such analysis with regard to informing compliance  efforts or identifying best practices or areas of weakness. However, in  our October 2014 report, we identified large differences among some  servicers both with and without controls for certain loan, borrower, and  property characteristics. We determined that the existing data are  sufficiently reliable to allow for more sophisticated analytical methods  such as an econometric analysis that could control for certain  differences among servicers. By not capitalizing on the information  these methods provide, Treasury risks making policy decisions based  on potentially incomplete information and may miss opportunities to  identify best practices to assist the greatest number of eligible  borrowers. Thus, we continue to maintain that Treasury should take  action to fully implement this recommendation.", "In the same report, we recommended that Treasury conduct periodic  evaluations to help explain differences in MHA servicers\u2019 reasons for  denying applications for trial modifications. Such evaluations could  help inform compliance reviews of individual servicers, identify areas  of weaknesses and best practices, and determine the potential need  for programmatic changes. Treasury put together a list of servicers  with reporting anomalies that had been identified and sent them  questionnaires asking them to explain the rationale behind using  certain codes to report denials (denial codes) of applications for trial  modifications. Treasury expects to have answers back by October  2015. Beyond that, Treasury stated that it and the MHA Program  Administrator planned to continue to collect data and monitor trends in  the data on an ongoing basis and reach out to servicers on an as- needed basis to collect more information. Treasury\u2019s compliance  agent has also added procedures for testing denial codes that  servicers report. According to Treasury officials, Treasury has used  the prevalence of certain denial codes to inform certain policy  changes. For example, they said that the most common reason that  applications for HAMP were denied is that borrowers did not submit  the documentation necessary to evaluate their eligibility for HAMP. In  response, Treasury has simplified documentation requirements where  appropriate several times. In addition, Treasury told us that they use  the denial code information to form the basis for discussions with  individual servicers to ensure compliance with program guidelines and  reporting practices. Although these are examples of Treasury\u2019s  analysis of overall denial rates, Treasury\u2019s actions do not address  differences in individual MHA servicers\u2019 reasons for denial.  Additionally, it is not clear whether Treasury plans to conduct periodic  evaluations of differences in denial rates or how Treasury will use the  information it gathers to identify areas of weaknesses and best  practices and determine whether additional policy changes are  needed. Thus, we continue to maintain that Treasury should take  action to implement this recommendation.", "The two recommendations that Treasury has not implemented are as  follows:  In February 2014, we recommended that Treasury require its MHA  compliance agent to take steps to assess the extent to which  servicers had established internal control programs that effectively  monitored compliance with fair lending laws applicable to MHA  programs. In April 2014, Treasury officials stated that they planned  to continue efforts to promote fair lending policies. However, as of  August 2015, they did not plan to implement our recommendation. As  we noted in the report, both the MHA Servicer Participation  Agreement and MHA Handbook require that servicers have an  internal control program to monitor compliance with relevant  consumer protection laws. According to Treasury officials, the federal  agencies with supervisory authority over fair lending remain in the  best position to monitor servicers in this area. Representatives of the  federal regulators said that their fair lending reviews have a broader  overall focus that may not specifically focus on MHA activities.", "Moreover, our analysis identified some statistically significant  differences among four large MHA program servicers in the number of  denials and cancellations of trial modifications and in the potential for  redefault of permanent modifications for certain protected groups.  Evaluating the extent to which servicers have developed and  maintained internal controls to monitor compliance with fair lending  laws could give Treasury additional assurances that servicers are  implementing the MHA program in compliance with fair lending laws.", "In July 2015, we recommended that Treasury develop and implement  policies and procedures that established a standard process to better  ensure that changes to TARP-funded housing programs were based  on evaluations that comprehensively and consistently met the key  elements of benefit-cost analysis. In its written comments on the  draft report, Treasury agreed that it was important to assess the  benefits and costs of proposed program modifications and noted that  it would seriously consider the extent to which it could apply our  recommendation going forward. Treasury officials said that they  planned to provide an update on actions taken or planned in a  required response to Congress in September 2015."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided Treasury a draft copy of this report for review and comment.
