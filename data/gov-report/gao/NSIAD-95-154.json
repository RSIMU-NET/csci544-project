Today, many federal agencies are facing that same reality.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) is a prime example of an agency facing the challenge of streamlining for efficiency and lower costs while maintaining quality. DOD has accomplished that goal in several areas. For example, since 1992, as a direct result of our recommendations, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has taken steps to have private sector vendors supply certain personnel items directly to military facilities in lieu of the traditional military supply system. As a result, by 1997, DLA expects a 53-percent reduction in its 1992 inventory level of these items.", "What is behind these improvements? In large measure, these organizations have benefited from GAO studies emphasizing \u201cbest practices,\u201d carried out by the Defense Management and NASA (DMN) issue area within the National Security and International Affairs Division (NSIAD). The best practices approach to change involves identifying organizations that are widely recognized for major improvements in their performance and efficiency in a specific area, such as inventory management. The processes, practices, and systems identified in these organizations are referred to as best practices, and provide a model for other organizations with similar missions. Frequently, benchmarking is used to gather information on these practices from a number of different organizations, which is then applied to improving operations. Benchmarking is also an effective approach for promoting organizational change.", "By applying a best management practices approach, DMN has been able to make recommendations intended to radically change DOD processes and correspondingly produce substantial savings. To date, DMN has issued 14 reports related to implementing and managing best management practices. Many of these reports illustrate the benefits from a best practices review. Appendix I contains a listing of these reports.", "The best practices approach need not be confined to our defense issues. In this report, we explain how others could go about using the same principles and techniques to promote and implement improved processes.", "If you have any questions about this strategy, please contact me on (202) 512-8412.

Best practices we have identified in our work resulting in recommendations to the defense community include: (1) relying on established commercial networks to manage, store, and directly deliver defense electronic items more efficiently; (2) using private sector food distributors to supply food to the military community faster and cheaper; and (3) adopting the use of supplier parks to reduce maintenance and repair inventories.", "Most of the Defense Management and NASA\u2019s (DMN) best practices reports have focused on using best management practices to improve a specific the Department of Defense (DOD) process. DMN has also reported on management concepts that are important in successfully implementing best management practices throughout an organization, such as reporting on techniques companies use to achieve and manage change.

Also, DOD\u2019s supply management is a large budget item so the potential for large dollar savings was present. DMN believed that comparing DOD\u2019s supply management practices to those that had a proven track record in the private sector would provide a picture of what improvements were possible and indicate proven strategies. A GAO consultants\u2019 panel, consisting of retired DOD officials and logistics business and academic experts, agreed that looking at private sector practices would help us find ways to improve DOD operations, because many private sector companies had made fundamental improvements in logistics management.", "DMN\u2019s best practices work can result in radical changes in certain DOD processes, as well as substantial dollar savings. Since 1992, as a direct result of our recommendations, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has taken steps to have private sector vendors supply pharmaceutical products, medical supplies, food, and clothing and textiles directly to military facilities in lieu of the traditional military supply system. As a result, by 1997, DLA expects a 53-percent reduction in its 1992 inventory level of these items. With fewer days\u2019 worth of supplies on hand, DLA depot overhead costs will decline also.

Our experience shows that the following questions can serve as a guide in making the decision.", "Have GAO and others reported on the acknowledged problem areas before, and to what extent has there been attempts to make the process work as designed? In our case, GAO had reported on DOD\u2019s inventory problems for over 30 years, and DOD had generally agreed with our observations and had often taken steps to improve the process. However, improvements were incremental at best and failed to achieve significant gains in effectiveness or dollar savings.", "Is there a process with similar requirements that can be compared to the one being examined but is implemented in a way that provides significantly better results? For example, a military and private hospital both depend on timely and accurate delivery of supplies.", "Do the areas being considered have an established counterpart in the private or public sector that will provide evidence of the benefits of a new process? For example, we compared the way DOD procures, stores, and delivers food to base dining halls to the way institutional food users in the private and public sector obtain food. Other areas looked at, such as medical, clothing, and spare parts inventories, also allowed us to make comparisons with processes with similar objectives in the private and/or public sector.", "A best practices review can be applied to a variety of processes, such as payroll, travel administration, employee training, accounting and budgeting systems, procurement, transportation, maintenance services, repair services, and distribution. You may consider looking at an area where the agency has already begun to implement some best management practices, but with limited success. Additional work in the area may provide a crucial boost to an agency\u2019s efforts. Looking at current industry trends in contracting out business functions (also referred to as \u201coutsourcing\u201d) can also suggest areas that could benefit from a best practices review. For example, private sector companies are beginning to outsource logistics functions, primarily transportation and distribution, and data processing functions.", "When Is a Best Practices Approach Appropriate? objectives. Ask questions like (1) What drives the costs in a particular process? and (2) Is the process effective in achieving its goals? An initial step is to determine all the variables that contribute to the expenditures associated with the area. Another early step is to start with the areas that the customers think are of major importance to the organization being reviewed.", "Identifying the scope of the process you plan to review is not always easy. It is not always clear where you begin and where you stop when you decide to benchmark a process. It is important that the entire process be considered, rather than just part of the process. For example, in reviewing DOD\u2019s food supply, we examined the entire food supply system, including buying, storing, and distributing food rather than just a part of the system such as distribution because these parts are interconnected and changes in one part will impact the others. If you fail to capture the entire process then you may push costs into another section of the process or create an improvement that is inhibited by trying to marry old ways with new ways that are in conflict with each other. However, you cannot look at everything. At least initially, select a process which is about ready to accept change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Do You Perform a Best Management Practices Review?", "paragraphs": ["Under a best practices review, you are forced to consider new approaches. Specifically, you will compare how an organization performs functions with one doing them differently\u2014such as a function in a unique government agency with a company performing the same or similar function in the private sector. The different approach may turn out to be a much better way of performing a function. Implementing this better way to perform a process throughout the organization is what allows an agency to make meaningful changes.", "In identifying best practices among organizations, the \u201cbenchmarking\u201d technique is frequently used. In benchmarking with others, an organization (1) determines how leading organizations perform a specific process(es), (2) compares their methods to its own, and (3) uses the information to improve upon or completely change its process(es). Benchmarking is typically an internal process, performed by personnel within an organization who already have a thorough knowledge of the process under review. Our approach is similar. However, GAO\u2019s role is to look at the process from the outside, much like a consultant, and determine if that process can be improved upon or totally changed.", "The best practices evaluation will look not only at quantitative data, such as costs, but also at how other processes and aspects such as organizational culture might be affected by change.", "In our work, we have found several elements that any best practices review should include. These elements are listed below and then discussed separately in detail: (1)    Gaining an understanding of and documenting the government process you want to improve.
