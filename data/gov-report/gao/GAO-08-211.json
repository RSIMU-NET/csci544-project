For example, IRS implemented controls for user IDs for certain critical servers, improved physical protection for its procurement system, developed a security plan for a key financial system, and upgraded servers that had been using obsolete operating systems. In addition, IRS established enterprisewide objectives for improving information security, including initiatives for protecting and encrypting data, securing information technology assets, and building security into new applications. However, about 70 percent of the previously identified information security weaknesses remain unresolved. For example, IRS continues to, among other things, use passwords that are not complex, grant excessive access to individuals who do not need it, and install patches in an untimely manner. In addition to this limited progress, other significant weaknesses in various controls continue to threaten the confidentiality and availability of IRS's financial processing systems and information, and limit assurance of the integrity and reliability of its financial and taxpayer information. IRS has not consistently implemented effective controls to prevent, limit, or detect unauthorized access to computing resources from within its internal network. For example, IRS did not always (1) enforce strong password management for properly identifying and authenticating users, (2) authorize user access to only permit access needed to perform job functions, (3) encrypt sensitive data, (4) effectively monitor changes on its mainframe, and (5) physically protect its computer resources. In addition, IRS faces risks to its financial and taxpayer information due to weaknesses in implementing its configuration management policies, as well as appropriately segregating incompatible job duties. Accordingly, GAO has reported a material weakness in IRS's internal controls over its financial and tax processing systems. A key reason for the weaknesses is that the agency has not yet fully implemented its agencywide information security program to ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained.

Although this  expansion has created many benefits for agencies such as IRS in achieving  their missions and providing information to the public, it also exposes  federal networks and systems to various threats. The Federal Bureau of  Investigation has identified multiple sources of threats, including foreign  nation states engaged in information warfare, domestic criminals, hackers,  virus writers, and disgruntled employees or contractors working within an  organization. In addition, the U.S. Secret Service and the CERT  Coordination Center studied insider threats, and stated in a May 2005  report that \u201cinsiders pose a substantial threat by virtue of their knowledge  of, and access to, employer systems and/or databases.\u201d", "Without proper safeguards, systems are unprotected from individuals and  groups with malicious intent who can intrude and use their access to  obtain sensitive information, commit fraud, disrupt operations, or launch  attacks against other computer systems and networks.

Recognizing the importance of securing federal agencies\u2019  information systems, Congress enacted the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) in December 2002 to strengthen the security of  information and systems within federal agencies. FISMA requires each  agency to develop, document, and implement an agencywide information  security program for the information and systems that support the  operations and assets of the agency, using a risk-based approach to  information security management.

For example, the Internal Revenue Manual does not always specify when  successful system changes should be logged. Further, although IRS policy  provides general requirements for protection of audit logs, the manual for  mainframe security software does not provide detailed guidance on what  logs to protect and how to protect them.

For example, although IRS and GAO examined controls over the same  systems, we identified unencrypted passwords on an internal Web site that  IRS had not. Our test results also showed that contractors did not always  follow agency security policies and procedures. To illustrate, contractors  had inappropriately stored clear-text passwords and sensitive documents  on internal agency Web sites.
