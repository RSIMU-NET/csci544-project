To first identify promising approaches, GAO reviewed summaries and syntheses of rigorous research on approaches that increase employment and earnings, and profiled 10 state and local programs that were nominated by experts familiar with welfare research and state and local efforts, and that were selected to represent a range of approaches. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance, and interviewed agency officials and experts with a range of views."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 10 state and local programs GAO examined used various promising approaches to help Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance recipients gain employment by meeting a range of participant needs. These approaches included the use of subsidized employment, employment alongside treatment for a health condition, and training for high-demand jobs. For example, for individuals in need of additional work experience, San Francisco's TANF program has provided subsidies to employers to place participants in temporary, wage-paying jobs. To help individuals with mental and physical disabilities and substance abuse problems, nonprofit contractors for New York City's TANF program have provided individualized assessment and treatment, often combined with employment. To prepare individuals with various skill levels for high-demand jobs, Minnesota and Washington have used a career pathways approach of combining occupation-specific training with basic skills education and support services. However, experts told us that some states have a misperception that this approach is not allowable under TANF rules, even though the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services (HHS) support its use. HHS told us that states could still meet program requirements while using this approach, but the agency has not issued formal guidance clarifying this. Internal control standards for the federal government state that information should be communicated to managers in a form that enables them to carry out their responsibilities. As a result of these misperceptions, the career pathways approach may be underused by TANF agencies and TANF recipients could miss out on the potential benefits of this approach.", "Expertise and dedicated funds facilitated use of these promising approaches, but the federal TANF program, itself, lacks incentives for their wider adoption. Of the 10 programs GAO examined, 9 drew on the expertise of partner organizations\u2014including community college systems, workforce agencies, and nonprofits. The programs also benefitted from decisions by state and local policymakers to dedicate funds\u2014including TANF funds\u2014for the selected programs, according to officials. However, incentives for large numbers of state and local TANF agencies to adopt and test promising approaches are lacking under the structure of the TANF program for several reasons. First, many program design and funding choices are left to the states, and GAO's prior work has shown that state use of TANF funds for more costly welfare-to-work approaches can compete with other allowable uses of TANF funds. Second, TANF's main performance measure does not necessarily encourage agencies to use certain approaches that incorporate longer-term education and training or treatment services, although states are not prohibited from doing so. Third, little incentive exists for TANF agencies to evaluate their programs. HHS's authority over many aspects of TANF is limited and it has not proposed legislative changes to address these areas. Yet, because HHS oversees TANF, it is positioned to identify, suggest, and work in consultation with Congress on potential changes that would better address the lack of incentives for the use of promising approaches by states and to better meet the TANF goal of increasing employment. Without federal action, adoption and evaluation of promising approaches may continue to be limited to select states and localities, leaving TANF recipients in other locations without access to these promising approaches."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS should issue guidance to clarify how the career pathways approach can be used by TANF agencies and identify potential changes to address the lack of incentives in the TANF program.

In March 2014, states used  federal and state TANF funds to provide cash assistance to 1.6 million  low-income families nationwide. In keeping with a TANF goal of reducing  families\u2019 dependence on government by promoting work, TANF requires  states to engage a certain percentage of families with a work-eligible  individual receiving cash assistance in specified work-related activities or  face potential financial penalties. These work activities include, for  example, unsubsidized employment, job search and job readiness  assistance, certain training and education, and work experience. In recent  years, some state TANF agencies have narrowed the scope of services  they provide, reportedly in response to resource constraints and staff  reductions. Related to this trend, data suggest that more TANF  recipients\u2014especially those considered hard to employ\u2014could receive  assistance that will help them to gain employment and reduce their  dependence on cash assistance.", "GAO has been asked to provide examples of what some states are doing  now to help TANF recipients reach these goals and how these efforts can  be expanded.

To identify state and local programs that are currently using these  approaches to serve TANF cash assistance recipients, we interviewed  cognizant researchers; officials from HHS, the Department of Labor, and  the Department of Education; and others with TANF expertise. We  selected 12 experts based on their knowledge of the research and efforts  under way at the state and local level, as well as to reflect a range of  perspectives on welfare-to-work issues. We identified them through our  literature review and through referrals from other experts. We selected 10  programs to profile (located in 6 states\u2014California, Kentucky, Minnesota,  New York, Utah, and Washington\u2014and the District of Columbia) from  those nominated by experts to reflect diversity in approaches used,  economic conditions, demographics, and geographic regions, among  other factors. We conducted in-depth interviews, by phone and through  four site visits, with program administrators and state and local TANF  officials to learn about key program features that might increase  employment and incomes. We obtained views from experts; federal,  state, and local officials; and program administrators on factors that  facilitate the use of promising approaches and that could broaden their  use. We assessed information and communication HHS provides to  states related to promising approaches against federal internal control  standards.for the programs we selected, and reviewed HHS administrative data on  states\u2019 engagement of TANF recipients in prescribed work activities. We  assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing related documentation  and interviewing knowledgeable officials and determined they were  sufficiently reliable for providing contextual information on these programs  and describing work participation trends, respectively.

In  addition, the block grant includes a maintenance-of-effort (MOE)  requirement, which requires states to maintain a significant portion of their  historic financial commitment to welfare-related programs. In fiscal year  2013, states spent a total of $31.6 billion in federal TANF funds and state  MOE funds, with federal funds accounting for 53 percent of the total. The  federal law that established TANF also created a TANF Contingency  Fund that states could access in times of economic distress. In creating  the TANF block grant, Congress emphasized the importance of state  flexibility, and restricted HHS\u2019s regulatory authority over the states except  to the extent expressly provided in the law.", "In line with the second purpose, a key TANF goal is helping parents  prepare for and find jobs.

Generally, this is because many states have relied on the caseload  reduction credit and other allowable options to meet the requirement  rather than engaging more families in specified work activities to reach a  50 percent rate. This has raised concerns among some policymakers that  states are meeting the letter but not the spirit of the law. PRWORA  established higher work participation rate requirements and eliminated  many exemptions from these requirements for recipients compared to  what was in place prior to TANF. This reflected research that found that  mandatory work requirements could reduce welfare receipt and increase  employment among single mothers and help address concerns about  long-term welfare receipt. In our prior work, we concluded that states\u2019 use  of the modifications currently allowed in federal law and regulations, as  well as states\u2019 policy choices, have diminished the usefulness of the work  participation rate as a national TANF performance measure.", "The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 required states to report additional  information on TANF recipients\u2019 engagement in activities. An HHS  report to Congress, based on 2011 state data, found that that 24 percent  of work-eligible individuals met federal work participation rate standards,  but more than 50 percent of work-eligible individuals had zero hours of  participation (see fig. 1). While some of these individuals were  exempted from participation or excluded for some other reason such as  caring for a child under age one, at least some of these individuals had  not been engaged in work activities by the state or local TANF agency.HHS data show that federal and state spending on work-related activities,  such as subsidized employment, has declined in the last 3 years for  which data are available (fiscal years 2011-2013) and has been under 8  percent of total TANF spending in each of these years.", "Almost half of individuals meeting the work participation rate standards  did so through unsubsidized employment\u2014working in a regular job while  receiving cash assistance. This suggests that states\u2019 ability to meet the  work participation rate relies heavily on the activities of individuals who  are already able to work rather than providing special assistance to those  who have the most difficulty finding and keeping jobs. In fiscal year 2011,  unsubsidized employment was the most common work activity among  individuals participating in at least one hour of a countable work activity  per month. Job search and job readiness assistance, followed by  vocational education training, were the next most common activities (see  fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of Welfare Program Experimentation, Research and State Waivers", "paragraphs": ["Between 1987 and 1996, there was considerable experimentation with  welfare-to-work programs under TANF\u2019s predecessor program, Aid to  Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), as HHS granted waivers to  states to test and evaluate new approaches. A body of HHS-sponsored  research resulted, showing that welfare-to-work programs can increase  employment and reduce welfare receipt. This research helped inform the  creation of TANF. Between 1987 and 1996, 46 states received waivers  from existing AFDC requirements to test and evaluate new approaches to  improve employment outcomes for people on welfare. These initiatives  were referred to as section 1115 waivers because they were granted  under section 1115 of the Social Security Act. According to HHS  officials, HHS required states that applied for and received waivers from  federal program requirements to have an independent organization  evaluate its program change, supported by HHS and state funding.  These waiver initiatives included placing time limits on the receipt of  benefits and strengthening work requirements, among others. According  to HHS, many of the policies and concepts included in state waiver  requests were later incorporated into TANF. States that received section  1115 waivers under AFDC were allowed, under PRWORA, to continue to  operate under these waivers until their expiration. However, the last of  these waivers expired in 2007, and no provision in law allowed these  AFDC waivers to be extended. Questions have been raised as to whether  HHS continues to have the authority under section 1115 to waive certain  TANF program rules; this report does not address this issue. Under law,  HHS is required to conduct TANF and related research and the agency  supports a broad array of research and evaluations. See appendix III for a  list of relevant recent and ongoing HHS-funded evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolution of the TANF Block Grant", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1996 welfare law replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant  and gave states flexibility to set spending priorities, they have used a  smaller share of the grant to provide cash assistance. Within the first 5  years of TANF, the number of families receiving cash assistance declined  by over half and states shifted their TANF priorities to other forms of aid,  or non-cash services. These can include any other services meeting  TANF purposes, such as job preparation activities, child care and  transportation assistance for parents, out-of-wedlock pregnancy  prevention activities, and child welfare services. In fiscal year 1997,  nationwide, states spent about 23 percent of federal TANF and state  MOE funds on non-cash services. In contrast, states spent more than 66  percent of federal TANF and state MOE funds for these purposes in fiscal  year 2013. While the TANF block grant still serves as the nation\u2019s major  cash assistance program for low-income families with children, states  have also increasingly used it as a flexible funding stream for supporting  a broad range of allowable services. However, we previously reported  that the accountability framework currently in place in federal law and  regulations has not kept pace with this evolution. Our prior work found  that TANF\u2019s accountability framework provides incomplete information on  how states\u2019 non-cash services are contributing to TANF purposes. We  noted that Congress may wish to consider ways to improve reporting and  performance information so that it encompasses the full breadth of states\u2019  uses of TANF funds. The composition of the overall TANF caseload has  also changed, with the percentage of \u201cchild-only\u201d cases increasing from  about 23 percent in fiscal year 1998 to about 46 percent in fiscal year  2011. These cases consist of families receiving cash assistance on behalf  of children only, in contrast to other cases in which adults in the families  also receive benefits on their own behalf. According to HHS, the  increase in the percentage of child-only cases was primarily due to a  sharp decline in the number of TANF cases with an eligible adult, rather  than an increase in the number of child-only cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hard-to-Employ TANF Recipients", "paragraphs": ["Some TANF cash assistance recipients are work-ready while others face  challenges that make them harder to employ.

However, some state TANF officials we interviewed for a 2012 report said  the pressure to meet TANF work participation rate requirements causes  them to focus on the \u201cready-to-work\u201d cash assistance population, which  can leave the \u201chard-to-employ\u201d population without services.

Subsidized  employment programs have been used for decades to provide income  support for people who are unable to find jobs in the regular labor  market and improve employability for people with limited work  experience. These programs can vary, for example, in terms of the  amount of wages that are subsidized; prospects for permanent,  unsubsidized employment; the degree of worksite supervision  provided; and whether the worker is employed directly or through an  intermediary (see fig. 3).", "Research has shown that subsidized employment can increase  employment and earnings, although some studies suggest that these  gains may not last beyond the subsidized position. Nevertheless,  these programs can provide individuals who are hard to employ with  work experience and can have indirect effects, such as reduced  recidivism among former prisoners. Subsidized employment programs  in the 1970s and 1980s, during the time of TANF\u2019s predecessor  program, yielded positive results on employment and earnings. One  such demonstration project tested a model in which 10,000 welfare  recipients in seven locations received 4 to 8 weeks of training and  spent up to one year in subsidized positions as home health aides.  Most of the subsidized employment programs that produced long-term  employment gains targeted women; disadvantaged men experienced  fewer positive results following the period of subsidized employment.", "Following welfare reform, transitional jobs gained traction as a  strategy to increase the employability of TANF recipients. The theory  behind this approach is that people best learn to work through  working. Program staff can observe and coach participants on skills  such as developing good work habits and dealing with coworkers to  improve their future success in an unsubsidized job. Participants may  be able to subsequently acquire jobs they would not otherwise have  access to. Recent studies of transitional jobs programs have not  shown sustained increases in employment, although these programs  had indirect effects of reducing recidivism and reliance on welfare  receipt.", "As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,  Congress provided funding through the TANF Emergency  Contingency Fund that in part helped states cover the costs of  increased expenditures for subsidized employment programs. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia reportedly used $1.3  billion from the Emergency Contingency Fund to create 260,000  subsidized jobs, according to research. Although these efforts were  not focused solely on TANF cash assistance recipients, experts we  spoke with said the availability of additional funds renewed interest  among states in subsidized employment.

Further, one official said that while the subsidized work-study component  is a critical program feature, the expectation that clients will work at least  20 hours a week once they have exhausted their allowable full-time  education may affect academic outcomes.", "The work activity limits only apply to what states may count toward the  work participation rate and do not prevent states from allowing clients to  engage in these activities for longer periods of time. However, several  experts we interviewed explained that many state policies on activities  that are available to clients are shaped by the work participation rate  requirements. That is, some states may design their programs to provide  and support only those activities that count toward the work participation  rate, while other states also provide and support activities that do not  count toward the rate. In addition, we have previously found that states  have relied on a combination of factors allowed in law to reduce the  percentage of families they needed to engage in work to meet their work  participation rate requirements. According to the most recent data  available from fiscal year 2011, 23 states used these factors to reduce  their required work participation rate for all TANF families from 50 percent  to 0 percent. As a result, states may have less incentive to use promising  approaches to engage hard-to-employ individuals in work activities, as  they can meet their work participation rate requirements without engaging  these individuals.

An official with the D.C. TANF program said it had not yet been  evaluated formally because the program had only recently been  redesigned.

This suggests a loss of opportunity.  Data already suggest that state TANF programs currently engage  recipients in a relatively limited range of activities and that more TANF  recipients could be engaged in activities that are work-related. TANF\u2019s  goals include ending needy families\u2019 dependence on government benefits  by promoting work. However, the program\u2019s block grant structure means  that many policy decisions are decentralized, and HHS has limited  authority in directing state programmatic choices. This tends to leave  innovation to individual localities and states. Yet other allowable uses of  TANF funds compete with the adoption of promising welfare-to-work  approaches. Further, limited participation by TANF agencies in HHS  evaluations may slow the development and adoption of new promising  approaches, leaving TANF without a continuous improvement process. In  announcing its intention to exercise waiver authority, HHS noted that the  purpose of its proposed waivers was to test alternative and innovative  strategies, policies, and procedures designed to improve employment  outcomes for needy families. However, as HHS officials told us, no state  has applied for a waiver since its announcement in 2012. While we are  not taking a position on whether HHS has authority to issue waivers, it is  clear that this strategy has not encouraged states to innovate and test  new approaches. We recognize that PRWORA limits HHS\u2019s authority  over state program and funding choices and evaluations of state  programs. Yet, HHS, as the federal agency that oversees TANF, is  positioned to identify, suggest, and work in consultation with Congress on  potential changes that would address the lack of incentives for states to  adopt promising approaches. Absent federal action, adoption and  evaluation of promising approaches may continue to be limited to select  states and localities, leaving TANF recipients in other locations without  access to these promising approaches. In the meantime, at least one  promising approach\u2014career pathways\u2014appears to suffer from  misperceptions about whether activities under the career pathways  approach can be counted toward the work participation rate, or whether  the career pathways approach is allowable with TANF funds.

We selected 12 experts  based on their knowledge of the research and efforts under way at the  state and local level, as well as to reflect a range of perspectives on  welfare-to-work issues. We identified them through our literature review  and through referrals from other experts. We asked the experts and  agency officials to identify state and local programs that are currently  using the promising approaches we identified through our literature  review to serve TANF cash assistance recipients.

We  conducted in-depth interviews, by phone and through four site visits, with  program administrators and state and local TANF officials to learn about  key program features that help increase employment and earnings. For 3  programs, we also interviewed local contractors. We obtained views from  experts; federal, state, and local officials; and program administrators on  factors that facilitate the use of promising approaches and that could  broaden their use. We assessed information and communication HHS  provides to states related to promising approaches against federal  internal control standards.", "We obtained budget, performance, and other program data for the  programs we selected, as well as HHS administrative data on states\u2019  engagement of TANF recipients in prescribed work activities. We  assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing related documentation  and interviewing knowledgeable officials and determined they were  sufficiently reliable for providing contextual information on these programs  and describing work participation trends, respectively.
