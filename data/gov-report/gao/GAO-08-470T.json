The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed criteria for these projections in November 2005. It established a governmentwide goal for agencies to refine their projections of the number of clearance investigations that will be required in any given year to be within 5 percent of the number of actual requests for investigation. At a May 2006 congressional hearing, an OPM Assistant Director stated that DOD had exceeded its departmentwide projection by 59 percent for the first half of fiscal year 2006. The negative effects of such inaccurate projections include impediments to workload planning and funding. GAO noted the problem with the accuracy of DOD's projections in its February 2004 report and recommended that DOD improve its projections for industry personnel. In the report it is issuing today, GAO noted that DOD has initiated changes to improve its estimates of future investigation needs and is conducting research that may change these methods further. For example, in 2006, DOD took steps to increase the response rate of its annual survey used as a basis for determining its projections. In 2007, it changed its methods for analyzing data that informs its projections. However, DOD has not yet demonstrated the effectiveness of these changes. DOD must address additional long-standing challenges or issues in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of its personnel security clearance program for industry personnel. First, continuing delays in determining clearance eligibility can result in increased costs and risk to national security. For example, when new employees' clearances are delayed, it affects their abilities to perform their duties fully since they do not have access to classified material. Second, DOD and the rest of the federal government provide limited information to one another on how they individually ensure the quality of clearance products and procedures, which affects reciprocity of clearances. Reciprocity occurs when one government agency fully accepts a security clearance granted by another government agency. GAO's September 2006 report noted that agencies may not reciprocally recognize clearances granted by other agencies because of concerns that other agencies may have granted clearances based on inadequate investigations and adjudications. Third, in DOD's August 2007 report to Congress, it provided less than 2 years of funding-requirements information, which limits congressional awareness of future year requirements for this program. Fourth, DOD does not have a comprehensive DOD-specific plan to address delays in its clearance program. While there is a governmentwide effort to reform the clearance process, it is projected not to be operational until beyond December 2008."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss several of the long-standing  challenges that affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) personnel security clearance program for industry  personnel. DOD\u2019s clearance program maintains approximately 2.5 million  clearances on servicemembers, federal DOD civilian employees, industry  personnel for DOD and 23 other federal agencies, and employees in the  federal legislative branch. For more than two decades, we have  documented challenges to DOD\u2019s clearance program.", "Long-standing delays in determining clearance eligibility and other  clearance challenges led us to designate DOD\u2019s personnel security  clearance program as a high-risk area in January 2005 and to continue that  designation in the updated list of high-risk areas that we published in  2007. We identified this as a high-risk area because problems in the  clearance program can negatively affect national security. For example,  delays in renewing security clearances for personnel who are already  doing classified work can lead to a heightened risk of unauthorized  disclosure of classified information. In contrast, delays in providing initial  security clearances for previously noncleared personnel can result in other  negative consequences, such as additional costs and delays in completing  national security-related contracts, lost-opportunity costs, and problems  retaining the best qualified personnel. At the same time, our work has  acknowledged recent improvements to the department\u2019s clearance  processes that were DOD-specific or part of governmentwide efforts.", "My statement today will focus on two issues: (1) the status of DOD\u2019s  efforts to improve its projections of the number of clearances needed for  industry personnel, and (2) an overview of other long-standing challenges  that have a negative effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of DOD\u2019s  personnel security clearance program for industry personnel. My  statement draws on a report which we are issuing today and on our prior  work on clearance processes which included reviews of clearance related  documents and interviews of senior officials at DOD and the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) which has the primary responsibility for  providing investigation services to DOD. Our work was performed in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions, based on our audit objectives.

Clearances are categorized into three levels: top secret, secret, and  confidential. The level of classification denotes the degree of protection  required for information and the amount of damage that unauthorized  disclosure could reasonably cause to national security. The degree of  expected damage that unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be  expected to cause is \u201cexceptionally grave damage\u201d for top secret  information, \u201cserious damage\u201d for secret information, and \u201cdamage\u201d for  confidential information.", "DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence   has responsibility for determining eligibility for clearances for  servicemembers, DOD civilian employees, and industry personnel  performing work for DOD and 23 other federal agencies, and employees in  the federal legislative branch. That responsibility includes obtaining  background investigations, primarily through OPM. Within OUSD(I), DSS  uses OPM-provided investigative reports to determine clearance eligibility  of industry personnel. DOD has responsibility for adjudicating the  clearances of servicemembers, DOD civilians, and industry personnel.  Two DOD offices are responsible for adjudicating cases involving industry  personnel: the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office within DSS  and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals within the Defense Legal  Agency. Accordingly, the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office  adjudicates cases that contain only favorable information or minor issues  regarding security concerns (e.g., some overseas travel by the individual).  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals adjudicates cases containing  major security issues (e.g., an individual\u2019s unexplained affluence or  criminal history) that could result in the denial of clearance eligibility and  possibly lead to an appeal.", "Recent significant events affecting DOD\u2019s clearance program include the  passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  and the issuance of the June 2005 Executive Order 13381, \u201cStrengthening  Processes Relating to Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified  National Security Information.\u201d The act included milestones for reducing  the time to complete clearances, general specifications for a database on  security clearances, and requirements for reciprocity of clearances.  Among other things, the executive order stated that OMB was to ensure  the effective implementation of policy related to appropriately uniform,  centralized, efficient, effective, timely, and reciprocal agency functions  relating to determining eligibility for access to classified national security  information.", "Another recent event affecting DOD\u2019s clearance program was the passage  of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2007 which required DOD to include in its annual budget submission to  Congress a report on DOD\u2019s industry personnel clearance investigations  program. In response to that mandate, DOD\u2019s August 2007 Annual Report  to Congress on Personnel Security Investigations for Industry described  DOD-specific and governmentwide efforts to improve security clearance  processes. For example, one DOD-specific action described in the report  is the addition of a capability to electronically submit a clearance  applicant\u2019s form authorizing the release of medical information. In  addition, one governmentwide effort described in the report is that all  requests for clearances are now being submitting using OPM\u2019s Electronic  Questionnaires for Investigations Processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Procedures for Projecting Future Industry Investigation Needs Are Evolving, but the Effectiveness of These Efforts Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["DOD has had a long-standing challenge in accurately projecting future  industry investigation needs and is developing and implementing new  methods to improve its procedures. However, DOD has not yet  demonstrated the effectiveness of these changes. Since 2001, DOD has  conducted an annual survey of contractors performing classified work for  the government in order to estimate future clearance-investigation needs  for industry personnel, but those estimates have not accurately reflected  actual clearance needs. In November 2005, OMB reported a  governmentwide goal whereby agencies have been asked to work toward  refining their projections of required investigations to be within 5 percent  of the numbers of actual requests for investigation. However, according  to an OPM Associate Director\u2019s May 2006 congressional testimony, DOD  exceeded its departmentwide projection by 59 percent in the first half of  fiscal year 2006.", "Our work has shown that DOD\u2019s long-standing inability to accurately  project its security clearance workload has had negative effects on its  clearance-related budgets and staffing requirements. For example, as we  reported in 2004, the services and defense agencies had to limit the  number of overdue reinvestigations that they submitted for investigation  in fiscal year 2000 because they did not budget sufficient funds to cover  the costs of the workload. Furthermore, in April 2006, DOD temporarily  stopped processing applications for clearance investigations for industry  personnel, attributing the stoppage to a large volume of industry clearance  requests and funding problems.", "In May 2004, we addressed DOD\u2019s problems with inaccurately projecting  the future number of clearances needed for industry personnel and the  negative effect of inaccurate projections on workload planning. In that  report, we recommended that OUSD(I) improve its projections of  clearance requirements for industry personnel\u2014for both the numbers and  types of clearances\u2014by working with DOD components, industry  contractors, and the acquisition community to identify obstacles and  implement steps to overcome them. At that time, DOD officials attributed  inaccurate projections to (1) the use of some industry personnel on more  than one contract and often for different agencies, (2) the movement of  employees from one company to another, and (3) unanticipated world  events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Because DOD  continues to experience an inability to accurately project its security  clearance workload, we believe that our 2004 recommendation for  improving projections still has merit.", "In the report on security clearances we are issuing today, we note that DSS  has made recent changes to the methods it uses to develop these  estimates, and it is conducting research that may change these methods  further. For example, DOD has modified the procedures for annually  surveying contractors performing classified work for the government in  order to more accurately estimate the number of future clearance  investigations needed for industry personnel. To improve the response  rate to this survey, in 2006, DSS made its survey accessible through the  Internet, and DSS field staff began actively encouraging industry  representatives to complete this voluntary survey. According to a DSS  official, these changes increased the survey response rate from historically  low rates of between 10 and 15 percent of the surveyed facilities providing  information in previous years to 70 percent of facilities in 2007, which  represented 86 percent of industry personnel with a clearance. In addition  to improving the response rate for its annual survey, DSS also changed its  methods for computing the projections. For example, DSS began  performing weekly analyses to refine its future investigation needs rather  than relying on the previous method of performing a onetime annual  analysis of its survey results. DSS also changed its analysis procedures by  including variables (e.g., company size) not previously accounted for in its  analyses. In addition, DOD\u2019s Personnel Security Research Center is  assessing a statistical model for estimating future investigation needs in  order to determine if a model can supplement or replace the current  survey method. However, it is too early to determine the effect of these  new methods on the accuracy of DOD\u2019s projections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Faces Additional Long-standing Challenges to Improving the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Its Personnel Security Clearance Program for Industry Personnel", "paragraphs": ["DOD must address additional long-standing challenges or issues in order  to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its personnel security  clearance program for industry personnel.
