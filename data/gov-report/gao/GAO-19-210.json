In 2015, DHS established an R&D coordination mechanism, to be led by S&T, and in 2017 issued R&D coordination-related guidance. Specifically, to improve coordination, DHS established an Integrated Product Team (IPT) process to serve as the key R&D coordination mechanism within DHS. All ten DHS components that GAO interviewed stated that the IPT process improved visibility into DHS R&D efforts. However, the component that obligated approximately 17 percent of DHS R&D funds in 2017, or $176 million, did not participate in the IPT process in 2018, as required. Nonparticipation poses a risk to R&D coordination efforts across DHS, including R&D project information not being shared among components. Furthermore, ensuring that all required components participate in the IPT process would help S&T maintain visibility of R&D projects in order to fulfill its statutory role of coordinating R&D, and mitigate the risk of potential duplication of effort.", "S&T, in its coordination role for DHS, uses disparate information sources to identify and track R&D project information and faces challenges to track progress and other information for ongoing R&D projects. For example, R&D project information is stored in multiple information sources leading to difficulty in integrating complete R&D project information and resulting in reporting that is not comprehensive. By developing a mechanism to address these challenges, S&T can further improve its efforts to report and analyze R&D project information, and have improved visibility on R&D efforts across DHS. GAO also identified challenges in collecting information related to R&D performance. Among other things, DHS is not well positioned to integrate the results and share lessons learned because limited R&D customer feedback information is collected and analyzed. Of the seven DHS components with R&D budget authority, two reported having formal customer feedback mechanisms. As a result, DHS is unable to more fully understand its customers' perceptions and experience which would allow DHS to better assess the performance of its R&D efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, with which DHS concurred, including that DHS: 1) ensure all components participate in the IPT process, 2) develop a mechanism that aligns R&D project tracking sources, and 3) collect feedback from R&D customers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Conducting research and development (R&D) on technologies for  detecting, preventing, and mitigating terrorist and natural threats is vital to  enhancing the security of the nation.

Within DHS, the Science and Technology directorate  (S&T) is responsible for coordinating and integrating R&D activities  across the department while DHS components may also conduct R&D to  support their respective missions.", "Since 2003, questions have been raised regarding S&T\u2019s ability to  oversee and coordinate R&D activities across the department as well as  to demonstrate the value of these investments over time. In 2012, we  found that DHS efforts to coordinate R&D across the department were  fragmented and overlapping, which increased the risk of unnecessary  duplication. We also reported that DHS did not know how much all of its  components invested in R&D, making it difficult to oversee these efforts  across the department. We recommended, among other things, that the  Secretary of Homeland Security develop and implement policies to  include elements such as a definition of R&D that provides reasonable  assurance that reliable accounting and reporting of R&D resources and  activities are achieved. In response to our recommendation, DHS issued  a memorandum in April 2014 that included a definition for R&D.  Furthermore, DHS implemented a common appropriations structure to  accurately identify the resources it is expending on R&D projects.", "You asked us to evaluate DHS\u2019s efforts to coordinate and monitor R&D  activities across the department. This report addresses the following  questions: (1) how much has DHS obligated for R&D from fiscal years  2010 through 2017 and what types of R&D does DHS conduct; (2) to  what extent does S&T coordinate R&D across DHS; and (3) how, if at all,  does DHS track and identify R&D efforts and assess R&D performance  department-wide.", "To determine how much DHS has obligated for R&D, we analyzed federal  budget data to identify R&D-related obligations for fiscal years 2010  through 2017. We selected this time frame to analyze multiple years of  obligation trend data, and 2017 was the most recent year of available  data at the time of our review. To identify the R&D obligations data, we  searched the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) MAX database  for DHS accounts with the term \u201cresearch\u201d in the account title and  extracted total obligations for those accounts from the database for fiscal  years 2010 through 2017. We assessed the reliability of the data by  reviewing OMB guidance and procedures that govern OMB MAX data  inputs. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting  general trends. However, because we previously found that some DHS  R&D-related obligation data were not properly identified, and because  R&D-related obligations could potentially be reported in other accounts  that may not contain the term \u201cresearch,\u201d we report the data as a  minimum of the amount that DHS could have obligated for fiscal years  2010 through 2017. We also interviewed DHS officials, including those from the DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and the S&T  Finance and Budget Division to obtain and corroborate information about  R&D-related obligations, budget and expenditure tracking tools and  reports. To identify what types of R&D DHS conducts, we reviewed DHS  documents including congressional budget justifications and fact sheets.  To learn more about the types of R&D activities that DHS components  conduct, we also interviewed officials from each of the 10 components  that are involved in the Integrated Product Teams (IPT), which is DHS\u2019s  primary R&D coordination mechanism. Based on IPT charter documents  and S&T IPT guidance, we identified the components that are to  participate in the IPT process. These components were: the Countering  Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency, the U.S. Secret Service, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis,  the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement.", "To determine the extent to which S&T coordinates R&D across DHS, we  analyzed DHS guidance documents, such as management directives,  instructions, and memoranda, which assign R&D-related roles and  responsibilities and govern certain R&D coordination practices.

We also interviewed DHS officials with roles and responsibilities  related to R&D to obtain their perspectives on R&D coordination and the  relevant guidance documents, including officials who manage IPT  operations. To further understand the IPT process, we conducted  interviews with officials from the 10 DHS components that participate in  the IPT process to obtain their perspectives on the benefits and  challenges of the process. Furthermore, we analyzed IPT-related  documentation including charter documents, IPT meeting agendas and  minutes, and IPT guidance documents to determine how the process  facilitates R&D coordination efforts. We also interviewed DHS officials  responsible for department-wide requirements identification.", "To examine the extent to which DHS tracks and identifies R&D efforts, we  interviewed S&T officials to determine what tracking mechanisms are  used. We also reviewed existing lists of DHS R&D projects, such as  DHS\u2019s Report of Coordinated R&D, DHS\u2019s responses to congressional  inquiries regarding R&D project lists, outputs from electronic tracking  systems, such as S&T\u2019s Project Tracker Database, and R&D projects  listed in congressional budget justification documents, among other  things. We also interviewed S&T officials involved in developing the R&D  project information sources to determine how the lists are compiled, how  information is entered into the sources, and what the benefits and  challenges are for each source of R&D project information that we  identified. In addition, we interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s OCFO and  reviewed departmental financial management policies to learn about how  the recently-implemented common appropriations structure has affected  the transparency of R&D efforts across DHS.", "To determine the extent to which DHS components with R&D budget  authority collected and reported performance information to assess their  R&D efforts, we reviewed applicable laws governing performance  reporting in the federal government, including the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as updated and expanded  by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), and guidance for  implementing these laws. We also reviewed leading practices, identified  in our prior work, used by organizations related to R&D performance  indicators. In addition, we reviewed leading practices for project,  program and portfolio management and reviewed DHS documents  related to its processes for collecting and reporting its performance  information. The documents reviewed included policies and guidance  regarding how these processes are to operate, the information to be  collected, as well as documents used to communicate performance  information, including DHS\u2019s Annual Performance Report, as well as  DHS\u2019s congressional budget justification documents. To illustrate how  DHS uses one method to track R&D progress, we analyzed selected  milestones in the congressional budget justification documents for 7 of  DHS\u2019s approximately 132 reported R&D projects. To conduct our  analysis, we identified two milestones each from the selection of seven  R&D projects that S&T officials consider to be high priority. We selected  the two milestones from the most recent year for each project; if there  were more than two milestones, we randomly selected two. The  milestones, selected from the fiscal year 2018 budget documents, were  assessed against DHS guidance that its components are to utilize to  develop the milestones. Two analysts independently reviewed the  milestones and resolved any disagreements in their assessments. To  further understand the information used to assess R&D performance, we  interviewed officials from the seven IPT-participating DHS components  with R&D budget authority to learn how they collect and report  performance information. We also examined guidance to components for  collecting and reporting performance information, such as performance  goals and milestones, and customer feedback mechanisms.", "We also interviewed officials from various DHS offices that are involved in  managing, collecting or using R&D performance information from across  the department.

DHS\u2019s Office of Policy develops  strategies, operational plans, and leads the development of operational  and resource allocation guidance for the department, among other things.  Further, we reviewed performance information and documents related to  DHS\u2019s process for assessing and reporting its annual performance goals.  This included performance information reported in DHS\u2019s Annual  Performance Report for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and in  congressional budget justification documents for fiscal year 2018 for the  DHS components that conduct R&D.

In December 2017, DHS officials reported that they had not  yet submitted the report, and anticipated that the response to the NDAA  requirement would be completed by January 2018. In August 2018, DHS  submitted its response to the committee, then 19 months late. S&T  officials stated that the reporting delays were due to challenges in  collecting and integrating the data. S&T officials also reported that it used  the components\u2019 congressional budget justification documents as a  starting point to identify R&D projects to include in its report in response  to the NDAA requirement. However, additional details about the R&D  projects had to be collected via a \u201cdata call\u201d process from the  components. S&T officials told us that it was a challenge to have  components report information about their R&D projects consistently and  systematically. Furthermore, S&T officials identified terminology-related  challenges in their R&D data call efforts, including making distinctions  between R&D projects, efforts, and activities. S&T officials also reported  that, in its current format, they would not be able to easily identify how  many projects were added to the NDAA list across years, or if a given  R&D project experienced a large increase or decrease in funding.", "Annual Reports of Coordinated R&D: In response to a 2015 request  from the Secretary of Homeland Security that the IPTs identify R&D work  being performed across DHS, S&T issued a \u201cReport of Coordinated R&D\u201d  in 2016 and 2017.

The reports \u2013 for 2016 and 2017 \u2013 contain tables of R&D  project names and the component leading the project, among other  things. However, during the course of our review, S&T officials reported  that these annual reports should not be considered authoritative lists of  R&D projects due to inconsistencies in the project information that  components reported which led to the reports not being comprehensive.  For example, when we asked about some significant variations in the  number of projects between 2016 and 2017, S&T officials told us that one  DHS component responded to the data call with a list of R&D activities  that included a \u201cwish list\u201d of R&D for their component, and not actual  ongoing R&D activities. DHS officials acknowledged that they do not have  a mechanism to ensure the comprehensiveness of information reported  by the components through the data call process. In addition, two  components did not respond to S&T\u2019s request for R&D project information  for the 2017 Annual Report of Coordinated R&D.", "Congressional Budget Justifications: In May 2018, in the absence of a  single, comprehensive list of R&D projects across DHS prior to the  issuance of its report in response to the NDAA, S&T officials referred us  to the R&D projects listed within the seven individual congressional  budget justifications for the components that currently have budget  authority to conduct R&D. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, S&T officials  used the congressional budget justifications as their starting point in  developing their response to the NDAA. However, S&T officials stated  that there may be differences between the projects listed in the NDAA  response and the projects listed in the congressional budget justifications.  For example, S&T stated that the report in response to the NDAA  includes all \u201congoing\u201d projects, regardless of the fiscal year in which they  received funds; while the congressional budget justifications include R&D  projects for which funding was requested for the given fiscal year.

Accordingly, the Committee directed S&T to develop a method or system  for tracking all S&T-funded R&D projects. A November 2016 DHS  Directive reiterates this requirement, specifying that the list of projects  should be updated on at least a quarterly basis throughout the duration of  an R&D project. S&T officials told us that, in response to the committee  report, they developed the Project Tracker Database, which was in use at  the time of our review, but was transitioned to a new system, the S&T  Analytical Tracking System, in September 2018. Neither the S&T  Analytical Tracking System nor its predecessor system, the Project  Tracker Database, is intended to comprehensively collect information on  R&D projects across the department, only for R&D projects managed  within S&T.

The disparate R&D project information sources that S&T  maintains, such as DHS\u2019s response to the National Defense Authorization  Act of 2017 and the Annual Reports of Coordinated R&D discussed  above, and the manual data-call process it takes to update the sources  limits departmental access to current and reliable R&D project information. For example, an internal DHS web-based portal with pre- defined fields could provide component officials with a means for  reporting information more consistently and comprehensively. Without  complete and readily accessible R&D information, DHS may not have the  information it needs to make informed decisions about R&D investments,  such as which projects are to be prioritized. By developing a mechanism  to address challenges and limitations related to the collection, integration,  and comprehensiveness of R&D data across the department, S&T can  improve its visibility on R&D efforts across DHS in accordance with its  role as DHS\u2019s coordinator of R&D efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Effectively Developed Some R&D Performance Management Information, Posing Challenges to Assess and Report on the Progress of R&D Projects", "paragraphs": ["DHS components have processes in place to collect certain indicators of  R&D performance, but we found that these processes have limitations.
