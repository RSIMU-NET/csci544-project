In recent years, Congress has added other embargo measures\u2014enacting the CDA of 1992  and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (also known as the Helms-Burton Act). The CDA restricts U.S.-owned or -controlled firms in third countries from exporting to Cuba and authorizes humanitarian and telecommunications exports. The Helms-Burton Act codified the embargo in effect on March 1, 1996, and added other provisions related to the rights of U.S. citizens whose property has been confiscated by the Cuban government.", "In March 1998, the President announced (1) the restoration of direct charter flights between the United States and Cuba for authorized U.S. travelers, (2) a plan to streamline and expedite licensing procedures for medical exports, and (3) the reinstitution of family remittances up to $300 per quarter from persons in the United States to their families in Cuba.

The primary purpose of the travel restrictions is to stop the flow of hard currency from the United States to Cuba.", "The CACRs allow limited categories of U.S. persons to spend money on travel to Cuba without seeking OFAC approval. These include (1) official government travelers; (2) journalists; and (3) once per year, persons traveling to visit close relatives in Cuba under circumstances of extreme humanitarian need. In addition, U.S. persons whose expenses are fully paid by a non-U.S. person, including a Cuban or the Cuban government, may also travel to Cuba without OFAC approval.

Following the shootdown of two \u201cBrothers to the Rescue\u201d aircraft on February 26, 1996, the President suspended all direct flights between the United States and Cuba. OFAC then notified authorized carrier service providers that they could arrange indirect flights provided that U.S. responsibility for such flights ended in the third country. Authorized travelers could travel to Cuba by changing flights in the third country and flying on to Cuba. Under this procedure, responsibility for the second leg of the flight had to be assumed by a non-U.S. tour sponsor using non-U.S. aircraft and flight crews. Moreover, at that time, the requirement to change flights meant a change of aircraft.", "According to OFAC, several problems arose regarding air carrier service to third countries. First, OFAC became aware that most air service between the third-country destinations and Cuba was provided by a Cuban airline. Since authorized travelers had to pay the airline for tickets, additional U.S. currency was provided to Cuba. Second, authorized travelers\u2019 need to carry currency to meet expenses in third countries significantly complicated Customs\u2019 outbound search in the United States for excess currency going to Cuba. Third, since all travelers to Cuba\u2014both legal and illegal\u2014were going through third countries, Customs had to deal with assertions by some travelers that their final destination was the third country and not Cuba. Thus, Customs could not act with certainty about how much U.S. currency each passenger could legitimately take. And finally, travelers\u2019 need to change aircraft in the third country often resulted in substantial delays or overnight stays for passengers awaiting connecting flights, thereby necessitating the possession of additional funds.", "To address these problems, OFAC informed all carrier service providers by letter dated July 9, 1996, that they could permit authorized travelers to remain on board the non-U.S. aircraft for a continuing flight to Cuba from a third country, provided that the flight number was changed and the U.S. service provider\u2019s responsibility for the second leg of the flight ended in the third country.", "We find OFAC\u2019s July 9 change in procedure to be consistent with its authority under section 5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act, which conferred broad authority on the President and, by delegation to OFAC, to implement comprehensive embargoes against foreign countries. This change is consistent with section 102(h) of the Helms-Burton Act. Section 102(h) states that \u201cthe economic embargo of Cuba, as in effect on March 1, 1996, including all restrictions under part 515 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be in effect upon the enactment of this Act, and shall remain in effect, subject to section 204 of this Act.\u201d Under 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 515.201, financial transactions with Cuba, which include travel expenses, are generally prohibited except as specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury by regulations, licenses or otherwise. Section 204 requires a presidential determination that a transition government in Cuba is in power before the economic sanctions can be either suspended or terminated.", "The conference report accompanying the act explains that section 102(h) was not intended to prohibit executive branch agencies from amending existing regulations to tighten economic sanctions on Cuba or to otherwise implement Helms-Burton. According to OFAC, two of the principal purposes of the July 9 procedure were to afford greater U.S. control over flights and passengers, and to reduce currency transfers to Cuba resulting from authorized travelers flying from third countries to Cuba on a Cuban airline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Direct Flights to Cuba Are Consistent With U.S. Law", "paragraphs": ["In May 1998, the executive branch released its regulations for the resumption of direct passenger charter flights between Miami, Florida, and Havana, Cuba, effective June 15, 1998. Under the revised procedures, U.S.-licensed carrier service providers can arrange direct flights to Cuba, using either U.S. or non-U.S. aircraft and flight crews. The executive branch also restored direct humanitarian cargo flights between the United States and Cuba and imposed additional monitoring procedures on fully hosted travel to Cuba. Regarding the latter, it established a presumption that U.S. persons who travel to Cuba without authorization have engaged in prohibited travel-related transactions. Fully hosted travelers can rebut this presumption by giving federal enforcement agencies, upon request, relevant supporting documentation showing that they have not engaged in prohibited transactions.", "According to OFAC, restoration of direct flights between the United States and Cuba is likely to give U.S. enforcement agencies\u2014primarily Customs and OFAC\u2014greater control over U.S. persons and humanitarian cargo than they had on flights routed through third countries. Enhanced control also appears to reduce, to some extent, the potential for illegal transfers of currency into Cuba.", "We concur with OFAC\u2019s position regarding the executive branch\u2019s authority to restore direct flights. We also believe that it is within OFAC\u2019s authority to strengthen the monitoring procedures on fully hosted travel to Cuba. Among other things, this restriction is intended to make it more difficult for travelers to spend money in Cuba.

Under title III, the term \u201ctraffics\u201d includes a broad range of activities undertaken without the authorization of the U.S. national who holds a claim to the property. Title IV of the act authorizes the Secretary of State to deny a visa to, and the Attorney General to exclude from the United States, an alien that the Secretary determines has confiscated or trafficked in property owned by a U.S. national. For title IV sanctions to apply, the trafficking had to occur on or after March 12, 1996.", "After enactment of Helms-Burton, the State Department began an investigation of STET International, an Italian firm, which benefits from the use of ITT property confiscated in Cuba. Before State concluded its investigation on July 15, 1997, ITT and STET entered into an agreement under which ITT (1) allowed STET to use its confiscated property and (2) waived its right to bring any action against STET for such use, for a 10-year period. ITT also agreed to cooperate with STET in contacts with State to help ensure that no STET personnel would be excluded from the United States under title IV. In exchange, STET agreed to make a substantial one-time payment to ITT. In July 1997, State terminated its investigation. Subsequently, STET paid ITT the agreed-upon amount. State said that the agreement constituted a major step forward in the enforcement of Helms-Burton, reinforced the principle of respect for the property rights of U.S. citizens, and would serve as a disincentive to other foreign firms currently operating in or considering investment in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba without authorization of the U.S. claimant.", "In reviewing the agreement, State determined that as long as it is implemented in accordance with its terms, for the 10-year period covered, STET\u2019s use of ITT\u2019s confiscated property will not constitute \u201ctrafficking.\u201d The term traffics does not apply when U.S. nationals authorize other parties to make use of confiscated property for which they have claims. According to State, claimants may waive the title III private right of action. State also pointed out that the amount STET agreed to pay ITT was not insubstantial and, as such, suggests that the agreement was not a subterfuge for avoiding the intent of titles III and IV.", "We have reviewed the agreement and State\u2019s analysis and find the agreement consistent with the language and intention of titles III and IV of Helms-Burton.

For example, one carrier\u2019s report of currency transfers to Cuba during 1997 included a significant amount for passengers actually transported in 1996, but the carrier reported the number of passengers transported in 1997 only.

We believe that OFAC has the authority to make the family remittance changes under its general licensing authority, which was included in the codification of the embargo under section 102(h). Moreover, section 112 of Helms-Burton specifically addresses the reinstitution of general licenses for family remittances. This section expressed the sense of Congress that prior to such reinstitution, the President should insist that the Cuban government take steps to foster economic freedoms for small businesses in Cuba, among other conditions. Congress further suggested that if a general license was reinstituted, the administration should continue to require specific licenses for amounts over $500. In our view, section 112 clearly indicates that, even after section 102(h) of Helms-Burton codified the embargo in effect on March 1, 1996, the administration retained the authority to reinstitute a general license for family remittances.", "In their comments on this report, both OFAC and the Department of State noted that the administration carefully considered the sense of Congress, but determined that it was important to institute the changes promptly after the Pope\u2019s visit to Cuba in January 1998.

The comments specifically stated the view that the issue of family remittances was a matter \u201csubject to Presidential discretion in weighing the humanitarian purpose of allowing U.S. residents and citizens to support family members in Cuba against the resulting flow of hard currency to Cuba.\u201d Nevertheless, because these changes will likely result in increased transfers of currency to Cuba, they do not appear to further the general purpose of the embargo to limit such transfers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. embargo of Cuba has been in place for over 36 years. Under the embargo, the U.S. government has formulated regulations that balance policy objectives of the embargo with humanitarian needs of Cuban-Americans with family ties to Cuba. The embargo has been adjusted a number of times. Some changes tightened the embargo to further restrict transfers of hard currency to Cuba, one of the embargo\u2019s principal purposes, and others have loosened it in furtherance of humanitarian considerations.", "The executive branch has broad authority under U.S. law to make changes in the embargo as circumstances dictate. Overall, the changes discussed in this report are consistent with this broad authority. The changes in the regulations that permit general family remittances to Cuba may serve a humanitarian purpose, but they do not appear to further the U.S. objective of limiting currency transfers to Cuba.", "In some respects, the embargo has not been easy to enforce. It is difficult for U.S. enforcement agencies to monitor people and goods once they leave U.S. borders, and most foreign countries do not cooperate with U.S. embargo restrictions. Furthermore, there have been relatively few prosecutions of travel and export cases because of difficulties of proof, lack of jury appeal in cases where humanitarian issues may be present, and the relatively small amounts of goods or currency that are involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Treasury Department\u2019s OFAC and the State Department provided written comments on a draft of this report.

OFAC and State stated that the issue of family remittances is a matter of presidential discretion in weighing the humanitarian purpose of allowing U.S. residents and citizens to support family members in Cuba against the resulting flow of hard currency to Cuba. OFAC and State also noted that Helms-Burton does not prohibit OFAC from making reasonable adjustments to the family remittance licensing regime.

Helms-Burton also required the President to submit to Congress a semiannual report detailing payments made to Cuba by U.S. persons providing telecommunications services to Cuba.", "In July 1993, the State Department set forth the executive branch\u2019s general policy guidelines for implementing the telecommunications provision of the CDA. Under these guidelines, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for licensing travel by U.S. companies to Cuba to discuss possible contractual arrangements and payment terms. Commerce is responsible for licensing the export of U.S. telecommunications commodities to Cuba for approved telecommunications projects to the extent that the exports are necessary to deliver a signal to an international gateway to Cuba.

However, according to AT&T and MCI officials, the project was dropped for a number of reasons, including congressional concerns about a counterintelligence security risk posed by Cuba\u2019s possible access to fiber-optic technology.", "As a general matter, upgrade of the undersea cable would appear to be possible under the CDA, as amended by Helms-Burton, and the executive branch guidelines. These guidelines, in essence, direct the FCC to approve proposals utilizing modes of communications already in place between the United States and Cuba and cite the undersea cable as an example.

In 1963, Congress amended the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to preclude Cuba from receiving any quota authorizing the import of Cuban sugar into the United States until the President determines that Cuba has taken appropriate steps either (1) to return to U.S. citizens and entities the properties taken by Cuba on or after January 1, 1959, or (2) to provide equitable compensation for their confiscation. The President can waive this requirement pursuant to a national interest determination.", "Helms-Burton stated that protection of essential U.S. security interests required assurances that sugar products that enter the United States or are withdrawn from warehouses for consumption in the United States are not Cuban products. Furthermore, any country that desires to be allocated a U.S. import quota for either refined or raw sugar and is a net importer of sugar must certify to the President, through the State Department, that its sugar exports to the United States do not contain any sugar produced in Cuba.
