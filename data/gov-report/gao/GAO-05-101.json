Found in 26 countries, including Canada and the United States, BSE is believed to spread through animal feed that contains protein from BSE-infected animals. Consuming meat from infected cattle has also been linked to the deaths of about 150 people worldwide. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a feed-ban rule prohibiting certain animal protein (prohibited material) in feed for cattle and other ruminant animals. FDA and 38 states inspect firms in the feed industry to enforce this critical firewall against BSE. In 2002, GAO reported a number of weaknesses in FDA's enforcement of the feed ban and recommended corrective actions. This report looks at FDA's efforts since 2002 to ensure industry compliance with the feed ban and protect U.S. cattle."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FDA has made needed improvements to its management and oversight of the feed-ban rule in response to GAO's 2002 report, but program weaknesses continue to limit the effectiveness of the ban and place U.S. cattle at risk of spreading BSE. Improvements made include FDA establishing a uniform method of conducting compliance inspections and training FDA inspectors, as well as state inspectors who carry out inspections under agreements with FDA, on the new method. FDA also implemented new data-entry procedures that are designed to more reliably track feed-ban inspection results. Consequently, FDA has a better management tool for overseeing compliance with the feed-ban rule and a data system that better conforms to standard database management practices. However, various program weaknesses continue to undermine the nation's firewall against BSE. FDA acknowledges that there are more feed manufacturers and transporters, on-farm mixers, and other feed industry businesses that are subject to the feed ban than the approximately 14,800 firms inspected to date; however, it has no uniform approach for identifying additional firms. FDA has not reinspected approximately 2,800, or about 19 percent, of those businesses, in 5 or more years; several hundred are potentially high risk. FDA does not know whether those businesses now use prohibited material in their feed. FDA's feed-ban inspection guidance does not include instructions to routinely sample cattle feed to test for potentially prohibited material as part of the compliance inspection. Instead, it includes guidance for inspectors to visually examine facilities and equipment and review invoices and other documents. Feed intended for export is not required to carry a caution label \"Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants,\" when the label would be required if the feed were sold domestically. Without that statement, feed containing prohibited material could be inadvertently or intentionally diverted back to U.S. cattle or given to foreign cattle. FDA has not always alerted USDA and states when it learned that cattle may have been given feed that contained prohibited material. This lapse has been occurring even though FDA's guidance calls for such communication. Although research suggests that cattle can get BSE from ingesting even a small amount of infected material, inspectors do not routinely inspect or review cleanout procedures for vehicles used to haul cattle feed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow  disease, is an always fatal neurodegenerative animal disease that has been  found in cattle in 26 countries since it was first identified in the United  Kingdom in 1986. In December 2003, the United States discovered its first  case of BSE in a cow in Washington State. The U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) later determined that this cow was imported from  Canada. The agent believed to be responsible for BSE is a malformed type  of protein called a prion, found in certain tissue\u2014particularly brain and  central nervous system tissue\u2014of infected animals. Cattle contract BSE by  eating feed derived from the remains of BSE-infected animals. In Europe,  more than 5 million head of cattle have been killed to thwart the spread of  the disease. Scientists also generally believe that a fatal disease in  humans\u2014knows as variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD)\u2014is linked to  eating beef contaminated with the malformed protein. Research suggests  that vCJD is difficult for humans to contract\u2014about 150 people have died  worldwide from vCJD. Both diseases have long incubation periods during  which they are undetectable\u20142 to 8 years in cattle and possibly up to 30  years in humans.", "USDA is primarily responsible for detecting the disease in cattle, and the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) is primarily responsible for preventing its introduction and spread  through animal feed. Both agencies recognize the importance of preventing  BSE from becoming established in the United States\u2014not only to protect  the safety of the U.S. food supply but also to protect the economic viability  of the $70 billion U.S. beef industry. With 95 million head of cattle, the  United States is the world\u2019s largest beef producer, exporting a record 2.6  billion pounds of beef, valued at over $3.1 billion, in 2003. In January 2002,  we reported that the potential impact of even a small outbreak of BSE in  the United States could be economically devastating. Indeed, between  January and September 2004, the industry lost more than 80 percent of its  export trade, or an estimated $2 billion, following the discovery of the one  BSE-infected animal in December 2003. Although most countries stopped  importing U.S. beef for some period of time, domestic consumption did not  drop. In fact, changing dietary trends have led to increased U.S. beef  consumption in the last several years. The United States is in discussions  with its major trading partners about renewing U.S. beef imports.", "To protect U.S. cattle and consumers, USDA and FDA have put in place  three primary firewalls. These include the following:   Controls over imports. Since 1989, USDA has prohibited the  importation of live cattle and certain cattle products from countries  where BSE is known to exist. In 1992, FDA began identifying medical  products and other FDA-regulated foods and products derived from  cattle from countries with BSE. USDA and FDA, in cooperation with the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Customs and Border Protection,  screen shipments of such products.", "Animal surveillance. Since 1990, to detect BSE, USDA has been testing  brain tissue, primarily from cattle that exhibit neurological symptoms  and adult cattle that die from unknown causes, as well as from cattle  slaughtered for meat.", "Feed ban. In 1997, FDA banned the use of most proteins derived from  mammals in feed intended for cattle and other ruminants to keep  potentially infectious tissue out of cattle feed.", "This report focuses on FDA\u2019s implementation and enforcement of the  animal feed-ban rule, which many industry and consumer groups consider  the most important firewall against the introduction and spread of BSE in  the United States.", "Under the feed-ban rule, FDA requires firms to (1) label feed and feed  ingredients that contain or may contain most proteins from most mammals  (referred to hereafter as prohibited material) with a cautionary statement  that reads \u201cDo not feed to cattle or other ruminants,\u201d (2) have procedures  to protect against commingling or cross-contamination if they handle both  prohibited and nonprohibited material for feed and feed ingredients, and  (3) maintain records so that feed and feed ingredients that contain or may  contain prohibited material can be tracked from receipt through  disposition. Firms that transport both types of materials also must have  procedures to prevent commingling.", "FDA\u2019s feed-ban rule applies to feed for cattle and other ruminants, such as  sheep and goats. The material prohibited for use in cattle feed may  continue to be used in pet food and in feed for poultry, swine, horses, and  other nonruminant animals.", "The feed-ban rule designates a number of cattle- and other animal-derived  items as exempt from the ban, and hence allowable in cattle feed. These  exempt items include blood and blood products, plate waste, gelatin, and  milk and milk proteins. In addition, poultry litter (a protein source  comprised of poultry waste material, bedding, and spilled feed) is allowed  in cattle feed. FDA has published, but not taken action on, several advance  notices of proposed rulemaking for revising the ban to, among other things,  end most of the exemptions and require that feed manufacturers and other  such firms use dedicated equipment for cattle feed.", "To oversee compliance with the feed ban, inspectors from FDA and the 38  states that have contracts or agreements with FDA periodically inspect  firms, using FDA guidance and an inspection form that FDA developed to  document inspection results. Since 1997, FDA and states have identified  and inspected about 14,800 firms that are subject to the feed-ban rule. The  types of firms inspected include renderers, protein blenders, feed mills,  farms that mix their own feed, feed transporters, pet food manufacturers,  and other firms subject to the feed-ban rule. In 2002, FDA began using a  risk-based priority approach to determine which firms to inspect annually.  Under this approach, FDA has designated firms that manufacture, blend,  and otherwise directly process with prohibited material as the highest risk  for potentially exposing U.S. cattle to BSE. Firms that do not process with  prohibited material are designated as lower risk. FDA had designated about  570 firms as high risk in fiscal year 2004. FDA assigns a list of high-risk  firms for inspection to each of its district offices and gives the district  offices some discretion in deciding which lower risk firms to inspect. FDA  also negotiates with states over the number of inspections that FDA will  pay for under contract. States conduct about 70 percent of feed-ban  compliance inspections. When FDA determines that firms are out of  compliance, it can issue warning letters, encourage firms to conduct  voluntary recalls, or seek court orders to seize feed or feed ingredients.  FDA district offices review inspection results for accuracy and enter  inspection information into FDA\u2019s central data system\u2014the Field  Accomplishments and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS)\u2014and  periodically post inspection results on FDA\u2019s Web site.", "Our January 2002 report identified a number of weaknesses in federal BSE  prevention and detection efforts. Regarding the feed ban, we reported that  FDA had not promptly taken actions, such as issuing warning letters or  reinspecting firms that were out of compliance, to enforce the feed ban and  keep prohibited material out of cattle feed. We also reported that FDA\u2019s  data on inspections were so severely flawed that the agency could not  know the extent of industry compliance. We made a number of  recommendations to strengthen FDA\u2019s enforcement of the feed ban and its  oversight and monitoring of compliance inspections.", "As you requested, this report examines the effectiveness of the actions  FDA has taken, since our 2002 report, to ensure industry compliance with  the animal feed ban and protect U.S. cattle from BSE. In addition, appendix  III provides a chronology of FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s actions in response to the  two cases of BSE discovered in North America in 2003.", "In conducting our work, we examined in detail 404 inspection reports from  fiscal years 2003 and 2004, which we randomly selected from FDA\u2019s 18  district offices responsible for inspections in the 50 states. We interviewed  FDA district officials in the 18 districts and observed FDA and state  investigators conduct 19 inspections in 12 states. The sites were selected to  cover a range of firm types and sizes in various geographic locations with  concentrations of cattle feeding operations, including dairy cattle. We met  with FDA headquarters\u2019 officials responsible for procedures and actions  taken to (1) oversee and enforce the feed ban, (2) maintain the inspection  data system, and (3) propose and analyze regulatory decisions. We also  surveyed state agency officials in the 38 states that had contracts or  agreements with FDA in fiscal year 2004 regarding their inspection  programs, testing of animal feed and feed ingredients, and the training and  guidance they received from FDA. The state survey instrument and  summary of responses appear in appendix IV. Appendix I contains a  detailed description of our scope and methodology. We performed our  work from October 2003 through January 2005, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards, which included an  assessment of FDA\u2019s BSE program data reliability and internal controls."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["BSE and vCJD belong to a family of diseases known as transmissible  spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Other TSEs include scrapie in sheep  and goats, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, feline spongiform  encephalopathy in domestic cats, and mink encephalopathy. Currently, no  therapies or vaccines exist to treat TSEs and a definitive diagnosis can only  be made from a post-mortem examination of the brain. The infective agent  that gives rise to TSEs is generally thought to be a malformed type of  protein, called a prion, which causes normal molecules of the same type of protein in the brain to become malformed and eventually results in death.  Prions are neither viruses nor bacteria and contain no genetic material\u2014no  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Prions cannot be readily destroyed by  conventional heat, irradiation, chemical disinfection, or sterilization  procedures. TSE prions have been found to accumulate in central nervous  system tissue\u2014specifically the brain, spinal cord, and eye\u2014and have been  found in other body tissues, such as the tonsils and small intestines, of  animals and humans. For BSE, the precise amount of infective material  needed to cause disease is unknown, but research suggests that it is very  small. According to scientific experts in the European Commission, in  careful feeding experiments, less than 1 gram of infected brain tissue  induced disease in all the recipient cattle.", "The original source of BSE is not known with certainty. However, based on  available evidence, experts generally agree that the practice of recycling  the remains of diseased animals, specifically scrapie-infected sheep, into  feed for livestock, including cattle, was responsible for the emergence and  spread of BSE in the United Kingdom. In 1986, BSE was first identified in  the United Kingdom; and in 1988, that government banned the practice of  feeding ruminant-derived protein to ruminants to thwart its spread. The  number of new cases of BSE has declined from a high in 1992 of 37,316 to a  total of 764 new cases in 2004. BSE has been found in about 189,000  animals worldwide, most of which (about 184,000) were discovered in the  United Kingdom. The remaining cases were discovered in 26 countries,  including Canada and the United States. Three nations\u2014the United States,  Oman, and the Falkland Islands\u2014have only detected the disease in  imported animals. The following are the number of reported cases, by  region and/or country:   Europe. United Kingdom\u2014184,045; the rest of Europe\u20145,107;  North America. Canada\u20144; United States\u20141;  Asia-Pacific. Japan\u201414; and  South America. Falkland Islands\u20141.", "In 1996, the United Kingdom reported the first case of the human disease,  vCJD. Scientists believe vCJD is linked to exposure to the BSE prion, most  likely through consuming beef and beef products infected with BSE.  While scientists and regulatory officials believe that millions of people in  the United Kingdom may have ingested BSE-infected tissue, many also  believe vCJD is difficult to contract. As of December 1, 2003, 153 cases of  vCJD had been reported worldwide, with 143 of these cases in the United  Kingdom. The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, which is responsible for surveillance of  vCJD, reported that almost all of the vCJD victims had multiple-year  exposures in the United Kingdom during the height of the outbreak of  BSE-infected cattle\u2014between 1980 and 1996. Most vCJD victims have been  young\u2014the average age at death was 28\u2014and half died within 13 months  from the time they first showed symptoms.", "The first indigenous case of BSE in North America was discovered in  Canada in May 2003. (Canada\u2019s first infected cow, discovered in 1993, had  been imported from the United Kingdom.) A Canadian government  investigation concluded that the infected cow discovered in 2003 most  likely contracted the disease by consuming feed containing  BSE-contaminated ruminant material, probably before Canada imposed its  feed ban in 1997. Canadian authorities believe that BSE entered the feed  chain through slaughtered and rendered cattle imported from the United  Kingdom. In December 2003, an animal infected with BSE was discovered  in the United States. According to U.S. authorities, that animal\u2014a dairy  cow in Washington State\u2014had been part of a herd of 81 cattle imported  from Canada in September 2001. Appendix III describes FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s  actions in response to the 2003 discoveries. In January 2005, Canada  discovered two more cases of BSE.", "Following the discovery of the infected cow in the United States, U.S. beef  exports dropped precipitously. The United States is currently engaged in  discussions with its major trade partners to reestablish beef exports. In  October 2004, Japan, previously the largest importer of U.S. beef, agreed in  principle to resume imports of certain beef products from cattle  slaughtered at 20 months or younger; as of February 11, 2005, the two  countries were working out the details of this agreement.", "To detect potentially prohibited material in feed, FDA uses a test called  \u201cfeed microscopy,\u201d which is a visual examination of a sample under a  microscope for the presence of animal tissue, such as hair and bone  particles. According to FDA officials, when performed by an experienced  analyst, the species can sometimes be identified. FDA is evaluating a more  sensitive test called \u201cpolymerase chain reaction\u201d (PCR), which detects  animal DNA and can distinguish ruminant DNA. However, feed containing  exempt items (e.g., milk and blood proteins) derived from ruminants would  test positive for ruminant DNA using PCR.", "When inspectors find violations of the feed-ban rule, FDA can issue  warning letters, and firms may conduct voluntary feed recalls. FDA has the  authority to take immediate enforcement action, including seeking a court  order to seize feed products that violate the feed ban or obtaining a  court-ordered injunction ordering a firm to cease operations. Of the 38  states we surveyed, 37 told us they have authority to take action for  violations of the feed ban. FDA directs its districts to issue warning letters  within 30 workdays\u2014approximately 45 calendar days after the inspection.  Warning letters give firms the opportunity to voluntarily take corrective  action before FDA initiates enforcement actions.", "Under the risk-based priority inspection system that FDA adopted in 2002,  FDA and states have focused inspection resources on the following types  of firms, which FDA has designated as high-risk for potentially exposing  cattle to BSE:  renderers that accept dead ruminant animals and/or the waste materials  from beef slaughter facilities;  feed mills that use prohibited material, which can include FDA-licensed  mills that handle certain new animal drugs for use in animal feeds and  nonlicensed mills that do not handle such animal drugs; and   protein blenders that use prohibited material.", "Other firms subject to the feed ban include the following:  firms that manufacture only pet food;  firms that transport or distribute animal feed;  firms that salvage animal feed or pet food; and  other firms that handle animal feed, including retailers, grocery  warehouses, and specialty food companies.", "In addition to inspections of high-risk firms, FDA asks states to perform a  number of inspections at the lower risk firms under their contracts or  agreements with FDA. FDA also performs inspections of some lower risk  firms. Table 1 shows the number of firms inspected during fiscal year 2004.", "Our 2002 report found that  FDA was not acting promptly to compel firms to keep prohibited  materials out of cattle feed and to label animal feed that cannot be fed to  cattle;   FDA\u2019s data on feed inspections was so severely flawed that FDA did not  know the full extent of industry compliance;  FDA had no clear enforcement strategy for firms that do not obey the  feed ban and did not know what enforcement actions states had taken;  and  FDA had been using inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable data to track  and oversee feed-ban compliance.", "A 2001 study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis noted that the  greatest risk of BSE exposure to cattle in the United States is through  mishandling, mislabeling, or contaminating cattle feed. The study  developed a simulation model for predicting the number of infected  animals that would result from the introduction of BSE into the United  States. Using this model, the Harvard study concluded that, if 10 cattle  infected with BSE were imported into the United States, only three new  cases of BSE would likely occur, on average, and that BSE is virtually  certain to be eliminated from the United States within 20 years following its  introduction. According to the study, any new cases of BSE would come  primarily from industry\u2019s failure to comply with the feed ban. A subsequent  2003 Harvard reassessment\u2014following the discovery of the BSE-infected  cow in Canada that year\u2014arrived at a similar conclusion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Taken Important Steps to Improve Implementation of the Feed Ban", "paragraphs": ["Since our January 2002 report, FDA has changed the way it collects, tracks,  and reports inspection data. In April 2002, FDA implemented a uniform  inspection form for federal and state inspectors to document inspection  results. Although FDA had an inspection form earlier, inspectors were not  always completing the required information, and several states did not use  FDA\u2019s form.", "FDA has also issued feed-ban inspection guidance and appointed BSE  coordinators in each of its district offices to review inspection forms for  completeness. The district BSE coordinators told us that FDA has trained  inspectors on using the inspection form and carrying out inspections.  Although most states reported that this training was sufficient, a few told  us that they had not received training since the late 1990s or were not able  to attend training because of state budget constraints. However, in  commenting on a draft of the report, FDA officials said that the agency  always offers to provide training to states, when requested.", "Regarding the data deficiencies we reported in 2002, FDA implemented a  newly designed feed-ban database and data entry procedures in its Field  Accomplishment and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS) in April 2002.  According to our analysis, this new approach and data system are designed  to more reliably track feed-ban inspection results. As a result, FDA has a  better management tool for overseeing compliance with the feed-ban rule  and a data system that better conforms to standard database management  practices. Specifically, FDA\u2019s new approach makes the following  improvements:  All firms have unique identifiers. Inspection records in FDA\u2019s data  system\u2014including those that were previously missing unique  identifiers\u2014now have them, according to our data reliability analysis.  Before the new approach, about 45 percent of FDA\u2019s feed inspection  records lacked information to identify individual firms. As a result, the  earlier data could not be used to reliably determine the number of firms  inspected, compliance trends over time, or the inspection history of an  individual firm. These problems should not occur with FDA\u2019s new  system.", "Information is substantially complete and accurate. FDA has  corrected information problems we had identified in our 2002 report,  according to our data reliability analysis of the inspections conducted  since April 15, 2002. The new FACTS database contains edit checks to  detect any incomplete or inaccurate data. Furthermore, FDA\u2019s current  feed-ban inspection guidance directs district BSE coordinators or their  designees to review BSE inspection forms for completeness and  accuracy. Previously, headquarters staff had entered the data received  from district offices and did not have sufficient knowledge to detect  irregularities in the data they were entering. In addition, states that have  contracts or agreements with FDA are now using the same inspection  forms as FDA. Previously, several states used state-developed forms,  which did not always provide comparable information.", "Data are more timely. Since April 15, 2002, about 95 percent of  inspections with serious violations have been entered into the FACTS  database within 45 days of the inspection date, according to our  analysis. This rate of entry is a significant improvement over the  timeliness of entry rates we reported in 2002. At that time, we found that  some inspections were entered into FDA\u2019s database 2 or more years  after the date of inspection. For such inspections, FDA could not  accurately report on firms\u2019 compliance with the feed ban and could not  clarify inconsistent or conflicting information, or obtain answers to  missing information\u2014situations that FDA\u2019s new approach should help  avoid.", "As a result of these improvements, FDA is able to present more reliable  feed ban inspection information on its Web site for the approximately  10,000 firms inspected since April 15, 2002, or about two-thirds of the  approximately 14,800 firms inspected since 1997.

However, FDA has not developed a systematic  approach for identifying additional firms subject to the feed ban. For  example, FDA does not have an approach for identifying additional  nonlicensed feed mills in states that do not provide that information. FDA  also acknowledged that it has identified only a small percentage of the  thousands of transportation firms that may haul cattle feed. Moreover, in  commenting on a draft of this report, FDA told us that there are an  estimated 1 million businesses (e.g., dairy farms feedlots, and other  facilities) that feed cattle and other animals. FDA also told us that it does  not consider farms that mix their own feed or feed cattle as well as other  animals as low risk. However, FDA does not have a strategy for ensuring  that this industry sector is in compliance with the feed-ban rule.", "We observed one approach for expanding the number of firms subject to  the feed ban: some FDA and state inspectors we accompanied on firm  inspections wrote down the names of the firm\u2019s suppliers and customers  during the inspection and checked these names against FDA\u2019s inventory of  firms to help identify additional firms. According to officials in one district  where we observed this practice, they inspect these additional firms as  resources allow. However, FDA does not have guidance for inspectors to  do this routinely, and we observed other inspectors who did not record the  names of firms\u2019 suppliers and customers. The approach we observed was  one that may be largely applied with existing resources.

However, once FDA has  inspected a firm and determined that it does not process with prohibited  materials, FDA may not reinspect that firm for many years. In the interim,  FDA does not know whether the firm has changed operations and now  processes prohibited materials because it does not require firms that do so  to notify the agency.

For example, the feed-ban inspection guidance  does not instruct inspectors to routinely sample cattle feed to verify firms\u2019  claims that they do not use prohibited materials or exempt ingredients, or  to ensure that firms\u2019 cleanout and flushing procedures to prevent  commingling are followed and are effective.", "We recognize that the usefulness of testing is limited at firms that use  exempt items\u2014cattle and other ruminant blood, milk proteins, poultry  litter, and plate waste\u2014as ingredients in cattle feed. FDA officials told us  that they did not want to routinely test samples at firms during inspections  because the tests would likely have many false positives as a result of the  exemptions. Consequently, officials believed testing would not use  resources wisely.", "However, in 9 of the 19 inspections we observed, inspectors could have  used tests to verify feed-ban compliance because the firms claimed they did  not use any animal-derived exempt items. Even in these instances, where  tests would be beneficial, inspectors did not sample the feed. For instance,  inspectors did not take samples to confirm the adequacy of cleanout  procedures at firms that use nondedicated production facilities to  manufacture cattle feed but do not use any exempt materials. FDA\u2019s  feed-ban inspection guidance allows inspectors to draw samples at their  discretion, but FDA officials told us that inspectors rely on their judgment  of whether the cleanout procedures appear to be adequate and rarely use  testing to verify their assessment. FDA officials did not give us a clear  reason why they would not advise testing in situations where tests would  be useful to help confirm compliance.", "Some states have also done significant testing that FDA could use to verify  compliance with the feed ban but do not provide their test results to FDA,  although that information could give FDA a more complete picture of feed  ban compliance. In response to our survey, 18 of the 38 states that have  agreements with FDA to conduct feed-ban inspections told us they had  collected and tested over 1,500 feed samples during 2003. For example,  according to a North Carolina Department of Agriculture official, the state  collected and tested 738 samples; and, according to a Kansas Department  of Agriculture official, the state collected and tested 94 samples. In these  states, if the tests find what appears to be prohibited material, the states  followed up with the firms to determine what ingredients they used.  According to the officials, no contaminated cattle feed was found. In  California, which collected and tested about 100 samples, officials found  tests to be useful for demonstrating to cattle feed manufacturers the  difficulties of cleaning equipment that has been used for prohibited  material. FDA and state agency officials told us that most California feed  firms have switched to using dedicated equipment for cattle feed. Eleven of  the 18 states share test results with FDA, but FDA does not use these  results to verify industry compliance with the feed ban.", "In August 2003, FDA instructed its districts to begin testing finished feed  and feed ingredients, such as bags of feed sold at retail stores and bulk feed  sold to cattle feedlots. These tests were not taken in conjunction with  feed-ban compliance inspections. FDA inspectors took 660 samples  nationwide. The samples were submitted to FDA regional laboratories for  analysis, where analysts used feed microscopy. Although in its instructions  to districts for the collection effort, FDA called the tests \u201ca method to  monitor for compliance with\u201d the feed ban, FDA officials told us that the  test results could not be the sole basis for enforcement action at individual  firms because microscopic analysis cannot distinguish prohibited bone and  tissue from exempted material. Nonetheless, the officials also told us the  testing gives FDA further assurance of industry\u2019s compliance with feed ban.", "Because FDA did not use an approach that allows it to generalize the  results, the test results cannot be used as assurance of industry  compliance. In fact, because FDA did not provide instructions on how to  randomly select firms for sampling and how to take a random sample of  feed at the firms, the results cannot even help confirm compliance by the  stores, feedlots, and other firms where the samples were taken. In initiating  this effort without a sampling plan, FDA wasted its already limited  inspection resources. FDA has committed resources to collect and analyze  900 additional samples in fiscal year 2005. With the same resources, FDA  could have developed a sample design that would have allowed it to  generalize the test results to industry.", "FDA officials told us the agency would have to conduct an investigation to  determine whether an enforcement action was warranted. FDA provided  us some information on test results for the 660 samples that were taken and  analyzed. The data showed 145 potential violations, including 8 that FDA\u2019s  laboratories originally classified as serious. About one-third of the 145  samples with potential violations were of cattle feed. Several of those  samples had evidence of mammalian matter. Without more information, we  could not determine whether the cattle feed contained exempt items or  prohibited material. As of February 2005, FDA was in the process of  gathering the information we requested from its district offices on the  results of its investigation of the 145 potential violations and what, if any,  enforcement actions were taken based on the tests and follow-up  investigations.

First, feed  with prohibited materials could be intentionally or inadvertently redirected  into feed for U.S. cattle if firms fail to add the cautionary label to the  product that they had initially intended to export. Second, exported feed  containing prohibited material could mistakenly be fed to cattle that are  subsequently imported into the United States or whose meat and other  products are imported into the United States.", "We observed one situation where a problem could occur because a  cautionary statement was not on an exported product. One firm we visited  processed fishmeal, which is normally considered a safe ingredient for  cattle feed. However, this plant processed the fishmeal on the same  equipment it used for prohibited materials. If it were sold domestically, the  fishmeal would have to be labeled with the cautionary statement because it  is potentially contaminated with prohibited materials. However, the  product was shipped to overseas customers without the cautionary  statement. Because the fishmeal was not labeled, and fishmeal would not  be expected to contain prohibited material, customers could unwittingly  mix the fishmeal with other ingredients for their cattle. The FDA inspector  did not document in the inspection report which countries were sent the  fishmeal.

The feed mill  that manufactured and sold the feed had not labeled the salvaged pet  food with the required cautionary statement \u201cDo not feed to cattle or  other ruminants.\u201d Shortly after this discovery, the firm recalled the  misbranded feed. In April 2004, a state feed inspector found out about  the misfed animals from the feed mill, not from FDA, and alerted his  state program managers. The state contacted FDA, and after  determining that FDA did not intend to take action beyond issuing a  warning letter, the state seized and destroyed the animals in May 2004  under state authority to prevent the meat from entering the food supply.  FDA did not alert the state or USDA and did not issue the warning letter  to the feed mill until June 2004.", "A feed mill had inadvertently contaminated cattle feed with prohibited  material. The firm had made a mistake in designing and placing  equipment in the manufacturing process, which allowed spilled feed  containing prohibited material to become commingled with ingredients  used to make cattle feed. We observed this problem during an April 2004  inspection. FDA issued a warning letter in June 2004 demanding that the  firm correct the violations; the firm also conducted a voluntary recall of  the feed in June. Because the mill operated with this flawed system for  about 1 year before the discovery, potentially contaminated feed was  marketed and sold for cattle feed for that period of time. FDA did not  contact USDA or state authorities to alert them that cattle had  consumed the feed.", "A feed mill did not clean mixing equipment and transportation vehicles  used for processing and transporting feed containing prohibited and  nonprohibited materials. The firm also failed to properly label feed  containing prohibited materials with the required cautionary statement  and did not maintain sufficient records for tracking the sale of cattle  feed to its customers, as FDA requires. We identified these problems  during our review of inspection reports. The inspection occurred in  March 2003. The firm corrected the violations and recalled all cattle feed  that had not yet been consumed in March 2003.

However, we found  that the posted recall notices do not include information on whether, or for  how long, cattle or other ruminants had been given the contaminated feed.  Furthermore, FDA officials asserted that no action was needed beyond a  recall in these incidents because BSE has not been discovered in a cow  born in the United States. According to the officials, the meat would not  make people ill and the feed would not make cattle ill. Before this report  was issued, these same FDA officials told us that in the future, FDA will  alert USDA and states when cattle may have consumed prohibited feed.

The procedures must provide for cleaning out the  vehicles or other adequate preventative measures. Research suggests that  cattle can get BSE from ingesting even a small amount of infected  material\u2014an amount that could be introduced in feed that was transported  in a poorly cleaned vehicle. As part of an inspection of transportation firms,  inspectors review the adequacy of these procedures, but the inspection  form does not prompt them to do so during inspections of other types of  firms. The following two problems impede the effectiveness of FDA\u2019s  current procedures:   FDA has not identified and does not inspect many transportation firms.", "According to FDA officials and transportation data, thousands of  independent truckers, large and small trucking companies, and rail  companies may carry cattle feed and feed ingredients. FDA officials told  us that it would be virtually impossible to identify and inspect all of  these firms, given its limited resources. However, FDA agrees that  transportation compliance is important. In commenting on a draft of this  report, the agency noted that it is planning to increase oversight of  transportation firms based on FDA\u2019s assessment of compliance and risk  in this industry sector.", "Inspecting transportation firms at their home base would not ensure  that the required procedures are being used and that the nearly 200,000  large trucks that haul animal feed would be clean at the time they picked  up cattle feed, in part, because vehicles that carry prohibited material  may also carry cattle feed and other loads in succession before  returning to their home base. For example, at an inspection of one  high-risk protein blender, we observed an FDA inspector talking with an  independent trucker who had dropped off a load of cattle feed  ingredients, was picking up prohibited materials at the protein blender,  and was scheduled later to pick up a load of corn, which could be used  in cattle feed. The trucker explained that if he saw anything in the truck  between loads, he would climb in and sweep the material out with a  broom; if he did not see anything, he did not sweep out the truck  between loads. The trucker also said it would be extremely difficult to  find washout facilities to clean the truck between loads while on the  road.", "Consequently, we believe that it would be more effective to require FDA  and state inspectors to review and document procedures that feed mills  and other firms use to ensure that the vehicles they use to haul cattle feed  and feed ingredients are free of prohibited material as part of their  inspections at feed mills and other firms. During our observations of  inspections, we found that some FDA and state inspectors were already  doing so. However, our observations and analysis of inspection reports  showed that the inspectors did not routinely do so and did not uniformly  report on the adequacy of the firms\u2019 procedures for preventing the  introduction of prohibited material. We believe that inspectors were  overlooking the adequacy of firm\u2019s procedures to ensure the safe transport  of cattle feed because the BSE inspection form does not have any questions  to capture that information. Specifically, 82 of the 404 inspection reports  we reviewed were for renderers, protein blenders, feed mills, and other  firms that processed with prohibited material and handled cattle feed and  feed ingredients. We found that inspectors had documented the required  cleanout procedures for transportation equipment at only 11 of these 82  firms.

He testified that compliance by those firms was \u201cestimated to be  better than 99 percent.\u201d Subsequently, some industry officials claimed that  overall compliance with the feed ban is nearly 100 percent and used that  figure to support their claim that the feed ban does not need to be  strengthened. However, as noted earlier, those groups are comprised of  about 570 firms\u2014approximately 4 percent of the firms in FDA\u2019s inventory.", "In addition, FDA periodically publishes compliance information on its Web  site for all industry segments. This information has also been used to cite  high industry compliance. However, FDA and industry do not have a basis  for citing a compliance rate for a segment of firms subject to the feed ban  or industrywide because there are too many unknowns. Specifically, FDA  does not know the status of compliance for firms that  have never been inspected,  have not been reinspected in 5 or more years, and   may have started to process with prohibited materials since their last  inspection.", "Furthermore, as we previously discussed, because FDA does not routinely  sample feed to confirm compliance, inspection results are largely based on  a review of paper documents and a visual inspection. All these concerns  apply to compliance information FDA reports to Congress and the public  on its Web site.", "Additionally, our analysis of inspection reports also disclosed that FDA was  not including all serious violations in its calculation of the compliance rate  because it reclassified firms as \u201cin compliance\u201d once they correct  violations, regardless of how long the problem may have existed.", "Finally, we found that FDA has classified 42 firms as having less serious  violations that it counted as \u201cin compliance\u201d with the feed ban. Inspectors  reported that 18 of these firms failed to include a cautionary statement on  feed containing prohibited materials. Although FDA\u2019s feed-ban inspection  guidance designates the lack of a cautionary statement as a serious  violation, and lack of such a statement should result in the feed being  deemed misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA  excluded the violations at these firms from its calculation of the  compliance rate. Inspectors also reported that the remaining 24 firms had  procedures for preventing commingling but did not have these procedures  in writing. FDA\u2019s guidance designates the lack of written procedures as a  less serious violation, but we believe these violations should be classified  as serious.

The ongoing discussions and agreements to reopen  beef export markets could be derailed if more cattle were discovered with  BSE.", "FDA has taken positive steps since our 2002 report. Today FDA can say  with greater confidence that it has more timely and reliable inspection  data. Also, the risk-based system FDA has adopted to target inspection  resources on high-risk firms will increase the likelihood that firms  inspected annually will remain in compliance with the feed ban.", "FDA\u2019s processes, however, still have considerable room for improvement.  FDA does not have uniform procedures for identifying additional firms that  are subject to the ban but have never been inspected or for learning about  firms that change their practices and begin to handle prohibited material.  Furthermore, because inspectors are not using tests optimally\u2014to help  confirm, when appropriate, that cattle feed, production equipment, and  transportation vehicles are free of prohibited material\u2014FDA is limiting its  ability to assure that firms are in compliance with the feed ban and that  cattle feed is safe. Additionally, FDA is not taking advantage of state test  results to provide greater assurance that industry is adhering to the feed  ban and is not using its own program for sampling finished feed and feed  ingredients in a manner that will allow it to project test results.", "Moreover, the lack of a requirement for warning labels on feed and feed  ingredients intended for export that contain prohibited material, creates  opportunities for having the material fed to domestic or foreign cattle,  either intentionally or inadvertently. As the international group of BSE  experts convened by USDA pointed out, the United States has an obligation  to act responsibly toward its global neighbors when exporting feed and  feed ingredients.", "Especially troubling was our discovery that FDA did not alert USDA and  state authorities when it became aware that cattle had been given feed that  contained prohibited material. FDA, and its key partner, USDA, together  provide critical firewalls that the federal government has in place to protect  U.S. cattle and consumers. In addition, the lack of notification was contrary  to FDA\u2019s own guidance and FDA\u2019s inaction prevented USDA and states from  being able to make an informed decision on how to respond to the  discovery that cattle had consumed prohibited material.", "Given these weaknesses and the fact that FDA does not include all  violations in its estimates, we believe FDA is overstating industry\u2019s  compliance with the animal feed ban and understating the potential risk of  BSE for U.S. cattle in its reports to Congress and the American people.

FDA  stated that our report was thorough and that it recognized the  enhancements FDA has put in place in its feed-ban program. However, FDA  said the report did not identify material weaknesses to support our position  that oversight weaknesses limit FDA\u2019s program effectiveness and place U.S.  cattle at risk of spreading BSE. FDA believes that its current risk-based  inspection approach is adequate to protect U.S. cattle. According to FDA,  given the wide variety of firms subject to the feed ban and its resource  limitations, it \u201cis obligated to set priorities for inspecting a meaningful  subpopulation of these regulated firms.\u201d We recognize that FDA has made  many improvements, including adopting a risk-based approach for  inspections, that have substantially improved its oversight of the feed-ban  rule. However, our report identifies significant problems in FDA\u2019s oversight  that continue to place cattle at risk for BSE. The importance of a strictly  enforced feed ban is heightened now that BSE has been found in North  American cattle. As Harvard and the international panel of experts pointed  out, the feed ban is the most important fire wall against the spread of BSE.  Given the problems we identified and the significance of a well enforced  feed ban, it is important that FDA improves its feed ban oversight and  optimizes its use of resources.", "In addition, FDA does not agree with our criticism of its compliance  reporting. FDA believes that it provides the inspection results in a  transparent, complete, and accurate context. FDA notes that the BSE  inspection data posted on its Web site \u201callows the user to analyze the data,  in a multitude of ways, to provide their own contextual reference.\u201d Our  concern is precisely that the data are being analyzed and interpreted in an  erroneous context. Specifically, when FDA and industry used those data to  assert a 99 percent compliance rate with the feed ban, they took that  information out of context. While FDA\u2019s calculation of compliance by a  subset of regulated industries may in fact be quite high, FDA\u2019s data are not  sufficient to make that projection to all regulated industries. In addition,  FDA does not know the status of compliance for firms that have never been  inspected or have not been reinspected in years. Nor does it know if  previously inspected firms have started using prohibited material.  Furthermore, because FDA reclassifies firms from \u201cout-of-compliance\u201d to  \u201cin-compliance\u201d on its Web site when the firms correct violations, the  information posted on that Web site does not tell the user when serious  and/or long-standing violations have occurred. Lastly, inspection results are  largely based on a review of paper documents and a visual inspection, with  little or no feed testing. Given these data concerns and compliance  unknowns, FDA\u2019s data should not be used to project industry compliance;  and, anytime those data are cited, they should be reported in a complete  and accurate context.", "Regarding the nine recommendations we make in the report, FDA did not  take issue with the need for five and generally disagreed with four.  Although FDA noted implementation concerns, it did not take issue on the  need for (1) developing uniform procedures for identifying firms subject to  the feed ban, (2) collecting test results from the states that sample feed, (3)  including a cautionary statement on feed and feed ingredients intended for  export, (4) notifying USDA and states when feed or feed ingredients  containing prohibited material may have been fed to cattle, and (5)  modifying the inspection form to include questions to better oversee the  cleanliness of vehicles used to transport cattle feed or feed ingredients.", "FDA disagreed with our recommendation that it require firms that process  with prohibited material to notify the agency. FDA believes that it is already  getting information on changes to firms\u2019 practices from states and that  requiring an additional notification process would be costly to implement.  However, FDA acknowledged that it has generally not identified high-risk  feed salvagers and farms that mix their own feed or those that feed cattle as  well as other animals. The cost of the notification program will depend on  the requirements FDA puts in place. In developing the program, FDA could  target the notification to firms that pose a potentially high risk for exposing  cattle feed to prohibited material. We believe that FDA should know which  firms are high risk and that industry self-reporting is a mechanism that  would help the agency identify those firms and help it ensure compliance  with the feed ban.", "FDA also disagreed with our recommendation to systematically use tests in  conjunction with compliance inspections. While we recognize the  limitations of current test methodologies, we believe that tests are useful.  In fact, states and FDA are currently using these tests on feed. Our  recommendation speaks to systematically using these tests where  appropriate, to augment inspections, which are largely observation and  paperwork reviews. We expanded the recommendation to recognize that  FDA may validate other tests in the future.", "With respect to our recommendation that FDA develop a sample design for  testing finished feed and feed ingredients, FDA disagreed with the need for  a sample design that will allow it to more accurately generalize about  compliance. FDA stated that tests alone cannot serve as a basis to  generalize compliance. We agree that tests that indicate potential violations  need to be confirmed, because of the limitations of the current tests.  However, FDA is using the test results to identify potential problems, and it  tested 660 samples in 2003/2004 and plans to test 900 samples this year. The  point of our recommendation is that any testing activity of this magnitude  should have a sampling plan.", "Finally, FDA believes that it already reports inspection results in a  complete and accurate context, as we recommend. We disagree. As noted  above, given the data concerns and compliance unknowns raised in this  report, FDA\u2019s data should not be used to project industry compliance.

In addition, we randomly  selected 12 other firms that process with prohibited materials; 68 firms that  distribute prohibited materials; and 19 firms that do not process or  distribute prohibited materials.

The sites were  selected to cover a range of firm types and sizes in various geographic  locations with concentrations of cattle feeding operations, including dairy  cattle. The 19 inspections included renderers, protein blenders, feed mills,  farms with ruminants and other animals, and pet food manufacturers.

We  reviewed various FDA program documents, including the BSE/Ruminant  Feed Ban Inspections Compliance Program Guidance; BSE feed inspection  form; advance notices of proposed rulemakings to strengthen the feed ban,  including public comments; and the reports on the feed samples collected  and tested. We also interviewed state agency officials and reviewed  documents from the California Department of Food and Agriculture; the  Departments of Agriculture of Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, North  Carolina, and Pennsylvania; and the Texas Feed and Fertilizer Control  Service.

The feed ban requires that firms, with some  exceptions, take the following actions:  label feed and feed ingredients that contain most proteins from  mammals (prohibited material) with a cautionary statement \u201cDo not  feed to cattle or other ruminants,\u201d  have procedures to protect against commingling or cross-contamination  if they handle both prohibited and nonprohibited feed and feed  ingredients by using either equipment dedicated exclusively to feed or  ingredients intended for cattle or using cleanout procedures or other  adequate means to prevent carryover, and  maintain records so that feed and feed ingredients that contain or may  contain prohibited material can be tracked from receipt through  disposition.", "According to FDA\u2019s rules, firms that transport both types of materials must  also follow these procedures. Additionally, prohibited materials may be  used in pet food and in feed for poultry, swine, horses, and other  nonruminant animals. Lastly, FDA designated a number of cattle- and other  animal-derived items as exempt from the ban\u2014and hence, allowable in  cattle feed. These items include blood and blood products, plate waste,  gelatin, milk and milk protein, and any product whose only mammalian  protein consists entirely of protein from pigs and horses.

The model concluded that the risk to U.S. cattle and to consumers  from BSE is very low, but certain new control measures could reduce that  small risk even further. Therefore, based on comments received at the  public hearing and the findings of the Harvard Study, FDA asked for public  comment on various ways that the BSE feed ban could be strengthened,  including the following questions:  Should tissues that are known to be at higher risk for harboring the  infective agent for BSE, such as brain and spinal cord from ruminants 2  years of age or older be excluded from all rendered products?", "How extensive is the use of poultry litter in cattle feed, what is the level  of feed spillage in poultry litter, and what would be the impacts resulting  from banning poultry litter in ruminant feed?", "Should pet food for retail sale carry the cautionary statement \u201cDo not  feed to cattle or other ruminants?\u201d", "Are there practical ways, other than dedicated facilities, for firms to  demonstrate that the level of carryover of prohibited material in a feed  mill could not transmit BSE to cattle or other ruminants?

In addition to some of the measures FDA had planned to  take in an interim final rule, the international panel recommended broader  measures, such as banning all mammalian and poultry protein from  ruminant feed.

We believe the report identifies numerous oversight weaknesses that  continue to limit program effectiveness and place cattle at risk. The  purpose of the feed ban firewall is to prevent the exposure and spread  of BSE. A well enforced feed ban is even more critical now that BSE  has been discovered in cattle in North America. As shown in our report,  FDA does not know the compliance status or risks posed by firms it has  not identified, inspected or reinspected for many years. FDA  acknowledged that many more firms are subject to the feed ban than  have been inspected to date but said the agency must set priorities for  the number and types of firms it can identify and inspect with limited  inspection resources. We agree with FDA\u2019s use of a risk-based  inspection approach; however, FDA acknowledges the need to increase  inspections of certain industry segments, such as transporters and  animal feed salvagers. Moreover, for firms that FDA inspects, it does  not routinely sample feed to verify whether the operating procedures  observed by its inspectors are actually preventing prohibited materials  from contaminating cattle feed. Our recommendations are aimed at  ensuring that FDA has a strategy for maximizing the effectiveness of its  limited inspection resources, targeting inspections, and using feed tests  to minimize the risk of cattle being fed prohibited material.  2. Our concern is precisely that the data are being analyzed and  interpreted in an erroneous context. Specifically, when FDA and  industry used those data to assert a 99 percent compliance rate with the  feed ban, they took that information out of context. While industry  compliance may in fact be quite high for firms FDA has inspected  recently, FDA\u2019s data are not sufficient to project compliance  industrywide. FDA does not know the status of compliance for firms  that have never been inspected or have not been reinspected in years.  In addition, compliance history is lost\u2014firms that had serious and long- standing violations are classified as \u201cin-compliance\u201d once FDA  determines that the problems are corrected. FDA is not reporting that  the firms were ever out of compliance or the length of time that the  feed ban was violated. Lastly, inspection results are largely based on a  review of paper documents and a visual inspection, with little or no  feed testing. Given these data concerns and compliance unknowns, we  believe that FDA\u2019s data should not be used to project industry  compliance and, anytime those data are cited, they should be reported  in a complete and accurate context. 3. FDA agrees that there are industry sectors (such as transporter and  animal feed salvagers) that need to be assessed to determine their  potential risk to U.S. cattle. In fact, FDA acknowledges that there are  millions of firms potentially subject to the feed-ban rule. At the same  time, FDA implies that it has identified all high-risk firms. FDA has no  basis for that assertion. The example we suggest in this report is one  way of identifying additional firms that we observed during our review.  FDA identified other approaches that its districts used to identify other  firms. We believe that any approaches FDA identifies as useful should  be applied uniformly across all FDA districts. We included information  in the report on how FDA plans to use the $8.3 million it received in the  2005 budget. We also revised the report to include FDA\u2019s estimate of the  number of firms that feed cattle and other ruminants and revised the  recommendation in recognition that it may be impossible for FDA to  identify all firms subject to the feed-ban rule.  4. FDA suggests that requiring notification would take significant  resources. The cost of the notification program will depend on the  requirements FDA puts in place. In developing the program, FDA could  target the notification to firms that pose potentially high-risk for  exposing cattle feed to prohibited material. According to FDA, of the  14,800 firms it has inspected, about 570 renderers, protein blenders,  and feed mills comprise the high-risk firms subject to notification  because they manufacture or process prohibited material. While we  believe there may be more firms that fall into this group, it should not  be a significantly larger number. If it is significantly larger, that is  something FDA needs to know. Furthermore, requiring industry to self- report is another mechanism that would help FDA identify firms and  oversee compliance. Finally, FDA has registration requirements in  place for medicated feed firms and for food facilities, and could draw  on its experience with those programs for developing a notification  program for firms subject to the feed-ban rule. Because firms can  change their practices over time, we believe it is important that firms  notify FDA whenever such changes occur.  5. While we agree that the current test methods have certain limitations,  we believe that testing can be a valuable tool for helping FDA oversee  compliance with the feed ban. FDA maintains that, because the current  test methods cannot differentiate prohibited material from exempt  material, they cannot be used to verify the presence or absence of  prohibited material or to confirm the adequacy of cleanout measures.  However, states told us that they are using tests for these purposes.  Moreover, FDA is currently testing finished feed and using the test  results, together with follow-up inspections, to determine whether the  feed ban had been violated. We believe tests would help inspectors who  now rely on only paperwork review and visual examination to  determine the adequacy of cleanout procedures. Tests would also be  useful for vegetable-based cattle feed, where detecting the presence of  animal protein would indicate a violation. We revised the  recommendation to recognize that FDA may elect to use other test  methods in addition to feed microscopy and polymerase chain reaction  (PCR). With respect to FDA\u2019s sampling of finished feed, the 660 samples  FDA tested were not collected during feed-ban compliance inspections.  We plan to report later this year on FDA\u2019s sampling of finished feed. 6. We agree that FDA\u2019s current test methodology will not allow it to use  test results alone to verify feed-ban violations. However, testing  combined with follow-up inspections would allow FDA to be in a better  position to generalize about compliance with the feed-ban rule if FDA  developed a random sample methodology for inspectors to use for  sampling finished feed and feed ingredients. (Also see comment 5.)  7. After clarifying FDA\u2019s comment with an attorney in FDA\u2019s Office of the  Chief Counsel, we revised the report and the recommendation to delete  references that FDA should encourage firms to include a cautionary  statement on feed exports that may contain prohibited material. We  believe that it would be more prudent for FDA to focus its efforts on  obtaining statutory authority to require that the cautionary statement  be used on such exports.  8. We revised the recommendation to clarify that FDA should be alerting  USDA and the affected states whenever inspectors discover that cattle  may have consumed feed with prohibited material.  9. Based on the inspections we observed and the 404 inspection reports  that we reviewed in detail, we believe that inspector activities during  feed-ban compliance inspections are driven by the checklist  items/questions on the BSE inspection form. Therefore, we believe the  checklist should include specific questions to prompt inspectors to  examine vehicles and firms\u2019 cleanout procedures on every inspection.  10. As noted in the report, FDA believes that it provides the inspection  results in a transparent, compete, and accurate context. FDA notes that  the BSE inspection data posted on its Web site \u201callows the user to  analyze the data, in a multitude of ways, to provide their own  contextual reference.\u201d Our concern is precisely that the data are being  analyzed and interpreted in an erroneous context. Specifically, when  FDA and industry used those data to assert a 99 percent compliance  rate with the feed ban, they took that information out of context. While  FDA\u2019s calculation of compliance by a subset of regulated industries may  in fact be quite high, FDA\u2019s data are not sufficient to make that  projection for all regulated industries because of the many problems  we cite in the report. Specifically, FDA does not know the status of  compliance for firms that have never been inspected or those that have  not been reinspected in years. FDA also does not know if a firm that it  previously inspected and classified as low-risk has started using  prohibited material; and FDA reclassifies a firm in the database from  \u201cout-of-compliance\u201d to \u201cin-compliance\u201d when it corrects a violation\u2014 even when the violation was serious and long-standing. Lastly,  inspection results are largely based on a review of paper documents  and a visual inspection, with little or no feed testing. Given these data  concerns and compliance unknowns, FDA\u2019s data should not be used to  project industry compliance and, anytime those data are cited, they  should be reported in a complete and accurate context."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Vincent Balloon, Jim Dishmon,  Natalie Herzog, Lynn Musser and John C.
