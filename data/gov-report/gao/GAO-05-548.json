Thus far, the department has established program accountability and authority by assigning senior leadership management and oversight roles and responsibilities. DOD has also established three training transformation initiatives designed to prepare individuals, units, and staffs for joint operations and to provide enabling tools and processes to carry out missions. The initiatives are being developed incrementally, wherein each initiative matures through the \"build a little, test a little\" philosophy. DOD plans to complete its first program assessment later this year. One significant challenge that has emerged early and will require continued focus is establishing effective partnerships with program stakeholders via comprehensive communication and coordination to gain their full participation and buy-in to achieve training transformation goals. DOD has taken positive steps to communicate and coordinate with these stakeholders, which include DOD's combatant commanders, services, and training commands, as well as representatives from the Federal departments, agencies, and organizations that comprise the national security interagency community. However, GAO found an inconsistent understanding among some DOD stakeholders of the strategic vision and rationale behind the implementation and development pace of the initiatives. DOD has not assessed its communication and coordination efforts to determine why some stakeholders may not fully understand the overall vision. Similarly, DOD officials have been proactive in engaging external stakeholders in identifying potential joint training opportunities. However, DOD's outreach to the senior-level leadership of external organizations has been limited to date, thus risking their full commitment to future planning and implementation of joint training. Another\uf020significant challenge that has emerged early and will require continued focus is developing joint training requirements--and the specific training tasks that support the requirements--that meet combatant command mission needs. Rather than identifying joint training tasks through DOD's established process called the \"Joint Training System\" that is used to translate combatant command needs into training requirements, the department is developing some joint tasks through a working group process that does not ensure widespread participation by the combatant commands' and services' representatives. As a result, the department risks developing joint training requirements that combatant commands and services may not fully support. Both these challenges, if left unaddressed, have the potential for eroding support among program stakeholders, which in turn places the goals of the Training Transformation Program at risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As recently demonstrated in Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. forces are  conducting significantly more complex operations, requiring increased  interoperability between and among the military services, combatant  commands, and other Department of Defense (DOD) and non-DOD  organizations.

While this has allowed the services to meet their core training  responsibilities, it has also contributed to forces entering combat without  having had previous experience or training in joint operations.  For  example, in Operation Iraqi Freedom, many forces had to be given some  level of basic joint operations training after they had already entered the  Iraqi theater of war, because they were experiencing joint operations for  the first time.  In a changing security environment, joint operations are  becoming more important given the complex nature of military operations.  Specifically, this importance is being driven by the combatant commands\u2019  need to combine the capabilities of multiple services to address the global  threat as well as the growing interdependence of capabilities among the  services.", "Under Title 10, both combatant commanders and the military services are  given the authority to determine training requirements, plan training  exercises, and execute training activities.  Specifically, combatant  commanders oversee all aspects of military operations, joint training, and  logistics using the forces assigned to them, while the military service  secretaries are generally responsible for recruiting, organizing, supplying,  equipping, and training their service personnel.

Defense guidance issued shortly thereafter  directed the Under Secretary of Defense, Personnel and Readiness, to  work with the services, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the  combatant commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command to develop a  plan for transforming military training that would better enable joint force  operations. The department\u2019s vision for the Training Transformation  Program is to provide \u201cdynamic, capabilities-based training for DOD in  support of national security requirements across the full spectrum of  service, joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational  operations,\u201d and is built upon a foundation of three capabilities.", "According to the 2004 Training Transformation Implementation Plan,  these three capabilities, or initiatives, are designed to prepare individuals,  units, and staffs for the new strategic environment, and to provide  enabling tools and processes to carry out missions.

Under this development approach, some elements of  the three training transformation initiatives\u2014the JNTC, the JKDDC, and  the JAEC\u2014are developed concurrently, while other elements are  sequentially developed.  The department\u2019s expectation is that the three  initiatives will work together to successively build a training environment  that meets combatant command needs in three phases.  Phase 1 (2005)  focuses on providing combatant commanders with a steady flow of joint\u00ad trained individuals, units, and staff.  Phase 2 (2007) places an emphasis on  supporting an innovative training environment for new joint operational  capabilities based on combatant commanders\u2019 demands.  Phase 3 (2009)  will transition joint training into a real-time mission planning and rehearsal  environment.", "Reflective of the iterative implementation approach described above,  DOD\u2019s framework for assessing Training Transformation Program  performance will likewise follow the three phases of the program\u2019s  development.

Similarly, formal program  assessments using these metrics to measure training transformation\u2019s  impact on joint force readiness and guide subsequent investments in  training transformation capabilities will begin in 2005, at the end of Phase  1, and occur every 2 years thereafter.", "The management of each of the three training transformation initiatives is  carried out largely by joint management offices within each initiative\u2019s  sponsoring organization.  For example, the JNTC joint management office  is in the Joint Training Directorate of the Joint Forces Command.  These  offices serve as the primary focal points for planning, program  preparation, and execution of all resources and events associated with  their respective training transformation capability.  The joint management  office directors, having the responsibility to implement their respective  initiative, report directly to the organization sponsoring their initiative.

Officials acknowledge that  their use of a rapid, incremental approach to developing and implementing  the program adds a degree of complexity over traditional approaches.  Moreover, DOD\u2019s decentralized management of the three program  initiatives and dependencies on integration of separately led combatant  command and service training initiatives introduce additional complexity.  Further, encouraging stakeholders to make the cultural changes inherent  to the successful implementation of governmental and defense  transformational programs, such as the Training Transformation Program,  generally also requires focused management attention to communication  and coordination.  The Training Transformation Program\u2019s call for  communication and coordination beyond DOD entities may pose an  additional challenge, because of DOD\u2019s lack of direct authority over non- DOD partner organizations.", "The complexity of the Training Transformation Program heightens the  communication and coordination challenge.  The department\u2019s choice to  employ a rapid, incremental development approach provides management  with a process to review, assess, adjust, and redirect actions that  collectively transform training, and, according to DOD officials, is a  contributing factor to the complexity of the program.  Some DOD officials  we spoke with referred to the development approach as a \u201cstate of  constant change.\u201d  Furthermore, in an effort to meet the Training  Transformation Program\u2019s goals, DOD has assigned separate  organizations\u2014the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Readiness, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Joint Forces Command\u2014to  oversee development of each initiative.  In addition, the ability to leverage  evolving and developing technologies to deliver an integrated live, virtual,  and constructive joint training environment requires the successful  integration of separately led combatant command and service training  initiatives.  For example, the Pacific Command and its Navy component,  according to command officials, are developing their own discrete training  capabilities that are expected to eventually link to and enhance the JNTC.  Achieving JNTC goals relies upon existing training events, led and funded  by combatant commands and services.  The successful linkage of these  efforts will depend on continued comprehensive communication and  coordination.", "We have previously reported that transformational programs across  government require particular attention to managing cultural change.Within the Training Transformation Program, we believe there are two  areas where communication and coordination will play an important role  towards achieving cultural adaptation.  First, the training developed under  the program is expected to respond to combatant commanders\u2019  capabilities-based requirements, moving away from mission-based  requirements that are based on specific threats.  A capabilities-based  approach focuses on identifying the capabilities that U.S. forces will need  to deter and defeat any potential adversaries, being able to respond  decisively anywhere and anytime to any type of challenge.  Second,  training developed under the program will be \u201cjoint\u201d in nature and will  reflect the growing need for different services and commands to work  together to achieve common goals.  DOD acknowledges, in its Training  Transformation Implementation Plan, that it has to balance the priority  to provide the services with more joint training at the individual and  service levels against the services\u2019 priorities to train to their service\u00ad specific core competencies.

For example, representatives from three of  the command staffs we visited viewed the JNTC as Joint Forces  Command\u2019s attempt to impose additional requirements on existing service  and combatant command exercises rather than providing enabling  capabilities to enhance existing training exercises.  Also, general  consensus among all stakeholders attending the Joint Integrated Process  Team meeting in December of 2004 was that they did not fully understand  the Training Transformation Program\u2019s accreditation and certification  processes\u2014which are designed to ensure the joint content of military  training programs and the adequacy of supporting facilities\u2014because of  the complexity of the processes as well as the lack of clear definitions  during its initial implementation.

It appears that these stakeholders did not have a full understanding of the  larger strategic vision of the initiative to leverage evolving technologies  that will provide or distribute education and training needed anytime and  anywhere, across the full spectrum of forces. Also, some stakeholders  from two service headquarters and a command staff expressed a lack of  understanding of the program managers\u2019 decision to iteratively develop  the JAEC, as they develop metrics and perform assessments of the JNTC  and JKDDC.  In particular, some of the stakeholders associated with the  JNTC and JKDDC initiatives expressed discomfort about being measured  against specified outcomes when they were not initially provided with  standards to measure results.

Combatant commands\u2019 representatives said that they have  provided little input into the original development of the tasks identified  by the Joint Forces Command\u2019s working group to date.
