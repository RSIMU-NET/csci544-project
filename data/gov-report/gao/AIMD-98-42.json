While federal agencies historically have not been required to periodically report on deferred maintenance, agencies have provided maintenance estimates for budgetary and ad hoc reporting purposes. The validity of these past estimates has been questioned. We previously reported to you on reporting requirements and maintenance issues identified by GAO and agency inspectors general (IGs).", "Recent laws have imposed requirements to provide policymakers and agency program managers with more reliable financial information to formulate budgets, manage government programs and help make difficult policy choices. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and its subsequent expansion through the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 established a solid framework for improving financial management and accountability for federal resources and will result in the preparation and audit of financial statements for the government\u2019s 24 major departments and agencies, which are responsible for over 99 percent of the government\u2019s outlays. These laws also have made the implementation of new federal accounting standards a priority.", "The Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E), recently recommended by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) and approved by GAO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Treasury, specifically addresses the need for better information on maintenance by requiring the disclosure of deferred maintenance in agency financial statements beginning for fiscal years after September 30, 1997. FASAB addressed the issue of deferred maintenance in part because of concerns raised by many groups about the deteriorating condition of government-owned PP&E. Further, the Board believes that deferred maintenance represents a cost and that adequate information on these costs is important to users of financial statements.", "However, while providing useful new information for decision-making, the standard raises some implementation and definitional challenges\u2014such as determining the acceptable condition of assets and the estimation methods to be used. Your office expressed your continued interest in ensuring the effective and timely implementation of the deferred maintenance requirements of SFFAS No. 6 and requested us to explore the implementation plans and capabilities of federal agencies with respect to the new requirements. Specifically, this report responds to your request that we (1) look at the plans and progress of 11 agencies toward implementing the new deferred maintenance requirements of SFFAS No. 6 and (2) obtain the official position of agency CFOs and IGs with respect to its implementation.", "To achieve these objectives, we asked agency CFOs and their staffs a series of questions about estimating maintenance needs and implementing the deferred maintenance requirements of SFFAS No. 6.

SFFAS No. 6 requires that a line item for \u201cdeferred maintenance amounts\u201d be presented on the statement of net cost. The statement of net cost is one of several financial statements. It is designed to report the gross and net costs of providing goods, services and benefits. Although no dollar amounts for deferred maintenance are to be reported on the statement of net cost itself and thus are not included in the net costs of activities, the explanatory notes to the financial statements must include dollar estimates of deferred maintenance. When agencies begin to disclose deferred maintenance in their fiscal year 1998 financial statements in compliance with the standard, the annual audits of agency financial statements will help ensure that whatever is reported is subject to independent scrutiny. As the objective of the financial statement audit is to obtain reasonable assurance about the financial statements as a whole, individually reported deferred maintenance amounts will receive varying levels of audit coverage depending on their materiality to the financial statements. Because of the nature of these estimates, the auditor\u2019s assessment will depend in part, on management\u2019s judgement of the asset condition, maintenance needs, and the methodology chosen to estimate deferred maintenance.", "Deferred maintenance is defined in SFFAS No. 6 as \u201cmaintenance that was not performed when it should have been or was scheduled to be and which, therefore, is put off or delayed for a future period.\u201d Maintenance\u2014described as the act of keeping fixed assets in acceptable condition\u2014includes preventive maintenance and normal repairs, including the replacement of parts and structural components and other activities needed to preserve the asset so that it continues to provide acceptable service and achieve its expected life. Modifications or upgrades that are intended to expand the capacity of an asset are specifically excluded from the definition.", "SFFAS No. 6 recognizes that determining maintenance needs is a management function and accordingly allows management flexibility and judgment within broadly defined requirements. For example, the standard acknowledges that determining the asset condition\u2014condition rating\u2014is a management function because what constitutes acceptable condition may differ both across entities and for different items of PP&E held by the same entity. Under the standard, it is management\u2019s responsibility to (1) determine the level of service and condition of the asset that are acceptable, (2) disclose deferred maintenance by major classes of assets, and (3) establish methods to estimate and report any material amounts of deferred maintenance. In addition, the standard has an optional disclosure for stratification between critical and noncritical amounts of maintenance. Management must decide whether to distinguish between critical and noncritical deferred maintenance amounts and, if it chooses to do so, what constitutes critical.", "Of the 11 agencies included in our review, nine agencies are required specifically to implement the standard for fiscal year 1998.

USDA noted that its deferred maintenance estimate included activities to expand and upgrade PP&E items\u2014which are not considered deferred maintenance under SFFAS No. 6. State\u2019s estimate of deferred maintenance is based upon an inventory of known facility maintenance requirements. However the CFO for State cautioned that not all of these known requirements may be deferred maintenance as defined by SFFAS No. 6. DOT noted that its estimates of deferred maintenance included the Maritime Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, but did not include the Coast Guard. Similarly, DOD cited Air Force estimates for deferred maintenance for depot and real property but had no agencywide estimate.

Similarly, a 1993 Department of State IG report found that while the department had progressed in identifying its maintenance and repair deficiencies, information on the maintenance backlog had not been summarized, quantified or monitored.", "Further, the size and scope of DOD PP&E creates special problems in its reporting of deferred maintenance, many of which have been previously reported by GAO. As noted in our May 1997 report, DOD\u2019s changes in its definition of backlogs have led to large decreases in its \u201cunfunded requirements\u201d for maintenance. We also noted that the military services have expressed concern about the adequacy of funding to maintain and repair all of their facilities and have reported growing maintenance and repair backlogs. However, the services also have many excess buildings which could be demolished to avoid millions of dollars of recurring maintenance costs. Also, we recently reported that, while military service installation officials cited increases in backlogs of deferred maintenance and repair projects in recent years, reliable composite information was not available due to differences in how services develop and maintain these data. Further, recent efforts by the Office of the Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive system for performing facilities condition assessment have not been successful and systems maintained by the individual services vary in terms of their capabilities to identify funding requirements.", "Most recently, we reported on DOD\u2019s plans to implement the deferred maintenance requirements for national defense assets, noting that DOD needs to expedite plans to implement this new disclosure. In particular, we recommended that DOD (1) ensure that DOD-wide policy is in place as soon as possible so that DOD can comply with the effective date of the deferred maintenance requirements, (2) establish milestones for key actions in the policy development process to ensure issuance of the policy no later than March 1998, and (3) modify the ongoing study of existing DOD methods for determining deferred maintenance to complete the study by the end of March."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Agency Implementation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although some initial steps have been taken, significant work remains to be done for all agencies to effectively implement the deferred maintenance requirements for fiscal year 1998 reporting.

Thus, for many agencies, an appropriate step toward implementing the deferred maintenance requirements of SFFAS No. 6 is to improve their overall ability to identify and account for PP&E.", "DOD has received disclaimers of opinion on its fiscal year 1996 financial statements due in part to its inability to adequately account for its PP&E.

In an effort to improve the accuracy of PP&E reporting, the Forest Service in USDA is undertaking a complete physical inventory of PP&E. At the same time, the Forest Service Acting CFO stated that the agency plans to estimate deferred maintenance needs. The USDA IG concurs that a critical step to implementing the deferred maintenance requirements of SFFAS No. 6 for USDA is to develop complete inventories of its PP&E; without this inventory, the IG states that little reliance could be placed on estimates reported for deferred maintenance. Similarly, the DOT IG stated that DOT is focusing its efforts on correcting weaknesses identified in prior financial statement audits, particularly in the area of PP&E. Because deferred maintenance is linked to PP&E, the IG acknowledged that DOT needs to identify and validate PP&E before estimating amounts of deferred maintenance.", "At DOI, reporting issues are limited to the Bureau of Indian Affairs which in fiscal year 1996 could not provide adequate documentation or reliable accounting information to support $170 million in PP&E. DOI intends to include deferred maintenance disclosures in its fiscal year 1997 Consolidated Annual Report even though they are not required until fiscal year 1998.

While providing useful new information for decision-making, the deferred maintenance requirements raise a number of new implementation and definitional issues\u2014such as determining the acceptable condition of assets and the estimation methods to be used. The necessary flexibility in the standard increases the need for some departmental policies and guidance that are designed to be compatible with agency mission and organizational structure. Such departmental guidance could help ensure consistent reporting across agency units and facilitate the preparation of agencywide financial statements. However, the development of departmental guidance is complicated by the number and diversity of missions and assets even within a single agency. In determining the extent of additional departmental guidance to provide units, agencies must balance the desirability of consistent reporting with the need for flexibility.", "In addition, adequate data collection and tracking systems will be necessary to gather and verify information on deferred maintenance costs. However, as we have previously reported and as was acknowledged in June 1997 by both OMB and the Chief Financial Officers Council, the condition of agency financial systems remains a serious concern. Our past audit experience has indicated that numerous agencies\u2019 financial management systems do not maintain or generate original data to readily prepare financial statements.

The Deputy CFO for DOT indicated that a formal system for tracking deferred maintenance is not required by SFFAS No. 6. While technically correct, it is anticipated that deferred maintenance disclosures and estimates will be adequately documented by agencies. Accurate tracking of PP&E and deferred maintenance can be a valuable management tool for assessing program status and supporting resource allocation decisions on an ongoing basis. The Deputy CFO for DOT also did not believe that it was necessary to fully validate PP&E prior to estimating deferred maintenance. While we believe that the lack of an accurate accounting of PP&E will certainly impede any efforts to implement the deferred maintenance requirements, we agree that implementation of SFFAS No. 6 can\u2014and should\u2014proceed, even as agencies are continuing to validate their PP&E reporting.", "The Under Secretary of Defense, while stating that DOD is striving to comply with the reporting requirements, questioned if the benefits to be derived from reporting deferred maintenance will be proportionate to the effort required to obtain and report this information. He noted that deferred maintenance reporting represents a \u201csnap-shot\u201d at a specific time and stressed that, given the diversity of DOD\u2019s PP&E systems, implementation of the requirements represents a significant challenge that will be costly in terms of both funding and personnel. He expressed concern that the report does not assess the impact on agencies of implementing and complying with the standard.", "Federal financial accounting standards, including the deferred maintenance requirements, are developed by FASAB using a due process and consensus building approach that considers the financial and budgetary information needs of the Congress, executive agencies, and other users of federal financial information as well as comments from the public. DOD is a participant in these proceedings and has a member on FASAB. In its deliberations on deferred maintenance reporting, FASAB considered both the need to improve information on the condition of federal assets and the complexities of measuring and reporting this information. FASAB determined that deferred maintenance was a cost and that information on this cost was important to users. However, in recognition of measurement challenges and the limitations in the capacity of agency systems, FASAB developed the standard to provide entities flexibility in setting maintenance requirements and in establishing cost beneficial methods to estimate deferred maintenance amounts. The standard allows management flexibility to define deferred maintenance at a level meaningful for the agency. For example, acceptable asset condition is a management determination\u2014the level of detailed information obtained is dependent on management\u2019s determination of decisionmakers\u2019 needs.", "As discussed in the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No. 1 Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting, federal financial reporting is intended to address four broad objectives \u2014budgetary integrity, operating performance, stewardship, and systems and controls. Disclosure of deferred maintenance amounts is consistent with these objectives. The systematic financial reporting of deferred maintenance can improve information on operating performance and stewardship and thus assist in determining how well government assets are maintained. In contrast, the usefulness of DOD\u2019s current reporting of deferred maintenance through the budget process is more limited because estimates are developed on an ad-hoc basis and reporting is inconsistent among the military services and weapons systems. In addition, much of the data used are based on anticipated budgetary resources and not subjected to independent audit.", "The disclosure of deferred maintenance is an important management issue. Management should have this information throughout the year to assess the status of management programs and to support resource allocations on an ongoing basis. In the case of DOD, deferred maintenance applicable to mission assets, if reliably quantified and reported, can be an important indicator of mission asset condition (a key readiness factor) as well as an indicator of the proper functioning of maintenance and supply lines. Disclosure of deferred maintenance can also aid in supporting budget and performance measurement information. Because all financial reporting, including deferred maintenance, represents a \u201csnap-shot\u201d at a specific period in time\u2014the value of financial reporting lies in the data collection and reporting systems developed to create and support the financial statements. Thus, the data systems that support financial statements can provide the capability for monitoring and managing day-to-day operations.", "We recognize that the deferred maintenance requirement presents DOD with a challenge in determining and disclosing reliable estimates of deferred maintenance\u2014especially in addressing the broad range of financial management systems problems facing DOD. DOD\u2019s longstanding system problems are repeatedly cited as reasons for inadequate financial information. Development of reliable systems should enhance DOD\u2019s ability to meet financial reporting requirements, including the deferred maintenance disclosure requirement.", "The flexibility provided in the standard and the diversity of agency missions and assets increases the importance of department-level guidance to ensure consistent reporting. For example, we recently highlighted the key issues to be considered in developing guidance for disclosing deferred maintenance on aircraft. In particular, we noted that implementing guidance is needed so that all military services consistently apply the deferred maintenance standard. This means that DOD must address a number of issues, including (1) what constitutes acceptable condition, (2) determining whether\u2014or how\u2014to distinguish between critical and noncritical deferred maintenance, (3) determining when maintenance needed but not performed is considered deferred, and (4) whether deferred maintenance should be reported for assets that are not necessary for current requirements.
