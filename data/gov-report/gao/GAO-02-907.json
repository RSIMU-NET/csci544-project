Furthermore, in fiscal year 2001, both fee collections and agency funding requirements exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the agency's history. Although both 5-year plans cover the same period, the assumptions and projected results of the Business Plan are different in several ways from the Strategic Plan. The administration's recent legislative proposal to restructure patent fees to implement the Strategic Plan would result in higher fees for the majority of patent applications--large entities--that receive utility patents and maintain such patents in to the future. Consequently, total fees for these applicants would increase by $4,100 or 51 percent. Also, total fees for most small entities would increase $2,700 or 67 percent over current fees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which administers U.S. patent and trademark laws, had a staff of 6,426 and collected about $1.1 billion in patent and trademark fees in fiscal year 2001. Patent and trademark laws protect inventors\u2019 and businesses\u2019 inventions and encourage innovation and the scientific and technical advancement of American industry through the preservation, classification, and dissemination of patent information. As the U.S. economy depends increasingly on new innovations, the need to patent or trademark quickly the intellectual property resulting from such innovations becomes more important.", "The patent process begins with an applicant filing a patent application with USPTO and paying a filing fee. This step begins the patent examination process.  An applicant may be a small or large entity\u2014small entities, which pay reduced fees in many instances, include organizations with 500 or fewer employees, non-profit organizations, and independent inventors, whereas large entities, according to USPTO officials, include all others. As part of the examination process a patent examiner searches United States and foreign patents, journals, and other literature, and sometimes contacts the applicant to resolve questions and obtain additional information to determine the proposed invention\u2019s potential patentability. A proposed invention is patentable if it is a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof. If the examiner decides that a patent is warranted, the applicant is informed and, upon payment of an \u201cissue fee,\u201d USPTO grants a patent. The applicant may abandon the application any time during this process. If a patent is granted, the patent holder has, in most instances, a patent term of 20 years from the date the application was filed. To keep the patent active, the applicant must pay maintenance fees at 3.5 years, 7.5 years, and 11.5 years. Historically, the time from the date that a patent application is filed to the date that either the patent is granted or the application is abandoned has been called \u201cpatent pendency.\u201d", "In April 2001, USPTO estimated in its Fiscal Year 2002 Corporate Plan\u2014 which was part of the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2002 budget submission and included some performance information covering fiscal years 2002 through 2006\u2014that patent pendency would increase from 25 months in fiscal year 2000 to over 38 months in fiscal year 2006. Expressing concern about USPTO\u2019s plans for the future, the Congress directed USPTO in November 2001 to develop a 5-year plan, among other things, to improve patent quality and reduce patent and trademark pendency. In February 2002, USPTO issued its first 5-year plan, which was called the USPTO Business Plan and covered fiscal years 2003 through 2007. This plan included nine operating initiatives focused on improving patent timeliness and quality. For example, the plan included hiring hundreds of new patent examiners each year to handle new patent applications. The plan also identified changes to the fee structure, including a one-time surcharge on patent and trademark fees in fiscal year 2003 to begin paying for the new initiatives. The Business Plan was developed before the new Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (hereafter referred to as the Director) assumed office in December 2001. Consequently, the new Director viewed the Business Plan as only the first step toward a long- range strategy to strengthen the patent and trademark system.", "Because the new Director did not believe that the Business Plan went far enough, he conducted a review of the USPTO to identify new ways to improve quality and reduce pendency. Based upon the results of that review, in June 2002 USPTO produced another 5-year plan\u2014called The 21st Century Strategic Plan. Like the Business Plan, it covered fiscal years 2003 through 2007. However, the Strategic Plan used different assumptions than the Business Plan about some key factors, such as the expected number of patent applications to be filed, and included major operating and fee changes that were more aggressive than those in the Business Plan. According to USPTO, the Strategic Plan proposed fundamental changes in the way the agency operates, such as restructuring the patent fee schedule and redesigning the patent search and examination system. For example, instead of applicants paying one fee that covers filing and examination, applicants would pay a filing fee and then decide whether to request and pay for an examination. Additionally, the Strategic Plan\u2019s success was linked to enactment of the President\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget, legislation to change USPTO\u2019s current fee schedule, revisions to current rules, and legislation for streamlining the patent and trademark system. The administration released its fee legislation proposal on June 20, 2002.", "In this context, you asked for information on (1) USPTO\u2019s past and future operations, particularly patent applications filed, patents granted, patent application inventory, patent pendency, patent examiner staffing, and fee collections and funding requirements (agency appropriations); (2) some of the differences between USPTO\u2019s Business and Strategic Plans; and (3) changes in the patent fee structure under proposed legislation.

(See app. I, p. 29.)", "The patent pendency definition is different under each plan. Under the Business Plan, pendency is measured from the date an application is filed. However, under the Strategic Plan, pendency would be measured from the date an applicant pays the examination fee. According to USPTO officials, this definition is different than the definition under the Business Plan because of the proposed fundamental redesign of the patent search and examination system. Also, according to the Strategic Plan, this definition is the same measure\u2014the examination duration period\u2014used by the European Patent Office and the Japan Patent Office.", "This change in definition is partly responsible for the reduction in pendency under the Strategic Plan. Historically, applicants have paid a single fee that covered filing and examination; under the Strategic Plan there would be separate filing and examination fees. The applicant has two options for paying fees under the Strategic Plan. Under the first option, applicants may elect to pay the patent application fee and examination fee at the same time. Under the second option, applicants may elect to pay the application fee and defer examination and paying the examination fee for up to 18 months. According to USPTO, applicants that take advantage of the deferred examination do so for various reasons, such as to decide the merits of pursuing the patent or to avoid the early expenditure of funds. USPTO estimates that about 9 percent of all applicants will defer examination. The Strategic Plan redefines patent pendency as the examination duration period. As a result, under the first option the pendency measure is the same as under the Business Plan\u2014it begins from the date the patent application is filed. However, under the second option pendency begins when the examination fee is paid.", "Table 1 shows USPTO\u2019s projections of patent pendency under three scenarios using different assumptions. The first scenario shows the Business Plan\u2019s pendency projections. The second scenario is based upon the Strategic Plan where an applicant pays the filing fee and examination fee at the same time, thus seeking immediate examination. The third scenario is based on the Strategic Plan where an applicant pays the filing fee and then defers examination. Regarding the third scenario, the Strategic Plan notes that to determine the average total pendency under the Strategic Plan (from the date an application is filed to issue of a patent or abandonment of the application), 9 months should be added to the plan\u2019s calculation to reflect the estimated average examination deferral period. According to USPTO officials, fewer months should be added in the early years. Table 1 shows for the third scenario that when the deferral time is added, average pendency from filing until patents are granted or applications are abandoned would be longer under the Strategic Plan than under the Business Plan for those applicants who elect to defer examination of their applications. USPTO noted that the fiscal year 2008 difference between the 18 months in the second scenario and the 27 months in the third scenario is a measure of deferred examination.", "Patent examiners\u2019 responsibility for the search function on most domestic applications would also be eliminated under the Strategic Plan. Instead, with the exception of a new class of applicant\u2014the micro-entity\u2014 applicants would arrange for such searches by private organizations, foreign patent offices, or others; USPTO would continue to do searches for micro-entities. This change would allow examiners more time to focus on the examination function. USPTO assumes under the Strategic Plan that a portion of the patent examiners\u2019 time will be refocused from non- examination to examination functions. USPTO officials told us that most of the refocused time would result from eliminating the search function. The detailed action plans supporting the Strategic Plan show that eliminating the search function would increase examiners\u2019 productivity between 5 and 20 percent.", "Almost 2,100 more new patent examiners would be hired under the Business Plan than under the Strategic Plan\u20144,750 versus 2,688. This difference reflects revised assumptions about new hires and the number of examiners expected to leave. Under the Business Plan, USPTO expects to hire 950 examiners and assumes a 10 percent attrition rate each year during fiscal years 2003 through 2007. Under the Strategic Plan, USPTO expects to hire 750 examiners annually for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and 396 examiners annually for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. USPTO assumes 11 percent and 8 percent attrition rates for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, respectively, and 9 percent attrition annually for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. Fewer examiners would be required under the Strategic Plan because fewer new applications are anticipated and examiners would no longer be required to do the search function for most patent applications.", "Patent fee restructuring would be implemented in fiscal year 2004 under the Business Plan, and by October 1, 2002, under the Strategic Plan. There would be a one-time surcharge of 19.3 percent on patents and 10.3 percent on trademarks in fiscal year 2003 under the Business Plan, but no surcharge under the Strategic Plan. USPTO officials told us that the restructured fees would need to be put in place earlier than proposed under the Business Plan to compensate for the elimination of the one-time surcharge and the expected decrease in patent applications, and to implement changes proposed to improve quality and reduce pendency.", "Fee collections and funding requirements projected for fiscal year 2003 in the Business Plan would be the same in the Strategic Plan\u2014$1.527 billion in fee collections and $1.365 billion in funding requirements\u2014but the specifics would change. For example, the Strategic Plan\u2019s patent-funding requirements would increase by about $27 million and trademark-funding requirements would decrease by the same amount. Furthermore, projected funding requirements for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 would total about $539 million less under the Strategic Plan than under the Business Plan\u2014 $8.396 billion versus $8.935 billion\u2014as a result of changing assumptions, such as fewer patent applications filed and fewer patent examiners needed.

While the proposed filing fee under the Strategic Plan would be lower than the current filing fee, a new examination fee would be added and other fees would be higher. In addition, some new fees would be established for such things as surcharges authorized by the USPTO Director in certain instances. For example, a surcharge could be charged for any patent application whose specification and drawings exceed 50 sheets of paper. (See app. I, p. 30.)", "Generally, large entities would pay higher fees under the proposed legislation. The current fee structure provides that large entities pay a $740 patent filing fee that covers both the filing and examination of the patent application. While the proposed legislation would have large entities pay a $300 patent filing fee, it would also require applicants that request examination (assumed by USPTO to be 90 percent of the large entity applicants) to pay an additional $1,250 examination fee. Patent issue fees would also be higher under the proposed legislation. Consequently, a large entity that receives a utility patent would incur a fee increase of nearly $1,200, or about 59 percent, over current fees. Furthermore, the three fees to maintain the patent through its useful life would be higher. If a large entity maintains the patent through the payment of the three maintenance fees, the total fee increase resulting from the proposed legislation would be nearly $4,100, or about a 51 percent increase over current fees.

Instead of paying a $370 patent filing fee (50 percent of the $740 fee for large entities) that covers both the filing and examination of the patent application under the current fee structure, small entities would pay a $150 patent filing fee (50 percent of the new $300 fee) under the proposed legislation. However, small entities that request examination (assumed by USPTO to be 90 percent of the small entity applicants) also would have to pay the new $1,250 examination fee; with the exception of the new \u201cmicro-entity\u201d category, small entities would not get a discount on the new examination fee. In addition, issue fees for small entities are also higher. As a result, a small entity that receives a utility patent would incur a fee increase of over $1,200, or about 121 percent, over current fees.
