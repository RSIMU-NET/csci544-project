For that report, GAO was asked to determine how the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and State and the Social Security Administration use personal data from resellers and to review the extent to which information resellers' policies and practices reflect the Fair Information Practices, a set of widely accepted principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal data. GAO also examined agencies' policies and practices for handling personal data from resellers to determine whether these reflect the Fair Information Practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and State and the Social Security Administration reported that they used personal information obtained from resellers for a variety of purposes, including performing criminal investigations, locating witnesses and fugitives, researching assets held by individuals of interest, and detecting prescription drug fraud. The agencies spent approximately $30 million on contractual arrangements with resellers that enabled the acquisition and use of such information. About 91 percent of the planned fiscal year 2005 spending was for law enforcement (69 percent) or counterterrorism (22 percent). The major information resellers that do business with the federal agencies GAO reviewed have practices in place to protect privacy, but these measures are not fully consistent with the Fair Information Practices. For example, the principles that the collection and use of personal information should be limited and its intended use specified are largely at odds with the nature of the information reseller business, which is based on obtaining personal information from many sources and making it available to multiple customers for multiple purposes. Resellers believe it is not appropriate for them to fully adhere to these principles because they do not obtain their information directly from individuals. Nonetheless, in many cases, resellers take steps that address aspects of the Fair Information Practices. For example, resellers reported that they have taken steps recently to improve their security safeguards, and they generally inform the public about key privacy principles and policies. However, resellers generally limit the extent to which individuals can gain access to personal information held about themselves, as well as the extent to which inaccurate information contained in their databases can be corrected or deleted. Agency practices for handling personal information acquired from information resellers did not always fully reflect the Fair Information Practices. That is, for some of these principles, agency practices were uneven. For example, although agencies issued public notices when they systematically collected personal information, these notices did not always notify the public that information resellers were among the sources to be used. This practice is not consistent with the principle that individuals should be informed about privacy policies and the collection of information. Contributing to the uneven application of the Fair Information Practices are ambiguities in guidance from the Office of Management and Budget regarding the applicability of privacy requirements to federal agency uses of reseller information. In addition, agencies generally lack policies that specifically address these uses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to discuss critical issues surrounding  the federal government\u2019s purchase of personal information from  businesses known as information resellers.

Most significantly, the first four principles, relating to  collection limitation, data quality, purpose specification, and use  limitation, are largely at odds with the nature of the information  reseller business. These principles center on limiting the collection  and use of personal information and require data accuracy based on  that limited purpose and limited use of the information. However,  the information reseller industry presupposes that the collection  and use of personal information is not limited to specific purposes,  but instead can be made available to multiple customers for multiple  purposes. Resellers make it their business to collect large amounts  of personal information and to combine that information in new  ways so that it serves purposes other than those for which it was  originally collected. Further, they are limited in their ability to  ensure the accuracy, currency, or relevance of their holdings,  because these qualities may vary based on customers\u2019 varying uses.", "Information reseller policies and procedures were consistent with  aspects of the remaining four Fair Information Practices. Large  resellers reported implementing a variety of security safeguards,  such as stringent customer credentialing, to improve protection of  personal information. Resellers also generally provided public  notice of key aspects of their privacy policies and practices  (relevant to the openness principle), and reported taking actions to  ensure internal compliance with their own privacy policies (relevant  to the accountability principle). However, while information  resellers generally allow individuals limited access to their personal  information, they generally limit the opportunity to correct or delete  inaccurate information contained in reseller databases (relevant to  the individual participation principle).", "In brief, reseller practices compare with the Fair Information  Practices as follows:  Collection limitation. Resellers do not limit collections to specific  purposes but collect large amounts of personal information. In  practice, resellers are limited in the personal information that they  can obtain by laws that apply to specific kinds of information (for  example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act, which restrict the collection, use, and disclosure of certain  consumer and financial data). However, beyond specific legal  restrictions, information resellers generally attempt to aggregate  large amounts of personal information so as to provide useful  information to a broad range of customers. Resellers do not make  provisions to notify the individuals involved when they obtain  personal data from their many sources, including public records.  Concomitantly, individuals are not afforded an opportunity to  express or withhold their consent when the information is collected.  Resellers said they believe it is not appropriate or practical for them  to provide notice or obtain consent from individuals because they  do not collect information directly from them.", "Under certain conditions, some information resellers offer  consumers an \u201copt-out\u201d option\u2014that is, individuals may request that  information about themselves be suppressed from selected  databases. However, resellers generally offer this option only with  respect to certain types of information, such as marketing products,  and only under limited circumstances, such as if the individual is a  law enforcement officer or a victim of identity theft. Two resellers  stated their belief that under certain circumstances it may not be  appropriate to provide consumers with opportunities for opting out,  such as when information products are designed to detect fraud or  locate criminals. These resellers stated that if individuals were  permitted to opt out of fraud prevention databases, some of those  opting out could be criminals, which would undermine the  effectiveness and utility of these databases.", "Data quality. Information resellers reported taking steps to ensure  that they generally receive accurate data from their sources and that  they do not introduce errors in the process of transcribing and  aggregating information. However, they generally provide their  customers with exactly the same data they obtain and do not claim  or guarantee that the information is accurate for a specific purpose.  Some resellers\u2019 privacy policies state that they expect their data to  contain some errors. Further, resellers varied in their policies  regarding correction of data determined to be inaccurate as  obtained by them. One reseller stated that it would delete  information in its databases that was found to be inaccurate.  Another stated that even if an individual presents persuasive  evidence that certain information is in error, the reseller generally  does not make changes if the information comes directly from an  official public source (unless instructed to do so by that source).  Because they are not the original source of the personal  information, information resellers generally direct individuals to the  original sources to correct any errors. Several resellers stated that  they would correct any identified errors introduced through their  own processing and aggregation of data.", "Purpose specification. While information resellers specify purpose  in a general way by describing the types of businesses that use their  data, they generally do not designate specific intended uses for each  of their data collections. Resellers generally obtain information that  has already been collected for a specific purpose and make that  information available to their customers, who in turn have a broader  variety of purposes for using it. For example, personal information  originally submitted by a customer to register a product warranty  could be obtained by a reseller and subsequently made available to  another business or government agency, which might use it for an  unrelated purpose, such as identity verification, background  checking, or marketing. It is difficult for resellers to provide greater  specificity because they make their data available to many  customers for a wide range of legitimate purposes. As a result, the  public is made aware only of the broad range of potential uses to  which their personal information may be put, rather than a specific  use, as envisioned in the Fair Information Practices.", "Use limitation. Because information reseller purposes are specified  very broadly, it is difficult for resellers to ensure that use of the  information in their databases is limited. As previously discussed,  information reseller data may have many different uses, depending  on the types of customers involved. However, resellers do take steps  to ensure that their customers\u2019 use of personal information is  limited to legally sanctioned purposes. Information resellers pass  this responsibility to their customers through licensing agreements  and contract terms and agreements. Customers are usually required  to certify that they will only use information obtained from the  reseller in ways permissible under laws such as the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act and the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act. The information  resellers used by the federal agencies we reviewed generally also  reported taking steps to ensure that access to certain sensitive types  of personally identifiable information\u2014particularly Social Security  numbers\u2014is limited to certain customers and uses.", "Security safeguards. While we did not evaluate the effectiveness of  resellers\u2019 information security programs, resellers we spoke with  said they employ various safeguards to protect consumers\u2019 personal  information. They implemented these safeguards in part for  business reasons but also because federal laws require such  protections. Resellers describe these safeguards in various policy  statements, such as online and data privacy policies or privacy  statements posted on Internet sites. Given recent incidents, large  information resellers also reported having recently taken steps to  improve their safeguards against unauthorized access. Two resellers  reported that they had taken steps to improve their procedures for  authorizing customers to have access to sensitive information, such  as Social Security numbers. For example, one reseller established a  credentialing task force with the goal of centralizing its customer  credentialing process. In addition to enhancing safeguards on  customer access authorizations, resellers have instituted a variety of  other security controls. For example, three large information  resellers have implemented physical safeguards at their data  centers, such as continuous monitoring of employees entering and  exiting facilities, monitoring of activity on customer accounts, and  strong authentication of users entering and exiting secure areas  within the data centers.", "Openness. To address openness, information resellers took steps to  inform the public about key aspects of their privacy policies. They  used means such as company Web sites and brochures to inform the  public of specific policies and practices regarding the collection and  use of personal information. Reseller Web sites also generally  provided information about the types of information products the  resellers offered\u2014including product samples\u2014as well as general  descriptions about the types of customers served.", "Individual participation. Although information resellers allow  individuals access to their personal information, this access is  generally limited. Resellers may provide an individual a report  containing certain types of information\u2014such as compilations of  public records information\u2014however, the report may not include all  information maintained by the resellers about that individual.  Further, because they obtain their information from other sources,  most resellers have limited provisions for correcting or deleting  inaccurate information contained in their databases. If individuals  find inaccuracies in such reports, they generally cannot have these  corrected by the resellers. Resellers, as a matter of policy, do not  make corrections to data obtained from other sources, even if the  individual provides evidence that the data are wrong. Instead, they  direct individuals wishing to make corrections to contact the  original sources of the data. Several resellers stated that they would  correct any identified errors resulting from their own processing  and aggregation of data (for example, transposing numbers or  letters or incorrectly aggregating information).", "Accountability. Although information resellers\u2019 overall application  of the Fair Information Practices varied, each reseller we spoke with  reported actions to ensure compliance with its own privacy policies.  For example, resellers reported designating chief privacy officers to  monitor compliance with internal privacy policies and applicable  laws. Information resellers reported that these officials had a range  of responsibilities aimed at ensuring accountability for privacy  policies, such as establishing consumer access and customer  credentialing procedures, monitoring compliance with federal and  state laws, and evaluating new sources of data (for example, cell  phone records). Although there are no industrywide standards  requiring resellers to conduct periodic audits of their compliance  with privacy policies, one information reseller reported using a third  party to conduct privacy audits on an annual basis. Using a third  party to audit compliance with privacy policies further helps to  ensure that an information reseller is accountable for the  implementation of its privacy practices.", "In commenting on excerpts of our draft report, several resellers  raised concerns regarding the version of the Fair Information  Practices we used to assess their practices, stating their view that it  applied more appropriately to organizations that collect information  directly from consumers and that they were not legally bound to  adhere to the Fair Information Practices. As discussed in our report,  the version of the Fair Information Practices we used has been  widely adopted and cited within the federal government as well as  internationally. Further, we use it as an analytical framework for  identifying potential privacy issues for further consideration by  Congress\u2014not as criteria for strict compliance. Resellers also stated  that the draft did not take into account their view that public record  information is open to all for any use not prohibited by state or  federal law. However, we believe it is not clear that individuals give  up all privacy rights to personal information contained in public  records, and we believe it is important to assess the status of  privacy protections for all personal information being offered  commercially to the government so that informed policy decisions  can be made about the appropriate balance between resellers\u2019  services and the public\u2019s right to privacy. In our report we suggest  that Congress consider the extent to which information resellers  should adhere to the Fair Information Practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Lack Policies on Use of Reseller Data, and Practices Do Not Consistently Reflect the Fair Information Practices", "paragraphs": ["Agencies generally lacked policies that specifically address their use  of personal information from commercial sources (although DHS  Privacy Office officials have reported that they are drafting such a  policy), and agency practices for handling personal information  acquired from information resellers did not always fully reflect the  Fair Information Practices.

For example, several agency  components (specifically, law enforcement agencies such as the FBI  and the U.S. Secret Service) reported that in practice, they generally  corroborate information obtained from resellers when it is used as  part of an investigation. This practice is consistent with the principle  of data quality.", "Agency policies and practices with regard to the other four  principles were uneven. Specifically, agencies did not always have  policies or practices in place to address the purpose specification,  openness, and individual participation principles with respect to  reseller data. The inconsistencies in applying these principles as  well as the lack of specific agency policies can be attributed in part  to ambiguities in OMB guidance regarding the applicability of the  Privacy Act to information obtained from resellers. Further, privacy  impact assessments, a valuable tool that could address important  aspects of the Fair Information Practices, are not conducted often.

Regarding collection limitation, for most law-enforcement and  counterterrorism purposes (which accounted for 90 percent of  usage in fiscal year 2005), agencies generally limited their personal  data collection in that they reported obtaining information only on  specific individuals under investigation or associates of those  individuals. Regarding data quality, agencies reported taking steps  to mitigate the risk of inaccurate information reseller data by  corroborating information obtained from resellers. Agency officials  described the practice of corroborating information as a standard  element of conducting investigations. Likewise, for non-law- enforcement use, such as debt collection and fraud detection and  prevention, agency components reported that they mitigated  potential problems with the accuracy of data provided by resellers  by obtaining additional information from other sources when  necessary. As for use limitation, agency officials said their use of  reseller information was limited to distinct purposes, which were  generally related to law enforcement or counterterrorism. Finally,  while we did not assess the effectiveness of information security at  any of these agencies, we found that all four had measures in place  intended to safeguard the security of personal information obtained  from resellers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limitations in the Applicability of the Privacy Act and Ambiguities in OMB Guidance Contribute to an Uneven Adherence to the Purpose Specification, Openness, and Individual Participation Principles", "paragraphs": ["The purpose specification, openness, and individual participation  principles stipulate that individuals should be made aware of the  purpose and intended uses of the personal information being  collected about them, and, if necessary, have the ability to access  and correct their information.

Agency  officials said that they generally did not prepare system-of-records  notices that would address these principles because they were not  required to do so by the Privacy Act. The act\u2019s vehicle for public  notification\u2014the system-of-records notice\u2014becomes binding on an  agency only when the agency collects, maintains, and retrieves  personal data in the way defined by the act or when a contractor  does the same thing explicitly on behalf of the government.  Agencies generally did not issue system-of-records notices  specifically for their use of information resellers largely because  information reseller databases were not considered \u201csystems of  records operated by or on behalf of a government agency\u201d and thus  were not considered subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act.  OMB guidance on implementing the Privacy Act does not  specifically refer to the use of reseller data or how it should be  treated. According to OMB and other agency officials, information  resellers operate their databases for multiple customers, and federal  agency use of these databases does not amount to the operation of a  system of records on behalf of the government. Further, agency  officials stated that merely querying information reseller databases  did not amount to agency \u201cmaintenance\u201d of the personal information  being queried and thus also did not trigger the provisions of the  Privacy Act. In many cases, agency officials considered their use of  resellers to be of this type\u2014essentially \u201cad hoc\u201d querying or  \u201cpinging\u201d of reseller databases for personal information about  specific individuals, which they believed they were not doing in  connection with a formal system of records.", "In other cases, however, agencies maintained information reseller  data in systems for which system-of-records notices had been  previously published. For example, law enforcement agency  officials stated that, to the extent they retain the results of reseller  data queries, this collection and use is covered by the system of  records notices for their case file systems. However, in preparing  such notices, agencies generally did not specify that they were  obtaining information from resellers. Among system of records  notices that were identified by agency officials as applying to the  use of reseller data, only one\u2014TSA\u2019s system of records notice for  the test phase of its Secure Flight program\u2014specifically identified  the use of information reseller data.", "In several of these cases, agency sources for personal information  were described only in vague terms, such as \u201cprivate organizations,\u201d  \u201cother public sources,\u201d or \u201cpublic source material,\u201d when  information was being obtained from information resellers.", "The inconsistency with which agencies specify resellers as a source  of information in system-of-records notices is due in part to  ambiguity in OMB guidance, which states that \u201cfor systems of  records which contain information obtained from sources other  than the individual to whom the records pertain, the notice should  list the types of sources used.\u201d Although the guidance is unclear  what would constitute adequate disclosure of \u201ctypes of sources,\u201d  OMB and DHS Privacy Office officials agreed that to the extent that  reseller data is subject to the Privacy Act, agencies should  specifically identify information resellers as a source and that  merely citing public records information does not sufficiently  describe the source.", "Aside from certain law enforcement exemptions to the Privacy Act,  adherence to the purpose specification and openness principles is  critical to preserving a measure of individual control over the use of  personal information. Without clear guidance from OMB or specific  policies in place, agencies have not consistently reflected these  principles in their collection and use of reseller information. As a  result, without being notified of the existence of an agency\u2019s  information collection activities, individuals have no ability to know  that their personal information could be obtained from commercial  sources and potentially used as a basis, or partial basis, for taking  action that could have consequences for their welfare."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Privacy Impact Assessments Could Address Openness and Purpose Specification Principles but Often Are Not Conducted", "paragraphs": ["PIAs can be an important tool to help agencies to address openness  and purpose specification principles early in the process of  developing new information systems. To the extent that PIAs are  made publicly available, they provide explanations to the public  about such things as the information that will be collected, why it is  being collected, how it is to be used, and how the system and data  will be maintained and protected.", "However, few agency components reported developing PIAs for  their systems or programs that make use of information reseller  data. As with system-of-records notices, agencies often did not  conduct PIAs because officials did not believe they were required.  Current OMB guidance on conducting PIAs is not always clear about  when they should be conducted. According to guidance from OMB,  a PIA is required by the E-Government Act when agencies  \u201csystematically incorporate into existing information systems  databases of information in identifiable form purchased or obtained  from commercial or public sources.\u201d However, the same guidance  also instructs agencies that \u201cmerely querying a database on an ad  hoc basis does not trigger the PIA requirement.\u201d Reported uses of  reseller data were generally not described as a \u201csystematic\u201d  incorporation of data into existing information systems; rather, most  involved querying a database and in some cases retaining the results  of these queries. OMB officials stated that agencies would need to  make their own judgments on whether retaining the results of  searches of information reseller databases constituted a \u201csystematic  incorporation\u201d of information.", "The DHS Privacy Office has been working to clarify guidance on  the use of reseller information in general as well as the specific  requirements for conducting PIAs. DHS recently issued guidance  requiring PIAs to be conducted whenever reseller data are involved.  However, although the DHS guidance clearly states that PIAs are  required when personally identifiable information is obtained from a  commercial source, it also states that \u201cmerely querying such a  source on an ad hoc basis using existing technology does not trigger  the PIA requirement.\u201d Like OMB\u2019s guidance, the DHS guidance is  not clear, because agency personnel are left to make individual  determinations as to whether queries are \u201con an ad hoc basis.\u201d", "Until PIAs are conducted more thoroughly and consistently, the  public is likely to remain incompletely informed about agency  purposes and uses for obtaining reseller information.", "In our report we recommended that the Director, OMB, revise  privacy guidance to clarify the applicability of requirements for  public notices and privacy impact assessments to agency use of  personal information from resellers and direct agencies to review  their uses of such information to ensure it is explicitly referenced in  privacy notices and assessments. Further, we recommended that  agencies develop specific policies for the use of personal  information from resellers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Often Did Not Have Practices in Place to Ensure Accountability for Proper Handling of Information Reseller Data", "paragraphs": ["According to the accountability principle, individuals controlling  the collection or use of personal information should be accountable  for ensuring the implementation of the Fair Information Practices.  This means that agencies should take steps to ensure that they use  personal information from information resellers appropriately.", "Agencies described using activities to oversee their use of reseller  information that were largely based on trust in the individual user to  use the information appropriately, rather than management  oversight of usage details. For example, in describing controls  placed on the use of commercial data, officials from component  agencies identified measures such as instructing users that reseller  data are for official use only, and requiring users to sign statements  attesting 1) to their need to access information reseller databases  and 2) that their use will be limited to official business. Additionally,  agency officials reported that their users are required to select from  a list of vendor-defined \u201cpermissible purposes\u201d (for example, law  enforcement, transactions authorized by the consumer) before  conducting a search on reseller databases.", "While these practices appear consistent with the accountability  principle, they are focused on individual user responsibility instead  of monitoring and oversight. Agencies did not have practices in  place to obtain reports from resellers that would allow them to  monitor usage of reseller databases at a detailed level. Although  agencies generally receive usage reports from the information  resellers, these reports are designed primarily for monitoring costs.  Further, these reports generally contained only high-level statistics  on the number of searches and databases accessed, not the contents  of what was actually searched, thus limiting their utility in  monitoring usage.", "To the extent that federal agencies do not implement methods such  as user monitoring or auditing of usage records, they provide limited  accountability for their usage of information reseller data and have  limited assurance that the information is being used appropriately.", "In summary, services provided by information resellers are  important to federal agency functions such as law enforcement and  fraud protection and identification. Resellers have practices in place  to protect privacy, but these practices are not fully consistent with  the Fair Information Practices, which resellers are not legally  required to follow. Among other things, resellers collect large  amounts of information about individuals without their knowledge  or consent, do not ensure that the data they make available are  accurate for a given purpose, and generally do not make corrections  to the data when errors are identified by individuals. Information  resellers believe that application of the relevant principles of the  Fair Information Practices is inappropriate or impractical in these  situations. However, given that reseller data may be used for a  variety of purposes, determining the appropriate degree of control  or influence individuals should have over the way in which their  personal information is obtained and used\u2014as envisioned in the  Fair Information Practices\u2014is critical. As Congress weighs various  legislative options, adherence to the Fair Information Practices will  be an important consideration in determining the appropriate  balance between the services provided by information resellers to  customers such as government agencies and the public\u2019s right to  privacy.", "While agencies take steps to adhere to Fair Information Practices  such as the collection limitation, data quality, use limitation, and  security safeguards principles, they have not taken all the steps  they could to reflect others\u2014or to comply with specific Privacy Act  and e-Government Act requirements\u2014in their handling of reseller  data. Because OMB privacy guidance does not clearly address  information reseller data, agencies are left largely on their own to  determine how to satisfy legal requirements and protect privacy  when acquiring and using reseller data. Without current and specific  guidance, the government risks continued uneven adherence to  important, well-established privacy principles and lacks assurance  that the privacy rights of individuals are adequately protected.", "Mr. Chairmen, this concludes my testimony today.
