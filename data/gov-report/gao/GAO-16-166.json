To conduct this work, GAO analyzed budget data for fiscal years 2005 through 2014 on the Park Service's overall funding and fee revenue and donations. GAO also reviewed laws, examined Park Service reports, and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders, such as nonprofit partners and concessioners."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Park Service's (Park Service) total funding did not keep pace with inflation for fiscal years 2005 through 2014, even as fees and donations increased. Total funding increased in nominal dollars from $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion (15 percent) during this period, but declined by 3 percent after adjusting for inflation. Annual appropriations, which comprised about 88 percent of total funding on average, declined 8 percent after adjusting for inflation. Fees, donations, and other funding sources, which accounted for the remainder, increased 39 percent after adjusting for inflation.", "Revenues from fees and donations grew for fiscal years 2005 through 2014 to varying degrees. Specifically, revenues from recreation fees, which include entrance and amenity fees for facilities such as campsites, increased from about $148 million to $186 million (26 percent). Revenues from fees from concessions operations, which comprise the vast majority of commercial service fees, nearly tripled from almost $29 million to $85 million. Meanwhile, cash donations from philanthropic sources fluctuated, ranging from $19.5 million in fiscal year 2011 to $94.7 million in fiscal year 2014.", "The Park Service has efforts under way to increase revenues from fees and donations, but certain factors limit these efforts. For recreation fees, the Park Service updated its fee schedule, and several park units increased entrance and amenity fees. However, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) does not give the Park Service and other agencies that charge recreation fees the authority to adjust the price of a lifetime senior pass, which has been $10 since 1993. GAO's guide on user fees states that federal agencies should regularly review fees and make changes if warranted. Without the authority to modify the price of the senior pass, the Park Service is limited in its ability to increase revenue from this fee. In addition, Park Service guidance on recreation fees directs the agency to ensure its fees are set at a reasonable level, but does not call for periodic reviews of these fees, and the agency has no plans to do so. The agency also does not require park units to provide information on decisions to not change their fees or deviate from the fee schedule because decisions about raising fees are left to the park units. As a result, the Park Service is missing opportunities to ensure that its entrance fees are reasonable. To increase commercial service revenues, the Park Service increased minimum franchise fees that concessioners pay, and some park units have developed leasing programs. Several factors, such as limited competition for some concessions contracts, complicate efforts to increase these fees. For philanthropic donations, the Park Service has launched fundraising and public outreach campaigns in conjunction with its centennial anniversary in 2016 and has modified fundraising policies to increase donation opportunities. According to agency officials, several factors hamper the agency's ability to increase donations, such as projects that need funding are not always attractive to donors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider amending FLREA so that the federal agencies that charge recreation fees can determine whether to adjust the price of a senior pass.

The Park Service has reported that its funding does not cover  the full cost of its mission to preserve the park units for current and future  generations to enjoy. In 2006, we reported that the Park Service faced a  backlog of about $5 billion for the buildings, trails, and artifacts it is  responsible for maintaining, and in a 2013 testimony before Congress,  the Director of the Park Service stated that about $250 million in  additional annual funding was needed to keep this maintenance backlog  from growing.

According to Park Service guidance,  one of the guiding principles of the program is that parks will not collect  recreation fees if the cost of collection exceeds the amount of revenue  generated. For example, some park units do not have many visitors, so  the administrative costs of charging these fees, which include paying staff  to collect them, purchasing cash registers to process them, and hiring an  armored car service to deposit them, can outweigh the anticipated  revenues.", "Even with the decline in the number of parks collecting recreation fees,  revenues grew over the period we examined, largely because the fees  collected at a small number of parks account for a large portion of the  fees collected.

In addition, Park Service does not require  park units to provide information supporting their decisions on not  increasing entrance fee rates or increasing their fees by less than the fee  schedule. According to a senior Park Service official, providing this  information was not required because it was not compulsory that park  units increase their fees. However, Federal Internal Control Standards  state that for an agency to run its operations, it must have reliable and  timely communication and that information is needed throughout the  agency to achieve its objectives.

Of  the 131 park units that charged amenity fees in 2014, 55 park units  received approval from Park Service headquarters to increase their  amenity fees. Many of these parks received headquarters approval to  increase fees at campgrounds. For example, Whiskeytown National  Recreation Area in California received approval to increase fees $5 a  night in most cases for recreation vehicle, tent, and horse camping.

Park Service officials also said there were limits to how much  the agency could raise fees because FLREA requires that the agency  consider the impacts of fees on visitors, and the Park Service did not  want to dissuade visitors from coming to parks. For example, there was  opposition from the public to implementing entrance fees at additional  areas of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) National Historical Park and, in  response, park officials withdrew this proposal in February 2015.", "FLREA also directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish an  interagency pass that covers entrance fees and certain amenity fees for  all federal recreational lands. The price of the pass is $80 annually, as of  October 2015, and covers national park units, as well as recreational  lands managed by U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau  of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However,  FLREA limits agencies\u2019 ability to increase revenue from recreation fees.  For example, the law prohibits charging entrance fees to persons under  16 years of age. FLREA also requires the Secretary of the Interior to offer  a lifetime interagency pass for a one-time $10 price to senior citizens,  defined as being over 62 years of age, and requires that free interagency  passes be made available to permanently disabled people.", "While under FLREA, the price of the annual interagency pass can be  changed by the agencies that administer it, the law does not provide this  flexibility for the $10 lifetime senior pass, the free annual pass for  disabled individuals, or free entry for those under age 16. Interior\u2019s  Inspector General found that this aspect of FLREA \u201champers agencies\u2019  flexibility and their ability to make business decisions\u201d and concluded that  free and substantially discounted passes represent missed opportunities  for revenue. The price of the senior pass has been $10 since 1993, but  a bill introduced in September 2015 would increase this price to a one- time amount matching the price of the annual interagency pass, which is  $80, as of October 2015. If this occurred, it could generate about  another $35 million in revenue annually, assuming that the same number  of passes was sold, as in fiscal year 2014, which was about 500,000.  Because of the limitations in FLREA, Park Service and the other agencies  that administer the recreation fee program do not have the flexibility to  periodically reassess and change the price of the lifetime senior pass.  Providing this flexibility to these agencies would allow them to consider  adjusting fees periodically, which is consistent with our guide on federal  user fees.", "Park-specific characteristics. At some park units, collecting recreation  fees is precluded by the configuration of the parks or is not economically  advantageous. For example, some park units have many entry points,  which make the logistics of collecting entrance fees difficult, according to  Park Service officials. In addition, as previously described, at some park  units, it may not be economically advantageous to collect recreation fees  at some park units. For example, at parks with few visitors, the costs of  administering the fee collection program would be a significant portion of  the total fees collected, and these parks may not choose to charge an  entrance fee. Other park units\u2014for example, national historic sites\u2014may  not offer amenities, such as campsites, for which the Park Service could  charge fees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Park Service Increased Revenues from Commercial Services and Is Looking for New Opportunities to Generate Revenue, but Several Factors Complicate These Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service increased revenues from commercial service fees from  fiscal year 2005 through 2014, in part by increasing the franchise fees  that concessioners are to pay and by taking steps to make certain  contracts more attractive to potential bidders. However, several factors  complicate these efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Park Service Increased Concessions Revenues and Is Looking for Opportunities to Increase Revenues from Other Commercial Services", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service increased revenues from commercial service fees from  fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2014, in part by increasing the  minimum franchise fees included in contract prospectuses. According to  Park Service officials, the agency increased the minimum franchise fee by  modifying the process they used to develop contract prospectuses, which  describe the services concessioners are to provide, any investments  required for the operation, such as maintenance or equipment, and the  minimum franchise fee, among other things. After a prospectus is issued,  potential concessioners submit bids that include, among other things, the  franchise fee they agree to pay if they are awarded the contract\u2014which  has to be equal to or higher than the minimum in the prospectus\u2014along  with details about the services they propose to provide. Before 1998,  when the Concessions Act was enacted, the Park Service set minimum  franchise fees based on limited financial reviews of concessioners\u2019  financial statements, according to Park Service officials. After 1998, Park  Service officials told us that they started hiring hospitality consultants to  help them with the financial aspects of contract prospectuses to meet the  requirements of the new act. Specifically, the agency started working with  hospitality consultants to conduct in-depth financial analyses to develop  minimum franchise fees for the Park Service\u2019s largest contracts\u2014those  with gross revenues above $5 million. These analyses involve estimating  concessioners\u2019 costs and anticipated revenues and comparing the  estimated profitability of the concessions operations with industry  standards. Park Service officials and hospitality consultants told us that  these more sophisticated analyses allowed the agency to better estimate  the franchise fees that concessioners could pay while still having a  reasonable opportunity for profit, as required by the Concessions Act,  which led to higher franchise fees.", "Park Service officials also made efforts to increase revenues from  commercial service fees by working to make concessions contracts more  attractive and increasing competition among potential bidders. Park  Service officials told us that increased competition among potential  concessioners generally results in higher franchise fees in winning  contracts. Our analysis of Park Service data also found that increased  competition was associated with higher franchise fees. Specifically, based  on our analysis of 25 large contracts awarded between fiscal years 2005  and 2014 we found that the Park Service earned an average of 5 percent  in franchise fees from contracts that attracted 1 or 2 bidders and an  average of 16 percent in franchise fees from contracts that attracted 3 or  more bidders. One of the ways that Park Service officials said they tried  to make concessions contracts attractive to more potential bidders was by  reducing the amount of Leaseholder Surrender Interest (LSI) that had  accumulated under certain contracts. LSI generally represents the  depreciated value of capital improvements made by a concessioner to a  property, such as building a new structure or completing a major  rehabilitation. If a contract is awarded to a different concessioner when  the contract ends, the Concessions Act requires the previous  concessioner to be reimbursed for any LSI. The previous concessioner  may be reimbursed by the new contract holder or the Park Service. Park  Service officials and concessioners we spoke with said that LSI can  create barriers to competition because few companies have the  resources to reimburse the previous concessioner. Park Service officials  told us that they chose to reduce the LSI associated with certain contracts  because these contracts would otherwise have attracted few bidders. For  example, in 2014, the Park Service spent almost $100 million reducing  LSI to increase competition for a large concessions contract at Grand  Canyon National Park. The Park Service initially invested $19 million in  LSI payments. However, even with this reduction in LSI, the Park Service  did not receive offers that met the terms of its first three prospectuses,  and agency officials said that the level of LSI remained a barrier to  potential bidders. As a result, the Park Service paid an additional $81  million to further reduce LSI. The Park Service received multiple bids on  the fourth prospectus for this contract. Park Service officials told us that  they plan to award this contract by January 1, 2016.", "In addition to reducing LSI associated with certain contracts, the Park  Service has limited the amount of LSI that potential bidders can incur in  new contracts, according to Park Service and concessioner officials we  spoke with. Park Service officials told us that limiting LSI could reduce  start-up costs associated with future contracts since new concessioners  would not have to reimburse previous concessioners for accumulated  LSI. However, some concessioners told us that limiting LSI could lead to  lower levels of investment in concessioner-run properties, since  concessioners may be less likely to make capital improvements if they  are not reimbursed for these investments. This, in turn, could contribute to  additional asset degradation and increased future maintenance costs,  according to some concessioners we spoke with.", "Park Service officials also have looked for opportunities to increase  revenues from leases and commercial use authorizations. Specifically,  the Park Service hired a national leasing manager in 2015 to formalize its  leasing program, and some parks units and regions have developed  active leasing programs. For example, from 2009 through 2014, the  Northeast region increased the number of leases from 25 to 76. As a  result, the region more than doubled the revenue it generated from rents  and payments made in lieu of rent, which increased from almost $14  million to $38 million during this time period. According to regional Park  Service officials, the region increased its leases by increasing the number  of full-time leasing positions and by hiring staff with real estate expertise  to help advise parks on developing leases and perform market studies to  set rental rates.", "The Park Service also has developed a new policy that has the potential  to increase revenues from commercial use authorizations, according to  Park Service officials. Traditionally, fees for commercial use  authorizations were set to recover costs that park officials incurred  administering the program. According to several park unit officials we  spoke with, these fees ranged from $100 to $350 per permit. In 2015, the  Park Service developed guidance that allows park officials to charge  businesses a fee based on a percentage of gross receipts or a fee that is  sufficient to cover administrative and management costs incurred issuing  these commercial use authorizations\u2014whichever is more. For example,  the new guidance allows park officials to charge recreation service  providers that generate less than $250,000 in annual gross receipts the  greater of either 3 percent of gross receipts or $500. Some businesses  operating under commercial use authorizations generate significant  revenues, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to Park  Service officials. As a result, officials said that this shift has the potential  to increase revenues because the resulting fees would be higher than the  flat fees that have traditionally been charged."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Complicate Park Service\u2019s Efforts to Increase Revenues from Commercial Service Fees", "paragraphs": ["Several factors complicate the Park Service\u2019s efforts to increase revenues  from commercial service fees. In particular, officials noted that the Park  Service is required by law to balance a number of priorities. Specifically,  under the Concessions Act, accommodations, facilities, and services  offered under a concessions contract must be consistent to the highest  practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of park units  they are proposed to operate in, provide a reasonable opportunity for  profit to concessioners, and offer reasonable rates for facilities and  services to the public. The law does not require the Park Service to  maximize franchise fees; instead, it states that franchise fees are a lower  priority than protecting, conserving and preserving park units or providing  necessary and appropriate facilities and services to visitors at reasonable  rates. As a result, Park Service officials told us that increasing revenues  from franchise fees can be challenging.", "The Park Service\u2019s efforts to increase revenues from commercial service  fees also have been affected by limited competition for some concessions  contracts. Our analysis of Park Service data found that 32 percent (8 of  25) of the Park Service\u2019s largest contracts\u2014those generating $5 million or  more\u2014awarded between fiscal years 2005 and 2014 attracted one  bidder. These 25 contracts generated about 45 percent of the $65 million  in franchise fees collected by the Park Service in fiscal year 2013, the  most recent year for which data are available. Park Service officials told  us that, of these 25 contracts, 2 contracts for lodging services initially  received no bids. In addition, some parks offer limited opportunities for  revenue generation, which may in turn limit the number of bidders. For  example, Park Service officials told us that some park units are located in  remote locations that attract few visitors or have short tourist seasons,  which limits the potential profitability of these contracts. According to Park  Service officials, they are pleased to receive one bid in such cases.", "Adjusting a concessions contract to provide additional services, which  could increase revenues for concessioners and the Park Service, can be  a lengthy process, according to some concessioners we spoke with. For  example, one concessioner that provides transportation services at a park  told us that his company proposed increasing the number of park visitors  transported per day to levels consistent with the park\u2019s management plan.  This proposed change took 20 months to be reviewed and approved by  the Park Service, which, according to the concessioner, resulted in lost  revenue for both the concessioner and Park Service. Another  transportation concessioner told us about similar challenges adjusting his  company\u2019s operating plan to increase service hours by 30 minutes.  Although such a change in operating hours is generally the purview of the  park superintendent, according to the concessioner, the change took 5  years to be approved due to turnover in park leadership and park budget  constraints.", "Park Service officials told us that they act as quickly as possible when  they receive requests to change or increase concessioners\u2019 services but,  in some cases, it takes time to collect and assess the necessary  information to make an informed decision. For example, according to  Park Service officials, the agency considers the impact of the proposed  change on park operations and on other business operations in the park.  Park Service officials also told us that they are developing guidance to  establish factors to consider for adding services to help park unit staff  when considering concessioners\u2019 requests. Proposed factors include  whether the proposed services complement the terms of the current  contract and whether there will be environmental impacts at the park unit  from these services. In addition, concessioners must be fully compliant  with their current contracts before requests to add services may be  considered. As of August 2015, this guidance was under development,  and agency officials were uncertain when it would be issued.", "Efforts to increase revenues from leases and commercial use  authorizations also face challenges. According to Park Service officials,  leasing opportunities can be limited because some park units do not have  buildings available to lease or the facilities they have are not suitable for  leasing due to their poor physical condition. In addition, park officials at  two parks we visited told us that they do not have sufficient staff to  manage a leasing program. For commercial use authorizations, some  park officials we spoke with said that changing their fee structure to one  based on a percentage of business owners\u2019 gross revenues could pose a  financial burden to smaller businesses that have low profit margins yet  provide important services for park visitors. For example, park officials at  one park told us that some businesses have held commercial use  authorizations to deliver portable toilets, which they said is an essential  service during large events. These officials told us that these businesses  have relatively low profit margins and may be unwilling to operate in parks  if they had to pay higher fees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Park Service Has Sought to Increase Philanthropic Donations, but Several Factors Limit Its Ability to Do So", "paragraphs": ["To increase philanthropic donations, the Park Service is leveraging  opportunities arising from its centennial anniversary in 2016, adjusting  relevant policies, helping to increase the fundraising capacity of its  nonprofit partners, and training its own staff on ways to collaborate more  effectively with nonprofit partners.

The Park Service and the Foundation have launched a  major fundraising campaign, which aims to raise $250 million in  donations by 2018. These funds will be used to support 100 projects  that protect resources, connect visitors with the parks, and develop  the next generation of park stewards. For example, in the area of  protecting resources, projects include rehabilitating Constitution  Gardens in Washington, D.C., and restoring an area of large Sequoia  trees to a more natural state in Yosemite\u2019s Mariposa Grove.", "Public Outreach. In collaboration with the Foundation, the Park  Service launched the \u201cFind Your Park\u201d campaign in 2015. This public  outreach effort is designed to encourage Americans to visit park units,  generate interest in parks, and help raise financial and in-kind support  for park units. This effort uses social media and disseminates  marketing materials online and in park units. The Park Service has  partnered on this campaign with certain major donors, which each  made at least $500,000 in contributions to the Foundation to support  the campaign. Figure 7 shows examples of posters developed for the  campaign to be displayed in park units and also used in online and  print advertising.", "The Park Service also has allocated about $49 million in funds  appropriated by Congress for the centennial anniversary. Congress has  also appropriated funds to be used for matching grants. Specifically,  Congress appropriated $25 million in 2008, $15 million in 2010, and $10  million in fiscal year 2015 to match philanthropic donations dollar-for- dollar to fund projects in park units. To be considered, proposed projects  are to benefit one or more Park Service areas and have matching  donations of at least 50 percent of project costs, according to the Park  Service. Agency officials have prioritized projects with higher rates of  matching donations, and considered the timeliness of donations,  readiness of projects, and whether proposed projects address centennial  and service-wide goals, such as high-priority deferred maintenance.  Examples include rehabilitating the underground Franklin Court Museum  at Independence National Historical Park and reconstructing roads,  parking, walks, signs, and pedestrian areas to meet park road standards,  accessibility standards, and historical context at Roosevelt Arch in  Yellowstone National Park.", "Since 2014, the Park Service has also been revising its policies related to  philanthropy to help increase donations. Specifically, the Park Service  has been revising Director\u2019s Order 21\u2014the Park Service\u2019s main policy  governing donations and fundraising. Some nonprofit partners told us that  this guidance lengthened the donations process in the past by requiring  significant Park Service review. Park Service documentation suggests  that, when approved, the revised Director\u2019s Order 21 will likely shift  greater authority to regional directors and superintendents to accept  donations and approve fundraising agreements. For example, current  policy allows regional directors to approve donations less than $1 million.  The revised policy, which will likely be signed in early 2016, may allow the  Park Service Director to delegate approval authority to regional directors  for donations up to $5 million. The Park Service is also revising Director\u2019s  Order 7, which addresses volunteering, and Reference Manual 32, its  internal guidance on cooperating associations and is planning to  complete these revisions in late 2015. According to Park Service officials  involved with these revisions, the goal of these revisions is to emphasize  the importance of collaboration between Park Service and its partners.", "In addition, in January 2015 the Park Service temporarily waived three  parts of its policies to help with centennial fundraising efforts. First, Park  Service policy generally prohibits naming park assets as a form of donor  recognition. For example, buildings, vehicles, and park features are not to  bear donor names. Park Service waived this policy with regard to certain  donations for items including benches, bricks, motor vehicles, and rooms  in buildings\u2014although buildings themselves are still prohibited from  bearing donors\u2019 names. Second, Park Service policy generally prohibits  donor recognition from including corporate logos in park units. The Park  Service waived this policy to allow corporate logos to be included on  vehicles under certain conditions. Figure 8 provides an example of a  corporate logo displayed on a Park Service vehicle. Third, the Park  Service also issued a waiver allowing it to advertise with an alcohol  company. All three of these waivers will be effective until 2017, when  Park Service will reevaluate them to determine if they should remain in  place, according to a Park Service official.", "The Park Service has also sought to increase philanthropic donations by  encouraging the Foundation to expand and by helping friends groups  increase their fundraising capacity. Specifically, the Park Service  encouraged the Foundation to restructure and expand its staffing to better  align with the current philanthropic practices. Since 2008, the Foundation  has added 50 people and created three offices focused on corporate  giving, private giving, and marketing. According to Foundation officials,  the Foundation plans to continue increased fundraising efforts after the  centennial campaign.  With regard to friends groups, the Park Service has  begun training its own staff on ways in which they can collaborate more  effectively with nonprofit partners on their fundraising efforts. Park unit  officials we spoke with told us that they help friends groups with their  member outreach by attending fundraising events to describe the park\u2019s  needs to potential donors. In addition, park unit officials work with friends  groups to identify potential projects that need funds and that donors  would likely support. Park Service officials told us that improving the  fundraising capacity of friends groups is important since several new  friends groups have been started in the past 10 years, and many have not  yet developed fundraising skills.", "The Park Service has also taken steps to increase volunteerism.  Specifically, the Park Service allocated an additional $2 million in fiscal  year 2015 to pay for 70 new volunteer coordinators, known as Centennial  Volunteer Ambassadors.

One factor they cited is the  types of projects that need funding are not always attractive to donors.  For example, routine maintenance on buildings or sewer systems may be  less attractive to donors than large, visible projects, such as the  construction of a visitor center. In addition, the location of some parks can  limit their ability to obtain philanthropic support. For example, Park  Service officials in one regional office told us that some friends groups  have difficulty raising large sums of money because their parks are not  near urban areas with large pools of potential donors. Similarly, some  parks may not generate as much interest as larger, better known parks  and may struggle to attract donors. Another factor that Park Service  officials cited is some internal resistance to relying on outside funding  sources. For example, Park Service officials told us that some agency  employees have expressed concern about some efforts to increase  philanthropic donations\u2014particularly the recent temporary waiver on  partnering with corporations, which they view as commercializing the  parks.", "The Park Service also has limited capacity to manage volunteers.  According to Park Service officials, volunteers provide essential support  at many parks\u2014including helping with maintenance projects and  interpretative assistance\u2014but their efforts must be managed. In addition,  the number of people who want to volunteer at some parks outpaces the  availability of staff to manage them. Park Service officials explained that  some park units do not have dedicated volunteer coordinators and  instead assign these tasks as collateral duties due to budget constraints.

However, unlike the annual interagency pass,  FLREA does not permit Park Service or the other agencies that charge  recreation fees to increase the price of the senior pass.

We compared the laws and agency guidance and  memoranda, as well as GAO\u2019s design guide for federal user fees and  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, with  documentation associated with Park Service\u2019s efforts to increase  recreation fees. For commercial service fees, we analyzed Park Service  data on franchise fee rates, number of bidders, revenues of certain  commercial use authorization holders, and certain lease payments. For  philanthropic donations, we examined documents associated with Park  Service\u2019s centennial efforts.", "For all three objectives, we conducted interviews with Park Service  officials at the headquarters, region, and park unit levels. At the  headquarters level, we interviewed officials in the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s  Office, including those responsible for budgeting and overseeing the  recreation fee program; officials in the Office of Commercial Services that  are responsible for overseeing the commercial service program; officials  in the Office of Partnerships and Civic Engagement that oversee  relationships with friends groups; and officials in the Office of  Interpretation, Education, and Volunteers that oversee cooperating  associations and volunteers. At the regional level, we spoke with the  regional directors in all seven of Park Service\u2019s regional offices\u2014Alaska,  Intermountain, Midwest, National Capital, Northeast, Pacific West,  Southeast\u2014along with officials in these offices that help to manage the  recreation fee program, commercial services program, and relationships  with philanthropic partners. At the park unit level, we spoke with officials  that are involved in managing 31 park units. Specifically, we interviewed  officials at 23 park units in person and contacted officials from another 8  park units by phone and asked about their experiences with these funding  sources. Table 4 in appendix II lists the parks that we contacted as part  of our work. In selecting parks to contact, we included a range of parks,  that varied by certain characteristics, including number of visitors and  type (i.e., scenic vs. historical), and we interviewed officials from at least  one park unit in all seven of the Park Service\u2019s regions. We also spoke  with a variety of stakeholders, including concessioners and nonprofit  partners. We selected these stakeholders because of their affiliation with  parks in our review or because they would be able to provide other  perspectives on these revenue sources. For example, during some of our  site visits, we met with concessioners and partners that were working with  the park units we were visiting. The views from these interviews are not  generalizable to all parks, concessioners, and nonprofit partners, but they  were used to provide a range of perspectives on Park Service\u2019s efforts.  We also examined reports prepared in the last 10 years by Park Service  and stakeholder groups on recreation fees, commercial service fees, and  philanthropic donations.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to December  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Data on Selected National Park Units", "paragraphs": ["Table 4 provides information on the national park units that we contacted  as part of our work.
