The Congress has also recently considered legislation that would affect how intellectual property rights are administered. Some of these proposals would affect the organization and funding of PTO and the Copyright Office. In this regard, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to review various issues relating to intellectual property fees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In this country, the federal government is the primary regulator of intellectual property through the grant of patents and the registration of trademarks and copyrights. In this regard\u2014and because federal statutes and regulations provide various economic and procedural benefits concomitant with the grant or registration\u2014these three types of intellectual property are much alike. In other ways, however, they are different. Registering copyrights, for example, takes less time than granting patents or registering trademarks, yet copyrights generally have a much longer life. Trademarks have the shortest original term; however, they can be renewed indefinitely while patents and copyrights cannot. Patents for inventions never brought to market and copyrights for materials never published nevertheless are protected for their entire terms, while a trademark can be lost if it is not used.", "Similarly, the roles of the agencies regulating and administering intellectual property differ. Generally, PTO examines patent and trademark applications in great detail to ensure that others have not already applied for a patent on the invention or are not using the trademark in question. The Copyright Office essentially registers any materials that appear to be copyrightable and for which the application is complete. Unlike PTO, the Copyright Office generally does not determine whether some other person has a similar copyright or whether the materials are in the public domain. The differences in the complexities of the procedures followed by the agencies are mirrored by differences in the fees and related expenses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Patents", "paragraphs": ["A patent is a grant given by a government to an inventor of the right to exclude others for a limited time from making, using, or selling his or her invention. In the United States, the sole granting authority for patents is PTO. The patent process is totally funded through user fees. In fiscal year 1995, PTO issued 114,642 patents.", "PTO typically classifies patents as one of four types: \u2022 Over 90 percent of all patent applications are for \u201cutility\u201d patents for inventions that are either a process, machine, manufactured article, or composition of matter, or an improvement to one of these. A second type of patent is the \u201cplant\u201d patent\u2014constituting less than 1 percent of all applications\u2014which is granted for asexually propagated plants. Previously, utility and plant patents had a term of 17 years from the date the patents were issued. For those applications filed after June 7, 1995, however, utility and plant patents will have a nonrenewable term of 20 years from the date the earliest application is filed. \u2022 The third type of patent is the \u201cdesign\u201d patent, available for a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. In fiscal year 1995, design patent applications accounted for about 6.5 percent of all applications filed. Design patents have a nonrenewable term of 14 years from the date of issuance. \u2022 The fourth type of patent is the \u201creissue\u201d patent, which is granted as a replacement for a patent that was in some way defective. The reissue patent is granted for the unexpired term of the patent it replaced. Reissue patents typically account for less than 1 percent of all applications.", "Prior to issuing a patent, PTO examines the application to verify that the patent is indeed new, useful, and non-obvious. In this regard, PTO requires that every patent application include (1) a specification that describes the manner and process of making and using the invention as well as the claim or claims that make the invention patentable; (2) an oath or declaration that the applicant is the original inventor; (3) drawings, where necessary for understanding the nature of the invention; and (4) a filing fee. Additional fees may be necessary during examination, when the patent is issued, and during the term of the patent.", "Within PTO, the patent application examination process consists of several progressive phases. An applicant files a patent application with PTO, which reviews the application for accuracy and completeness during a preexamination phase. Following preexamination, the application is assigned, or \u201cdocketed,\u201d to an examiner within an examination group that has expertise in a specific field, such as computer systems or biotechnology.", "At this point, the examiner begins the process of determining whether the invention is a new and useful process or product that should receive a patent. Usually early in the process, the examiner makes a preliminary decision, or \u201cfirst action,\u201d which may be followed by contacts with the applicant to resolve questions and/or obtain additional information. If PTO decides to issue a patent, termed an \u201callowance,\u201d it informs the applicant and, upon the payment of the necessary fees, issues a patent. The application may be abandoned during any of these stages.", "The examination process can be lengthy. During fiscal year 1995, for example, the average \u201cpatent pendency\u201d\u2014the period from the date an application is filed until the date it is abandoned by the applicant or a patent is issued by PTO\u2014was 19.8 months. While not required, most inventors use the services of an attorney to help prepare the application and to assist them throughout the examination process, according to PTO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trademarks", "paragraphs": ["A trademark is a word, name, symbol, or design used to distinguish or identify the goods or services of a particular merchant or manufacturer from those of others. As with patents, the federal authority for registering trademarks in the United States is PTO, and the trademark process is funded through user fees. In fiscal year 1995, PTO issued 65,662 certificates of registration.", "Federal registration does not create a trademark because a trademark can only be acquired by actually using it in association with particular goods or services. However, federal registration does offer the registrant substantial procedural advantages should the trademark owner be faced with an infringement. Once registration has been obtained, the trademark must remain in substantially continuous use in order to be preserved. Trademark registrations have a term of 10 years but can be renewed indefinitely for additional 10-year terms.", "An applicant seeking to register a trademark must file an application accompanied by a fee, specimens of the trademark as it is actually used, a drawing of the mark, and various statements describing when the mark was first used and the types of goods and services on which it is used. Trademarks are categorized into various classes, such as toys or clothing, and, if registration for more than one class is sought, the applicant must pay an additional fee for each class.", "Once filed, the application is examined by an examining attorney within the Trademark Office of PTO. The attorney verifies that the trademark for which registration is sought is not \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to trademarks for other goods or services. If there is no such similarity and there are no other statutory bars to registration, PTO publishes the trademark and gives members of the public the right to oppose registration if they feel it is confusingly similar to another trademark, even if this other trademark is not already registered. If no problems are identified at this stage, the trademark is registered. Even then, however, it can be challenged at some later date if it is not used properly or if a prior user comes forward.", "The trademark process can also be lengthy. In fiscal year 1995, for example, PTO reported that the time between the filing of an application and the registration of the trademark averaged 16.4 to 16.7 months. While applicants may use attorneys in the application process, attorney involvement is not as extensive as with patents, according to PTO officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Copyrights", "paragraphs": ["A copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects literary and artistic expression as well as the media where these are displayed. Thus, copyrights are available for works such as books, periodicals, speeches, printed and recorded music, plays, computer software, paintings, sculpture, and motion pictures. Copyright registration in the United States is the exclusive province of the Copyright Office in the Library of Congress. In fiscal year 1995, the Copyright Office registered 609,195 copyrights.", "As with trademarks, a copyright is not gained through registration but rather when the work itself is created and reduced to some tangible form of expression. It is the expression of an idea that is copyrightable, not the idea itself. Registration does offer advantages, however, because the copyright owner has better evidence regarding the priority of the claim and is entitled to certain statutory benefits and damages upon infringement that would not otherwise be available. A copyright generally lasts for the (1) author\u2019s lifetime plus 50 years for personal works or (2) shorter of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation for works for hire, anonymous works, or pseudonymous works.", "The copyright registration process is simpler than for patents and trademarks. The copyright owner submits an application accompanied by a filing fee and one or two copies of the work, depending on the type. Most applicants, according to Copyright Office officials, do not use an attorney. The examination process is also relatively simple, taking an average of 38 to 83 days in fiscal year 1995 to complete, depending on the type of application. The examiner ensures the application is complete and accurate, that the materials appear to be copyrightable, that the fee is proper, and that the required copies are provided.

He asked that we address fees as they relate specifically to patents, trademarks, and copyrights and, where applicable, determine (1) how fees are set for the services provided by PTO and the Copyright Office, (2) the extent to which intellectual property fees are recovering the costs of the services provided, (3) whether different users of the same services pay different fees, (4) whether patent fees encourage or discourage the completeness and accuracy of applications, and (5) the potential effects of increasing copyright fees. We address these issues in chapters on patents, trademarks, and copyrights.", "In order to answer these interrelated questions, we determined that we would have to develop data and report on patents, trademarks, and copyrights separately because each has its own laws, application and examination procedures, and fee structure. In this regard, we obtained fee information on patents and trademarks from PTO and copyrights from the Copyright Office. This information included current fee schedules for each form of intellectual property as well as a summary of the fees actually received during fiscal year 1995, the most recent year for which such information was available. To the extent possible, we subdivided the fee receipts by fee type and computed the ratio of each fee type to total fees received.", "To determine how fees are set, we reviewed the statutory authority provided to PTO and the Copyright Office as well as the procedures these two agencies had developed for adjusting fees. We reviewed the legislative history for the statutory fees to determine the reasons for and timing of the various changes. We obtained information from the agencies showing the actual process and data used in the most recent fee adjustments considered.", "We also obtained certain workload information from PTO and the Copyright Office, showing the number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights issued or registered or for which the applications were abandoned or rejected during fiscal year 1995. This year was used because of the need for consistency with the fee receipt data discussed above and because in most cases it was the year for which the most recent data were available. In addition, we obtained information the agencies had developed showing the impact of fee increases on applications. For copyrights, we also performed a regression analysis to estimate the association between fee increases and changes in the number of applications while controlling for the influences of other factors that may affect application levels.", "We discussed the establishment of fees, fee history, the equity and fairness of fees by applicant and type of application, and the potential impact of adjusting fees with officials from PTO, the Copyright Office, and the intellectual property community. Where possible, we obtained comparable fee data for the Japanese Patent Office and the European Patent Office, the two other large patent offices in the world besides PTO.", "We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Commerce and the Library of Congress.

Changes to the law in 1990 and 1991 set patent fees at levels that would recover costs overall and authorized PTO to make annual adjustments for inflation. Despite the self-sufficiency of the patent process overall, however, individual fees are not necessarily commensurate with the costs of the services for which they are assessed. Again, this is by design because (1) the largest fees are paid at the back end of the process, while most costs occur at the front end of the process; (2) large and small entities generally are charged different fees for the same service; (3) costs vary by invention type, while fees do not; and (4) delays caused by the applicants generate more costs than fees.

Until recently, patent fees were not intended to cover the costs of PTO\u2019s patent process. In 1965, for example, patent and trademark fees were set at a level that recovered 67 percent of PTO\u2019s costs. By 1980, however, inflation had reduced the impact of these fees\u2014which had not been revised in the interim\u2014so that they recovered only 27 percent of PTO\u2019s operating costs.", "In 1980, the Congress revised the patent fee structure. Public Law 96-517, enacted December 12, 1980, provided that fees would be set to recover 50 percent of the costs of PTO\u2019s patent process. The law also provided that, like most other industrialized countries, patent fees would be paid not only for application filing and patent issuance but also for the life of most patents through fees known as maintenance fees.", "Public Law 97-247, enacted August 27, 1982, further modified the patent fee structure. In addition to raising fees, the law provided that filing, issue, and maintenance fees would be set by statute and could be adjusted every 3 years on the basis of fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The law also provided that large entities would pay statutory fees double the rate of small entities\u2014those entities classified as small businesses by the Small Business Administration (SBA), nonprofit organizations, and individual inventors. The purpose of this reduced fee for small entities was to reduce the impact of fee increases on the inventors most likely to be burdened by higher fees.", "Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5, 1990, put PTO on the road to self-sufficiency by increasing statutory patent fees by 69 percent in fiscal year 1991. This increase, known as a \u201csurcharge,\u201d was a replacement for appropriations from the general fund. Subsequently, the surcharge was extended through fiscal year 1998 and modified so that the amounts specified by statute are collected. Unlike regular fees, which are treated as offsetting collections for budget purposes and are fully available to PTO, the surcharge fees were to be treated as offsetting receipts and would be available to PTO only to the extent appropriated back by the Congress.", "Public Law 102-204, enacted December 10, 1991, authorized PTO to adjust patent fees annually to account for changes in the CPI. Since fiscal year 1993, PTO has been self-sufficient, receiving no appropriations other than those generated by the surcharges. Actually, PTO has not been allowed to use all the fees it has collected.

Fiscal year 1995 fee revenues totaled $577.7 million.

Table 2.1 summarizes fiscal year 1995 revenues by primary type of fee, and appendix II provides a detailed comparison of these revenues for the individual fees.", "Each applicant pays a filing fee prior to PTO\u2019s examination of the merits of the patent application. There are different filing fees for utility, design, plant, and reissue applications, just as there are different fees for large and small entities. In fiscal year 1995, utility patent applications were dominant, accounting for 89.8 percent of large entities\u2019 filing fees and 85.7 percent of small entities\u2019 filing fees. Overall, large entities paid $134 million, or 4.3 times the filing fees paid by small entities.", "Once PTO decides to allow the grant of a patent, the applicant must pay an issue fee in order to receive the patent. As with application fees, issue fees differ by the type of patent as well as by large and small entities. In fiscal year 1995, utility and reissue patents\u2014which are assessed the same issue fees\u2014accounted for 97.6 percent of all large entities\u2019 issue fees and 92.3 percent of all small entities\u2019 issue fees. In total, large entities paid $88.7 million, or 4.3 times the issue fees paid by small entities.", "Maintenance fees represent the largest single source of patent fee collections, accounting for more than a third of all patent fees collected during fiscal year 1995. The fees are paid at three stages during the life of the patent\u2014at 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years into the patent term\u2014with the fees at each stage being progressively higher.

All these fees are different for large and small entities. Other fees, such as those for filing a petition to the Commissioner, make no distinctions in the amount of the fee by the size of the entity.", "As noted previously, PTO now has discretion to raise most fees annually to adjust for inflation. PTO has raised fees each year except one since the surcharge was added in fiscal year 1991. Most of the discussion of fees in this chapter is based on fiscal year 1995 data, since this was the most recent year for which complete statistics on fees and patent examination statistics were available at the time of our review. Appendix III shows the fees in effect during fiscal year 1997.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Commerce noted that PTO\u2019s revenues from filing fees in fiscal year 1995 actually were a greater proportion of total revenues than is normally the case. This was due to the large number of applications submitted prior to the change in the patent term that became effective on June 8, 1995.

The Congress added the fee-differential provision in 1982 to reduce the effects of fee increases on small businesses, individual inventors, and nonprofit organizations. However, the differences today are much greater, now that PTO has become totally dependent on fees and the fees themselves are larger. In this regard: \u2022 PTO officials told us that the size of the entity has no bearing on PTO\u2019s costs. \u2022 For patent fee purposes, a small entity is a small business with no more than 500 employees, a nonprofit organization, or an individual inventor. The categorization of a small business as defined by the Congress is taken from the criteria SBA uses to determine whether a business qualifies as a small business for its programs. While this employee-based criteria may be useful for SBA, PTO officials said such a definition has little significance when considering the economic impact of fees on a patent applicant. In today\u2019s high-tech environment, many businesses that are highly capitalized and profitable have 500 or fewer employees. Similarly, some of the more successful applicants are individual inventors or work for small businesses. As one example, PTO officials noted that one of the most prolific U.S. inventors\u2014whose patents have returned him hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014is considered a small entity for patent fee purposes. \u2022 Patents are the only form of intellectual property for which the size of an entity has a bearing on the fees assessed. There is no such division of fees for either trademarks or copyrights. \u2022 The patent fees themselves are only a portion of the costs of receiving a patent. By definition, a patent represents a new and useful invention or process, and other costs are involved in researching, developing, producing, and marketing these inventions that typically are much greater than would be experienced in obtaining a trademark or copyright registration. In addition, in most cases, attorneys are involved in preparing, filing, and prosecuting the application. While attorneys\u2019 fees vary according to the circumstances, an intellectual property guide published by the Minnesota Small Business Assistance Office in 1992 estimated that attorneys\u2019 fees could range from $7,500 to $18,000 per application. \u2022 While patent fees have increased significantly since the surcharges were implemented in fiscal year 1992, inventor organizations generally did not believe they were too high or that they were stifling the inventive process. Furthermore, as shown in appendix IV, U.S. patent fees appear to be among the lowest in the industrialized world."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Application Complexity", "paragraphs": ["Patent applications cover a wide range of inventions, and the more complicated inventions generally require the most examination time.

Among the 17 individual examination groups, however, pendency ranged from a low of 17.4 months for solar, heat, power and fluid engineering devices to a high of 26.2 months for computer systems.", "Among the more specialized groupings within the examination groups, pendency can vary even more. For example, average pendency for the grouping of special receptacles, packages, shoes, and shoemaking was 15.8 months, compared with 29.6 months for the grouping of database and file management systems.", "While pendency alone is not the only determinant of costs, PTO officials agreed that the more complicated the invention, the more time and expense are attributable to examination. However, the fee schedule makes few provisions for these differences in examination time. One such provision is that, as shown in appendixes II and III, fees for design and plant applications\u2014which tend to be less complicated\u2014are lower than for utility patent applications.

The first such adjustment was to be effective in 1995. In March 1994, an internal Copyright Office task force recommended that basic registration fees not be increased, and the Acting Register of Copyrights at the time followed this recommendation.

Second, the revised fees would have formed the basis for any fee adjustments for inflation in the future.", "Third, while there may be administrative costs associated with publicizing fee increases, processing claims accompanied by insufficient remittances, and modifying paperwork and automation systems to reflect fee increases, the task force did not study ways that these costs and difficulties might be mitigated. For example, Copyright Office officials could not explain why they would have to take elaborate measures to publicize the fee increase and to reprint all publications. They said they did not consider as an option simply rejecting any application with an insufficient fee, nor did they consider listing a toll-free number or Internet address on the application where an applicant could obtain information on the appropriate fee, rather than listing the fee itself.", "We also do not agree with the task force\u2019s concern that an \u201codd fee\u201d would be difficult for the applicants or the Copyright Office staff to understand and use. Apparently, the concern is that the $20 fee is easy for applicants to remember and easy for Copyright Office employees to work with to ensure that the proper amounts are paid. However, fees of amounts other than in increments of $5 or $10 are common in commerce and government operations. For example, the applicant must pay postage in dollars and cents on each package he or she submits to the Copyright Office. In addition, millions of taxpayers and Internal Revenue Service employees work with many different rates and fees each year in computing income taxes.

As evidence, the report stated that, when the registration fees were doubled in January 1991, applications decreased 3.3 percent from the 1990 level after they had risen an average of 4.1 percent per year for the 8 years prior to the fee increase.", "The Register of Copyrights also raised concerns about the effect of a fee increase on applications during her September 18, 1996, testimony on S. 1961. She said that reorganizing the Copyright Office into a self-sustaining entity outside of the Library of Congress could mark the end of a vital and meaningful registration and deposit system. She reasoned that historical experience has shown that registrations decrease whenever fees are increased. Because the fee increase would likely be the largest such increase on record, the Copyright Office anticipated that many individual copyright owners would choose not to register their works and that businesses would register fewer works. This would result in a diminished and less valuable public database on works of authorship, making it more difficult for users to determine who owns what rights at a particular time. In addition, there would be a decrease in Library-deposit copies of works received through copyright registrations.", "In examining the support for the Register of Copyright\u2019s concerns over decreasing registrations, we again looked at the Copyright Office\u2019s preliminary analysis supporting the projected fivefold increase in fees. We found that this scenario was based on estimates that registrations would decrease 30 percent in the first year after the fee increase and an additional 15 percent in the second year.", "As with the estimates on cost increases, these estimates of registration decreases are questionable for various reasons. For example, decreases of the magnitude projected have never occurred in the more than 100 years for which the Copyright Office has data. As shown in figure 4.2, it is common for copyright registrations to decrease in the years following a fee increase. However, the decrease has usually been small, and registrations have tended to rebound in subsequent years.", "We also question the Copyright Office\u2019s projections because, while they consider only the overall impact on registrations, Copyright Office officials agree that some types of registrations are more likely to be affected than others. Following the 1991 fee increase, for example, applications for registration decreased significantly for some types of works but remained stable for others. Applications for performing arts decreased about 14 percent from fiscal years 1990 to 1992, while applications for visual arts and motion pictures increased by about 1 percent during the same period. In addition, the number of copyright registrations for unpublished works decreased by about 10 percent over the period, while the number of registrations for published works declined by about 3 percent.", "The Copyright Office\u2019s projections also do not consider the effect on registrations of changes in internal reporting procedures and other legislative changes that accompanied past fee increases. We found that these other factors can affect the number of applications received and registered. For example, when the registration fee was increased from $6 to $10 in fiscal year 1978, Copyright Office records show about a 27-percent reduction in the number of copyright registrations from the previous year. However, Copyright Office officials told us that they reported only 11 months of registrations for fiscal year 1978 rather than a full 12 months.", "Similarly, after the registration fee was increased to $20 on January 1, 1991, the number of applications for copyright registration decreased by about 3 percent in fiscal year 1991 and an additional 5 percent in fiscal year 1992. However, the fee increase was not the only change affecting applications. For example, the Copyright Office initiated group registration for serial issues during mid-1991. In doing so, all issues of a weekly, biweekly or monthly serial published within a 3-month period could be registered on one application at a fee of $10 per issue. According to Copyright Office officials, this reduced the number of serial registrations by an unknown amount. In addition, renewal of copyrights became automatic beginning in 1992. This accounted largely for the substantial and steady drop in renewal registrations beginning that year. While registration applications overall decreased by almost 10 percent from fiscal years 1990 to 1995, applications for these categories decreased by about 34 percent and 39 percent, respectively.", "Because there may be other, external issues\u2014such as the onset of a recession in 1991\u2014that could have affected applications beyond changes in copyright fees, we developed a model that allowed us to examine the association between fee changes and the number of applications while controlling for the effects of other factors. As discussed in appendix XI, we found that the association between fee increases and application decreases is likely to be small\u2014about a 0.1-percent decrease in applications for a 1-percent increase in fees. However, a regression model of this type is best at estimating such associations for relatively small changes in explanatory factors. We also found that there may be an even greater correlation between applications and the level of economic activity, as measured by the Gross Domestic Product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fee Increases Should Not Affect Library Collections", "paragraphs": ["We also question whether there would be any harmful results to the government even if copyright applications did decrease in reaction to a fee increase. The economic benefits of copyright registration primarily are those that pass to the copyright holder. In fact, the United States is one of the few countries in the world that even has a government agency registering copyrights. The primary advantage of registration in this country is that it provides official evidence of the copyright and provides statutory damages against infringement. Thus, if a person decides not to register a copyright, that person assumes the risk of loss.", "According to the testimony of the Register of Copyrights in the Senate hearing on S. 1961, one of the Copyright Office\u2019s primary concerns regarding a decrease in copyright registrations is that such a decrease might limit the works available at no cost for the collections of the Library of Congress. However, because of other provisions in existing legislation, a decline in registrations should have no significant impact. Section 407 of the Copyright Act requires that all material under copyright protection and published in the United States on or after March 1, 1989, be deposited with the Copyright Office within 3 months of publication. These deposits are available to the Library of Congress for its collections or for exchange or transfer to another library. Thus, published documents must be submitted to the Copyright Office and made available for the Library\u2019s collections even if copyright registration is not sought. If documents are not submitted as required by law, the Register of Copyrights can demand that the deposits be made and subject those not complying to fines and penalties.", "Although section 407 does not apply to unpublished material, the Library of Congress seldom selects unpublished material for its collections, with the exception of genealogy studies. According to Copyright Office officials, the Library of Congress selected less than 100 of the approximately 254,000 unpublished documents that were registered in fiscal year 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Copyright Office Officials Now Agree That the Copyright Process Could Be Self-Sustaining Within the Library", "paragraphs": ["In March 1997, the Register of Copyrights told us that she supports the concept of making the copyright process self-sustaining within the Library. She said that the fivefold increase in fees cited in the Senate hearing in September 1996 was indeed a worst-case scenario. However, she had presented this scenario because she viewed the proposal being considered at that time as entailing the separation of the Copyright Office from the Library of Congress. She believed that such a move would create uncertainties, such as whether new space would have to be obtained, whether a new computer system would have to be purchased, and how other services the Library and the Copyright Office now provide for each other at no charge would be provided in the future. Thus, the Register believed that it was necessary to show the potential fee increases that might be required under the most costly circumstances.", "The Register of Copyrights said that, in retrospect, she recognizes that the costs and fee increases associated with self-sufficiency would be lower than those presented at the September hearing, particularly if the Copyright Office is left in the Library of Congress, as is now being proposed. While the Copyright Office does not have a current estimate on what would be required to make it self-sustaining, the Register said that any fee increase would at a minimum have to replace the approximately $10 million the Copyright Office now receives in appropriations each year. She believed this would probably require fees that are about twice the current level.", "In subsequent discussions on a draft of this report, the Register said that she had not intended to say that she believed the Copyright Office itself should be self-sustaining. Rather, she believed that it should charge fees for services that reflect the costs of those services to the Copyright Office. She said that certain costs\u2014such as those of the Copyright Acquisitions Division\u2014were not directly related to the copyright process; thus, they should not be paid for by registrants but are more appropriately covered through appropriations.", "The Register also said in our March 1997 discussion that, if the copyright process is to be made self-sustaining though fees, these fees should be commensurate with the services provided. As we have previously noted, the costs of individual services vary widely, while most users of these services pay the same fee. In addition, the Copyright Office and the Library now provide services to each other that are not necessarily related to their primary missions and for which they are not reimbursed. For example, the Library provides numerous computer services to the Copyright Office at no charge, while the Copyright Office obtains works that were requested by the Library for its collections but not available through the copyright registration process, also at no charge. The Register believed that the fee study now being planned by the Copyright Office will address this issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Studies Support a Fee Increase", "paragraphs": ["Other recent studies of the Copyright Office support the need for a fee increase. In a 1996 report on the results of a management review of the Library of Congress contracted by GAO, Booz-Allen & Hamilton recommended that the Library of Congress focus its efforts on increasing revenues. As one means for doing so, the report recommended that the Library pursue full recovery of copyright costs. The report stated that fully recovering copyright registration costs offers significant opportunities, both in terms of additional revenues and the relative ease of implementation. It further stated that the Copyright Office meets two key criteria for pursuing a fee-based service. First, there are opportunities for significant revenues. Second, the Copyright Office has been subject to full cost recovery in the past, so a precedent has been established. To accomplish full cost recovery, the report recommended that the Copyright Office establish a differentiated fee structure based on the cost of the services provided. According to the study, to achieve full cost recovery, proposed registration fees would range from a low of $10 for group serials to a high of $38 to $420 for mask works.", "In October 1996, an internal management report of the Copyright Office prepared by a senior Library of Congress official at the request of the Librarian recommended that the Copyright Office recover relevant fees for services. However, the report also recommended that the Congress continue appropriating funds for activities, such as \u201cservice to the Congress,\u201d that are not associated with registration services and that the Library of Congress continue to provide its support to the Copyright Office in exchange for the value of the copyright deposits made available to the Library\u2019s collections. Unlike the Booz-Allen report, the Library of Congress recommended establishing either a single fee for all copyright registrations or a separate fee only for visual arts works based on the costs of these works. If the fee difference for visual arts is less than $5 per registration, however, the report recommended establishing only a single fee. While the Library of Congress\u2019s report concluded that a $35 registration fee would bring fees and costs into balance the first year, it also concluded that a $40 registration fee is desirable to account for the effects of inflation in subsequent years.", "Although the Library of Congress\u2019s report recognized that a fee increase may harm the Library\u2019s collections through reduced applications, it stated that any decline in registrations would likely occur primarily in unpublished works and in relatively low-value published works. It acknowledged that the demand provisions of section 407 of the Copyright Act would still apply to published works and that more works might come from that source than from applications for copyright registrations.", "Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) noted that the fee structure of the Copyright Office could be revised to generate more revenue and reduce the need for appropriations. In its March 1997 publication entitled Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options, CBO offered the option of requiring the Copyright Office to achieve full cost recovery as a deficit-reduction measure. According to the report, achieving full cost recovery would require that the copyright registration fee be increased to about $35 or $40 per application.", "The CBO estimate of what would be required to make the Copyright Office self-sufficient is similar to that advanced by the Register of Copyrights\u2014about double the current level. On the basis of our regression analysis, we believe that the decrease in applications from doubling the fees would be about 10 percent in the year following the fee increase. However, as noted earlier, models such as the one we developed tend not to be as highly predictive at such a high level of increase.", "In discussions we had with intellectual property organizations, they either opposed or had no opinion regarding any fee increase for copyrights.

Copyright Office officials told us that they estimate this term to average 125 years. In contrast, the law requires that published materials that are not selected by the Library of Congress be retained for the longest period considered practicable and desirable by the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress. The Register and the Librarian have set the period at 5 years for all works except visual arts, which are kept for 10 years. If a copyright owner wants to extend the retention period for a published work to cover storage costs for the full length of the copyright term, the Copyright Office assesses a $270 fee.", "As a result of the requirement in the law, millions of unpublished works could be stored for up to 125 years at taxpayer expense, while few published works will be stored longer than 5 years. Copyright Office officials told us that in some cases\u2014as with audio tapes, for example\u2014the copy is usually of no use after a few years because of the natural deterioration of the medium. They also said that they are rarely called upon to extract copies of unpublished works from storage, either by the Library of Congress or by the holder of the copyright.", "As a result of the difference in the retention requirements, published works consume far less storage space than unpublished works, even though published works represent the majority of items that are registered by the Copyright Office each year. Approximately 3.3 million unpublished works were placed in storage at either the Landover Storage Facility or the Washington National Records Center between 1978 and the end of fiscal year 1996. In addition to this material, other unpublished works have been microfilmed and are currently stored at the Copyright Office itself. In contrast, as of December 1996, only an estimated 1.8 million published works were in storage at the two facilities, and most of these were still within the statutory 5-year retention period. From fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 1995, the Copyright Office received only 85 requests for extended storage for published works.", "The annual cost of the space utilized by the Copyright Office at its Landover Storage Facility is $230,000 and is paid for by the Library of Congress. The space utilized by the Copyright Office at the Washington National Records Center is owned by the General Services Administration and leased to the National Archives. Although neither the Copyright Office nor the Library of Congress pays for this storage space, it is a cost of the copyright process and a cost to the government. National Archives officials estimated the fiscal year 1996 costs to be $1.56 per cubic foot. Given the number of cubic feet being utilized by the Copyright Office, the fiscal year 1996 cost was approximately $97,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Unlike PTO, the Copyright Office is not self-sustaining through fees, and the government provides about $10 million in appropriations each year to cover the costs not recovered by copyright fees or reimbursements from royalties.

Thus, most fees remain at the level they were in 1991. Copyright Office officials have supported the need for a fee increase that will match fees to the costs of services more closely and are planning a study to show what type of fee structure may be needed.", "In September 1996, the Copyright Office objected to a proposal that it become self-sustaining within a new, government-owned, intellectual property corporation because of fears that the increased costs would lead to a burdensome increase in fees, a dramatic decrease in registrations, and a reduction in free materials available for the Library of Congress\u2019s collections. These concerns are not supported by the Copyright Office\u2019s own study used for the testimony. In March 1997, the Register of Copyrights agreed that the fivefold increase in fees she had projected was a worst-case scenario and was based on the uncertainties the Copyright Office would face if removed from the Library of Congress.
