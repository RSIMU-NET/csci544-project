During the cold war the nation designed, tested, and produced new  nuclear weapons. Since the end of the cold war, however, some of the  infrastructure supporting the nuclear security enterprise has aged and  deteriorated, and the approach has shifted toward reducing the nuclear  weapons stockpile, and maintaining certain weapons indefinitely by  extending their operational lives, without nuclear testing. This approach  requires not only refurbishing existing weapons, but also replacing or  renovating research, development, and production facilities that date back  to the 1940s and 1950s; performing simulations and laboratory  experiments to ensure existing nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable;  and recruiting and training personnel with the specialized skills to sustain  the nuclear weapons program and maintain the stockpile into the future.  The Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA) is charged with ensuring a safe, secure, and  reliable nuclear deterrent; achieving designated reductions in the nuclear  weapons stockpile; and supporting the nation\u2019s nuclear nonproliferation  efforts. NNSA is responsible for activities in pursuit of these missions,  which are largely executed at eight government-owned, contractor- operated sites that comprise the nuclear security enterprise.", "As the United States reduces its nuclear weapons stockpile, the  administration has pledged additional funds to modernize and operate the  nuclear security enterprise, including refurbishment of weapons currently  in the stockpile and construction of replacement research and production  facilities to support these refurbishments. This increased investment in  the nuclear security enterprise is intended to ensure that scientific,  technical, and engineering capabilities are sufficiently supported such that  a smaller nuclear deterrent continues to be safe, secure, and reliable. But  NNSA, like all other federal agencies, is being asked to find ways to  operate more efficiently and reduce its costs. In November 2011, the  President issued Executive Order no. 13589, which stressed agencies  should act in a fiscally responsible manner, including minimizing agency  costs, in order to perform mission-critical functions in the most cost- effective way. Also, as we reported in December 2013, NNSA\u2019s 2014  future budget estimates incorporated about $24 billion in cost savings to  be achieved through management efficiencies and workforce prioritization  savings through 2038, including $320 million in 2014. NNSA officials said  the Office of Management and Budget directed NNSA to include cost  savings in its future budget estimates so that the overall estimate could  be reduced. Our December 2013 report also noted that NNSA  incorporated these cost savings into its budget estimates before  assessing how it could achieve the savings, which may affect whether the  estimates accurately reflect the amounts NNSA may request in the future.  Our report recommended that NNSA include a range of budget estimates  for preliminary projects and programs in future modernization plans.  NNSA generally concurred with our recommendation.", "See, for example, GAO, Nuclear Weapons: Factors Leading to Cost Increases with the  Uranium Processing Facility, GAO-13-686R, (Washington, D.C.: July 12, 2013) and  Department of Energy: Observations on Project and Program Cost Estimating in NNSA  and the Office of Environmental Management, GAO-14-510T (Washington, D.C.: May 8,  2013). money-saving alternatives from consideration.recommended, among other things, that NNSA ensure that future cost  analyses consider the full useful life of the facility, revise the Kansas City  Plant relocation schedule to be consistent with DOE guidance and GAO- identified best practices, and develop a risk-based approach for  managing technologies that could advance adversaries\u2019 nuclear  capabilities.
