Some private sector companies continue to be awarded contracts every year even though they violate federal laws intended to protect worker health and safety. Senator Simon has proposed legislation that would restrict companies that violate the Occupational Safety and Health Act from receiving federal contracts. Another proposal, introduced by Senator Kennedy, would reward companies for responsible behaviors. This proposal would reduce taxes and offer preferences in government contracts to companies for providing training opportunities to their workers and taking other actions that promote workers\u2019 economic security.", "Given your interest in the safety and health practices of federal contractors, you asked us to determine how many companies receiving federal contracts have also been assessed penalties for violations of occupational safety and health regulations, describe the characteristics of these contractors and their contracts, describe the kinds of violations for which these contractors were cited, and identify ways to improve contractor compliance with workplace safety and health requirements.", "To identify federal contractors assessed penalties for safety and health violations, we matched violation data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) automated database of inspection results with a database of federal contractors maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA). We restricted our analysis to those OSHA inspections that were closed in fiscal year 1994 in which the proposed penalty assessed by the OSHA compliance officer was what we defined as significant, regardless of the amount of the actual penalty recorded when the inspection was closed. We used proposed penalties when selecting inspections because they are based on the compliance officer\u2019s judgment of the nature and severity of violations, while actual penalties may be the product of other factors such as negotiations between OSHA and the company to encourage quicker abatement of workplace hazards. We considered the proposed penalty assessed by the compliance officer to have been significant if it was $15,000 or more. We verified by telephone that the company listed in the OSHA database of inspections was the same company (or owned by the same parent company) listed in the federal contractor database.", "We obtained information about the federal contracts and safety and health violations from the respective GSA and OSHA databases. We analyzed the GSA database for the dollar value of fiscal year 1994 contracts received by the violator or its parent company and the federal agencies that awarded those contracts. Data limitations prevented us from determining whether a company\u2019s contract activity occurred at the same worksite where the company was cited for safety and health violations. We analyzed the OSHA database for characteristics of the violations and the worksites inspected. Although we verified the link between the two databases, we did not verify the data in either one.", "To explore ways to improve the compliance of federal contractors with safety and health regulations, we met with compliance staff at OSHA and with federal contracting officials at GSA and other agency experts in procurement. We did our work from July 1995 to July 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. (See app. I for a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Private sector companies receive billions of dollars annually in federal government contracts for goods and services. Data from GSA show that federal contracts valued at $25,000 or more totaled almost $176 billion in fiscal year 1994. Approximately 22 percent of the labor force, 26 million workers, is employed by companies with federal contracts and subcontracts, according to fiscal year 1993 estimates of the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).", "Federal law and an executive order place greater responsibilities on federal contractors compared with other employers in some areas of workplace activity. For example, federal contractors must comply with Executive Order 11246, which requires a contractor to develop an affirmative action program detailing the steps that the contractor will take and has already taken to ensure equal employment opportunity for all workers, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In addition, the Service Contract Act and the Davis-Bacon Act require the payment of area-prevailing wages and benefits on federal contracts in the service and construction industries, respectively. Recently, the administration issued an executive order that would bar federal contractors from receiving contracts if they hire permanent replacements for striking workers and another executive order that would bar contractors for hiring illegal immigrants. Additionally, under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, Labor may debar contractors in the construction industry for \u201crepeated willful or grossly negligent\u201d violations of safety and health standards issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.", "Under federal procurement regulations, agencies may deny an award of a contract or debar or suspend a contractor for a variety of reasons, including failure to comply with safety and health standards. Before awarding a contract, an agency must make a positive finding that the bidder is responsible as defined in federal procurement regulations. Also, federal agencies can debar or suspend companies for any \u201ccause of so serious or compelling a nature that it affects the present responsibility of a Government contractor or subcontractor.\u201d Debarred companies are not allowed to receive federal contracts (or other forms of federal financial assistance, such as grants and loans) for a period of time, generally not to exceed 3 years. Suspended companies are temporarily disqualified from receiving federal contracts or other forms of federal financial assistance. In determining whether a federal contractor is responsible, agency awarding and debarring officials could consider compliance with safety and health standards.", "To help foster consistency among agency regulations concerning debarment and suspension, Executive Order 12549, issued in February 1986, established the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, which consists of agency representatives designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This committee meets monthly and provides the opportunity for agency representatives (primarily debarring officials) to share information about companies that they are either trying to debar or suspend or to bring into compliance with various laws and regulations in order to avoid having to take an adverse contracting action. At its monthly meetings, the committee also helps interpret regulations on debarment or suspension issued by OMB. When more than one agency has an interest in a particular federal contractor, the Interagency Committee coordinates the assignment of lead agency responsibility for any actions taken against that contractor.", "GSA maintains the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) that tracks firms awarded contracts of $25,000 or more in federal funding for products and services. For fiscal year 1994, FPDS tracked information on 179,977 contracts totaling almost $176 billion. Although it is difficult to estimate the number of federal contractors, GSA reports there may be 60,000 federal contractors in that there are as many unique corporate identification codes in FPDS. FPDS contains a variety of information, including the contractor\u2019s name and location, agency the contract is with, principal place of contract performance, and contract dollar amounts awarded. FPDS does not contain information on contractors\u2019 safety and health practices.", "Most private sector firms\u2014regardless of whether they are federal contractors\u2014must comply with safety and health standards issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The act was meant \u201cto assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women.\u201d The Secretary of Labor established OSHA in 1970 to carry out a number of responsibilities under the act, including developing and enforcing safety and health standards, educating workers and employers about workplace hazards, and establishing responsibilities and rights for both employers and employees for the achievement of better safety and health conditions.Even though OSHA has been in existence for 25 years, work-related illness and injury remain a substantial problem. A total of 6,588 workplace fatalities\u2014on average, 18 fatalities a day\u2014were reported to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1994, a 4-percent increase over 1993. In addition, a total of 6.8 million injuries and illnesses were reported in 1994.", "OSHA cites employers for violations of standards covering a variety of threats to workplace safety and health. Safety standards include those designed to protect against workers falling from stairs or scaffolds (walking-working surfaces); from injuries due to inadequate machine guarding (machine guarding); and from electrical hazards (electrical). Some standards (for example, excavations, underground construction, and steel erection) protect against construction-related injuries. Health standards protect against exposure to toxic substances such as lead, asbestos, and bloodborne pathogens (referring to occupational exposures to blood). There are also more generic informational standards relating to the recording and reporting of occupational injuries and illnesses and for informing employees about chemical hazards in the workplace. OSHA may also cite employers for hazards not covered by any standard under Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, referred to as the General Duty Clause. This clause requires that employers furnish employees a place of work \u201cfree from recognized hazards.\u201d OSHA has relied on the General Duty Clause, for example, to regulate employee exposure to tuberculosis in the health care industry. OSHA has also relied on the General Duty Clause to penalize companies for ergonomic hazards such as cumulative trauma disorders, including lower back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and tendinitis.", "OSHA characterizes violations as other-than-serious, serious, willful, or repeat, with civil penalties in specified increasing amounts for these various types of violations. In addition, OSHA designates violations as unclassified when companies make significant concessions to OSHA, perhaps to avoid losing coverage under state workers\u2019 compensation programs or to minimize adverse publicity attached to violations as originally classified. Additional penalties can be assessed either when a company fails to abate a hazard or under OSHA\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d policy. Failure to abate or correct a prior violation may bring an additional civil penalty for each day that the violation continues beyond the prescribed abatement date. Under OSHA\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d policy, an employer is cited for each instance of a particular violation\u2014or for each worker exposed to a hazard. Since initiated in 1986, this policy has resulted in penalties for some inspections running into the millions of dollars. Although inspections in which a company is cited in this fashion are not common, the number of these inspections doubled from 8 in fiscal year 1994 to 17 in fiscal year 1995.", "OSHA is authorized to conduct workplace inspections to determine whether employers are complying with safety and health standards, and to issue citations and assess penalties when an employer is not in compliance. The proposed penalty reflects an OSHA compliance officer\u2019s judgment of the nature and severity of violations. However, these proposed penalties are often reduced. OSHA justifies such reductions as a means to get employers to abate workplace problems quickly by avoiding the contesting of citations. If employers contest citations or proposed penalties, they do not have to abate the cited hazard until the case is resolved, thereby leaving workers unprotected. If cited for violations during an inspection, an employer has 15 working days to either (1) accept the citation, abate the hazards, and pay the penalties; (2) have an informal conference with local OSHA officials and negotiate an informal settlement agreement; or (3) formally contest the citation before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC). After reviewing a contested citation, OSHRC may affirm, vacate, or modify OSHA\u2019s citations and proposed penalties. Once the inspection is closed (either because the employer accepted the citation or a contested citation was resolved), the penalty is referred to as the actual penalty.", "OSHA targets a portion of its inspection resources toward facilities that may be more hazardous to employees. OSHA has recently taken steps to revise its inspection targeting priorities, in which employers in a certain industry are currently treated alike regardless of their individual safety and health performance. By integrating worksite-specific information, including excessive rates of workplace injury and illness and a record of serious and repeat violations, into its targeting procedures, OSHA hopes to enhance the effectiveness of its enforcement system.", "OSHA maintains a database that tracks all OSHA inspections. The Integrated Management Information Systems (IMIS) database includes over 2 million inspections from 1972 to 1995, with 72,950 closed inspections in 1994 alone in which the employer was cited for at least one violation. IMIS includes such information as whether the inspections were performed by OSHA or a state-operated program, penalty amounts (proposed and actual), the type of violation (for example, serious, willful, or repeat), the standards violated, whether fatalities or injuries occurred, and abatement information. In addition, IMIS includes some data on the worksite inspected, including the type of industry it is engaged in and the number of workers employed.

Over one-third of the 261 federal contractors assessed significant proposed penalties for OSHA violations received less than $1 million each. Nearly 5 percent received more than $500 million each in federal contracts in fiscal year 1994. These 12 companies were General Electric Co. ($8.7 billion); Lockheed-Martin Corp.

Within the Department of Defense, the Air Force and the Navy awarded by far the most contract dollars to violators ($11.8 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively). In addition to the Department of Defense, large amounts of contract dollars were awarded to violators by the Department of Energy ($5.8 billion) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ($1.2 billion). Other agencies that awarded more than $100 million in contracts to violators include the Department of Agriculture ($382 million), Department of Transportation ($365 million), GSA ($274 million), Department of Justice ($242 million), and the Tennessee Valley Authority ($113 million).

An examination of the violators\u2019 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes shows that many of these worksites manufactured paper, food, or primary and fabricated metals. Although manufacturing is the industry in which most violators were engaged, a significant percentage of worksites (18 percent) were engaged in construction, and this is likely an underestimate because of the difficulties we experienced verifying that worksites inspected in that industry were part of the same company as the federal contractor. (See fig. 3.) (Difficulties we encountered verifying construction worksites are explained in app. I.)", "Many (68 percent) of the worksites where the violations occurred were relatively small, employing 500 or fewer workers. Just over 15 percent of the worksites were very small, employing 25 or fewer workers. (See fig. 4.) Although few worksites employed large numbers of workers, the federal contractors that own these worksites often employ large numbers of workers and have numerous worksites throughout the country. Examples of these include Boise Cascade Corp.; General Motors Corp.; Georgia-Pacific Corp.; International Paper Co.; Sears Roebuck & Co.; and the United Parcel Service Amer., Inc. (UPS). Some of these federal contractors do billions of dollars in annual sales and employ hundreds of thousands of workers. For example, UPS employs 285,000 workers altogether, although most of the 24 worksites inspected employed fewer than 1,000 workers. One UPS worksite, located in Twin Mountain, New Hampshire, employed only 40 workers.", "We were unable to determine whether a company\u2019s contract activity occurred at the same worksite where the company was cited for safety and health violations. Data on the place of contract performance were not specific enough to enable us to confirm whether or not the locations were the same as where the OSHA inspections were conducted. It would have been difficult to get companies to confirm whether or not they conducted federal contract work at the particular worksite where the violations occurred. This information might not be readily available or considered confidential or proprietary. Finally, because the nature of some contract work is so dispersed, with contract activity of some form occurring across multiple worksites, it can be difficult for even the company to verify exactly what activities at various worksites were supported by federal contracts.

In only one inspection was a federal contractor assessed additional penalties for failing to abate a hazard; that is, the company failed to correct the same violation for which it was cited in a prior inspection. However, these relatively low rates of citations for repeat violations and penalties for failing to abate hazards may be a reflection of OSHA\u2019s limited resources to return to worksites it has inspected in the past. Only about 1 percent of all fiscal year 1994 inspections were follow-up or monitoring inspections. In addition, OSHA does not currently penalize employers for failing to provide proof that the company has abated the hazard. As a result, OSHA has only the employer\u2019s statement that abatement has taken place unless a follow-up or monitoring inspection is performed.", "Examples of federal contractors cited for serious, willful, or repeat violations or assessed additional penalties under OSHA\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d policy or for failing to abate hazards follow:", "Bath Iron Works Corp. and Boise Cascade Corp. were the only contractors assessed penalties under OSHA\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d policy.

Aside from the inherent interest of federal agencies in finding or keeping the contractor who is either the lowest bidder or has a history of providing these goods and services to the agency, awarding and debarring officials rarely exercise this authority in part because they lack information as to which contractors are OSHA violators. GSA officials, including members of the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, which monitors the implementation of debarment and suspension procedures, told us that agency awarding and debarring staff do not routinely receive information about contractors who have violated OSHA regulations. GSA officials also said safety and health information was not routinely collected by agency contract officers when they conduct their pre-award survey to determine whether or not a prospective contractor is responsible.", "Members of the Interagency Committee told us that the prospect of being debarred or suspended can provide an impetus for a contractor to undertake remedial measures to improve workplace safety and health conditions. Agency debarment and suspension staff could work with the contractors, perhaps with technical support provided by OSHA, to help bring a contractor into compliance, thereby avoiding disruption to the contracting arrangement. GSA officials and Interagency Committee members stressed the importance of maintaining agency discretion in contracting decisions and urged that debarment or suspension for safety and health violations not be mandated.", "Although our analysis did not include companies receiving other forms of federal financial assistance, such as grants and loans, GSA officials and Interagency Committee members said that safety and health violations should also be considered in debarment or suspension decisions for these companies since these forms of assistance total to large amounts of federal dollars. Federal assistance in the form of grants alone accounted for $225 billion in fiscal year 1995. State and local governments, through which federal grants are distributed, may contract with companies to carry out a wide range of work, including welfare and health care services as well as highway, airport, mass transit, and sewage treatment plant construction. GSA officials and Interagency Committee members said that workers employed by these companies should also be protected from workplace safety and health hazards. However, as is the case with direct federal contracts, agency officials often lack information as to which companies receiving these other forms of federal financial assistance also have OSHA violations.", "Under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA), OSHA also has authority to debar companies specifically for safety and health violations. However, OSHA has not exercised this authority in the past and it appears unlikely that it will increase its exercise of this authority in the future. Although agency officials said they consider debarment when particularly serious violations are committed by a company they can identify as a federal contractor, they prefer to rely on remedies available under the Occupational Safety and Health Act because litigation costs are lower and they can obtain quicker abatement of the hazard.", "Information can be made available to increase the likelihood that agency officials will make decisions regarding contracts and other forms of federal financial assistance that might improve contractor compliance with OSHA regulations. However, policies and procedures regarding the exchange of information between OSHA and contracting agencies need to be developed. In developing these policies and procedures, a number of issues would need to be resolved. These include the following: Identifying the inspection information regarding violations that OSHA could provide that would facilitate action by agency awarding and debarring officials. Given the large number of federal contractors violating OSHA regulations, there is a danger that excessive or irrelevant information would be generated and transmitted, resulting in a potential administrative burden on both OSHA and awarding and debarring officials within the agencies. OSHA could avoid this problem by developing criteria identifying those federal contractors with exceptionally poor safety and health records and transmitting information only on those companies to awarding and debarring officials. OSHA and the contracting agencies would also have to decide the type and level of detail of information that should be provided regarding these violators and the nature of their violations.", "Developing the logistics of how OSHA, GSA, the Interagency Committee, and agency awarding and debarring officials could share information. Whether violation information should be provided immediately after any inspection of a contractor in which exceptionally poor safety and health practices are indicated or whether it should be provided at regular intervals for all companies that meet these criteria based on their inspections over a certain period of time needs to be determined. OSHA might choose to work with GSA to determine which of its violators are federal contractors or it may consider leaving this determination to the Interagency Committee or awarding and debarring officials within the agencies. OSHA might also provide information on violators directly to individual agencies with whom the violators contract. Another alternative would be to have either GSA or the Interagency Committee, depending on their relative level of resources, act as a clearinghouse of safety and health compliance information for awarding and debarring officials at all the agencies. As a clearinghouse of compliance information, GSA or the Interagency Committee would need to come up with a strategy for disseminating this information about companies to the appropriate contract awarding and debarring official. If safety and health violations are also going to be considered in debarment or suspension decisions for companies receiving other forms of federal financial assistance (for example, grants and loans), this dissemination strategy would need to include those agency officials who manage these other assistance programs. Finally, regular communication between OSHA and agency debarring officials regarding violations of federal contractors might be facilitated if OSHA had a representative participate in the monthly meetings of the Interagency Committee.", "Enabling contracting agencies to interpret and use this information effectively. OSHA and agency contract officers could explore how agencies might use the awarding of federal contracts as a vehicle to encourage companies to take more affirmative steps (for example, develop a worksite safety and health program, or participate in voluntary compliance efforts) to improve workplace safety and health. GSA officials and the Interagency Committee members stressed the importance of agency discretion in contracting decisions and that debarment or suspension for safety and health violations should not be mandated. While preserving this discretion, agencies could work with OSHA to develop some kind of guidance as to how to interpret the safety and health records of federal contractors to determine whether or not a contracting action is warranted and, if so, what type of action is warranted. Such guidance, for example, could help agency debarring officials to identify those instances where it might be more appropriate to work with a contractor to facilitate compliance instead of debarring or suspending that contractor. Such situations might vary across agencies and contract type. In addition, OSHA and the contracting agencies might want to determine the kind of technical support, if any, OSHA could provide to help agencies in their efforts to bring a contractor with a poor safety and health record into compliance.", "Helping contracting agencies determine how closely tied to federal contract dollars the worksite with violations must be to warrant taking an adverse contract action. Sometimes a safety and health problem might be localized or confined to a specific worksite. Thereby, taking a contract action against the federal contractor might be appropriate only if that particular worksite receives contract dollars. On the other hand, a systemic corporatewide compliance problem may be indicated if there are violations across many worksites owned by or associated with the same federal contractor. In such cases, a contracting action against the company as a whole may be appropriate.

OSHA has recently launched an initiative to improve its inspection targeting system so that instead of treating employers in a certain industry alike, OSHA will focus its resources on specific worksites where employers ignore safety and health regulations and put their employees at risk. The rationale is to increase the likelihood that its limited resources will be spent inspecting worksites more likely to have hazards.

Labor stated that federal contractors, like other employers, have a responsibility for providing employees with a safe and healthful workplace. Labor also agreed that the exchange of information between OSHA and GSA could make additional compliance strategies available to OSHA at the worksites of federal contractors and could be consistent with OSHA\u2019s effort to reinvent its enforcement policies and procedures.", "However, Labor officials also suggested that our recommendation regarding the exchange of information on inspections and contracts be directed to GSA because they believe that GSA is in a better position to affect agency contracting actions. Officials expressed greater concern about our recommendation to use federal contractor status as one criterion in OSHA\u2019s prioritizing of inspection resources. Labor officials said that the report does not provide evidence that federal contractors have a worse compliance record than other employers. Because OSHA\u2019s inspection targeting program, consistent with the administration\u2019s National Performance Review (NPR), is intended to focus OSHA\u2019s limited enforcement resources toward worksites where the greatest safety and health hazards exist, introducing the criterion of whether or not a company received federal contracts could divert resources toward worksites with less serious hazards.", "Although coordination among all parties is necessary, we directed our recommendations to Labor because we believe that OSHA is the appropriate starting point for the initiation and development of any information exchange on federal contracts and OSHA inspections. OSHA is the primary federal agency responsible for workplace safety and health and it maintains detailed information on the inspections conducted throughout the nation, including the nature and severity of the violations detected. In contrast, although GSA maintains information on federal contracts, the contracting function itself is diffused among many individual agencies and departments. Therefore, our recommendations recognize GSA as instrumental in facilitating the sharing of information between OSHA, which maintains the safety and health compliance information, and agency awarding and debarring officials, who can use this information in their contracting decisions.", "Regarding Labor\u2019s concerns about OSHA\u2019s allocation of its inspection resources, we acknowledge that including federal contractor status as an additional criterion in OSHA\u2019s prioritization of inspections raises several issues, including its appropriateness from a policy standpoint and how such a criterion would be operationalized. However, we view the use of federal contractor status as a criterion to be implemented in addition to and not in lieu of other criteria identifying high-hazard workplaces. We also recognize that Labor, upon conclusion of its review, may determine that federal contractor status should play only a minor role in OSHA\u2019s prioritization of resources. In addition, given our requesters\u2019 interests and the formidable data limitations facing such an analysis, we did not seek to assess federal contractors\u2019 overall compliance record as compared with other employers. Instead, we sought to determine whether companies receiving federal contracts had also been assessed significant proposed penalties for safety and health violations. Our finding that 16 percent of all the significant-penalty inspections closed in fiscal year 1994 involved federal contractors suggests that the inclusion of contractor status as a priority criterion could enhance OSHA\u2019s ability to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for U.S. workers.", "Officials from GSA and members of the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension also generally agreed with the report\u2019s findings and concurred that information on OSHA inspections of firms receiving federal contracts would be useful to agency awarding and debarring officials\u2019 decisions.

On such matters, they believe that only OSHA has sufficient expertise to implement a health and safety compliance program.

Interagency Committee members, in particular, said that they lack staff and administrative support that would be necessary for it to serve as a clearinghouse of OSHA contractor compliance information. Interagency Committee members also stated that the committee\u2019s authority is limited to coordinating the assignment of lead agency responsibility when more than one agency has an interest in a particular contractor and it cannot assign this responsibility. Finally, because the Interagency Committee is composed only of debarring officials, it has no direct link to awarding officials that could limit its role in facilitating the flow of violation information to agency contract officers.", "GSA officials and Interagency Committee members also pointed out that debarment and suspension actions, because they can have a serious impact on a contractor\u2019s business life, can provide an impetus for a contractor to take remedial measures. However, they stated that it would be inappropriate and run counter to procurement regulations to use debarment or suspension to threaten a contractor, even one with an egregious safety record. To further clarify the roles of OSHA and other parties on this matter, GSA officials suggested that an appropriate sequence implementing this recommendation would be for OSHA to establish with the contractor the appropriate compliance program and then provide information on the case to the contracting agency\u2019s debarring official for review of the contractor\u2019s overall responsibility.", "We did not specify the precise roles that OSHA, GSA, and other parties should play in facilitating the exchange of information because we believed that it was best that the flexibility be available to ensure that any arrangement developed would minimize the burden for all parties.

We also believe that GSA and the Interagency Committee are better positioned than OSHA to identify which violators receive federal contracts and to help disseminate information on OSHA inspections to federal awarding and debarring officials throughout the government. Awarding and debarring officials within the individual agencies, after review of OSHA inspection information, would then be able to make more informed decisions. Under such a procedure, agency discretion could be preserved so that awarding and debarring officials could provide the appropriate impetus for improvement to federal contractors while avoiding unnecessary procurement disruptions. We also note that, in all cases, OSHA would not be precluded from using its own authority to cite employers for violations, monitor abatement efforts, or take other available actions.", "We also agree that debarment or suspension should not be used as a means to punish individual contractors and the report does not recommend this. Instead, agencies could use OSHA inspection information to ensure that they comply with the requirement in federal procurement regulations that agencies contract only with firms that are responsible\u2014in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Another limitation to this review is that companies may have changed their safety and health practices, particularly if a long time has elapsed between the opening and closing of an inspection.

I.2.)", "We discovered some inconsistencies in accident data when comparing different sources of data. The primary source of accident data is in the IMIS accident segment, providing data on the number of workers killed or injured and the degree of injury, among other information. However, investigation summaries, referring to accident abstracts submitted by OSHA compliance officers, referred to fatalities or injuries not always recorded in the accident segment. In addition, some violations were coded in a special manner to indicate that they were related to a fatality or catastrophe, yet there was not a corresponding accident segment or investigation summary. We reconciled these inconsistencies by conducting follow-up telephone calls to the OSHA area offices that had conducted the inspection. In many of these inspections, a fatality or injury had occurred.The results of these follow-up calls are reflected in the number of fatalities and injuries and in the descriptions of the accidents, which occurred at the worksites of 50 federal contractors.", "We performed a special tabulation for types of violations. Because the types of violations (serious, willful, repeat, and unclassified) are captured not by inspection but by violations only, our special tabulation involved developing counts by inspection when there was at least one violation of that particular type. We also performed a special tabulation to determine how many inspections involved additional penalties assessed under OSHA\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d policy and the specific standards violated. We also ran data for all worksites to determine whether a company had been penalized for failing to abate a hazard.", "We ran distributions of penalties, both of total proposed penalties and total actual penalties for our 345 inspections. To capture the degree to which proposed penalties were reduced, we ran a distribution of the percentage difference between each proposed and actual penalty. Finally, we ran distributions by standards violated, focusing on those standards in which the greatest number of violations in these 345 inspections fell.", "We chose not to report the disposition of inspections, referring to the level of review at which a contested inspection was resolved\u2014formal settlement agreement, administrative law judge decision, or by OSHRC commissioners\u2019 decision. After requesting copies of decisions from OSHRC on those inspections in which violations were coded as being resolved by its commissioners, we found that many of these cases had actually been resolved before reaching this level of review by an administrative law judge\u2019s decision. We found disposition coding errors of this nature among inspections conducted by both federal OSHA and state-operated programs. However, we did review all administrative law judge decisions in the federal OSHA cases to make sure that the types of violations reported and the actual penalties for which the company was assessed accurately reflected the review by the administrative law judge.", "We also used IMIS to characterize the worksite where the inspection occurred. OSHA staff told us that the more reliable data on the number of employees was the number at the worksite. We also ran a distribution on the primary industry the worksite was engaged in, relying on SIC codes captured for each worksite. We used more detailed codes within the SIC classification system when reporting on individual worksites. To describe the federal contractors (or parent company) that own the worksites inspected, we gathered number of employees and annual sales data for selected companies\u2014those that were assessed significant proposed penalties in more than one inspection closed in fiscal year 1994.", "OSHA staff helped us to determine whether some of the worksites owned by federal contractors that had been assessed significant proposed penalties had a history of violations. OSHA staff, using corporate identification codes for worksites inspected, performed a search of IMIS to retrieve prior-year inspections at these same worksites. Because of missing corporate identification numbers, OSHA was only able to retrieve prior-year inspection information on about one-half (197) of the worksites. We ran a distribution by proposed penalty to determine if some of these prior inspections resulted in significant proposed penalties of $15,000 or more.", "We also asked OSHA staff to review our list of 261 federal contractors who own worksites with safety and health violations to determine whether any of their 345 inspections were criminally prosecuted by OSHA or, conversely, whether any of these federal contractors were participants in OSHA\u2019s VPP because of exemplary safety and health practices. While OSHA staff determined that none of the 345 inspections was criminally prosecuted, they reported to us that some of these federal contractors did have worksites (other than those assessed significant proposed penalties for safety and health violations) that were VPP participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exploring Ways to Improve Compliance", "paragraphs": ["To explore ways to improve compliance of federal contractors with OSHA, we met with OSHA officials in the Directorate of Compliance Programs, because of their enforcement responsibilities, and Labor\u2019s Office of the Solicitor. We also met with contracting officials at GSA and the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, which coordinates suspension and debarment activities governmentwide. We also met with computer and technical staff in OSHA headquarters as well as officials in its San Francisco regional office.", "We conducted our work from July 1995 to July 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Inspections and Contracts of 261 Federal Contractors Assessed Significant Proposed Penalties", "paragraphs": ["Table II.1 provides key characteristics of inspections and contracts of the 261 federal contractors assessed significant proposed penalties for violations of safety and health regulations. Our definition of a significant penalty is a proposed penalty of $15,000 or more regardless of the size of the actual penalty recorded when the inspection was closed (either because the employer accepted the citation or a contested citation was resolved). The proposed penalty is the penalty issued by OSHA in the original citation and reflects the compliance officer\u2019s judgment of the nature and severity of violations, while the actual penalty may be the product of other factors such as negotiations between OSHA and the company to encourage quicker abatement of workplace hazards. Because some of these 261 federal contractors own more than one worksite inspected, a total of 345 inspections appear in the table. In reporting fiscal year 1994 contract dollars, we are referring to the federal contractor (or parent company), which is identified if it is different from the name of the worksite where the violations occurred. The violations may have occurred at only one worksite or facility, possibly within a division or subsidiary, of the federal contractor and not necessarily where the contract activity was performed.", "Inspection information includes the location of the worksite inspected and the activity number of the inspection that is assigned in IMIS. We have provided both the proposed and actual penalties. We have reported those standards violated that are associated with the highest actual penalty as well as standards that reportedly contributed to a fatality or injury when different than the former. In summarizing the fatality or injury, we referred to investigation summaries submitted by OSHA compliance officers or follow-up calls to local OSHA offices when other data in IMIS indicated an accident had occurred but no summary was available. To provide selected characteristics of violations, we reported whether violations included at least one violation that was willful, repeat, or serious and whether the company was assessed penalties under OSHA\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d policy or for failing to abate a hazard.", "If a proposed penalty of $100,000 or more was assessed for safety and health violations (which was the case in 26 of these inspections), an asterisk appears by the activity number of the inspection.

Our definition of a significant penalty is a proposed penalty of $15,000 or more regardless of the size of the actual penalty recorded when the inspection was closed (either because the employer accepted the citation or a contested citation was resolved). The proposed penalty is the penalty issued by OSHA in the original citation and reflects the compliance officer\u2019s judgment of the nature and severity of violations, while the actual penalty may be the product of other factors such as negotiations between OSHA and the company to encourage quicker abatement of workplace hazards. Because some of these 261 federal contractors own more than one worksite inspected, a total of 345 inspections appear in the table. The name of the federal contractor (or parent company) is identified if it is different from the name of the worksites where the violations occurred. The table also includes the location of the worksite inspected, including the corresponding activity number of the inspection as assigned in IMIS. Given that there are many different OSHA standards, we reported those standards in which the greatest number of violations in the 345 inspections fell. Because more violations were of general industry standards, we reported these standards in greater detail. We have identified those 26 inspections in which a proposed penalty of $100,000 or more was assessed for safety and health violations with an asterisk that appears by the activity number of the inspection. Seventy-one inspections conducted by state-operated safety and health programs are identified with a special symbol (=) by the activity number of the inspection. The column of \u201cAll other standards\u201d is often marked in inspections conducted by state-operated programs because the codes used by some states are different from the codes for federal standards.", "Worksite (name of federal contractor if different)", "Location (IMIS activity number)", "New York, NY (106934086)", "A.A.R.
