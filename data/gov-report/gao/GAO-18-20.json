It aims to allow IRS, states, and tax preparation industry partners to quickly share information on identity theft (IDT) refund fraud. The ISAC pilot includes two components: an online platform run by IRS to communicate data on suspected fraud, and an ISAC Partnership, a collaborative organization comprised of IRS, states, and industry, which is intended to be the governance structure. As of November 2017, the ISAC had 48 members: 31 states (including full members and those receiving alerts only), 14 tax preparation companies, and 3 financial institutions. In addition, IRS is using a Rapid Response Team (RRT) in partnership with states and industry members to coordinate responses to IDT refund fraud incidents that pose a significant threat within 24 to 72 hours of being discovered. IRS deployed the RRT for six incidents in 2016 and once in 2017.", "GAO found that the ISAC pilot aligns with key aspects of all five leading practices for effective pilot design GAO previously identified, but none fully. For example, IRS has worked to incorporate stakeholder input, but its message about the ISAC's benefits has not fully reached states. Further, IRS does not have criteria for assessing whether the pilot's objectives have been met. Without this assessment and better alignment with leading practices, IRS, its partners, and Congress will have difficulty determining the effectiveness of the pilot and whether to implement it more broadly.", "IRS has taken actions to improve the ISAC pilot, but the ISAC Partnership does not have an outreach plan. While the ISAC Senior Executive Board limited industry participation to partners who participated in its Security Summit, the ISAC has obtained support from trade organizations. However, officials from almost all states represented in our focus groups noted that they either had not used, or were unfamiliar with, the ISAC-specific resources. While the ISAC Board has taken steps to engage stakeholders, the ISAC Partnership does not have an outreach plan to increase membership and improve states' and industry partners' understanding of the ISAC's benefits. Without such a plan, less effective collaboration is likely among stakeholders and opportunities to prevent IDT refund fraud may be missed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends IRS ensure (1) the ISAC better aligns with leading practices for effective pilot design, and (2) the ISAC Partnership develops an outreach plan to expand membership and improve understanding of the ISAC's benefits.

IDT refund fraud occurs when a refund-seeking fraudster  obtains an individual\u2019s Social Security number, date of birth, or other  personally identifiable information (PII), and uses it to file a fraudulent tax  return seeking a refund. This crime burdens honest taxpayers because  authenticating their identities is likely to delay the processing of their  returns and refunds. IRS estimates that at least $14.5 billion in IDT tax  refund fraud was attempted in tax year 2015, of which it prevented at  least $12.3 billion (85 percent). Of the amount attempted, IRS estimated it  paid at least $2.2 billion (15 percent).", "Given current and emerging risks, in 2015 we added IRS\u2019s efforts to  address IDT refund fraud to our high-risk area for enforcement of tax  laws. This is part of our broader body of work on IDT refund fraud since  2014. We previously reported that IRS had undertaken substantial  research efforts to combat this problem, such as estimating the cost of  IDT refund fraud. The efforts also include examining the size of the  problem and evaluating whether IRS\u2019s methods for authenticating  taxpayers provide reasonable assurance that the authentication  determination is accurate. Our work and associated recommendations  have helped IRS continue to adapt as it confronts new and evolving  schemes.", "To further address IDT refund fraud, IRS held a Security Summit in March  2015, with representatives such as state tax administrators and industry  partners, including tax preparation and software firms and financial  institutions.

IRS,  through the ISAC working group and the Board, communicated with  stakeholders before, during, and after forming the ISAC. Such  communication helped ensure that stakeholders were engaged and that  their views were understood and incorporated. For example, in 2016,  IRS\u2019s contractor conducted a preliminary assessment and interviews to  compile and present stakeholder views and aspirations for the ISAC. This  process included meeting with state officials and industry partners about  ISAC preferences, suggestions, concerns, and risks.

During a 3-day fraud simulation exercise  hosted by IRS\u2019s contractor, participants discussed partner actions, needs,  and processes to inform the ISAC\u2019s development. Additionally, IRS  conducted a stakeholder analysis which documented stakeholders\u2019  engagement in the ISAC Partnership. This is intended to inform the  development of the ISAC communications plan. Finally, the ISAC\u2019s  Partnership governance structure, which includes representatives from  states and industry, helps facilitate communication among stakeholders.", "Despite these efforts, IRS\u2019s message about the ISAC\u2019s benefits has not  fully reached states. In our focus groups, a few state officials reported  they are unclear about the benefit of the ISAC. To help improve  communication, the Board invited relevant trade organizations to  participate in its July Board meetings. IRS officials reported that the  message about the benefits of the ISAC may not have initially reached  states because it took time to build trust among state and industry  partners. FTA confirmed that states may not have understood the benefits  of working with IRS and industry partners and were wary of joining the  ISAC. Further, IRS officials said that some trade organizations that  endorsed the ISAC had differing views about the organization of the  ISAC\u2014such as who should be invited to participate\u2014which made it  challenging for IRS to effectively garner support. A few states reported in  our focus groups that FTA\u2019s endorsement was important to their decision  to join the ISAC. Until IRS further communicates the ISAC\u2019s benefit to  current and potential stakeholders, IRS and the ISAC Board may face  challenges in reaching their goal of increasing robust participation in the  ISAC. We discuss how IRS can improve its outreach to state and industry  partners later in this report.", "Establish well-defined, appropriate, clear, and measureable  objectives: In our 2016 report, we found that well-formulated objectives  help ensure that appropriate evaluation data can be collected from the  outset of the pilot so that data are available for measuring performance  against clear goals and standards. Broad objectives should be translated  into specific researchable questions that articulate what will be  assessed. Additionally, we have reported that agencies should establish  measurable goals for determining when the pilot progresses from one  stage to the next to improve their ability to evaluate the success of the  pilot.", "IRS\u2019s efforts mostly aligned with this leading practice.

In February 2017, the Board established the metrics  subgroup to assess the performance of the ISAC and develop metrics.  The Board noted that metrics are essential for showing the value added  by the ISAC compared to other efforts. The ISAC Roadmap, a planning  document that outlines three developmental phases over 4 years, shows  that IRS and the Board have considered an implementation plan, as well  as how the online platform might evolve in the areas of program  operations, infrastructure, analytics, and partner engagement.  Additionally, IRS\u2019s contractor anticipated and developed risk mitigation  strategies to handle scenarios that might arise before, during, and after  the ISAC\u2019s launch and interfere with reaching the pilot\u2019s objectives.  Finally, ahead of ISAC\u2019s launch, the contractor refined key operational  attributes to help define ISAC\u2019s full desired capabilities.", "However, IRS has not translated its objectives into specific, researchable  questions that articulate what will be assessed.

However,  we have previously reported that without well-defined, appropriate, clear,  and measurable objectives, it will be difficult to ensure appropriate  evaluation data are collected and available to measure performance  against the objectives and goals. In short, it will be difficult for IRS to  know whether it achieved its objectives. Without knowing this, IRS will  have difficulty justifying investing additional resources.", "Ensure scalability of pilot design: The purpose of a pilot is generally to  inform a decision on whether and how to implement a new approach in a  broader context. Identifying criteria or standards for identifying lessons  about the pilot will help inform an agency\u2019s decisions about scalability and  when to integrate pilot activities into overall efforts. We previously  reported that the criteria and standards should be observable and  measureable events, actions, or characteristics that provide evidence that  the pilot objectives have been met.", "IRS\u2019s efforts in designing the ISAC partially aligned with this leading  practice. First, IRS identified and integrated lessons learned into its pilot.  For example, ahead of ISAC\u2019s launch, IRS\u2019s contractor identified potential  capabilities of the ISAC based on lessons learned from four ISACs from  other industries and a 2-day collaborative session in summer 2015. In  February 2017, 1 month after the ISAC\u2019s launch, the Board established  the metrics subgroup to develop evaluation criteria to determine the  extent to which the pilot objectives have been met. According to ISAC  Board officials, the metrics subgroup is developing and testing metrics  that the ISAC Board expects to use beginning in the 2018 filing season.  The metrics are designed to measure participation in the ISAC,  contribution of data or information to the ISAC, and the effectiveness of  the data or information provided.", "IRS also took steps to improve the ISAC pilot design, which will help it  scale the pilot in the future. For example, in May 2017, IRS\u2019s contractor  presented lessons learned from the 2017 filing season, including what  was accomplished, what should be changed in future filing seasons, and  areas for future attention to consider how well the lessons learned can be  applied when the pilot is scaled up. The contractor\u2019s presentation also  outlined recommendations from a May 2017 independent assessment of  the ISAC, including the current status of each recommendation and  actions needed to implement them. In addition, during the July 2017 ISAC  Board meeting, IRS\u2019s contractor discussed lessons learned, and the IRS  ISAC Executive Official discussed takeaways thus far from standing up  the ISAC. Finally, IRS took steps to establish criteria for assessing the  pilot\u2019s performance, but these steps are primarily related to participation,  access, and data contribution requirements.", "IRS does not have criteria that would inform decisions about the ISAC\u2019s  scalability, including when it is appropriate to include more state and  industry members, how to identify additional members, or how to expand  the functionalities of the online platform. For example, IRS has yet to  articulate the criteria to determine the appropriate time frame for the ISAC  to remain in the pilot stage and does not have a plan to decide how and  when the ISAC will move from the pilot stage into full implementation.  However, IRS officials have said that the ISAC will likely continue in pilot  phase through the 2018 filing season.", "According to IRS officials, IRS had prioritized other activities and is now  turning its attention to plans for scaling the pilot. Without measurable  evaluation criteria that provide evidence that the ISAC pilot objectives  have been met, the Board will have difficulty assessing the ISAC\u2019s  performance and making decisions about scalability.", "Clearly articulate an assessment methodology: In 2016, we reported  that key features of an assessment methodology include a strategy for  comparing the pilot\u2019s implementation and results with other efforts; a clear  plan that details the type and source of the data necessary to evaluate  the pilot; and methods for data collection, including the timing and  frequency.", "While IRS\u2019s efforts minimally aligned with this leading practice, it has  taken some steps to clearly articulate its assessment methodology. For  example, according to the IRS ISAC Executive Official, IRS plans to  evaluate the extent to which the revenue protected by the ISAC pilot  compares to existing fraud detection and prevention efforts, including the  External Leads Program. To help accomplish this, IRS took preliminary  steps to collect and track metrics related to ISAC\u2019s performance and  compare ISAC\u2019s efforts against other mechanisms to combat fraud. For  example, IRS\u2019s contractor collects and disseminates program metrics and  ISAC analytics weekly, including the total number of members, leads,  alerts, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This is intended to help  assess progress in expanding the ISAC and identifying fraud. In addition,  the metrics subgroup started comparing ISAC leads against information  collected from the states as part of its effort to assess ISAC data quality.", "However, IRS has not completed an assessment methodology and data  gathering strategy that outlines the type and source of data necessary to  evaluate the pilot to assess the progress in achieving each of the ISAC\u2019s  objectives, including whether the ISAC successfully facilitates the  exchange of information and helps detect and prevent fraud. IRS also  does not have a strategy for comparing the pilot\u2019s implementation and  results with other efforts. For example, while IRS officials expect to  determine federal revenue protected by the ISAC and compare that to  other efforts, IRS has not formalized this plan and IRS officials do not  expect to start until at least October 2017, when the needed data become  available. Additionally, according to IRS\u2019s ISAC Executive Official, state  and industry partners\u2014who are important stakeholders in the ISAC\u2014may  not be able to track dollars protected through the ISAC. As a result, IRS  may only know the federal dollars protected, while the amount protected  at the state level may remain unknown. This makes it more difficult to  communicate the potential benefits to states. Furthermore, the ISAC  could be collecting additional data to better meet its objectives. While  quantifying federal dollars protected is a key indicator of the ISAC\u2019s  success, that metric alone will not demonstrate the ISAC\u2019s benefit and  effectiveness.", "Without a documented strategy to compare the ISAC pilot to other efforts  and a methodology that details the type and source of data necessary to  evaluate the pilot\u2014beyond the federal dollars protected by the ISAC that  would otherwise have been undetected\u2014IRS may find it difficult to  assess the effectiveness of the pilot, identify areas for improvement, and  demonstrate its capabilities compared with other efforts.", "Develop a data-analysis plan: In conjunction with a clearly articulated  assessment methodology, a detailed data-analysis plan identifies who will  analyze the data as well as when and how data will be analyzed to  assess the pilot\u2019s performance and draw conclusions about how to  improve procedures moving forward. As we previously reported, the  results will show the successes and challenges of the pilot, and in turn,  how the pilot can be incorporated into broader efforts.", "While IRS\u2019s efforts minimally aligned with this leading practice, it has  taken some steps to measure performance at the activity level. For  example, IRS worked with its contractor to regularly track and report  engagement metrics; user statistics; and analytics on alerts, leads, and  device IP addresses, which at times are categorized and aggregated.  (See figure 4 earlier in this report for an example of the ISAC data  visualization tool with illustrative data.) IRS\u2019s contractor also surveyed  ISAC members to better gauge user experience with alerts and what  participants found to be most valuable on the online platform. In response  to other recommendations to develop metrics for measuring ISAC\u2019s  performance and success, the contractor\u2019s May 2017 ISAC evaluation  outlined actions, including beginning to track recommended metrics and  exploring means of quantifying the benefit.", "However, IRS has not formalized the plan to determine the amount of  revenue protected nor has it developed a detailed data-analysis plan to  determine how the ISAC pilot\u2019s performance will be tracked. The ISAC\u2019s  metrics subgroup reported that it is working to develop preliminary  performance metrics to benchmark the ISAC pilot\u2019s progress. It  acknowledged that metrics and a detailed analysis plan are essential to  demonstrate the ISAC\u2019s benefit. The subgroup reported it is in the  process of developing them. Without a detailed data analysis and  evaluation plan that identifies data sources and criteria, IRS cannot fully  determine or demonstrate the pilot\u2019s performance and challenges. As a  result, IRS, its partners, and Congress will have difficulty determining the  ISAC\u2019s effectiveness and whether IRS should expand the pilot.", "IRS officials said they are still learning about the five leading practices for  pilot design, and as noted, the ISAC at least partially aligns with each  one. According to internal control standards in the federal government, an  agency should formulate plans to achieve its objectives in order to meet  them.

However, as of October 2017, 5 states had  contributed data and 8 states had submitted 29 alerts. In our focus  groups, officials from a few states reported they were concerned about  the data contribution requirement and were unsure if they had the  resources to contribute such data and did not fully understand the terms  of the data contribution requirement.

The  ISAC Board sought to reframe the discussion about data contribution and,  in July 2017, changed the language to describe data contribution as a  data/information opportunity.", "Endorsing organizations are another potential tool to increase  participation in the ISAC. Five trade organizations\u2014American Coalition of  Taxpayer Rights, Council for Electronic Revenue Communication  Advancement, Computer and Communications Industry Association, the  Free File Alliance, and FTA\u2014are supporting the ISAC Partnership as  endorsing organizations. According to IRS, endorsing organizations  provide additional support for the ISAC concept and are uniquely  positioned to serve as links between the ISAC and the sectors they  represent. While they are not ISAC members and therefore cannot  access the online platform, their role is important to build connections  between stakeholders. However, according to FTA officials, IRS did not  effectively leverage FTA to communicate the benefits to states during the  first year of the pilot, but IRS and the ISAC Board have since taken  important steps to improve collaboration.", "FTA endorsed the ISAC in February 2017 and, in our focus groups, both  state and industry officials said the endorsement was important for  securing more widespread state participation. According to FTA, IRS did  not incorporate its feedback about the probable response from states to  the ISAC, which FTA officials believe may have resulted in a lower-than- expected rate of participation by states in the early months of the ISAC.  According to IRS officials, IRS attempted to work with endorsing  organizations while standing up the ISAC online platform and received  comments from FTA and an industry trade organization that reflected  different interests and priorities. According to IRS officials, IRS attempted  to find a middle ground.

IRS officials said  that IRS not sharing information in the ISAC limits the full benefit of the  ISAC. While the ISAC is designed to be a three-pronged collaboration  between IRS, states, and industry, because IRS does not view or  contribute record-level data, such data only flows between states and  industry. This limits the full value of the ISAC. Further, it may be  challenging for the ISAC partnership to meet a key goal of increasing  participation among state and industry members if a key stakeholder in  the partnership is unable to fully participate. IRS officials said the agency  is considering options to allow it to participate more fully in the ISAC.  Specifically, IRS included a request for a legislative change to section  6103 in a report to Treasury. This request is an important step to enable  the ISAC to be an effective information sharing and collaboration tool.", "Likewise, some states faced legal hurdles to joining the ISAC.
