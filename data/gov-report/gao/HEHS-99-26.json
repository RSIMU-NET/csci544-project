Over 4,000 people were hospitalized, and 55 died. In 1996, drinking apple juice contaminated with a virulent strain of E. coli bacteria made more than 60 people seriously ill and caused the death of one person. And in 1998, 26 children became ill from playing in a swimming pool contaminated by a virulent strain of E. coli. Four of the children developed a serious complication that affects the blood and kidneys.", "The resurgence of some infectious diseases is particularly alarming because previously effective forms of control are breaking down. For example, some pathogens (disease-causing organisms) have become resistant to antibiotics used to bring them under control or have developed strains that no longer respond to the antibiotics.", "Monitoring infectious diseases\u2014identifying diseases and their sources\u2014is critical for determining control and prevention efforts. Public health officials refer to this activity as surveillance\u2014the ongoing collection, analysis, and interpretation of disease-related data to plan, implement, and evaluate public health actions. Many public health experts have raised concerns about the adequacy of the nation\u2019s infectious diseases surveillance network, especially for those diseases considered to be emerging\u2014that is, ones more prevalent now than 20 years ago or ones that show signs of becoming more prevalent in the near future.", "In light of these concerns, you asked us to examine the nation\u2019s surveillance network and to focus on the contribution of laboratories, since new technology gives them an increasingly important role in identifying pathogens and the sources of outbreaks. Specifically, you asked us to (1) determine the extent to which states conduct public health surveillance and laboratory testing of selected emerging infectious diseases, (2) identify the problems state public health officials face in gathering and using laboratory-related data in the surveillance of emerging infectious diseases, and (3) describe the assistance that the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides to states for laboratory-related surveillance and the value of this assistance to state officials.", "To provide information on the contribution of laboratories to the surveillance network, we surveyed the directors of all state public health laboratories and infectious diseases epidemiology programs that report disease-related information directly to CDC, including officials in all 50 states, 5 territories, the District of Columbia, and New York City. We also conducted case studies in Kentucky, New York, and Oregon; spoke with additional state and local public health officials around the country; and interviewed CDC officials. We focused our work on six specific emerging infectious diseases or pathogens: tuberculosis, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (including E. coli O157:H7), pertussis, Cryptosporidium parvum, hepatitis C virus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our methodology is described in more detail in appendix I, the results from our surveys are in appendixes II and III, and details on the six diseases are in appendix IV.

The causes of this increase are complex and often difficult to anticipate. For example, increased development, deforestation, and other environmental changes have brought people into contact with animals or insects that harbor diseases only rarely encountered before. Not all emerging infections are unfamiliar diseases, however. Some pathogens have developed resistance to the antibiotics that brought them under control just a generation ago. Moreover, the threefold increase in international travel during the past 20 years and greater importation of fresh foods across national borders allow infectious diseases to spread rapidly. As these diseases travel, they interact with growing numbers of people who have weakened immunity, such as transplant recipients, elderly persons, patients treated with radiation, and those infected with HIV/AIDS.", "With the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s and the development of vaccines for diseases like polio, there was widespread optimism that infectious diseases could be eliminated completely. As a result, public health officials shifted some monitoring efforts to other health problems, such as chronic diseases. By 1986, CDC had discontinued surveillance of drug-resistance trends in tuberculosis. The resurgence of tuberculosis and the appearance of HIV/AIDS thus caught the nation\u2019s public health system off guard.", "Today, infectious diseases account for considerable health care costs and lost productivity. In the United States, an estimated one-fourth of all doctor visits are for infectious diseases. Foodborne illnesses, some of which were unrecognized 20 years ago, are estimated to cause up to 33 million cases and 9,000 deaths annually and to cost as much as $22 billion a year. The number of pathogens resistant to one or more previously effective antibiotics is increasing rapidly, adding to health care costs and threatening to return the nation to the pre-antibiotic era. Antibiotic resistance limits effective treatment options, with potentially fatal results. Resistant infections that people acquire during hospitalizations are estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and cause 19,000 deaths a year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Surveillance Is the Primary Public Health Tool to Detect and Monitor Infections", "paragraphs": ["Surveillance is public health officials\u2019 most important tool for detecting and monitoring both existing and emerging infectious diseases.

These sources in turn must take the initiative to provide data to the health department, where officials analyze and interpret the information as it comes in.", "Under active surveillance, public health officials contact people directly to gather data. For example, state or local health department staff could call commercial laboratories each week to ask if any tests conducted for cryptosporidiosis yielded positive results. Active surveillance produces more complete information than passive surveillance, but it takes more time and costs more.", "Infectious diseases surveillance in the United States depends largely on passive methods of collecting disease reports and laboratory test results.

To help determine the cause of the patient\u2019s illness, a physician may rely on a laboratory test, which could be performed in the physician\u2019s own office, a hospital, an independent clinical laboratory, or a public health laboratory. State and local health departments that provide clinical services also generate laboratory test results for infectious diseases surveillance.", "Local health departments are often the first to receive the reports of infectious diseases generated by physicians, hospitals, and others. Health department staff collect these reports, check them for completeness, contact health care professionals to obtain missing information or clarify unclear responses, and forward them to state health agencies. Staff resources devoted to disease reporting vary with the overall size and mission of the health department. Since nearly half of local health agencies have jurisdiction over a population of fewer than 25,000, many cannot support a large, specialized staff to work on disease reporting.", "In state health departments, epidemiologists analyze data collected through the disease reporting network, decide when and how to supplement passive reporting with active surveillance methods, conduct outbreak and other disease investigations, and design and evaluate disease prevention and control efforts. They also transmit state data to CDC, providing routine reporting on selected diseases. Many state epidemiologists and laboratory directors provide the medical community with information obtained through surveillance, such as rates of disease incidence and prevailing patterns of antimicrobial resistance.", "Federal participation in the infectious diseases surveillance network focuses on CDC activities\u2014particularly those of the National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID), which operates CDC\u2019s infectious diseases laboratories. CDC analyzes the data furnished by states to (1) monitor national health trends, (2) formulate and implement prevention strategies, and (3) evaluate state and federal disease prevention efforts. CDC routinely provides public health officials, medical personnel, and others information on disease trends and analyses of outbreaks. Through NCID and other units\u2014such as the National Immunization Program and the National Center for HIV, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHSTP)\u2014CDC offers an array of scientific and financial support for state infectious diseases surveillance, prevention, and control programs. NCID officials said that most of their 1,100 staff and $186 million budget in fiscal year 1998 were devoted to assisting state infectious diseases efforts. For example, CDC provides testing services and consultation not available at the state level; training on infectious diseases and laboratory topics, such as testing methods and outbreak investigations; and grants to help states conduct diseases surveillance.The Epidemiology Program Office provides training and technical assistance related to software for disease reporting and oversees data integration efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Laboratories Play an Essential Role in Surveillance of Emerging Infectious Diseases", "paragraphs": ["Public health and private laboratories are a vital part of the surveillance network because only laboratory results can definitively identify pathogens.

According to public health officials, the nation\u2019s 158,000 laboratories are consistent sources of passively reported information for infectious diseases surveillance. Independent commercial and hospital laboratories may also share with public health agencies information gathered through their private surveillance efforts, such as studies of patterns of antibiotic resistance or the spread of diseases within a hospital.", "Every state has at least one state public health laboratory to support its infectious diseases surveillance activities and other public health programs. Some states operate one or more regional laboratories to serve different parts of the state. In five states\u2014Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, and Wisconsin\u2014academic institutions, such as university medical schools, provide public health laboratory testing. State laboratories conduct testing for routine surveillance or as part of special clinical or epidemiologic studies. These laboratories provide diagnostic tests for rare or unusual pathogens that are not always available in commercial laboratories or tests for more common pathogens that use new technology still needing controlled evaluation. State public health laboratories provide specialized testing for low-incidence, high-risk diseases, such as tuberculosis and botulism. Testing they provide during an outbreak contributes greatly to tracing the spread of the outbreak, identifying the source, and developing appropriate control measures. Epidemiologists rely on state public health laboratories to document trends and identify events that may indicate an emerging problem. Many state laboratories also provide licensing and quality assurance oversight of commercial laboratories.", "State public health laboratories are increasingly able to use new advanced molecular technology to identify pathogens at the molecular level. Often, these tests provide information that is used not to diagnose and treat individual patients but to tell epidemiologists whether cases of illness are caused by the same strain of pathogen\u2014information that is not available from clinical records or other conventional epidemiologic methods. Public health officials have already used this type of laboratory information to identify the movement of diseases through a community in ways that would not have been possible 5 years ago. For example, staff in Minnesota\u2019s laboratory use a molecular technology called pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to test \u201cisolates\u201d (isolated quantities of a pathogen) of E. coli O157:H7 that laboratories in the state must submit. From 1994 to 1995, the resulting DNA fingerprint patterns identified 10 outbreaks\u2014almost half of which would not have been identified by traditional surveillance methods. Using the laboratory results, epidemiologists were able to find the sources of contamination and eliminate them, thus preventing additional infections.", "CDC laboratories provide highly specialized tests not always available in state public health or commercial laboratories and assist states with testing during outbreaks. The staff at CDC\u2019s laboratories also have a broad range of expertise identifying pathogens. These laboratories help diagnose life-threatening, unusual, or exotic infectious diseases; provide information on cases of infectious diseases for which satisfactory tests are not widely or commercially available; and confirm public or private laboratory test results that were atypical or difficult to interpret.

In total, we found that during fiscal year 1997, states devoted a median of 8 staff years per 1 million population to laboratory testing of infectious diseases.

Among the smaller number of state laboratories that conduct tests to support surveillance of hepatitis C and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, a smaller percentage of laboratory directors considered their staff resources at least adequate (68 percent and 58 percent, respectively).", "Some state laboratory and epidemiology officials told us that staffing constraints prevent them from making full use of testing capacity. For example, the laboratory director in a state that had acquired PFGE technology cited lack of staff time as one reason for not routinely using PFGE in surveillance of E. coli O157:H7. As a result, he said, the incidence of E. coli O157:H7 in his state is probably understated. If resources were available, he would also like laboratory staff to test pertussis specimens collected during a recent outbreak to determine whether the increase in reported cases was a true outbreak or the result of increased awareness\u2014and reporting\u2014of the disease following the death of a child. Thirty-six state laboratory directors reported having vacancies during the past year and said the vacancies had negatively affected their laboratory\u2019s ability to support their state\u2019s infectious diseases surveillance activities. Nine rated the impact as great or significant. Administrative and financial constraints, such as hiring freezes or budget reductions, were most often responsible for the vacancies.", "Laboratory officials noted that advances in scientific knowledge and the proliferation of molecular testing methods have created a need for training to update the skills of current staff. They reported that such training is often either unavailable or inaccessible because of funding or administrative constraints. For example, several state officials said that in reducing costs, training budgets are often cut first. In other states, staff are subject to per capita limits on training or travel expenses.

Almost 40 percent of laboratory directors reported using computerized systems to little or no extent for receiving surveillance-related data, and 21 percent use them very little for transmitting data. While state epidemiologists use electronic systems more than laboratory directors, they also use them less commonly to receive information (42 percent) than to report it (62 percent).", "One reason for the limited use of electronic systems may be the lack of equipment. A 1996 CDC survey found that, on average, about 20 percent of staff in most state health agencies did not have access to desktop computers that were adequate for sharing information rapidly. Forty percent of local health officials responding to a 1996 survey conducted by the National Association of City and County Health Officials said they lacked such equipment. State and local health officials most often attributed the lack of computer equipment and integrated data processing and management systems to insufficient funding.", "The absence of equipment means some tasks that could be automated must be done by hand\u2014and in some cases must be done by hand even after data have already been processed in electronic form. For example, representatives from two large, multistate private clinical laboratories told us that data stored electronically in their information systems had to be converted to paper so that it could be reported to local health departments. In one state we visited, a local health department mails data stored on disk to the state health agency because it lacks the equipment to transfer the data electronically.", "Even with adequate computer equipment, the difficulty of creating integrated information systems can be formidable. Not only does technology change rapidly, but public health data are currently stored in thousands of places, including the record and information systems of public health agencies and health care institutions, individual case files, and data files of surveys and surveillance systems. These data are in isolated locations that have differing hardware and software structures and considerable variation in how the data are coded, particularly for laboratory test results.", "CDC operates over 100 data systems to monitor over 200 health events, such as specific infectious diseases. Many of these systems collect data from state surveillance programs. This patchwork of data systems arose, in part, to meet CDC and state needs for more detailed information for particular diseases than was usually reported. For example, while information collected to determine incidence rates of many nationally notifiable diseases consists of minimal geographic and demographic data, the information collected to determine incidence rates of tuberculosis includes information on personal behavior, the presence of other diseases, and stays in institutional settings, as well as geographic and demographic data. The additional information collected on tuberculosis also helps guide prevention and control strategies.", "Public health officials told us that the multitude of databases and data systems, software, and reporting mechanisms burdens staff at state and local health agencies and leads to duplication of effort when staff must enter the same data into multiple systems that do not communicate with one another. Furthermore, the lack of integrated data management systems can hinder laboratory and epidemiologic efforts to control outbreaks. For example, in 1993 the lack of integrated systems impeded efforts to control the hantavirus outbreak in the Southwest. Data were locked into separate databases that could not be analyzed or merged with others, requiring public health investigators to analyze individual paper printouts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Concerns May Also Affect Use of Laboratory Data", "paragraphs": ["State officials also raised concerns about a lack of complete data for surveillance and the increased reliance on fees to fund state laboratories, which they believe undermine their infectious diseases surveillance efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Completeness of Data", "paragraphs": ["Public health officials and experts acknowledge that, even when states require reporting, the completeness of data reported varies by disease and type of provider. As might be expected, reporting of severe and life-threatening diseases is more complete than reporting of mild diseases. However, when mild diseases are not reported, outbreaks affecting a large number of people may go unnoticed until deaths occur among people at higher than normal risk. In addition, reporting by practitioners in frequent contact with infectious diseases, such as family practitioners, is more complete than reporting by those who are not, such as surgeons. Although surveillance need not be complete to be useful, underreporting can adversely affect public health efforts by leading to erroneous conclusions about trends in incidence, risk factors for contracting a disease, appropriate prevention and control measures, and treatment effectiveness.", "Completeness of reporting is a concern for the surveillance of illnesses that can produce mild symptoms, such as diarrheal illnesses, which include many foodborne and waterborne conditions. Reported cases of some illnesses represent the tip of the iceberg, at best. A recent CDC-sponsored study estimated that 340 million annual episodes of acute diarrheal illness occurred in the United States, but only 7 percent of people who were ill sought treatment. The study further estimated that physicians requested laboratory testing of a stool culture for 22 percent of those patients who sought treatment, which produced about 6 million test results that could be reported. In cases of mild diarrheal illness, physicians may not request laboratory tests to identify the pathogen because patients with these diseases can get better without treatment or effective treatments do not exist.", "Public health officials expressed varying views about how managed care growth and the consolidation of the laboratory industry might affect the completeness of surveillance data. Some public health officials and physicians believe that managed care\u2014with its emphasis on controlling costs\u2014could lead doctors to order fewer diagnostic tests, particularly those not needed for treatment decisions. Also, to the extent that managed care organizations less frequently use specialists, results from specialized tests they employ would not be generated. Concerns about laboratory consolidation\u2014particularly when specimens are shipped to central testing facilities in other states\u2014stem from fears that out-of-state testing centers will not report test results needed for surveillance, possibly because they might not be aware of state reporting requirements regarding what information should be reported and where to direct it. In two states we visited, representatives of large multistate independent laboratories said their policy is to report test results in accordance with state requirements. One representative provided us with documentation showing the various reporting requirements of states in one region served by the laboratory.", "Each of these laboratories is participating in electronic laboratory reporting pilot programs in different states.", "Other CDC and state public health officials believe that managed care organizations and concentrated ownership of laboratories could provide information that is potentially more consistent, complete, and reliable than what public health officials now routinely obtain through passive reporting. They argue that because information on a large number of patients is concentrated in a small number of organizations, the number of contacts for active surveillance projects is smaller and more manageable and information can be analyzed from large databases. Moreover, they add, these organizations are likely to collect and store laboratory data electronically, which could speed disease reporting.", "Our survey asked epidemiologists whether they or other agencies in their states had evaluated the impacts of managed care and laboratory consolidation on surveillance data; we could identify no systematic evaluations on this issue.

CDC staff and laboratories support state infectious diseases surveillance efforts with technical assistance and testing services that may not be available at the state level. CDC staff provide consultation services on such matters as epidemiological methods and analysis, laboratory techniques, and interpretation of laboratory results. Almost all of the state laboratory directors and epidemiologists responding to our survey said they use CDC\u2019s laboratory testing services and frequently consult with CDC staff.", "Training. CDC provides public health and medical personnel with training on a wide range of topics. The training is offered through such means as interactive audio- or video-conferences, computer-assisted instruction, seminars, and hands-on workshops. Since 1989, CDC has offered laboratory training through a collaboration with APHL. An APHL and CDC assessment identified the need for training on current advances in food microbiology, fungal and viral infections, rabies, tuberculosis, and new and emerging pathogens. To meet these needs, CDC developed a series of courses incorporating hands-on experience, offered in various locations around the country. State laboratory directors and epidemiologists indicated they use CDC training extensively, and most said they participated in CDC-sponsored training in 1997.", "Grant programs. CDC\u2019s various grant and staffing assistance programs provide at least some support to the infectious diseases surveillance programs of all states. In fiscal year 1998, NCID distributed $31.2 million of its $185.7 million budget to state and local health agencies for infectious diseases programs. NCID supports three major grant programs that aid state surveillance programs for emerging infectious diseases (see table 2).Together these three grant programs provided about $20 million to state and local health departments in fiscal year 1997.", "EIP and ELC grants, designed to strengthen and enhance state surveillance abilities, are components of CDC\u2019s overall plan to address emerging infectious diseases.", "Funding for regional laboratory networks. To help with both state-specific and nationwide control and prevention efforts, CDC has sponsored development of regional laboratory networks that give states access to molecular testing services that may not be available in their own state laboratory. The two main laboratory networks are PulseNet, which currently focuses on E. coli O157:H7, and the Tuberculosis Genotyping Network (see table 3).", "Staffing assistance. CDC provides a small number of staff resources to assist state infectious diseases programs through 2-year Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) placements and fellowships in state or local health departments or laboratories. About one-fourth of the 60 to 80 EIS participants selected each year work in state and local health departments. Additionally, by February 1998, CDC had trained 18 laboratory fellows to work in state, local, and federal public health laboratories through its Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory Fellow Program, a collaborative effort with APHL; CDC plans to make 9 emerging diseases laboratory fellowships available through APHL and the CDC Foundation. One goal of the fellowships is to strengthen the relationship of public health laboratories to infectious diseases and drug-resistance surveillance, prevention, and control efforts. Information sharing. Over the past several decades, CDC has developed and made available to states several general and disease-specific information management and reporting programs. Virtually all states use two of these programs to report data on some infectious diseases to CDC\u2014the Public Health Laboratory Information System (PHLIS) and the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS).

According to officials who spoke with us, CDC\u2019s testing for unusual or exotic pathogens and the ability to consult with experienced CDC staff are important, particularly for investigating cases of unusual diseases. However, about 15 percent of survey respondents said CDC\u2019s testing services made only modest improvements in their state\u2019s surveillance capacity.", "Over 70 percent of epidemiologists responding to our survey said that knowledgeable staff at CDC are easy to locate when they need assistance, but many noted that help with matters involving more than one CDC unit is very difficult to obtain. Many state officials who spoke with us thought that this problem arose because staff in different units do not seem to communicate well with each other. One official described CDC\u2019s units as separate towers that do not interact.", "A number of state officials commented that CDC provides tests and consultation very promptly when people are at risk\u2014for example during outbreaks of life-threatening diseases\u2014but less quickly in other circumstances. To provide more timely consultation, CDC has developed an on-line image-sharing ability that allows CDC staff and health professionals in remote locations to view an organism under a microscope at the same time. In one state, staff at CDC and a surgeon in another state used this capacity during an operation to identify a parasite as the cause of the patient\u2019s eye problem, allowing the surgeon to rule out cancer as a diagnosis and eliminating the need to remove the patient\u2019s eye.", "Some state officials and survey respondents said that in less urgent circumstances, CDC\u2019s test results were often not returned quickly enough to be useful to physicians or, in some cases, to epidemiologists. For example, state officials have waited up to a year for CDC to return test results on unusual organisms, making it difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to recognize any subsequent encounters with these organisms. Some of these officials suggested that competing priorities at CDC often prevented the timely return of test results in the absence of immediate need.", "Training is another CDC service that state officials believe is important.

State laboratory officials attributed this improvement to the funding and training they received from CDC. In addition to supporting such core activities as active surveillance of antibiotic-resistant conditions, four states use EIP funds to conduct active surveillance of unexplained deaths and severe illnesses in previously healthy people under age 50\u2014a potentially critical source of information to detect new or newly emerging diseases. This project will also provide information on known infectious diseases that health care professionals are not recognizing in their patients.

Of the 54 states that reported conducting surveillance for tuberculosis, 49 have laboratories that test for antibiotic-resistance. In contrast, of the 37 states that reported conducting surveillance for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, only about half have laboratories that provide testing support.

CDC officials responsible for these programs said that the most recent versions can share data more readily with other systems but that the lack of training in how to use the programs and high staff turnover at state agencies may limit the number of state staff and officials able to use the full range of program capabilities.", "NETSS supports the collection and management of information such as patient demographics and residence, the suspected or confirmed diagnosis, and the date of disease onset. PHLIS contains more definitive information on the pathogen provided by the laboratory test. Both programs also offer optional disease-specific reporting modules states may use to gather additional data. When epidemiologists cannot electronically merge data from different sources, they must manually match the records to analyze disease trends and determine the relevant risk factors needed for effective prevention and control efforts. Sharing data between systems also identifies multiple records on the same case and can help epidemiologists take steps to improve reporting.", "Epidemiologists responding to our survey rated NETSS more highly for flexibility and overall helpfulness than laboratory directors rated PHLIS. About half (48 percent) of responding epidemiologists said NETSS was highly flexible for meeting their needs while only one-quarter (27 percent) of laboratory directors said the same for PHLIS. Fifty-eight percent of epidemiologists said NETSS greatly helped them conduct surveillance, while 22 percent said it was moderately helpful and the remaining 20 percent said it was minimally helpful. In contrast, 76 percent of laboratory directors said PHLIS was of little help, 13 percent said it was very helpful, and 11 percent said it was moderately helpful.", "Many epidemiologists and laboratory directors thought the system they use does not share data well with other systems.

In late 1995, CDC established the Health Information and Surveillance System (HISS) Board to formulate and enact policy for integrating public health information and surveillance systems. Subcommittees of the HISS Board bring together federal and state public health officials to focus on issues such as data standards and coding schemes, legislation for data security, assessing hardware and software used by states, and identifying gaps in CDC databases. As of August 1998, the HISS Board or its subcommittees had identified barriers to implementing effective laboratory reporting standards and some solutions, established mechanisms to assess information needs and gaps in state and local data systems, and begun to assess ways to integrate NETSS and PHLIS.", "CDC provides some training and technical assistance related to NETSS and PHLIS, although state officials we interviewed said such training and assistance are in short supply. Responses to our survey suggest that CDC\u2019s training for these two systems was less widely used and less highly valued than its technical assistance. Nearly all respondents used CDC\u2019s technical assistance for these two programs, while two-thirds of laboratory directors and 82 percent of epidemiologists used the training. Almost half of the epidemiologists and 40 percent of the laboratory directors found the technical assistance highly valuable, but less than 30 percent of either group found the training highly valuable.

The Information Network for Public Health Officials (INPHO) is designed to foster communication between public and private partners, make information more accessible, and allow for rapid and secure exchange of data. By 1997, 14 states had begun INPHO projects. Some had combined these funds with other CDC grant moneys to build statewide networks linking state and local health departments and, in some cases, private laboratories. In New York, state officials developed a network that will link all local health agencies with the state health department and over 4,500 health care facilities and diagnostic laboratories. The network provides electronic mail service and access to surveillance data collected by the state. In Washington, systems for submitting information electronically reduced passive reporting time from 35 days to 1 day and gave local authorities access to health data for analysis.", "In addition to funding specific projects through INPHO grants, in April 1998 CDC adopted a policy that allows states to submit proposals to use disease grant funds to build integrated information systems. As of November, no states had submitted proposals, although several indicated they planned to do so. This initiative involves no new funding but allows states to use money from existing grants in more flexible ways.", "While state officials were supportive of additional CDC efforts in this area, they also recognized that progress in developing effective networks could be affected by the actions\u2014or lack of action\u2014of others in the surveillance network.

They point to outbreaks rapidly identified and contained as visible indications of the system\u2019s strength. Our survey results tend to support this view: surveillance of five of the six emerging infectious diseases we asked about is widespread among states, and surveillance of four of the six is supported by testing in state public health laboratories.
