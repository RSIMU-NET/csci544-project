More than one-half of all sites were in California and Texas, and sites in Arkansas, California, Texas, Nevada, and Utah had some of the highest concentration levels. Yet, most sites had lower levels of contamination; roughly two-thirds of sites had concentration levels at or below the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) provisional cleanup standard of 18 parts per billion. Federal and state agencies are not required to routinely report perchlorate findings to EPA, and EPA does not centrally track or monitor perchlorate detections or the status of cleanup. As a result, a greater number of contaminated sites than we reported may already exist. Although there is no specific federal requirement to clean up perchlorate, EPA and state agencies have used broad authorities under various environmental laws and regulations, as well as state laws and action levels, to sample and clean up and/or require the sampling and cleanup of perchlorate by responsible parties. Further, under certain federal and state environmental laws, private industry may be required to sample for contaminants, such as perchlorate. According to EPA and state officials, private industry and public water suppliers have generally complied with regulations requiring sampling and agency requests to sample. The Department of Defense (DOD) has sampled and cleaned up perchlorate in some locations when required by laws and regulations, but the department has been reluctant to sample on or near active installations under other circumstances. Except where there is a specific legal requirement, DOD's perchlorate sampling policy requires the services to sample only under certain conditions. Cleanup is planned or under way at 51 of the almost 400 perchlorate-contaminated sites identified to date. Since 1998, EPA and DOD have sponsored a number of perchlorate health risk studies using varying study methodologies. We reviewed 90 of these studies that generally examined whether and how perchlorate affected the thyroid. About one-quarter concluded that perchlorate had an adverse effect. In January 2005, NAS reported on the potential health effects of perchlorate and concluded that a total exposure level from all sources, higher than that initially recommended by EPA (a dose equivalent to 1 part per billion in drinking water, assuming that all exposure came from drinking water) may not adversely affect a healthy adult. On the basis of NAS' report, EPA revised its reference dose to a level that is equivalent to 24.5 parts per billion in drinking water (if it is assumed that all exposure comes only from drinking water). The reference dose is not a drinking water standard; it is a scientific estimate of the total daily exposure level from all sources that is not expected to cause adverse effects in humans, including the most sensitive populations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Ammonium perchlorate (perchlorate) is a primary ingredient in solid  rocket propellant and has been used for decades by the Department of  Defense (DOD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), and the defense industry in the manufacturing, testing, and firing  of rockets and missiles.

Perchlorate is a naturally occurring and  manufactured salt that is easily dissolved and transported in water and has  been found in groundwater, surface water, and soil across the country.  Perchlorate has also been found in drinking water and food products, such  as milk and lettuce. Recent health studies have shown that perchlorate can  affect the thyroid gland and may cause developmental delays.", "Due to questions and ongoing debate about the risks of exposing children  and pregnant women to low levels of perchlorate, four federal agencies  asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review and comment on  recent studies of perchlorate and its health effects. In January 2005, NAS  concluded that existing studies did not support a clear link between  perchlorate exposure and adverse health effects. NAS recommended a  perchlorate reference dose\u2014an estimated daily exposure level from all  sources that is not expected to cause adverse effects in humans, including  the most sensitive populations\u2014of 0.0007 milligrams per kilogram of body  weight per day. The dose is equivalent to 2 liters of drinking water per day  containing 24.5 parts per billion of perchlorate when consumed by an adult  weighing 70 kilograms (or 154 pounds), assuming that all perchlorate  exposure comes from drinking water. In February 2005, the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) adopted NAS\u2019 recommended reference dose for  perchlorate, but it has not established a national federal standard for  perchlorate in drinking water or other regulatory requirements to clean up  perchlorate in groundwater, surface water, or soil.", "In this context, we identified (1) the estimated extent of perchlorate found  in the United States; (2) what actions the federal government, state  governments, and responsible parties have taken to clean up or eliminate  the source of perchlorate; and (3) what studies of the potential health risks  from perchlorate have been conducted and, where presented, the author\u2019s  conclusions or findings on the health effects of perchlorate.", "To provide an estimate of the extent of perchlorate found in the United  States, we compiled and analyzed data on perchlorate detections from  EPA, DOD, the U.S. Geological Survey, and state agencies. To identify the  actions governments and responsible parties have taken to clean up and  eliminate the source of the perchlorate, we (1) reviewed federal and state  laws, regulations, and policies on water quality and environmental cleanup  and (2) interviewed EPA officials and selected state agency officials to  identify the authorities they have used to monitor and respond to instances  of perchlorate. We also interviewed EPA and state agency officials on  whether responsible parties have taken action to clean up perchlorate and  reviewed and analyzed data from federal and state agencies to determine  the status and extent of cleanup efforts.

However, our use of this term excludes pollution prevention  efforts, such as the removal of perchlorate from wastewater. To identify  studies of the potential health risks from perchlorate, who conducted them,  and what methodologies were used, we conducted a literature search for  studies of perchlorate health risks published since 1998, interviewed DOD  and EPA officials on what studies they considered important in assessing  perchlorate health risks, and examined the references of each study for  other studies we had not obtained. We identified 125 studies on perchlorate  and the thyroid, of which we reviewed 90 that were relevant to our review.

On the basis of  1998 manufacturer data, EPA estimated that 90 percent of the perchlorate  produced in the United States is manufactured for use by the military and  NASA. Total typical production quantities average several million pounds  per year. Private industry has used perchlorate to manufacture products  such as fireworks, flares, automobile airbags, and commercial explosives.  Perchlorate is a salt, both manufactured and naturally occurring, and is  easily dissolved and transported in water. It has been found in drinking  water, groundwater, surface water, and soil across the country. There is no  national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate. In 1992 and  again in 1995, EPA established a provisional reference dose range for  perchlorate of 0.0001 to 0.0005 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per  day. This converts to a drinking water concentration of between 4 and 18  parts per billion. On the basis of the drinking water conversion, EPA  identified a corresponding provisional cleanup level for perchlorate of  between 4 and 18 parts per billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of Perchlorate Investigation and Study", "paragraphs": ["Perchlorate was initially identified as a contaminant of concern by EPA in  1985, when it was found in wells at hazardous waste sites in California.  Perchlorate became a chemical of regulatory concern in 1997 after  California found perchlorate in the groundwater near Aerojet, a rocket  manufacturer in Rancho Cordova. At the time, perchlorate could not  reliably be detected below 400 parts per billion in water. In April 1997, a  new analytical method capable of detecting perchlorate in drinking water  at concentrations of 4 parts per billion became available. This development  prompted several states to test drinking water, as well as groundwater and  surface water, for perchlorate. Within 2 years, perchlorate had been  detected in drinking water in 3 western states and groundwater and surface  water in 11 states across the United States. Perchlorate in drinking water is  considered a more immediate concern.", "In light of emerging concerns about perchlorate, EPA published in 1998 its  first draft risk assessment on the environmental risks of perchlorate  exposure. In February 1999, an external panel of independent scientists  reviewed EPA\u2019s draft risk assessment and recommended additional studies  and analyses to provide more data on perchlorate and its health effects.  DOD and industry researchers conducted laboratory and field studies of  the health effects of perchlorate and submitted them to EPA. On the basis  of an analysis of these studies, EPA revised its draft perchlorate risk  assessment and released it for peer review and public comment in January  2002. The revised draft risk assessment included a proposed reference dose  equivalent to a concentration of 1 part per billion in drinking water, if it is  assumed all exposure comes only from drinking water. After a second  panel peer review, and some disagreement about the proposed reference  dose, EPA, DOD, NASA, and the Department of Energy asked NAS, in 2003,  to review EPA\u2019s perchlorate risk assessment and key studies of the health  effects of perchlorate. These and other recent health studies have shown  that the consumption of perchlorate affects the human thyroid by  decreasing the amount of iodine absorbed. Iodine deficiency can result in  developmental delays if it occurs during pregnancy and early infancy and  can result in hypothyroidism if it occurs during adulthood. The purpose of  the NAS study was, in part, to assess the extent to which studies have  shown negative health effects from perchlorate.", "In January 2005, NAS reported that existing studies did not support a clear  link between perchlorate exposure and developmental effects, and NAS  recommended additional research on perchlorate exposure and its effect  on children and pregnant women. NAS also recommended a safe exposure  level, or reference dose, for perchlorate of 0.0007 milligrams per kilogram  of body weight per day. (For comparison, EPA\u2019s draft reference dose for  perchlorate in its 2002 draft risk assessment, which equated to a drinking  water concentration of 1 part per billion, was based on a daily dose of  0.00003 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day.) According to  NAS, the reference dose is conservative and includes safeguards to protect  the most sensitive population, the fetus of the nearly iodine-deficient  pregnant woman. In February 2005, EPA established a new reference dose  for perchlorate on the basis of the NAS recommendation. The new  reference dose is equivalent to 24.5 parts per billion in drinking water,  assuming that an adult weighing 70 kilograms (or 154 pounds) consumes 2  liters of drinking water per day, and that all perchlorate ingested comes  from drinking water. If EPA establishes a drinking water standard for  perchlorate, however, it may be less than 24.5 parts per billion because  humans may consume perchlorate from other sources, such as produce  and milk.", "In addition to studies of perchlorate and health effects, other federal  agencies, research groups, and universities have conducted or are  conducting studies of perchlorate found in food and the environment. For  example, the U.S. Geological Survey collected soil samples from California  and New Mexico to test for the presence of perchlorate in natural minerals  and materials. In 2003, an environmental research group reported that it  sampled lettuce purchased in northern California and found perchlorate  above 30 parts per billion in 4 of 22 samples. In September 2003,  researchers from Texas Tech University sampled 8 bottles of milk and 1 can  of evaporated milk and found perchlorate concentrations up to 6 parts per  billion in seven of the milk samples and more than 1 part per billion in the  evaporated milk sample. In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration  sampled the following items for perchlorate: lettuce, bottled water, milk,  tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, and spinach. Produce samples were taken  from areas where officials said they believed irrigation water contained  perchlorate. These data are currently being evaluated, but preliminary  results show perchlorate was found in some samples.", "Method 314.0 is the EPA-approved method for analyzing perchlorate in  drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Method 314.0 can detect  perchlorate concentrations of 1 part per billion in finished (treated)  drinking water but has a minimum reporting limit of 4 parts per billion.  Both EPA and DOD officials have expressed concerns about using Method  314.0 to test for perchlorate in media other than drinking water, such as  groundwater, surface water, and soil (where researchers mix soil with a  liquid to extract the sample). According to EPA, sediment and dissolved  ions commonly found in groundwater and surface water can yield false  positive results if the method is not used properly. Analysis methods other  than Method 314.0 are available, and EPA has approved their use to analyze  specific sites for perchlorate. Further, two new methods have been  developed for the analysis of perchlorate in drinking water, and another is  expected to be available in the spring of 2005. These three methods have  minimum reporting limits ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 parts per billion.  However, Method 314.0 has been the principal method used to test and  report on the presence of perchlorate in all media, including soil, sediment,  groundwater, and surface water.", "Various treatment technologies to remove perchlorate from groundwater  and surface water are in use or under review. Biological treatment and ion  exchange systems are among the technologies currently in use. Biological  treatment uses microbes to destroy perchlorate by converting the  perchlorate ion to nontoxic ions, oxygen, and chloride. Ion exchange  systems replace the perchlorate ion with chloride, which is an ion found in  table salt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Laws, Regulations, and Federal Policy Covering Hazardous Substances", "paragraphs": ["Several federal environmental laws provide EPA, and states authorized by  EPA, with broad authorities to respond to actual or threatened releases of  substances that may endanger public health or the environment. For  example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended, authorizes EPA to investigate  the release of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. The  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) gives EPA  authority to order a cleanup of hazardous waste when there is an imminent  and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment, and one  federal court has ruled that perchlorate is a hazardous waste under RCRA.  The Clean Water Act\u2019s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) provisions authorize EPA, which may, in turn, authorize states, to  regulate the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. These  pollutants may include contaminants such as perchlorate. The Safe  Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to respond to actual or threatened  releases of contaminants into public water systems or underground  sources of drinking water, regardless of whether the contaminant is  regulated or unregulated, where there is an imminent and substantial  endangerment to health and the appropriate state and local governments  have not taken appropriate actions. Under certain environmental laws such  as RCRA, EPA can authorize states to implement the requirements as long  as the state programs are at least equivalent to the federal program and  provide for adequate enforcement. A detailed summary of these and other  laws and regulations is presented in appendix IV.", "In addition, some states have their own environmental and water quality  laws that provide state and local agencies with the authority to monitor,  sample, and require cleanup of various hazardous substances, both  regulated and unregulated, that pose an imminent and substantial danger to  public health. For example, the California Water Code authorizes Regional  Water Control Boards to require sampling of waste discharges and to direct  cleanup and abatement, if necessary, of any threat to water, which may  include the release of a contaminant such as perchlorate.", "DOD\u2019s September 2003 interim policy on perchlorate sampling states that  the military services shall sample for perchlorate where service officials  suspect the presence of perchlorate on the basis of prior or current DOD  activities, and where a complete human exposure pathway is likely to exist.  The policy also states that the services shall sample for perchlorate (1) as  required by the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s Unregulated Contaminant  Monitoring Regulation and the Clean Water Act\u2019s NPDES program and (2)  as part of cleanup conducted under DOD\u2019s Environmental Restoration  Program. While DOD\u2019s policy requires it to sample where the two  conditions of release and exposure are met, it does not specify whether the  services may sample for perchlorate when requested by state agencies or  EPA, apart from requirements under environmental laws and regulations.  Further, except for at a few sites,DOD has not independently directed the  services to clean up perchlorate.

However, DOD\u2019s policy on perchlorate sampling does not address  cleanup. We found DOD has sampled for perchlorate on closed  installations when requested by EPA or a state agency and cleaned up on  active and closed installations when required by a specific environmental  law, regulation, or program, such as the environmental restoration program  at formerly used defense sites. For example, at EPA\u2019s request, the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) installed monitoring wells and is  sampling for perchlorate at Camp Bonneville, a closed installation near  Vancouver, Washington. Utah state officials told us DOD is removing soil  containing perchlorate at the former Wendover Air Force Base in Utah,  where the Corps found perchlorate in 2004.", "According to EPA and state officials, DOD has been reluctant to (1) sample  on or near active installations because there is no specific federal  regulatory standard for perchlorate or (2) sample where DOD determined  the criteria to sample were not met as outlined in its policy. Except where  there is a legal requirement to sample at a particular installation, DOD\u2019s  perchlorate policy does not require sampling unless the two conditions of  release and exposure are met. Utah state officials told us the agency asked  the Department of the Army to sample for perchlorate at two active  installations, Dugway Proving Grounds and Deseret Chemical Depot.  Previously, in 1998, the Army reported that perchlorate had been used at  Dugway for more than 20 years. According to state agency officials, the  Army said there was not a clear potential for human exposure to  perchlorate at these sites, and it would not sample unless a higher Army  level approved the sampling. In February 2005, Utah officials told us  Dugway Proving Grounds had not requested permission from Army  headquarters to sample, and they did not know whether Deseret requested  permission to sample.", "In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, several provisions to federal law were  enacted that encourage DOD to conduct health studies and evaluate  perchlorate found at military sites. For example, the Ronald W. Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 states that the  Secretary of Defense should develop a plan for cleaning up perchlorate  resulting from DOD activities, when the perchlorate poses a health hazard,  and continue evaluating identified sites. In October 2004, DOD and  California agreed to a procedure for prioritizing perchlorate sampling at  DOD facilities in California. The procedure includes steps to identify and  prioritize the investigation of areas on active installations and military sites  (1) where the presence of perchlorate is likely based on previous and  current defense-related activities and (2) near drinking water sources  where perchlorate was found. Although DOD has been urged by Congress  to evaluate sites where the presence of perchlorate is suspected, DOD\u2019s  September 2003 perchlorate policy continues to require sampling on active  installations only where there is a suspected release due to DOD activities  and a likely human exposure pathway, or where required under specific  laws, such as the Clean Water Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA and States Are Cleaning Up, Requiring Cleanup, or Taking Action to Clean Up 51 Sites Where Perchlorate Was Found", "paragraphs": ["EPA, state agencies, and responsible parties are cleaning or planning to  clean up at 51 of the 395 sites we identified.

The cleanup involves extracting and treating up to 26 million gallons of  water per day, after which the water is distributed to several nearby  communities. Texas required Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant, a closed  DOD facility, to clean up by limiting perchlorate releases to a daily average  concentration of 4 parts per billion (and a maximum of 13 parts per billion  per day) under the NPDES program. Kerr-McGee Chemical, a former  perchlorate manufacturer in Nevada, is cleaning up using an ion exchange  system. According to officials, Nevada required the facility to clean up  perchlorate under a state water law after perchlorate concentrations up to  3.7 million parts per billion were found in the groundwater.", "At 28 sites, EPA and state agency officials told us that federal and state  governments and private parties are evaluating the extent of perchlorate  and potential cleanup methodologies. Unidynamics, an Arizona propellant  manufacturer located at a CERCLA site, responded to EPA\u2019s concern about  perchlorate at the site and is investigating perchlorate treatment methods.  According to officials, after Kansas asked Slurry Explosives to clean up  perchlorate under a state environmental law, the manufacturer began  investigating a biological method to clean up.", "The remaining 344 sites are not being cleaned up for a variety of reasons.

Of these 90 studies, 49 used an experimental  design methodology to determine the effects of perchlorate on humans,  mammals, fish, and/or amphibians by exposing these groups to differing  dose amounts of perchlorate over varied periods of time and comparing the  results with other groups that were not exposed. Twelve were field studies  that compared humans, mammals, fish, and/or amphibians in areas known  to be contaminated with the same groups in areas known to be  uncontaminated. Both methodologies have limitations; that is, the  experimental studies were generally short in duration, and the field studies  were generally limited by the researchers\u2019 inability to control whether, how  much, or how long the population in the contaminated areas was exposed.  Finally, 29 studies used a data analysis methodology where researchers  reviewed several publicly available human and animal studies and used  data derived from these studies to determine the process by which  perchlorate affects the human thyroid and the highest exposure levels that  did not adversely affect humans. The 3 remaining studies used another or  unknown methodology.

Only 44  studies had conclusions on whether perchlorate had an adverse effect. Of  these, 29 studies evaluated the effect of perchlorate on development, and  18 found adverse effects resulting from maternal exposure to perchlorate.  Adverse effects of perchlorate on the adult thyroid are difficult to evaluate  because they may happen over longer time periods than can be observed in  a research study. However, the adverse effects of perchlorate on  development can be more easily studied and measured within study time  frames. Moreover, we found different studies used the same perchlorate  dose amount but observed different effects. The different effects were  attributed to variables such as the study design type or age of the subjects,  but the precise cause of the difference is unresolved. Such unresolved  questions are one of the bases for the differing conclusions in EPA, DOD,  and academic studies on perchlorate dose amounts and effects. According  to EPA officials, the most sensitive population for perchlorate exposure is  the fetus of a pregnant woman who is also nearly iodine-deficient.  However, none of the 90 studies we reviewed considered this population.

Most of the studies NAS reviewed were field  studies, the report said, which are limited because they cannot control  whether, how much, or how long a population in a contaminated area is  exposed. NAS concluded that the studies did not support a clear link  between perchlorate exposure and changes in the thyroid function in  newborns and hypothyroidism or thyroid cancer in adults. In its report,  NAS noted that only 1 study examined the relationship between  perchlorate exposure and adverse effects on children, and that no studies  investigated the relationship between perchlorate exposure and adverse  effects on vulnerable groups, such as low-birth-weight infants.

In addition, EPA and state officials  attributed the cause of the perchlorate found at more than one-half of sites  to natural occurrence or undetermined sources. State and other federal  agencies do not always report perchlorate detections to EPA, however,  because EPA, other federal agencies, and the states do not have a  standardized approach for reporting perchlorate data nationwide. As a  result, a greater number of sites with perchlorate may already exist.  Further, EPA does not track the status of cleanup at sites where  perchlorate has been found.

In its letter, EPA stated that it  already had significant information and data on perchlorate concentrations  in various environmental media, where much of the information was  provided by other federal and state agencies as well as private parties. EPA  also asserted that the development and maintenance of a new tracking  system would require additional resources or the redirection of resources  from other activities. To justify a tracking system, EPA would have to  analyze its associated costs and benefits.", "As our report explains, however, state and other federal agencies do not  always report perchlorate detections to EPA. Further, without a formal  system to track and monitor perchlorate findings and cleanup activities,  EPA does not have the most current and complete accounting of  perchlorate as an emerging contaminant of concern. To underscore our  point, in commenting on a draft of this report, DOD provided a listing of  four sites where it found perchlorate between 2000 and 2004. These sites  were not in EPA\u2019s database. (We added these sites to our listing in app. II.)  With regard to the cost benefit aspect of EPA\u2019s comments, we believe that  EPA is misconstruing the extent of work necessary to implement a more  formalized and structured system to track perchlorate. We are not  proposing an elaborate new system but, instead, believe that EPA needs to  work toward a more structured process than what is currently in place to  track and monitor perchlorate routinely. Currently, EPA\u2019s regions are  spending time and effort contacting their counterparts in other federal  agencies and states on an ad hoc basis to obtain more current information  about perchlorate. However, this is being done without any structure or  consistency related to how and when contacts are made, how frequently  they are made, or what specific information is collected. As a result, we  found that EPA does not have complete, current, or accurate information to  track the occurrence of perchlorate\u2014the type of information that would be  needed when making a determination about the need for regulation. We  continue to believe that such information is necessary and that it can be  obtained without an elaborate or costly undertaking.", "In contrast to EPA\u2019s view of our report\u2019s accuracy, DOD said in its April 26,  2005, letter (see app. VI), that our report did not provide an accurate  assessment of perchlorate issues and activities. DOD asserted that our  report mischaracterized DOD\u2019s response to perchlorate and cited examples  of where DOD has sampled and invested in cleanup technologies, even  though perchlorate is currently unregulated. We disagree with DOD\u2019s  position. Our report credits DOD with actions it has taken but also points  out where DOD has not acted. For example, our report acknowledges that  DOD is sampling for perchlorate as required under various environmental  laws, or when certain criteria exist as specified in DOD\u2019s sampling policy;  that is, where the presence of perchlorate is suspected based on prior or  current DOD activities and a complete exposure pathway to humans is  likely to exist. While DOD states that it has a policy that establishes an  affirmative obligation to sample and not a limitation, that view is not  shared by some regulators. As we point out in our report, there have been a  number of instances where EPA or state agencies asked the services to  sample but service officials declined because they did not believe the  conditions met with DOD\u2019s sampling policy. As such, DOD has used its  policy to limit testing for perchlorate that environmental regulators  believed was necessary.", "With regard to DOD\u2019s point that perchlorate is unregulated, we are well  aware that many other contaminants, like perchlorate, are not specifically  regulated, yet are being addressed and cleaned up as hazards under various  environmental laws.", "DOD also stated that we did not accurately summarize the findings of the  NAS study and other scientific and technical data.

DOD stated that  it will continue to share its information on perchlorate. As previously  noted, in commenting on this report, DOD provided information on four  locations where perchlorate has been found, in one case as long as 5 years  ago, and which do not appear on EPA\u2019s list of perchlorate detection sites.

Under RCRA\u2019s corrective  action provisions, facilities seeking or holding RCRA permits can be  required to clean up their hazardous waste contamination. Under RCRA,  EPA has the authority to order a cleanup of hazardous waste when there is  an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the  environment. EPA may authorize states to administer their own programs  in lieu of the federal program, as long as these programs are equivalent to  and consistent with the federal program and provide for adequate  enforcement.

CERCLA provides broad authority to  EPA to respond to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances  or pollutants or contaminants that may endanger public health or the  environment. Under these provisions, DOD has responded to perchlorate  found on military installations and facilities. CERCLA establishes  prohibitions and requirements for contaminated sites; provides for the  liability for hazardous substances at these sites; and provides for the use of  the Hazardous Substances Superfund, a trust fund to provide for cleanup,  for example, when a responsible party cannot be identified.
