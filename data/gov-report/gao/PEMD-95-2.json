This report addresses the Committee\u2019s interest in the current balance of the research effort in the 10 laboratories\u2019 research programs. It examines the extent to which the national laboratories are engaged now in basic and applied research or in research related to commercial product development."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy\u2019s multiprogram laboratories have had missions that are national in scope since their inception during World War II. The original laboratories\u2014Lawrence Berkeley (Calif.), Los Alamos (N. Mex.), and Oak Ridge (Tenn.)\u2014were established as government-owned, contractor-operated institutions to apply the productive capability of private industry to the development of atomic weapons. The weapons-development mission continued during the cold war, and six additional laboratories\u2014Argonne (Ill.), Brookhaven (N.Y.), Sandia (N. Mex. and Calif.), Idaho Engineering (Idaho), Lawrence Livermore (Calif.) and Pacific Northwest (Wash.)\u2014were created between 1946 and 1965 to foster civilian applications of nuclear technology. A 10th laboratory, the Solar Energy Research Institute, was designated a national laboratory in 1991 to expand federal energy research and development (R&D) capability in alternative energy sources, and it was renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Colo.). As a group, the 10 laboratories are known as the national laboratories.", "As the laboratories\u2019 experience and research capability evolved, mission emphases shifted among them. Sandia, Los Alamos, and Lawrence Livermore acquired primary responsibility for nuclear weapons research and development and the largest share of the laboratories\u2019 funds. Responsibility for research in the environmental and biological, energy, and national security areas was distributed among all 10 laboratories to varying degrees. However, the Congress and DOE are reassessing this mission configuration.", "Since 1980, the Congress has had an active interest, expressed in a series of laws, in seeing that more of the national laboratories\u2019 outputs be put to commercial uses. Changing needs for defense technology resulting from the end of the cold war and concern with maintaining U.S industry\u2019s competitiveness in global markets have led several members of Congress to open a public debate and propose new legislation that addresses the national laboratories\u2019 missions, structure, and cooperation with industry.Among the alternatives being considered in the public debate are reducing all the laboratories\u2019 budgets, consolidating or closing some of them, and redirecting their weapons development mission toward commercial product-related R&D in such areas as technology development for environmental restoration, energy, and high-performance computing.", "Underlying these discussions are questions about the type of R&D activities the national laboratories are performing now, the nature and scope of their outputs, and their potential for assisting industry in bringing technology to the marketplace. This report is an effort to inform the debate by providing an empirical base for these questions, as a starting point for addressing the broader issues. It examines whether the balance of laboratories\u2019 effort is in basic and applied research or research related to commercial product development, the distribution of the laboratories\u2019 research outputs, and their potential for commercial application. Findings were based on a cross-section of the laboratories\u2019 R&D activities for the period 1989-92. However, the objectives for most of the programs in the study population were initiated before the national laboratories\u2019 legislative mandate for technology transfer in the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act took effect in late 1989. In most fields of R&D, more than 4 years are required for outputs to evolve after objectives have been established. Therefore, the commercial product-related effort we found is to be considered a baseline against which future activities and outputs can be measured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We began our work by developing a comprehensive description of current research activities in the 10 laboratories. We chose to survey the laboratories directly because we could find no sufficiently comprehensive existing documentation. We collected our data through a survey of the 10 laboratories\u2019 research programs and the facilities and equipment that support them. The survey scope consisted of all major research programs and facilities with costs of at least $10 million, as well as special nominations by the laboratories themselves of other less costly programs and facilities.", "These two criteria were designed to ensure that all large subprograms and smaller subprograms that were important to the laboratories\u2019 missions would be included in our sample. This allowed us to describe the laboratories\u2019 major research efforts. However, findings based on these criteria should not be considered representative of a laboratory\u2019s entire research effort since the proportion of programs budgeted at less than $10 million can vary from one laboratory to another.", "DOE\u2019s Budget and Reporting System categories provided a common classification scheme for the laboratories\u2019 12 research programs, which permitted cross-laboratory comparisons of program characteristics. Research program and subprogram names are shown in table 1. The data we collected on these programs covered fiscal years 1989-92.", "We conducted pilot tests of the survey methodology and data collection instruments at Brookhaven and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We then revised the instrument and administered one version to the remaining eight laboratories. After we processed the survey responses, we asked each laboratory to confirm by letter that our list of research programs and facilities was, in fact, complete.", "The national laboratories engage in a wide range of defense and nondefense R&D-related activities. These range from generating hypotheses and testing fundamental science principles to assisting a potential user in adapting laboratory outputs to a production or service delivery system. To analyze the extent to which the laboratories are engaged in basic and applied research or research related to commercial product development, we divided their activities into five categories: basic research, applied research, development, technology transfer, and technical assistance.", "Basic research is research undertaken primarily to gain fuller knowledge or understanding of a subject and to contribute to the knowledge base in the field of investigation. Applied research is research directed toward the practical use of knowledge or understanding of a subject to meet a recognized need. Development is research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes or processes. Development has some type of product as the output goal, but may conclude with a prototype rather than a usable good. Additional time, research, and testing are usually required to convert the prototype to a weapon or commercially viable product.", "Because the national laboratories perform R&D only through the development stage, additional mechanisms and arrangements are required to achieve application of the laboratories\u2019 outputs in the public or private sector. These activities are technology transfer and technical assistance. Technology transfer is the process that fosters the use of devices, processes, \u201cknow-how,\u201d or scientific and technical information produced in a national laboratory by universities, private industry, or government agencies. It includes making potential users aware of the laboratories\u2019 research outputs, assisting in their selection or use, and collaborating with representatives of private industry and public or nonprofit institutions to ensure that some of the laboratories\u2019 outputs will have commercial or public applications. Technical assistance applies the laboratory\u2019s expertise to practical problems but does not involve the use of a laboratory\u2019s outputs. It is any form of assistance, other than financial, to a state or local government or a business, including publications, workshops, conferences, studies, or telephone consultation.", "Development, technical assistance, and technology transfer are the three national laboratory research activities related to commercial product development. All five categories, already used by the laboratories but specially grouped for our analysis, constitute a natural framework that, together with DOE\u2019s program classification scheme, allowed us to look at R&D-related activity across all 10 laboratories, using expenditures as a measure of activity.", "Recognizing that the laboratories do not maintain records of their R&D expenditures in terms of our five categories, we asked managers of the subprograms in our study population to estimate, for each subprogram they managed, the proportion of funds expended in each of the five areas. Our analysis of R&D activity is therefore presented as percentages, not actual dollar values. To provide a context for considering our findings, we present in table 2 the fiscal year 1992 budgets for subprograms in the study population that were included in our analysis and the laboratories\u2019 total budgets in fiscal year 1992.", "We also examined the laboratories\u2019 outputs. As output measures, we selected products of laboratory R&D that were clearly identifiable to our respondents and for which they were likely to maintain records. Since our study objective was to examine the balance among laboratory activities rather than their impact, we focused on outputs of R&D activity that occurred within the laboratories rather than their efforts at job creation or increased sales. Because of great variation in the size, scope, field of investigation and funding level of the subprograms in the study population, both within and among laboratories, we presented our findings as simple tabulations, rather than as standardized units. Use of a single measure for standardizing the outputs, such as dollar of funding per output, would have failed to account for variations among the subprograms on other dimensions. Moreover, because of the institutional complexity this variation represents, we interpreted our output findings very conservatively, treating them as measures of activity rather than indicators of performance. We looked at the outputs in two broad categories: (1) publications and reports and (2) outputs related to commercial product development. The outputs attributed to each category are described in the Principal Findings section.", "Finally, we looked at three other indicators\u2014the formation of cooperative R&D agreements, R&D effort devoted to critical technologies, and program managers\u2019 assessment of their on-going research\u2014to gauge the laboratories\u2019 potential for commercial product development.", "We conducted our review in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principal Findings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Balance Among R&D-Related Activities", "paragraphs": ["To examine the balance of the national laboratories\u2019 current R&D-related activities, we analyzed the distribution of laboratory expenditures for R&D within and among laboratories and research programs. For the 10 laboratories overall, R&D-related activity was almost evenly divided between basic and applied research on the one hand, and research related to commercial product development on the other. Approximately 8 percent more of the effort was devoted to R&D activities related to commercial product development, as shown in figure 1. More applied research than basic research was conducted: 27.2 percent versus 17.4 percent. Among research activities related to commercial product development, most (30.9 percent) was development, but more activity was devoted to technical assistance (14.4 percent) than technology transfer (7 percent). Thus, R&D-related activity directly targeted on potential commercial applications of the laboratories\u2019 outputs currently constitutes the smallest proportion of the laboratories\u2019 R&D-related effort. Despite its small size, however, this level of effort exceeds the laboratories\u2019 minimum statutory requirement for technology transfer activity.", "These overall percentages, however, mask major differences among the laboratories with regard to R&D funding distribution. (See table IV.1 in appendix IV.) Four laboratories\u2014Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, Oak Ridge, and Brookhaven\u2014spent 25 percent or more of their research funds on basic research. These laboratories account for over half (59.3 percent) of the total national laboratory research budget that is spent on basic research. (See table IV.2.) Los Alamos spent 19.4 percent of its R&D funds to support its mission to perform \u201cbasic research in selected disciplines that help maintain an outstanding science and technology base.\u201d Only about 10 percent or less of the laboratory research budget was spent on basic research at the other laboratories. The energy research program accounted for the greatest proportion of funds spent on basic research, both within and among research program areas. (See tables IV.3 and IV.4.)", "As table IV.1 shows, four laboratories\u2014Oak Ridge, Pacific Northwest, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos\u2014spent 29 percent or more of their research funds on applied research. Among the 10 laboratories, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos accounted for almost half (47.9 percent) of applied research expenditures. (See table IV.2.) Most applied research was supported by programs in the areas of defense, energy research, and work for others. (See table IV.4.)", "As noted earlier, most of the laboratories\u2019 development work, the most product-oriented of R&D activities, was devoted to defense, rather than nondefense, research. Almost three-quarters (71.5 percent) of all the laboratories\u2019 development research was conducted at Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia. (See table IV.2.) In turn, the largest share of development research was performed in the defense and nuclear energy programs. (See tables IV.3 and IV.4.) Therefore, while it is true that across the 10 laboratories, a greater proportion of research funding was devoted to activities more closely related to commercial product development than to basic and applied research, most of these funds currently support defense research. To determine whether this research will have commercial opportunities for use, we examined the national laboratories\u2019 outputs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Laboratories\u2019 R&D Outputs", "paragraphs": ["A second measure of the type of effort in which the national laboratories are engaged\u2014as between basic and applied research or research related to commercial product development\u2014is output. The laboratories produce two major types of outputs: (1) publications and reports, and (2) outputs related to commercial product development. Table 3 shows that, across a 4-year period, most of the laboratories\u2019 outputs were publications and reports. This finding was expected because reports and publications are the primary mechanisms for diffusion of R&D findings, and they are prepared at all stages of the R&D process. Reports, conference papers, and published articles, which can be produced more quickly than books and book chapters, substantially outnumber the latter.", "As we discussed above, a slightly higher percentage of the laboratories\u2019 expenditures was devoted to R&D activities related to commercial product development than to basic and applied research; nevertheless, few of their outputs were commercial product-related. Prototype devices and materials, algorithms, and software are the largest number of outputs in this group. These outputs tend to arise from the development stage of the R&D process, which often occurs several years before production of a marketable or usable good. Not all outputs of the development stage will, of course, achieve commercial application.", "Most of the prototype devices and materials, algorithms, and software, as indicated in tables V.1 and V.2 in appendix V, were produced at the weapons laboratories, and most were funded by DOE\u2019s defense program. Other outputs laboratory managers identified as commercial products or commercial processes also tend to arise from the development stage. Although they will require a substantial additional investment before they are ready to market, these products or processes will more likely result in actual commercial applications because a potential commercial use has already been identified. Most of these outputs were produced by Los Alamos, Sandia, and Pacific Northwest, and the defense program supports most of the research that has led to these outputs. The point here is that although defense-funded R&D has produced more outputs that could lead to commercial products, whether these outputs will achieve commercial application is still unknown.", "Patent applications may be submitted for inventions throughout the entire R&D process, but a license is usually acquired only when a decision to market a technology has been made. The number of licenses awarded, therefore, is a stronger measure of output activity related to commercial product development than the number of patents. A trend in the data indicative of the laboratories\u2019 production of outputs related to commercial product development is the increase in the number of licenses awarded during fiscal years 1989 through 1992. (See table 3.) In fiscal year 1992, Sandia and Pacific Northwest awarded the most licenses, and most licensed outputs were supported by defense program research. (See tables V.1 and V.2.)", "We expected to find that most commercial product-related outputs were supported by research programs that spent most of their R&D funds for development. However, the R&D expenditures of those programs that supported the most outputs related to commercial product development covered the range of R&D activities. We found that in fiscal year 1992, four research programs\u2014energy research, conservation and renewable energy, defense, and work for others\u2014supported most of the commercial product-related outputs of all types and that, over 4 years, commercial product-related output production had been increasing each year in three of the programs, as shown in figure V.1. We also found that in fiscal year 1992, the largest proportion of expenditures in the defense and conservation and renewable energy programs was for development.", "As expected, the defense and conservation and renewable energy programs supported more of the outputs specifically designated as commercial products and processes than any of the 10 other research programs. However, in looking more closely at these four programs, we found some interesting differences. Work for others, which supports more commercial product and process-type outputs than eight other programs, devoted a slightly higher proportion of R&D expenditures to applied research than to development. But in energy research, which supports more commercial product- and process-related outputs than nine other programs, the largest proportion of expenditures was for basic research.

Of these three, the most frequently used indicator of the national laboratories\u2019 potential for commercial product development is the formation of CRADAs. Here we found a major increase in activity. The national laboratories reported that from fiscal year 1989 through 1992, they entered into 196 CRADAs. Among programs in the study population in operation all 4 years, the number of new CRADAs formed increased from 17 in fiscal 1989 to 130 in fiscal 1992.", "Sandia and Oak Ridge laboratories were most active in entering into CRADAs. (See table VI.1. in appendix VI.) Most were formed for research sponsored by programs in the defense and conservation and renewable energy areas. (See table VI.2.) The greatest increase in CRADA formation occurred at Sandia, where 74 CRADAs were in effect in fiscal year 1992. Fifty-three of the CRADAs effective in fiscal year 1992 were sponsored by the defense program technology transfer initiative at Sandia. This subprogram was initiated in June 1990 to identify opportunities for commercializing technologies produced by DOE-funded defense research activities in such areas as advanced manufacturing and precision engineering, materials and processes, advanced microelectronics and photonics, and computer architecture and applications.", "Although the national laboratories do not yet have a legislative mandate or mission for research in the critical technologies, their research program managers reported that 74.1 percent of R&D expenditures are devoted to work in critical technology areas. This research was distributed over the 22 areas identified by the National Critical Technologies Panel, with the greatest concentration in energy technologies (13.6 percent); pollution minimization, remediation, and waste management (8.8 percent); computer simulation and modeling (6.7 percent); and materials synthesis and processing (6.2 percent). (See table VI.3.)", "Work in these critical technology areas was distributed broadly among the laboratories and research programs. Five laboratories\u2014Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, Oak Ridge, Idaho, and Lawrence Livermore\u2014devoted approximately 20-30 percent of their research funds to energy technologies. (See table VI.3.) Pacific Northwest expended the greatest proportion of R&D funds (41.3 percent) on pollution minimization technologies. Idaho and Lawrence Livermore were most active in computer simulation and modeling. Oak Ridge and Los Alamos devoted the greatest percentage of effort to materials synthesis and processing. As a group, the laboratories devoted approximately three-fourths of their R&D expenditures to research in critical technology areas, but Sandia and Los Alamos expended only about half of their resources on critical technologies research. All of the research programs sponsored research in critical technologies to some degree, with the least effort expended by environment, safety, and health. (See table VI.4.)", "Finally, laboratory research program managers\u2019 judgments about their research programs\u2019 potential for commercial product development were optimistic. Among the subset of all national laboratory programs with a potential for commercial product development, almost 58 percent of the program managers expected that development to occur within 5 years of fiscal 1992. (See figure VI.1.) An additional 27.6 percent reported that their program has the potential for commercial product development within 5-10 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As of 1992, the national laboratories spent slightly more than half of their R&D funds on research related to commercial product development.

CRADA formation was increasing, but these arrangements ensure only that collaboration between the laboratories and industry will occur, not that a commercial product will be generated. Almost three-fourths of the laboratories\u2019 effort was devoted to research in critical technology areas, but achievement of commercial application will not be known for several years. Over half of the managers of research subprograms that have commercial product potential expected innovations to arise within 5 years, but these expectations must be considered \u201cbest educated guesses.\u201d While we can conclude, therefore, that the national laboratories\u2019 were engaged in slightly more research related to commercial product development than basic and applied research, it is too early to determine whether this activity will produce technologies with commercial uses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft report and received a response from DOE and the 10 national laboratories. DOE questioned the definitions and categories we defined to analyze the laboratories\u2019 R&D-related activities and our finding that the laboratories perform slightly more research related to commercial product development than basic and applied research. DOE also thought that this study should have examined additional institutional factors, including the R&D activities of other agencies, and should have used data maintained by DOE headquarters rather than surveyed the laboratories for data.", "We note that the definitions for R&D-related activities we employed are derived from a Congressional Budget Office study of the federal R&D enterprise, our study of the Technology Transfer Act of 1986, and expert opinion. We also disagree with DOE\u2019s proposed broader scope for this study because it exceeds our study objective and would have required additional data collection and analyses that are beyond the study scope. Furthermore, our exploration of data available at DOE headquarters found that it was not adequate to satisfy our information needs.", "Eight laboratories agreed with the report\u2019s objective, analyses, and conclusions. However, one of this group, Lawrence Berkeley, thought that the relationship of commercial product development to the broader needs of industry and the nation should have been addressed in the study. Two of the laboratories raised issues about study methodology. Idaho believed that a greater proportion of the budget for its subprograms should have been included in the study sample. Oak Ridge questioned the effect of the study\u2019s sampling methodology on output findings for the laboratory and the definition of the category called outputs related to commercial product development.", "Lawrence Berkeley said that we had overlooked an important issue. The laboratory thought that the study should have included an examination of the relationship of the national laboratories\u2019 role in commercial product development to the broader needs of industry and the nation. We agree that this issue is important to address as part of the public debate about the laboratories\u2019 missions and structure. However, we disagree that it should have been examined in this report, which focuses on establishing an empirical baseline of national laboratories\u2019 activities.", "DOE\u2019s Idaho Operations Office responded for Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The Idaho Operations Office said that the budget figure reported for Idaho subprograms included in the study sample should have been higher. We did not agree to revise Idaho\u2019s budget figure, because to do so would have violated the study methodology used to sample programs at other laboratories.", "Oak Ridge took the position that most of its commercial product-related outputs were produced by subprograms that were not selected in the study sample because they were funded at less than $10 million. The laboratory expressed concern that the subprograms we sampled produced only 7 percent of its commercial product-related outputs while representing 73 percent of its overall budget. Oak Ridge based this position on summary output data for the entire laboratory and sampled subprograms that laboratory representatives had tabulated. Again, we could not include the output data for Oak Ridge\u2019s unsampled programs in our analyses without violating the sampling methodology. We also had some questions about the large number of outputs the Oak Ridge analysis ascribed to unsampled programs.", "Oak Ridge also thought that our definitions for these outputs equated the laboratories\u2019 development work with commercial product development. We disagree. The definitions we used make it clear that the laboratories were not expected to produce commercial products.

"subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The definitions for basic research, applied research, and development that our study employs are derived from a Congressional Budget Office study of the federal R&D enterprise. The definition of technology transfer is the one used in our study of the Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and the definition of technical assistance is based on expert opinion. Our analysis examined the laboratories\u2019 effort in each type of activity separately, and grouped, in two major categories, in order to address the study objective: to provide an empirical base for examining the extent to which the laboratories are engaged in basic and applied research or research related to commercial product development. Figure 1 and tables IV.1-IV.4 allow the reader to view our findings in both the two major categories and as separate R&D-related activities. The finding for each major category presented in figure 1 is the sum of the findings for the corresponding separate R&D-related activities presented in the last column of table IV.1.", "DOE disagrees with the category we established for \u201cresearch related to commercial product development\u201d\u2014that is, that development, technical assistance, and technology transfer are all laboratory activities related to commercial product development\u2014but does not question our definitions or findings for each separate activity. We agree that DOE may decline to accept our definition for research related to commercial product development, but we do not agree that our finding for the sum of the three separate activities is erroneous. This finding is based on laboratory research managers\u2019 estimates of the distribution of their subprograms\u2019 expenditures that were collected, verified, and analyzed according to generally accepted government auditing standards. We consider these estimates, made by research managers who are closely involved with the R&D, more accurate than estimates that may be obtained by other methods. 2. The analyses we produced were intended to establish baseline data for addressing empirical questions underlying the public debate, rather than to serve as a comprehensive analysis of the laboratories\u2019 roles. To address the study objective, we focused on the 10 laboratories as a set of institutions, on comparing the distribution of expenditures for five types of R&D-related activities both within and among the 10 laboratories, on the nature and scope of their outputs, and on their potential for working with industry to bring commercial products to market. Given this approach, with the exception of expenditures for critical technologies and collaboration with industry, which we do examine, the other factors DOE suggests for analysis are beyond the scope of this study. However, we anticipate that our study might stimulate another party to undertake the type of institutional, comparative analysis that DOE suggests. 3. We agree with DOE that the laboratories collaborate in R&D with industry partners who then perform the additional testing and research activities required for commercial application. We also agree that \u201cit typically should take years from the conclusion of a CRADA and the transfer of a technology to a partner, to the commercialization of a product.\u201d The explicit definitions of terms and the discussion of CRADAs in the report make this clear. (See pp. 6, 12, and 15.) However, we disagree that the report attributes commercial product development work to the national laboratories. 4. We state in the section on Methodology that we began our work with a survey of the laboratories\u2019 R&D activities because we could find no sufficiently comprehensive (emphasis added) existing documentation. To confirm that we had not overlooked an important information source when we designed and implemented our data collection strategy, we made inquiries about DOE\u2019s institutional plan and research and development databases. We found that DOE headquarters maintains only the institutional plan database and that it includes only one of the data items, research program budget, that we used in our report. This budget information was available for fiscal years 1989-91 when we implemented our survey but would not have been useful for our analyses because it is not compiled at the same level of detail as our data.", "We also found that the research and development database is not one of DOE\u2019s databases. It is being developed by the Critical Technologies Institute for the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the Executive Office of the President. When it is complete, it will have five data items analogous to our data. However, this database was not available when we developed our national laboratory inventory and is not now available to users other than OSTP. Forty-one of the items in our report are not included in either the institutional plan or research and development databases.", "The Laboratory Management Division in DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Research maintains the institutional plan database. It has research program budget data for fiscal years 1979 to the present at the program level for 9 of the 10 national laboratories, and it has subprogram budget data for selected programs, such as energy research, defense programs, civilian radioactive waste management, and work for others. Because they are incomplete at the subprogram level, these data would not have been useful for our R&D-related activities and critical technologies analyses, which required budget data for all subprograms in our sample. Further, none of the budget data for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are included in the institutional plan database. These data must be obtained from NREL\u2019s hardcopy institutional plan, which is available from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at headquarters.", "The Critical Technologies Institute\u2019s research and development database will have information on laboratory expenditures for basic research, applied research, development, and technology transfer for research subprogram categories analogous, but not identical, to those we used, and on CRADAs\u2014for the national laboratories as well as for the laboratories of several other federal agencies\u2014when it is available to organizations other than OSTP. The Critical Technologies Institute representative to whom we spoke could not specify when the database will be available. However, the research and development database will not have information comparable to the 16 research subprogram outputs we collected from the laboratories nor on the proportion of subprogram expenditures for the 22 critical technologies and the proportion of expenditures for technical assistance.", "We are also aware that abstracts of CRADA agreements can be obtained through DOE headquarters from the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, which is based in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. However, we also found these data to be incomplete. In August 1992, we requested these data through DOE\u2019s Office of Technology Utilization at headquarters and received 147 abstracts for the nine laboratories from which we collected CRADA information\u201449 fewer than the total the laboratories reported to us. Since the fiscal year was not then complete, we assumed that all CRADA information had not yet been reported to DOE or entered into the database.", "Our experience developing the survey frame, moreover, suggested that the laboratories\u2019 institutional plan data needed modification to address our study requirements and that the information available from DOE was not consistent with information available from the laboratories. We used the list of research programs included in the institutional plans as a preliminary frame for part I of the survey. Recognizing that the laboratories are dynamic institutions, we asked each laboratory to confirm the list before survey implementation. Most of the laboratories made both deletions and additions to the list to meet our survey selection criteria. (See p. 4.) We used the lists of facilities reported in the DOE report, Capsule Review of DOE Research and Development Laboratories and Field Facilities, as a preliminary frame for part II of the survey. The laboratories made deletions and additions to these lists as well and in two cases almost completely replaced them. Changes of this magnitude confirmed the strategy of collecting data directly from the laboratories to address our study\u2019s information requirements. 5. During the agency review of our draft report, two laboratories provided us with additional CRADA information, bringing the total number of CRADAs in effect among all programs in operation in any year from fiscal year 1989 to 1992 to 196. (See table VI.1.) This total is the number of CRADAs in effect in fiscal year 1992, rather than \u201cnow,\u201d to which DOE refers and which we assume is fiscal year 1994. Moreover, we found a substantial increase in CRADA formation in fiscal year 1992, sponsored by DOE\u2019s defense program technology transfer initiative at Sandia. (See tables VI.1 and VI.2.) It is possible that the increase we found persisted and included more laboratories, bringing the total to 1,000 in fiscal year 1994. However, such a change would not render our finding for fiscal year 1992 inaccurate. 6. Brookhaven brought it to our attention that the number of CRADAs formed is limited by the amount of money allocated to a laboratory and that this amount varies widely from laboratory to laboratory. We agree with Brookhaven that characterizing CRADA formation as the \u201cstrongest\u201d indicator of a laboratory\u2019s commercial product potential is misleading for this reason, and we have modified our discussion of CRADA findings.", "Scientific user facilities and personnel exchanges will be examined in a separate study. Licensing is described in the section on Principal Findings of this report. (See pp. 13-14.) CRADAs are cost-shared cooperative agreements targeted to a commercial innovation. 7. We treat laboratory outputs as measures of activity, not as measures of impact or productivity. (See pp. 7-8.) 8. We found that the 10 laboratories produced many more publications and reports (21,593) than they did outputs related to commercial product development (2,510) in fiscal year 1992. This is a statement of fact, tabulated from reports to us by the laboratories\u2019 research managers. It describes the laboratories\u2019 activity. It is not intended as a criticism of the research enterprise. 9. The purpose of this report was to examine the balance of R&D-related activity across the laboratories, rather than to examine the magnitude of the R&D investment. We used the proportion of funds expended for each type of R&D-related activity as a measure of activity, not as a measure of investment. (See pp. 6-7.)

Most of these outputs, they explained, are produced by programs that fall below the $10-million threshold for inclusion in the survey. In fact, according to tabulations they had performed, the sampled programs, while representing 73 percent of the overall budget, produce only 7 percent of the outputs in question.", "Secondly, Oak Ridge thought that the report\u2019s definitions and analyses equate development work with commercial product development and that the conclusion based on this definition is not supported by the data.
