On January 1, 2006, Medicare began providing this benefit, and beneficiaries have until May 15, 2006, to enroll without the risk of penalties. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Part D benefit, has undertaken outreach and education efforts to inform beneficiaries and their advisers. GAO was asked to discuss how CMS can better ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are informed about the Part D benefit. This testimony is based on Medicare: CMS Communications to Beneficiaries on the Prescription Drug Benefit Could Be Improved, GAO-06-654 (May 3, 2006)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Information given in the six sample documents that GAO reviewed describing the Part D benefit was largely complete and accurate, although this information lacked clarity. First, about 40 percent of seniors read at or below the fifth-grade level, but the reading levels of these documents ranged from seventh grade to postcollege. Second, on average, the six documents we reviewed did not comply with about half of 60 common guidelines for good communication. For example, the documents used too much technical jargon and often did not define difficult terms. Moreover, 16 beneficiaries and advisers that GAO tested reported frustration with the documents' lack of clarity and had difficulty completing the tasks assigned to them. Customer service representatives (CSRs) answered about two-thirds of the 500 calls GAO placed to CMS's 1-800-MEDICARE help line accurately and completely. Of the remainder, 18 percent of the calls received inaccurate responses, 8 percent of the responses were inappropriate given the question asked, and about 3 percent received incomplete responses. In addition, about 5 percent of GAO's calls were not answered, primarily because of disconnections. The accuracy and completeness of CSRs' responses varied significantly across the five questions. For example, while CSRs provided accurate and complete responses to calls about beneficiaries' eligibility for financial assistance 90 percent of the time, the accuracy rate for calls concerning the drug plan that would cost the least for a beneficiary with specified prescription drug needs was 41 percent. For this question, the CSRs responded inappropriately for 35 percent of the calls by explaining that they could not identify the least costly plan without the beneficiary's personal information--even though CSRs had the information needed to answer the question. The time GAO callers waited to speak with CSRs also varied, ranging from no wait time to over 55 minutes. For 75 percent of the calls--374 of the 500--the wait was less than 5 minutes. The Part D benefit portion of the Medicare Web site can be difficult to use. GAO's test of the site's overall usability--the ease of finding needed information and performing various tasks--resulted in scores of 47 percent for seniors and 53 percent for younger adults, out of a possible 100 percent. While there is no widely accepted benchmark for usability, these scores indicate that using the site can be difficult. For example, the prescription drug plan finder was complicated to use and some of its key functions, such as \"continue\" and \"choose a drug plan,\" were often not visible on the page without scrolling down."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you discuss the Medicare outpatient  prescription drug benefit, known as the Part D benefit, which was  established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003 with coverage beginning on January 1, 2006.  Until this time, Medicare, the program that finances health care benefits  for about 42 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, had not generally  provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Beneficiaries who opt  to enroll in Part D may choose a drug plan from those offered by private  plan sponsors under contract to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), which administers the Part D benefit. These plans differ in  the drugs covered, pharmacies used, and enrollee costs. As of   April 20, 2006, more than 30 million of Medicare\u2019s 42 million beneficiaries  were enrolled in a Part D plan or had other outpatient prescription drug  coverage. Beneficiaries have until the end of the current enrollment  period, May 15, 2006, to enroll in the Part D benefit and select a plan  without the risk of penalties in the form of higher premiums.", "Given the newness and complexity of the Part D benefit, it is critical that  beneficiaries and their advisers, including members of their families,  understand the options available to them. Understanding these options  enables beneficiaries to make informed decisions on whether to enroll in  the Part D benefit, and if they decide to enroll, which drug plan to choose.  As part of its responsibilities, CMS has undertaken efforts to provide  beneficiaries and their advisers with the information they need about the  Part D benefit through various media, including written documents, the   1-800-MEDICARE help line, and the Medicare Web site. CMS\u2019s education  efforts are important because widespread confusion has been reported  among beneficiaries about the costs and coverage under the new benefit.", "You and others have expressed interest in ensuring that Medicare  beneficiaries receive the information they need to make informed  decisions. My remarks today will focus on (1) the extent to which CMS\u2019s  written documents describe the Part D benefit in a clear, complete, and  accurate manner; (2) the effectiveness of CMS\u2019s 1-800-MEDICARE help  line in providing accurate, complete, and prompt responses to callers  inquiring about the Part D benefit; and (3) whether CMS\u2019s Medicare Web  site presents information on the Part D benefit in a usable manner. My  testimony will summarize findings of a report we released yesterday that  examines CMS\u2019s Medicare Part D benefit communications to beneficiaries  in more detail and includes recommendations to the CMS Administrator  for improving the quality of the agency\u2019s Part D benefit education and  outreach materials.", "To address these issues, we interviewed CMS officials responsible for  written documents about the Part D benefit, the 1-800-MEDICARE help  line, and the Medicare Web site. To assess the clarity, completeness, and  accuracy of written documents, we performed an in-depth review of a  sample of six CMS documents describing the Part D benefit, including  contracting with the American Institutes for Research (AIR), a firm with  experience in evaluating written documents, to assess their clarity. (See  app. I for a list of written documents reviewed.) We also placed 500 calls  to 1-800-MEDICARE, posing one of five questions related to the Part D  benefit in each call so that each question was asked 100 times. We  evaluated the accuracy and completeness of customer service  representatives\u2019 (CSR) responses to these questions. (See app. II for the  questions and criteria we used to evaluate the accuracy and completeness  of CSR responses to calls we made to 1-800 MEDICARE.) To assess the  usability of the Part D benefit information available on the Medicare Web  site, we contracted with the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g), an expert on  Web design. We conducted our work from November 2005 through   May 2006, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, CMS successfully developed a large volume of information  about the new Part D benefit and made it available to beneficiaries  through a variety of sources, despite the challenge of developing this  information within a short time frame. However, the quality of CMS\u2019s  communications to beneficiaries and their advisers about the Part D  benefit could be improved. For example, although the six CMS written  documents we reviewed were largely accurate and complete, they often  lacked clarity. Specifically, while about 40 percent of seniors read at or  below the fifth-grade level, the reading levels of the documents ranged  from seventh grade to postcollege. Moreover, the six documents used too  much technical jargon and often did not define difficult terms. Similarly,  although 67 percent of the responses to the 500 calls we placed to CMS\u2019s   1-800-MEDICARE help line regarding the Part D benefit were accurate and  complete, we nonetheless received a substantial number of responses that  were not. Eighteen percent of the calls received inaccurate responses,   8 percent of the responses were inappropriate given the question asked,  about 3 percent received incomplete responses, and about 5 percent of our  calls were not answered, primarily due to disconnections. In addition, our  review of the Part D benefit portion of the Medicare Web site showed that  this site can be difficult to use. In usability tests that examined the ease of  finding needed information and performing various tasks, we found that,  for overall usability, the Web site scored 47 percent for seniors and   53 percent for younger adults, out of a possible 100 percent. While there is  no widely accepted benchmark for usability, these scores indicate that  using the site can be difficult. Therefore, in the report we issued yesterday,  we made specific recommendations to the CMS Administrator to enhance  the quality of the agency\u2019s communications on the Part D benefit,  including clarifying written materials, monitoring the accuracy and  completeness of CSR\u2019s responses to callers\u2019 inquiries, and improving the  usability of the Part D benefit portion of the Medicare Web site. In its  comments on a draft of our report (see app. III), CMS said that it supports  the goals of our recommendations and is already taking steps to  implement them. However, CMS said that our findings did not present a  complete and accurate picture of its Part D benefit communications  activities. We believe that our report provides an accurate examination of  the CMS communications mechanisms that have the greatest impact on  beneficiaries (see app. IV)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["CMS has undertaken steps to educate beneficiaries about the Part D  benefit using written documents, a toll-free help line, and the Medicare  Web site.

Medicare  & You\u2014the beneficiary handbook\u2014is the most widely available and was  sent directly to beneficiaries in October 2005. Other written documents  were targeted to specific groups of beneficiaries, such as dual-eligible  beneficiaries and beneficiaries with Medicare Advantage or Medigap  policies.", "Beneficiaries can obtain answers to questions about the Part D benefit by  calling the 1-800-MEDICARE help line. This help line, which is  administered by CMS, was established in March 1999, to answer  beneficiaries\u2019 questions about the Medicare program. As of December  2005, about 7,500 CSRs were handling calls on the help line, which  operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is run by two CMS  contractors. CMS provides CSRs with detailed scripts to use in answering  the questions. Call center contractors write the scripts, and CMS checks  them for accuracy and completeness.", "In addition, CMS\u2019s Medicare Web site provides information about various  aspects of the Medicare program. The Web site contains basic information  about the Part D benefit, suggests factors for beneficiaries to consider  when choosing plans and provides guidance on enrollment and plan  selection. It also lists frequently asked questions, and allows users to view,  print, or order publications. In addition, the site contains information on  cost and coverage of individual plans.

As a result, these documents are challenging for many  seniors. Even after adjusting the text for 26 multisyllabic words, such as  Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Social Security Administration, the  estimated reading level ranged from seventh to twelfth grade, a reading  level that would remain challenging for at least 40 percent of seniors.", "Second, on average, the six documents we reviewed did not comply with  about half of the 60 commonly recognized guidelines for good  communications.

The 11 beneficiaries and   5 advisers we tested reported frustration with the documents\u2019 lack of  clarity as they encountered difficulties in understanding and attempting to  complete 18 specified tasks. For example, none of these beneficiaries and  only 2 of the advisers were able to complete the task of computing their  projected total out-of-pocket costs for a plan that provided Part D  standard coverage.

However, CMS has not ensured that its communications to  beneficiaries and their advisers are provided in a manner that is  consistently clear, complete, accurate, and usable. Although the initial  enrollment period for the Part D benefit will end on May 15, 2006, CMS  will continue to play a pivotal role in providing beneficiaries with  information about the drug benefit in the future.

CMS said that it did not believe our findings presented a  complete and accurate picture of its Part D communications activities.  CMS discussed several concerns regarding our findings on its written  documents and the 1-800-MEDICARE help line. However, CMS did not  disagree with our findings regarding the Medicare Web site or the role of  SHIPs. CMS also said that it supports the goals of our recommendations  and is already taking steps to implement them, such as continually  enhancing and refining its Web-based tools.", "CMS discussed concerns regarding the completeness and accuracy of our  findings in terms of activities we did not examine, as well as those we did.  CMS stated that our findings were not complete because our report did  not examine all of the agency\u2019s efforts to educate Medicare beneficiaries  and specifically mentioned that we did not examine the broad array of  communication tools it has made available, including the development of  its network of grassroots partners throughout the country. We recognize  that CMS has taken advantage of many vehicles to communicate with  beneficiaries and their advisers. However, we focused our work on the  four specific mechanisms that we believed would have the greatest impact  on beneficiaries\u2014written materials, the 1-800-MEDICARE help line, the  Medicare Web site, and the SHIPs.

Although we appreciate CMS\u2019s efforts to improve its Part D  communications to beneficiaries on an ongoing basis, we believe it is  unlikely that the problems we identified in our report could have been  corrected yet given their nature and scope.", "CMS raised two concerns with our examination of a sample of written  materials. First, it criticized our use of readability tests to assess the clarity  of the six sample documents we reviewed. For example, CMS said that  common multisyllabic words would inappropriately inflate the reading  level. However, we found that reading levels remained high after adjusting  for 26 multisyllabic words a Medicare beneficiary would encounter, such  as Social Security Administration. CMS also pointed out that some experts  find such assessments to be misleading. Because we recognize that there  is some controversy surrounding the use of reading levels, we included  two additional assessments to supplement this readability analysis\u2014the  assessment of design and organization of the sample documents based on  60 commonly recognized communications guidelines and an examination  of the usability of six sample documents, involving 11 beneficiaries and 5  advisers.", "Second, CMS expressed concern about our examination of the usability of  the six sample documents. The participating beneficiaries and advisers  were called on to perform 18 specified tasks, after reading the selected  materials, including a section of the Medicare & You handbook. CMS  suggested that the task asking beneficiaries and advisers to calculate their  out-of-pocket drug costs was inappropriate because there are many other  tools that can be used to more effectively compare costs. We do not  disagree with CMS that there are a number of ways beneficiaries may  complete this calculation; however, we nonetheless believe that it is  important that beneficiaries be able to complete this task on the basis of  reading Medicare & You, which, as CMS points out, is widely disseminated  to beneficiaries, reaching all beneficiary households each year. In addition,  CMS noted that it was not able to examine our detailed methodology  regarding the clarity of written materials\u2014including assessments  performed by one of our contractors concerning readability and document  design and organization. We plan to share this information with CMS.", "Finally, CMS took issue with one aspect of our evaluation of the 1-800- MEDICARE help line. Specifically, CMS said the 41 percent accuracy rate  associated with one of the five questions we asked was misleading,  because, according to CMS, we failed to analyze 35 of the 100 responses.  However, we disagree. This question addressed which drug plan would  cost the least for a beneficiary with certain specified prescription drug  needs. We analyzed these 35 responses to this question and found the  responses to be inappropriate. The CSRs would not provide us with the  information we were seeking because we did not supply personal  identifying information, such as the beneficiary\u2019s Medicare number or date  of birth. We considered such responses inappropriate because the CSRs  could have answered this question without personal identifying  information by using CMS\u2019s Web-based prescription drug plan finder tool.  Although CMS said that it has emphasized to CSRs, through training and  broadcast messages, that it is permissible to provide the information we  requested without requiring information that would personally identify a  beneficiary, in these 35 instances, the CSR simply told us that our question  could not be answered. CMS also said that the bulk of these inappropriate  responses were related to our request that the CSR use only brand-name  drugs. This is incorrect\u2014none of these 35 responses were considered  incorrect or inappropriate because of a request that the CSR use only  brand-name drugs\u2014as that was not part of our question.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
