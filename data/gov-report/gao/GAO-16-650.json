To receive Flexibility waivers, states had to agree to meet other requirements related to college- and career-ready expectations, school accountability and support, and effective instruction. Education approved Flexibility waivers for 43 states. In December 2015, Congress reauthorized the ESEA which modified Education's waiver authority. GAO was asked to review Education's Flexibility initiative.", "GAO examined the extent to which Education assessed states' ability to fully implement their Flexibility waivers and the process it used to oversee the waivers. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, guidance, and key documents related to the Flexibility initiative, such as monitoring reports; and interviewed Education officials.

According to GAO's analysis of Education letters and monitoring reports, 12 of the 43 states with Flexibility waivers faced multiple challenges that affected their ability to fully implement their waivers. Education used a risk assessment process to document these challenges throughout the waiver approval, monitoring, and renewal phases (see table). For example, Education identified risks with one state's capacity to oversee and monitor schools needing improvement prior to approving the state's waiver in 2013 and noted similar issues, as a result of monitoring, in 2015. Overseeing local districts and schools was particularly challenging for states, according to GAO's analysis of Education documents. Meanwhile, Education has not yet evaluated its process to review, approve, and monitor the Flexibility waivers given to states or incorporated any relevant lessons learned into its plans for implementing the December 2015 reauthorization of the ESEA. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should consider lessons learned when planning agency activities. As Education begins to implement the new law, it has an opportunity to learn from its experiences with the Flexibility initiative and incorporate any applicable lessons learned. Absent such an evaluation, Education may miss opportunities to better oversee state implementation of the new law."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education evaluate its Flexibility initiative oversight process to identify lessons learned and incorporate any applicable lessons into its plans for overseeing state implementation of the new law. Education generally agreed and outlined steps to address the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In December 2015, Congress reauthorized the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Among other things, the new  law, known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), requires states  to submit plans to the Department of Education (Education) for approval  that describe states\u2019 compliance with various requirements, such as  implementing a statewide accountability system to identify and support  low-performing schools. Like the prior reauthorization\u2014known as the No  Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA)\u2014ESSA authorizes Education to  waive various statutory or regulatory provisions, subject to certain  requirements. ESSA also modified this waiver authority. For example,  ESSA prohibits Education from requiring states to include specific  academic standards in their waiver requests or to use specific academic  assessments as a condition of waiver approval.", "In September 2011, in response to states\u2019 requests for relief from certain  provisions of the NCLBA, Education invited states to request waivers that  would grant them flexibility in meeting certain NCLBA requirements in  effect at that time, such as identifying for improvement or corrective  action those schools and school districts that repeatedly failed to meet the  state\u2019s adequate yearly progress goals. In response, almost every state  applied for a Flexibility waiver, and Education ultimately approved waivers  for 43 states. As part of the Flexibility initiative, states agreed to address  four principles identified by Education that included implementing college-  and career-ready standards and assessments; district and school  recognition, accountability and support systems; and systems for  evaluating and supporting teacher and principal effectiveness. The  Flexibility initiative built on reform efforts begun under the Race to the Top  and School Improvement Grants programs. We have previously reported  that states and school districts have experienced a variety of challenges  with those programs, such as obtaining support from stakeholders and  building staff capacity. Under the ESSA, all waivers granted through the  Flexibility initiative terminate on August 1, 2016.", "You asked us to review Education\u2019s design, implementation, and  oversight of its Flexibility initiative. In light of the effects that the ESSA  may have on state education systems, this report examines the extent to  which Education assessed states\u2019 ability to fully implement their Flexibility  waivers and the process it used to oversee this initiative.", "To perform this work, we used a variety of approaches. We reviewed  relevant federal laws and guidance, as well as key federal documentation  provided by Education related to the review and approval of Flexibility  waivers and monitoring reports. In addition, we interviewed officials in  Education\u2019s Office of State Support, Risk Management Service, Office of  Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of the General Counsel,  and Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development. To  determine if any states faced challenges to their ability to fully implement  their Flexibility waivers, we reviewed states\u2019 waiver approval letters,  waiver renewal letters, and monitoring reports. On the basis of that  review, we identified states that had at least two of the following  designations:", "Education included conditions when approving the state\u2019s initial", "Education found during monitoring that the state was not  implementing an element of its Flexibility waiver consistent with its  approved request and meeting Education\u2019s expectations for  establishing systems and processes\u2014particularly for monitoring  schools and school districts\u2014that supported waiver implementation;  or", "Education included conditions when renewing the state\u2019s Flexibility  waiver.", "To learn more about challenges specific states faced in implementing  their Flexibility waivers, we conducted structured interviews with officials  in four states: Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. These  were selected from those states we identified that had at least two of the  designations noted above to reflect a range of challenges states faced in  implementing Flexibility waivers. We also interviewed an official in  Washington state\u2014the only state whose waiver was not extended\u2014 because it was unable to fully implement its Flexibility waiver.", "Of the four principles on which the Flexibility initiative was based, we  focused our efforts on three: district and school accountability and support systems; and college- and career-ready standards and assessments;  systems for evaluating and supporting teacher and principal  effectiveness.", "We did this because Education\u2019s oversight activities and state challenges  identified under the Flexibility initiative focused on these three principles.  Our review does not include the initiative\u2019s fourth principle, which is  related to removing duplicative and burdensome reporting requirements  that do not directly affect student outcomes. We evaluated Education\u2019s  process for risk assessment and its efforts to learn from its experiences  with the Flexibility initiative using standards for internal control in the  federal government. In addition, we considered our prior work on the  Flexibility initiative in which we held discussion groups with selected  states regarding the benefits and challenges of requesting and  implementing Flexibility waivers under NCLBA (for more about our prior  review, see app. I). Further, we interviewed education policy  stakeholders from the Council of Chief State School Officers and National  Conference of State Legislatures because they have direct, broad-based  knowledge about states\u2019 experiences with the Flexibility initiative,  including challenges states encountered when implementing their  waivers.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the NCLBA, the Secretary of Education had the authority to waive  many statutory and regulatory requirements for states, school districts,  and other entities that received funds under a program authorized by the  law, provided that certain conditions were met. In September 2011,  Education introduced the Flexibility initiative and invited states to request  a waiver for flexibility from certain NCLBA requirements in effect at the  time. For example, Education offered to waive requirements related to the  timeline for determining whether states, districts, and schools were  making adequate yearly progress toward improved academic  achievement for all students, including specified subgroups. (See app. II  for a full list of NCLBA provisions that could be waived under the  Flexibility initiative.) To be approved for a Flexibility waiver, Education  required states to address certain principles for improving elementary and  secondary education, as seen in table 1.", "Education\u2019s Student Achievement and School Accountability Office was  responsible for administering the Flexibility initiative until October 2014. At  that time, the Student Achievement and School Accountability Office  became part of the newly-created Office of State Support, which assumed  responsibility for administering the initiative.", "As part of Education\u2019s process for reviewing and approving states\u2019  requests for waivers under the Flexibility initiative, Education invited  states to submit their requests in one of several \u201cwindows\u201d between 2011  and 2014. Almost every state applied for a waiver during one of these  windows. Generally, Education approved states to implement their  requests for a certain number of years. As of April 2016, Education had  approved requests for Flexibility waivers in 43 states. In November  2014, Education invited states that had received approval for Flexibility  waivers for the 2014-2015 school year to submit a request to renew their  waivers for an additional 3 years, or through the end of the 2017-2018  school year.", "As shown in figure 1, Education established a process in which states  requested Flexibility waivers, states\u2019 requests were peer-reviewed, and  Education made final decisions. According to Education officials, the  review and decision process was focused on whether states\u2019 requests  were consistent with Flexibility principles. Education convened peer  review panels to evaluate states\u2019 initial Flexibility waiver requests and  suggest ways to strengthen a state\u2019s plan for implementing the principles  of the Flexibility initiative. For example, peer reviewers in some cases  suggested strengthening plans to ensure that students from racial and  ethnic subgroups were sufficiently included in school accountability  systems. Ultimately, Education used the results of peer review and the  department\u2019s internal analysis to inform its final decision of whether or not  to approve states\u2019 Flexibility waiver requests.", "After completing the initial review and decision process, Education  conducted a monitoring process to oversee Flexibility waiver  implementation and identify any areas in which states needed additional  support. The first part of the monitoring process (referred to as \u201cPart A\u201d  monitoring) was designed to provide Education with a more in-depth  understanding of a state\u2019s goals and approach to implementing its  Flexibility waiver and to ensure that the state had the critical elements in  place to begin implementing its plan. The second part of the monitoring  process (referred to as \u201cPart B\u201d monitoring) was designed to enable  Education to review state implementation of the plan and follow up from  the initial monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Assessed States\u2019 Ability to Implement Flexibility Waivers and Identified Challenges but Has Not Yet Evaluated Its Own Oversight Processes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education Identified Challenges to States\u2019 Ability to Implement Flexibility Waivers", "paragraphs": ["By establishing a process to review, approve, and monitor states\u2019  Flexibility waivers, Education identified challenges to states\u2019 ability to fully  implement their waivers, as shown in table 2. Recognizing that Flexibility  waivers affected multiple significant aspects of state and local educational  systems, Education took steps that enhanced its ability to identify  implementation risks. For example, officials in Education\u2019s Office of State  Support (the office responsible for the initiative) told us they coordinated  with other Education offices to identify findings or concerns regarding how  states were implementing other education programs that might affect a  state\u2019s waiver implementation. Education\u2019s efforts to identify  implementation risks were consistent with standards for internal control in  the federal government, which define risk assessment as identifying and  analyzing relevant risks associated with achieving program objectives.  Agency management is to comprehensively identify risks and consider  any effects they might have on the agency\u2019s ability to accomplish its  mission for all projects, such as the Flexibility initiative.", "Education asked states to include information in their initial Flexibility  waiver requests about how they consulted with teachers and their  representatives and other stakeholders, such as parents and  organizations representing students with disabilities and English learners,  in developing their waiver proposals. However, officials we interviewed in  two states, as well as an official from the National Conference of State  Legislatures, discussed issues related to stakeholder consultation,  especially with state legislatures, regarding their Flexibility waiver  requests. For example, Washington state was unable to implement a  teacher and principal evaluation and support system that included student  learning growth as a significant factor. A state official told us they  attempted to design a system that would meet the needs of various  stakeholders, including teachers, but ultimately the system was not  implemented because, according to Education, the state legislature did  not approve the changes needed to put the system in place. In addition,  Arizona officials said state laws and rules from the state board of  education limited their ability to implement an accountability system that  was consistent with their Flexibility waiver request. Under the ESSA,  states will be required to develop their Title I state plans with timely and  meaningful consultation with the governor and members of the state  legislature and state board of education, among others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Twelve States Faced Multiple Challenges in Implementing Their Flexibility Waivers, Especially Related to Local Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Of the 43 states with Flexibility waivers, we identified 12 states that faced  multiple significant challenges throughout the initiative, affecting their  ability to fully implement their waivers: Alabama, Arizona, Florida,  Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas. As shown in table 3, these 12  states had at least two of the following designations:", "Education included conditions when approving the state\u2019s initial", "Education found during monitoring that the state was not  implementing an element of its Flexibility waiver consistent with its  approved request meeting Education\u2019s expectations for establishing  systems and processes\u2014particularly for monitoring schools and  school districts\u2014that supported waiver implementation; or", "Education included conditions when renewing the state\u2019s Flexibility  waiver.", "Some of these states were unable to fully address the challenges  Education identified when their waiver was initially approved. For  example, Education identified risks related to Pennsylvania\u2019s capacity to  monitor interventions in \u201cfocus schools\u201d prior to approving the state\u2019s  Flexibility waiver and subsequently found during Part B monitoring (nearly  2 years later) that the state lacked a plan to conduct such monitoring.  Pennsylvania officials told us that, according to Education officials, these  weaknesses resulted from not documenting how interventions in focus  schools were consistent with the state\u2019s plan to improve student  achievement in these schools. To help manage these challenges,  Education included conditions when approving and renewing these  states\u2019 Flexibility waivers and provided technical assistance. During Part  B monitoring, Education found that most of these states were not meeting  Education\u2019s expectations for establishing monitoring systems and  processes that support implementation of their Flexibility waivers.", "Many of these states were particularly challenged to develop systems for  overseeing local school districts and schools. Specifically, during Part B  monitoring, Education found that 8 of the 12 states we identified as facing  multiple challenges did not meet expectations regarding systems for  monitoring local implementation of their Flexibility waivers (see table 4).  According to Education officials, many states were not implementing  monitoring activities consistent with their approved Flexibility waivers and  the key Flexibility principles. For example, Education found that Alabama  did not have a formal monitoring mechanism to ensure its interventions in  priority schools, focus schools, and other Title I schools met the  requirements of the Flexibility initiative; and New Hampshire did not  monitor its districts\u2019 adoption and implementation of college- and career- ready standards.", "During the initial Flexibility waiver review and decision process and Part B  monitoring, Education asked states about their plans to monitor local  implementation and asked for documentation, such as monitoring  schedules or reports. Education officials told us that state monitoring of  local implementation is a persistent challenge across many education  programs, and said that the possible reasons states continue to  experience challenges related to monitoring include staff capacity and   staff turnover at state departments of education. Education officials told  us they could help states strengthen their monitoring efforts by  disseminating best practices but have not yet done so because of time  and resource constraints.", "Education did not establish specific timeframes for providing final Part B  monitoring reports to states. According to our analysis of Education\u2019s  documentation, it took over 4 months, on average, to provide states with  final Part B monitoring reports; for 10 states, it was over 6 months.  Education officials told us that many factors affected the time frames for  finalizing its monitoring reports, such as the complexity of the approaches  being used by a state to implement its Flexibility waiver, the need to  balance this work with other high-priority work being done by department  staff, and the U.S. government shutdown in October 2013. Recognizing  that the length of time Education takes to notify a state about monitoring  findings affects how long it will take a state to address any  implementation risks the department identified, Education officials told us  they provided draft reports to states earlier in the process and gave them  an opportunity to provide technical edits to the draft reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Has Not Yet Evaluated its Oversight Process for the Flexibility Initiative, Which Could Strengthen Its Ability to Support and Oversee ESSA Implementation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although 12 states faced multiple challenges throughout the Flexibility  waiver initiative, Education has not yet evaluated its process for  reviewing, approving, and overseeing Flexibility waivers.

For example, Education officials told us they plan to  determine how they can improve their use of the peer review process for  ESSA state plans. As of yet, however, Education has not evaluated its  oversight of Flexibility waivers and did not provide us with a time frame for  doing so.

Education also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into  the report, as appropriate.", "In its written comments, Education agreed that it is important to  continuously evaluate its work and to consider ways to improve its  efficiency and effectiveness and cited examples of the agency doing so  during ESEA Flexibility implementation. For example, Education said it  developed the Office of State Support, in part based on lessons learned  while implementing the Flexibility initiative. In addition, Education said that  since the ESSA was enacted in December 2015, it has continued to  informally evaluate ESEA Flexibility implementation and oversight and  cited several examples relevant to ESEA Flexibility and other Education  programs and initiatives. For example, Education said that it has been  considering changes to its planned performance review system designed  to support state implementation of the Flexibility initiative and other  programs. Further, the agency provided new information in its letter,  telling us that it is piloting quarterly calls between Education program  officers and states and piloting a fiscal review in eight states focused on  components of the law it says did not change significantly between  NCLBA and ESSA. As Education continues its efforts to evaluate lessons  learned from the Flexibility initiative\u2014including the peer review process\u2014  and apply them to its oversight of ESSA, we encourage Education to  incorporate these lessons into how it oversees the design and  implementation of states\u2019 monitoring systems which are key to the  success of ESSA\u2019s accountability provisions.
