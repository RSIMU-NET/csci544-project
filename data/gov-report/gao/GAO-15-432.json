This report examines the extent to which (1) agencies have used ESPCs and plan to use them; (2) projects have achieved their expected cost and energy savings; and (3) agencies have overseen and evaluated such projects. GAO compiled data on awarded ESPCs; reviewed agency guidance and files for a nongeneralizable sample of 20 ESPC projects that reflected a range of contract award dates, contract values, and other characteristics; and interviewed officials from the seven agencies with the highest energy usage and greatest facility square footage\u2014the Air Force, Army, and Navy within the Department of Defense; the Departments of Energy, Justice, and Veterans Affairs; and the General Services Administration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The seven selected agencies in GAO's review awarded approximately $12.1 billion in energy savings performance contracts (ESPC) in fiscal years 1995 through 2014 and plan to continue using them to help meet federal energy directives and initiatives. Under ESPCs, private contractors finance the up-front costs of energy improvements. Agencies then repay contractors from the savings, such as those resulting from lower utility bills. The seven agencies GAO reviewed have used more than 500 ESPCs for projects, such as installing energy-efficient lighting or power generation projects. Agencies' plans to use ESPCs vary, particularly for data center consolidation projects, which could reduce a significant amount of energy.", "Cost and energy savings that contractors reported to agencies for most ESPCs met or exceeded expectations, but some of these savings may be overstated. GAO's review of a nongeneralizable sample of 20 projects found that contractors' reports overstated cost and energy savings for 14 projects. Contractors calculate and report savings annually in accordance with plans agreed to in their contracts with agencies. These plans include assumptions about agencies' use of equipment, which may change over the life of the contract. If changes reduce project savings, such as when an agency does not operate or maintain the equipment as agreed, contractors are not required to reduce the amount of savings they report or measure the changes' effects. GAO evaluated the extent to which changes in agency operations or other factors within agencies' control may have reduced energy savings for a nongeneralizable sample of projects. Estimates agencies provided to GAO of savings that were reported but not achieved ranged from negligible to nearly half of a project's reported annual savings. For example, one agency removed equipment for a sewer system upgrade, which resulted in over $104,000 in annual savings that were reported but not achieved, or about 40 percent of the project's reported savings. Federal guidance states that when reviewing contractor reports, agencies should understand changes in project performance and savings levels, and what actions should be taken to address deficiencies. However, agencies were not always aware of how much savings were not achieved due to agency actions because contractors were not required to report this information. Without clearer reporting of savings that are not achieved, agencies may be unable to determine what, if any, corrective actions should be taken.", "The seven agencies in GAO's review have conducted limited oversight and evaluation of their ESPC projects. In GAO's sample of 20 projects, agency representatives did not perform some oversight activities included in guidance because they were unaware of these duties or how to perform them, among other reasons. Without ensuring that training provides officials with the information needed to understand how to perform their oversight responsibilities, agencies may continue to inconsistently perform oversight. Moreover, most of the agencies in GAO's review have not systematically evaluated their ESPC portfolios to determine the effects of changing circumstances\u2014such as facility use\u2014on project performance because they do not have processes to do so. Without such oversight and evaluation, agency officials cannot make fully informed decisions about how best to strategically manage their ESPCs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to improve oversight of ESPC projects through clearer reporting of savings, improved training, and systematic evaluations of portfolios, among other things.

Several laws and executive orders have  established federal energy requirements and sustainability goals, such as  goals to reduce energy usage and conserve water. Implementing projects  to meet these requirements and goals can be costly, and obtaining up- front appropriations for such projects has been particularly challenging for  agencies in recent years because of constrained federal budgets.

We assessed the reliability of selected  agencies\u2019 ESPC data by (1) performing electronic testing of required data  elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  systems that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data. We assessed available ESPC data from  the Air Force, Army, Navy, DOE, and GSA and determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Because data  from Justice and VA on ESPCs were not sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, we relied on DOE\u2019s data for these agencies. We also reviewed  relevant federal laws, executive orders, the selected agencies\u2019 fiscal year  2014 Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans, and Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. To determine the extent to  which selected agencies\u2019 ESPCs achieved their expected cost and  energy savings, we reviewed six studies by DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National  Laboratory analyzing ESPCs\u2019 reported cost and energy savings. We  assessed the studies\u2019 methodology and interviewed their authors, and we  determined the findings were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report.

In May 2014, the President expanded this challenge to total $4 billion in performance-based contracts by the end of  2016.", "The process that agencies and contractors generally follow for developing  and implementing an ESPC project spans five phases, from acquisition  planning\u2014during which agencies identify project requirements and  assemble their acquisition team\u2014to project performance\u2014during which  energy conservation measures are in place and operating, and agencies  pay contractors. Figure 1 illustrates the general process for developing  and implementing an ESPC project.", "During the process of developing and implementing an ESPC project,  agency officials often work with DOE\u2019s or the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers\u2019 (Corps) federal contracting centers. Both DOE and the Corps  have awarded indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity ESPC contract  vehicles to a set of prequalified energy services contractors. Agencies  using these \u201cumbrella\u201d contract vehicles can award an ESPC for an  individual project to any of the prequalified contractors. Using one of  these contract vehicles allows agencies to develop and implement an  ESPC project in less time because the process of competitively selecting  qualified contractors has already been completed, and key aspects of  contracts have been broadly negotiated. In addition, both DOE and the  Corps provide contracting and technical support to agencies that use their  contract vehicles. For example, DOE\u2019s FEMP provides facilitation  services, where a third party assists the agency and contractor in  agreeing on the terms of a contract. FEMP also issues guidance and  offers training for agencies on the various steps of developing and  implementing an ESPC project. The Corps provides technical support,  cost estimating services, and legal support to agencies using its contract  vehicle. As part of revisions that DOE and the Corps made to their  contract vehicles in 2008, both DOE and the Corps now require that  agencies use a qualified project facilitator when developing and  implementing an ESPC, which addresses the recommendation in our  June 2005 report to ensure that agencies use appropriate expertise when  undertaking an ESPC. Additionally, each of the seven agencies in our  review has established a central office to support individual sites with  developing and implementing ESPC projects, and several of these  agencies have increased the role of their central offices since our last  review to provide additional support, such as oversight of ESPCs.", "An ESPC project\u2019s expected cost and energy savings are established  during project development, finalized when the contract is awarded, and  measured and verified over the course of a project\u2019s performance period.  These savings can include reductions in costs for energy, water,  operation and maintenance, and repair and replacement directly related  to the energy conservation measures. Agencies must pay contractors  from funds appropriated or otherwise made available to pay for such  utilities and related operational expenses. Payments to contractors  generally cover the costs associated with equipment and installation,  contractor-provided operation and maintenance services, financing  charges, and other costs. ESPC projects generally include two types of  expected savings: (1) proposed cost and energy savings, which  contractors estimate will result from the energy conservation measures  installed, and (2) guaranteed cost savings, which must be achieved for   Generally, contractors guarantee about  the contractor to be fully paid.95 percent of a project\u2019s proposed cost savings, which gives them room  for some amount of proposed savings to not be achieved without a  reduction in their payments.", "Energy and cost savings are the difference between a projected baseline  of the energy use without the energy conservation measures and with the  measures.

Most ESPC projects include the following  four key documents that outline how cost and energy savings are to be  measured and verified:", "Measurement and verification plan. During the project development  phase, the contractor and agency develop a plan that establishes how  to measure and verify that savings are achieved. Measurement and  verification methods can include surveys, inspections, direct  measurements of energy use, and other activities to ensure that  equipment is operating correctly and has the potential to generate  expected savings.", "Risk and responsibility matrix. During the contractor selection  phase, the contractor and agency develop a risk and responsibility  matrix that identifies key project risks and their potential effects, and  specifies whether the agency or the contractor will be responsible for  managing financial risks, such as changing interest rates; operational  risks, such as operating hours and weather; and performance risks,  such as equipment performance and preventative maintenance.", "Postinstallation measurement and verification report. After the  energy conservation measures are installed, the contractor conducts  measurement and verification activities and presents the results in a  postinstallation measurement and verification report.", "Annual measurement and verification report. Throughout an  ESPC\u2019s performance period, the contractor conducts measurement  and verification activities and submits an annual report to the agency  to document the cost and energy savings achieved.", "According to FEMP guidance, one of the primary purposes of  measurement and verification is to reduce the risk that expected savings  will not be achieved. FEMP guidance describes risks related to (1)  equipment use, which stem from uncertainty in operational factors, such  as the number of hours equipment is used or changes in the planned  operation of equipment, and (2) equipment performance, which stem from  uncertainty in projecting a specified level of performance. Contractors are  usually reluctant to assume risks related to equipment use because they  often have no control over operational factors. In contrast, according to  FEMP guidance, the contractor is ultimately responsible for the selection,  design, and installation of equipment and typically assumes responsibility  for performance risks.", "FEMP guidance outlines a range of options that contractors may select to  measure and verify the cost and energy savings achieved by each energy  conservation measure. If certain factors that affect savings, such as  weather conditions, utility prices, and hours of agency operation, are  either too complex or costly to measure, agency and contractors may  choose to agree in advance on\u2014or stipulate\u2014the values for those factors  regardless of the actual behavior of those factors. For example, because  ESPCs can be long contracts, the contractor and agency typically  stipulate escalation rates to estimate future utility prices during the  performance period. If the savings that are achieved are less than the  savings calculated using stipulated values, the agency pays the  contractor for the savings calculated using stipulated values. If achieved  savings are greater than the savings calculated using stipulated values,  the agency retains the additional savings.", "The measurement and verification options that FEMP guidance outlines  vary in their rigor and costs. The option that is generally the least rigorous  and costly involves measuring the key factors affecting energy use\u2014such  as the number of lighting fixtures or efficiency of a heating unit\u2014before  and after installation, but typically does not involve measuring such  factors over the term of the contract. In contrast, other options outlined in  FEMP guidance generally involve ongoing measurements of energy use,  or proxies of energy use, over the contract term. FEMP guidance helps  identify when each option should be used and states that the selection of  a measurement and verification method is based on project costs and  savings, complexity of the energy conservation measure, and the  uncertainty or risk of savings being achieved, among others. According to  FEMP guidance, costs for measurement and verification generally  increase with the level of accuracy required in energy savings analyses  and the number and complexity of variables that are analyzed, among  other factors. Moreover, the incremental value of additional measurement  and verification will at some point be less than its cost. For instance, the  energy consumed by a light fixture does not change appreciably over  time, and requiring contractors to measure fixtures annually would  increase the cost of measurement and verification for little benefit,  according to FEMP officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have Awarded About $12.1 Billion for ESPCs for a Variety of Projects, and Their Plans for Continued Use Vary", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 1995 through 2014, the seven selected agencies in our  review awarded approximately $12.1 billion in ESPCs for a variety of  projects, such as constructing biomass facilities to heat federal buildings.

Contractors must  calculate and report annual savings in accordance with the measurement  and verification plans agreed to in their contracts with agencies. These  plans include measuring equipment performance. They also include  assumptions about factors that are beyond contractors\u2019 control, such as  agencies\u2019 use of energy-saving equipment and utility prices, which may  change over the life of the contract. If changes in such factors reduce  savings, contractors generally are not required to reduce the amount of  savings they report or measure the effects of such changes. For example,  contractors do not generally reduce the savings they report when an  agency alters the agreed upon hours of operation, thus reducing the  number of hours that energy-saving equipment is used. Conversely, if  savings increase because of changes in factors beyond contractors\u2019  control, contractors generally do not increase the amount of savings they  report, and agencies generally retain any surplus savings and do not  increase payments to the contractor.", "Measurement and verification reports for 14 projects in our sample  overstated some cost and energy savings in that they reported savings  that were not achieved because of agencies\u2019 actions, including (1)  agencies not operating or maintaining equipment as agreed when the  ESPC was awarded and (2) agencies\u2019 removal of equipment from or  closure of facilities where energy conservation measures had been  installed. For projects in our sample, contractors\u2019 reports generally did not  quantify or estimate the effects of these factors on savings, although  some reports noted that savings were affected in some way. Because of  the large number of factors that can result in overstated or understated  savings, we did not determine the net effect of all factors on projects\u2019  achieved savings. For example, some energy conservation measures in  the projects we reviewed outperformed expectations, which may have  offset the lower-than-expected savings of other energy conservation  measures in those projects. Table 4 shows the projects we reviewed and  the agencies\u2019 actions that affected savings that were reported in the most  recent measurement and verification report, as of September 2014. (For  further detail on the effects of these factors on savings for these projects,  see app. VI.)", "The following are examples from the ESPC projects we reviewed of  agency actions that resulted in reported savings that were not achieved:", "Agency did not operate or maintain equipment as agreed  The  most common factor resulting in overstated savings for the ESPC  projects we reviewed was an agency making changes to operating  hours and temperature set points on programmable heating,  ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, which occurred in  8 of the 20 projects. According to available agency estimates, these  changes generally resulted in lower energy and associated cost  savings than expected, but contractors did not reflect these effects in  reported savings amounts because they were due to agency  actions. In other cases, agencies did not fulfill their responsibilities  for operating or maintaining equipment. For instance, the contractor  for a project at a Justice facility found that steam distribution  equipment the contractor installed had been damaged, reducing the  savings the equipment achieved. However, the contractor did not  reduce reported savings because it stated that the damage resulted  from improper operation by Justice staff. In some cases, agencies  took actions that reduced savings, such as changing operating hours  or temperature set points, to meet changing agency mission needs.", "Agency removed or abandoned equipment  components of energy conservation measures or entire measures  were removed by the agency during the performance period, but  contractors did not reduce reported savings because these changes  were due to agency decisions. For instance, the Army closed a  section of an installation that had numerous buildings with energy  conservation measure equipment installed. As a result, savings were  not being generated by this equipment, but the contractor reported the  savings that would have been achieved for the year had the  equipment continued to operate. In some cases, agencies removed  or abandoned equipment to meet changing agency mission needs.", "The amount of savings reported but not achieved ranged from negligible  to nearly half of an ESPC project\u2019s reported savings for the year, based  on information provided by agencies and our analysis of available  information from the most recent measurement and verification reports for  selected projects. For example, where estimates were available, agency  changes to operating hours and temperature set points on programmable  HVAC equipment generally resulted in savings that were reported but not  achieved that were negligible as a percentage of the total savings  reported, according to agency officials. In contrast, the Air Force\u2019s  removal of equipment associated with a sewer system upgrade resulted  in over $104,000 in annual savings that were reported but not achieved\u2014 about 40 percent of the annual savings reported for the project. (For a full  list of the projects we reviewed and information on the effects of factors  beyond contractors\u2019 control on savings, see app. VI.) Officials from  several agencies noted that there are benefits to funding energy  conservation projects through ESPCs, as opposed to using up-front  appropriations. The officials noted that like ESPC projects, the expected  savings for projects funded with up-front appropriations may not be  achieved.  However, savings that are not achieved are more likely to be  identified for ESPC projects because savings must be measured and  verified.", "Unlike changes in agencies\u2019 use of equipment, agencies cannot control  changes in utility prices, but changes in utility prices compared with the  amounts stipulated in the contracts could affect the savings for ESPC  projects. Agencies commonly stipulate annual escalation rates for energy  costs based on projected utility prices published by the National Institute  of Standards and Technology and developed by DOE\u2019s Energy  Information Administration. DOE has reported that the projected utility  prices for ESPCs awarded through its contract vehicle have generally  underestimated the actual increase in utility prices, and therefore ESPC  projects are generally saving more than expected. Specifically, in 2007,  DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory analyzed 22 ESPC projects to  calculate savings using actual, rather than projected, utility prices. After  adjusting for actual utility prices, savings for 16 of the 22 ESPC projects  Oak Ridge examined were greater than the savings contractors reported,  while savings for the remaining 6 ESPC projects were lower than  reported.", "Energy markets have changed significantly since 2007, and are likely to  change in the future. For example, improvements in horizontal drilling and  hydraulic fracturing led to large increases in the production of natural gas  from shale formations, which contributed to significant decreases in the  price of natural gas. Such changes likely affected the savings that certain  ESPC projects achieved, such as those whose savings were based  predominantly on reductions in natural gas use. However, it is not clear  whether the assumptions that agencies are using for utility prices are  reasonable because DOE has not conducted an analysis of ESPC  projects awarded under its contract vehicle since its 2007 report. As a  result, agencies may not have the information they need to know whether  their projects are achieving expected savings and achieved savings may  be significantly different\u2014either higher or lower\u2014than reported savings.  There are drawbacks of assumptions about utility prices being  consistently higher or lower than actual rates. DOE guidance states that  stipulating higher utility rates, which generally results in higher expected  savings, will provide better cash-flow for projects. However, the guidance  also states that overvaluing savings is a serious concern that can cause  budgetary problems for the agency. This is because contractor payments  must come from agency funds used to pay for energy, water, and related  expenses. Therefore, contractor payments that exceed achieved energy,  water, and related savings will limit the funds agencies can use to cover  these expenses.", "We identified three projects in our nongeneralizable sample for which  achieved savings were lower than reported savings because utility prices  differed from those stipulated in the contract. Specifically, for one DOE  project and one Justice project, natural gas prices were significantly lower  than the amounts stipulated in the contracts, which led to achieved  savings that were about $147,000 and $477,000 less than the reported  cost savings for the year, respectively. These amounts represented about  44 percent of the reported cost savings for the DOE project and about 30  percent of the reported cost savings for the Justice project. Additionally,  an Air Force project that involved switching inefficient oil heating units to  natural gas units projected rates for natural gas that did not reflect  seasonal price increases in winter months. Because actual natural gas  prices were substantially higher than projected in the winter, the costs of  running the new natural gas units were higher than projected. This  resulted in achieved savings that were about $160,000 less than the  reported savings for the year, which was about 5 percent of the project\u2019s  total reported savings for the year. Utility prices vary from year to year, so  it is to be expected that prices will differ from the stipulated values in  some years. Without a periodic analysis of utility prices over several years  and across projects, agencies may not have the information they need to  know whether examples like the three in our sample are typical and  indicative of problems with the assumptions or anomalies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Were Not Always Aware of How Much Expected Savings Were Not Achieved", "paragraphs": ["Agencies were not always aware of the amount of expected savings that  were not achieved, in part because contractors generally did not\u2014and  were not required to\u2014report this information when savings were not  achieved due to agency actions.

Additionally, we have  modified the recommendation to include that DOE consider periodically  analyzing the impacts of utility prices on ESPC savings, given significant  changes in energy markets since Oak Ridge\u2019s 2007 study.", "DOD and DOE partially concurred, and VA did not concur, with our third  recommendation about working with contractors to determine the best  way to obtain estimates of savings that are not achieved for existing  contracts. DOD and VA suggested changes to the wording of the  recommendation, which we have incorporated. In its comments, DOE  reiterated that agencies would benefit from verifying factors, such as  physical changes to buildings that were not contemplated prior to contract  implementation, through annual measurement and verification activities.  DOE also stated that FEMP is addressing these issues through revision  of its measurement and verification reporting template and will investigate  the use of the revised reporting template for existing contracts. DOE  reiterated its concerns about reporting savings that were not achieved  due to factors, such as changes in utility prices, that are beyond  contractor and agency control. We recognize this concern, as discussed  in our response to the second recommendation above. We have modified  our report and revised the wording of the recommendation to (1) focus on  estimating savings that were not achieved due to agency actions, (2)  more clearly indicate that the estimates are to be obtained for inclusion in  future measurement and verification reports for existing contracts, and (3)  limit its implementation to instances where it is economically feasible.", "DOE partially concurred with our fourth recommendation about providing  training on certain oversight activities. In December 2014, we interviewed  DOE officials, including FEMP program managers, about available  training pertaining to agencies\u2019 oversight responsibilities. These officials  told us that there was no specific course dedicated to performing agency  oversight and that such a course would be beneficial. The need for  additional training on oversight activities was also suggested by DOD  officials during our review. In commenting on our report, however, DOE  stated that, in September 2014, FEMP added to its training courses a  webinar that addressed agency responsibilities for oversight during the  contract performance period. DOE also stated that FEMP would examine  available training and resources; make updates, as appropriate; and  investigate how to encourage their use among agencies. We have noted  this new information in the body of the report. However, because DOE  provided the information on the webinar late in our review, we did not  assess the webinar cited by DOE. We continue to believe, based on the  analysis conducted for this review, that issues related to training may  have been a factor in agencies\u2019 inconsistent oversight of contractors\u2019  measurement and verification activities that we found in our sample of  ESPC projects. We are encouraged by DOE\u2019s plans and have modified  our recommendation to include evaluating its existing training and  determining whether additional training on oversight is needed.", "DOE concurred with our fifth recommendation related to FEMP  monitoring of agencies\u2019 oversight of ESPC projects awarded using the  DOE contract vehicle. DOE stated that FEMP will examine its Life of the  Contract program for an improved means of quantifying agencies\u2019  compliance in observing measurement and verification activities and  reviewing and certifying the resulting reports.", "DOD concurred with our sixth recommendation about establishing a  process to systematically evaluate its ESPC portfolio. DOE and VA  partially concurred with this recommendation. In its comments, DOE  stated that FEMP would review its process that addresses performance  issues and its process for engaging with agencies to determine whether  to modify or terminate a contract. DOE stated that its review process  includes evaluating cost savings that are not achieved as a result of  agency actions and evaluating interest rates to assist agencies in  determining the potential cost savings available through refinancing. In its  comments, VA concurred in principle with the recommendation but stated  that the agency would be limited in how it could use information obtained  from such evaluations and that the evaluations would not provide  significant value relative to the time and money required to conduct them.  We have modified our recommendation to be less prescriptive about how  the information is to be used. We continue to believe, as VA stated in its  comments, that such evaluations could make agency officials aware of  how changing circumstances have affected ESPC performance.  Moreover, our recommendation allows for agencies to consider  conducting such evaluations after a certain number of years or in  response to events, which should decrease the burden of such  evaluations.", "In its technical comments, DOE stated that it disagreed with our use of  the term \"actual savings,\" and that actual savings would be better  characterized as \"the cost and energy savings that contractors measure  and verify in accordance with the plan the agency agreed to when  developing and awarding the contract.\" DOE stated doing so is consistent  with the ESPC authority, which authorizes a methodology to determine  energy savings using models and assumptions that the federal agency  and contractor agree on prior to contract formation. DOE also stated that  there are factors that could affect savings that cannot be known and that  analyzing only known factors will produce a skewed analysis of \"actual\"  savings. We acknowledge these limitations. However, we found that  savings that contractors reported, in accordance with the plan the agency  agreed to, sometimes included savings that were not achieved because  of agency actions, such as physical changes to buildings. DOE agrees  that such factors, which were not contemplated prior to contract  formation, should be verified by annual measurement and verification  activities. We continue to believe that it is important for agencies to obtain  information from contractors on savings that are not achieved because of  agency actions and have modified our report to discuss \u201cachieved  savings\u201d instead of \u201cactual savings.\u201d", "In DOD\u2019s technical comments, it provided some missing data for the  amount the Army awarded in ESPCs for fiscal years 2011, 2012, and  2014. DOD also provided updated guaranteed costs savings data for  some Army projects after it submitted comments on the draft report. We  updated the report with these data. DOD also requested that we list DOD  as the agency in tables 2 and 4 and list the Air Force, Army, and Navy as  components, but we did not do so because we did not include other DOD  components in the scope of our audit, and we wanted to highlight the  details specific to the Air Force, Army, and Navy. We recognize that the  Air Force, Army, and Navy are components of DOD, and we acknowledge  this in the beginning of the report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and the Secretaries of Defense, Energy, and Veterans  Affairs; the Attorney General; the Administrator of the General Services  Administration; and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.", "In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please  contact me at (202) 512-3841 or ruscof@gao.gov.

This report examines  the extent to which (1) selected agencies have used ESPCs and plan to  use them in the future, (2) selected agencies\u2019 ESPC projects have  achieved their expected cost and energy savings, and (3) selected  agencies have overseen and evaluated their ESPC projects.", "To determine which federal agencies to include in our review, we selected  agencies with the highest energy usage and greatest facility square  footage, based on government-wide data collected by the Federal Energy  Management Program (FEMP). We chose the following seven agencies  based on the above criteria the Departments of Energy (DOE), Justice,  and Veterans Affairs (VA); the General Services Administration (GSA);  and the Army, Navy, and Air Force within the Department of Defense  (DOD). We refer to these agencies as the seven selected agencies. As of  fiscal year 2013, DOD, DOE, Justice, VA, and GSA represented 78  percent of the federal government\u2019s total floor space and 80 percent of  the government\u2019s energy use. Findings based on these agencies cannot  be generalized to other agencies. To provide information on all of our  objectives, we interviewed knowledgeable agency officials, reviewed  relevant agency and contractor reports, and conducted site visits to ESPC  projects in Golden, Colorado, and White Oak, Maryland. We selected  these sites based on whether they were undertaken by federal agencies  within our review; innovativeness, such as use of newer technology; and  proximity to locations of GAO staff. Findings from these site visits cannot  be generalized to other projects.", "To determine the extent to which selected agencies used ESPCs, we  collected and analyzed available data on ESPCs awarded in fiscal years  1995 through 2014. We found that there is no source of comprehensive  data on federal agencies\u2019 use of ESPCs, either in DOE, the contracting  centers, or the agencies. The seven selected agencies started collecting  data comprehensively and electronically at different points in time, and  they keep some contract data only in project files at the facilities where  the contracts are being implemented. We combined agencies\u2019 available  data into the most consistent format available, deleted duplicate records,  performed basic tests to determine the reliability of the data, reviewed  existing information about the data and the systems that produced them,  and interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We found  that selected agencies were missing some data, but we found the data  used in this report to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  compiled data into the following fields: project title, contractor, contract  vehicle, award date, agency, implementation price, total contract price,  guaranteed savings, contract term length, and annual energy savings. If  agencies did not provide data that were defined in the same way as other  agency data, we used the most comparable data available. We used  FEMP\u2019s data as our primary ESPC data source for all seven selected  agencies, and we supplemented it with Air Force, Army, GSA, and Navy  data. Because data from Justice and VA on ESPCs were not sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report, we relied on FEMP\u2019s data on these  agencies. To determine the extent to which agencies plan to use ESPCs  and challenges faced when using ESPCs to consolidate data centers, we  reviewed relevant federal laws, executive orders, the President\u2019s  Performance Contracting Challenge, the seven selected agencies\u2019 fiscal  year 2014 Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans, and Office of  Management and Budget guidance.", "To determine the extent to which selected agencies\u2019 ESPCs projects  have achieved their expected cost and energy savings, we reviewed six  annual studies by DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory that analyzed  cost and energy savings reported by contractors in annual measurement  and verification reports for ESPCs awarded under DOE\u2019s contract  vehicle. These ESPCs represent about 70 percent of federal ESPCs  awarded since 1995 by total contract value. Oak Ridge National  Laboratory\u2019s first annual study was issued in 2007 and reflected savings  reported by contractors in calendar year 2005, and its most recent annual  study was issued in 2013 and it reflected savings reported by contractors  in calendar year 2012. Oak Ridge National Laboratory did not issue an  annual study for savings reported in 2006 or 2007. In addition, the years  for which savings were reported were approximated based on the  average start and end dates of the reporting periods covered by the  annual measurement and verification reports included in Oak Ridge  National Laboratory\u2019s analysis. For instance, the reports included in the  2012 analysis had an average start date of January 4, 2012, and an  average end date of January 5, 2013, for an approximate reporting period  of calendar year 2012. Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s studies included  ESPCs for projects that were in their performance period and for which  the contractor had produced at least one measurement and verification  report in the year before the study. Projects in the planning or  construction phases, first year of the performance period, or  postperformance period were not reflected in a given year\u2019s study. We  reviewed Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s methodology for these studies,  interviewed the authors of the studies, and determined the findings of the  studies were sufficiently reliable for purposes of our report. We did not  analyze trends in reported savings for ESPCs awarded through the  Corps\u2019 contract vehicle because the Corps had not centrally tracked or  analyzed reported savings for these ESPCs.", "In addition, to provide illustrative examples of the extent to which selected  agencies\u2019 ESPC projects have achieved their expected savings, we  reviewed annual measurement and verification reports submitted by  contractors and other project documentation for a nongeneralizable  sample of 20 ESPC projects, with a total contract value of about $824  million. (See app. VI for a list of projects that we selected.) We selected  projects from among the 530 projects listed in DOE, Corps, and agency  data on ESPCs awarded by the seven selected agencies in fiscal years  1995 through 2014. We selected projects that reflected a range of award  dates, contract values, and other characteristics. We selected at least one  project at each of the seven selected agencies, and more projects at  agencies that had awarded more ESPCs. Our review was generally  limited to projects that had completed at least 1 year of the performance  period for which an annual measurement and verification report was  submitted. The one exception was VA\u2019s Veterans Integrated Service  Network 22, Greater Los Angeles project, which was in the first year of its  performance period at the time of our review, and it did not yet have an  annual measurement and verification report. However, because VA did  not award any ESPCs in 2004 through 2011, this was the only VA project  available for our sample that was in its performance period. Therefore, in  order to include VA in our sample, we reviewed the postinstallation  measurement and verification report for the project, which included  information on projected savings for the first year of the performance  period based on measurement and verification activities conducted after  project installation. For all 20 projects in our sample, we reviewed  measurement and verification reports and other documentation to identify  instances where contractors noted changes in the performance or  operation of equipment that could have affected the savings they  generated. We also reviewed information in the documents on projected  utility rates. We contacted agency officials directly involved with the  projects to obtain additional information, such as estimates of the savings  that are not achieved due to changes in equipment performance or  operation, the reasons for those changes, and actual utility rates for the  most recent year. The findings from our review of these projects are not  generalizable to other projects. To inform our review of the projects, we  reviewed FEMP\u2019s measurement and verification guidance, which  includes information on procedures and guidelines for quantifying the  savings resulting from ESPCs, and is intended for agency staff and  contractors. We also reviewed supplemental measurement and  verification guidance from the seven selected agencies in our review and  interviewed officials from these agencies regarding their processes for  measuring and verifying ESPC savings.", "To determine the extent to which selected agencies have overseen and  evaluated ESPC projects, we reviewed and analyzed annual  measurement and verification reports submitted by contractors and other  project documentation for a nongeneralizable sample of 20 ESPCs at the  seven selected agencies to determine the extent that agencies observed  the contractor\u2019s measurement and verification activities and reviewed and  approved the latest measurement and verification report. We conducted  follow-up inquiries with agency officials to obtain any missing data in the  project files. We also interviewed FEMP and other agency officials about  the results associated with the sample projects. We also reviewed audit  agency reports conducted on ESPCs since 2005. Furthermore, we  interviewed agency officials about internal procedures for evaluating  agency ESPC projects and analyzed agency documents related to these  evaluations.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2014 to June 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Moreover, federal budget agencies disagree about whether this should be  the case.

Under OMB\u2019s scoring treatment, an agency  must obligate, at the time the contract is executed, sufficient budgetary  resources to cover the agency\u2019s contract payments for the fiscal year in  which the contract is signed. For each subsequent fiscal year during the  contract period, the agency must obligate funds to cover the contract  payments the agency is required to make for that year. OMB has not  changed its approach to scoring ESPCs since it first issued formal  guidance in 1998, and OMB staff said they have no plans to do so. The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO), on the other hand, scores the full  cost of ESPCs up front in its cost estimates of legislation authorizing  agencies to enter into ESPCs. It views this treatment as consistent with  government-wide principles that the budget should reflect the  government\u2019s full commitment at the time decisions are made. In the case  of an ESPC, this means a new obligation would be made at the time the  ESPC is signed. CBO\u2019s cost estimates of legislation authorizing agencies  to enter into ESPCs reflect the annual net effects of such obligations in  the current fiscal year and 10 subsequent years.", "CBO has developed several cost estimates for legislation affecting  ESPCs and, in a recent estimate, changed how it reflects the cost savings  that may result from ESPCs. estimate for legislation that, among other things, expanded the definition  of allowable energy conservation measures under an ESPC, CBO  showed an increase in spending resulting from increased ESPC use.", "CBO, S. 1321 Energy Savings Act of 2007 (Washington, D.C.: June 11, 2007); CBO, S.  761 Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013 (Washington, D.C.: May  21, 2013); CBO, H.R. 2689 Energy Savings Through Public-Private Partnerships Act of  2014 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 24, 2014).", "CBO estimated that contractual commitments to pay vendors for energy  conservation measures implemented pursuant to the legislation would  amount to $450 million over 10 years.

CBO estimated that reductions in federal costs attributable to  contracts implemented pursuant to the legislation would total $210 million  over 10 years, with additional reductions in subsequent years.
