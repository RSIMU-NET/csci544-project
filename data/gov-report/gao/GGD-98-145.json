In 1996, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) recommended that the maximum permissible \u201chold period\u201d for local checks be extended from 2 to 3 business days after the day of deposit to give banks adequate time to identify fraudulent checks that should be dishonored. Consumer groups disagreed with that recommendation and countered that giving banks an additional day would create hardships for consumers. The 2-day hold period for local checks remains in effect.", "Concerns about both check fraud risk and depositors\u2019 access to funds have heightened interest in how technology can help the check-collection process by potentially speeding up the return of checks dishonored due to insufficient funds, fraud, or other reasons, while continuing to allow ready access to deposited funds. According to the Federal Reserve Board, the experience of depositary banks (the first bank at which a check is deposited) in receiving returned checks is one of the most significant factors to consider in assessing uniform time schedules under which bank deposits should be made available to depositors.", "You requested that we provide information about the current role of electronic check presentment (ECP) in the collection process for \u201cinterbank checks\u201d\u2014checks for which the depositary bank and the paying bank are not the same entity.

With ECP, the paying bank must decide whether to honor the check, or have the check returned to the depositary bank, upon receipt of the electronic data rather than the paper check.", "As agreed with your offices, our objectives were to (1) identify and describe the ECP services offered to U.S. banks; (2) determine the ECP volume in the United States for 1995 through 1997; (3) determine whether ECP affects the length of time that it takes for a dishonored check to be returned to the depositary bank; (4) identify any factors that may limit ECP use; and (5) determine how ECP may affect banks\u2019 risk of check fraud."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, an estimated 64 billion checks were written in the United States. Approximately 30 to 35 percent of these checks were \u201con-us\u201d checks\u2014that is, checks for which the collecting bank (any bank except the paying bank handling the item for collection) and the paying bank (the bank on which the check is drawn) are the same entity. On-us checks never enter the interbank check-collection process. The remaining 65 to 70 percent (about 45 billion checks in 1996) of the checks written were interbank checks.", "Interbank checks are cleared and settled through an elaborate check-collection process. The check-collection process includes, among other steps, check presentment and the final settlement of checks. Check presentment occurs when the checks are delivered to the paying banks for payment and the paying banks must decide whether to honor or return the checks. Final settlement of checks occurs when the collecting banks are credited and the paying banks are debited, usually through accounts held at either Federal Reserve Banks or correspondent banks.", "In the check-collection process, depositary banks generally sort deposited checks by destination and dispatch them for collection. Depositary banks can physically present paper checks to paying banks through several methods: direct presentment of the paper checks to the paying banks; exchange of paper checks at clearing houses in which the depositary banks and the paying banks are members; presentment of the paper checks through intermediaries, such as correspondent banks or Federal Reserve check offices; or some combination of the above methods, such as depositary banks using correspondent banks to collect checks and the correspondents collecting those checks through local clearing houses or Federal Reserve check offices.", "When paying banks decide not to pay certain checks, they must return the dishonored checks to the depositary banks. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the paying bank generally has until midnight of the day following presentment (\u201cmidnight deadline\u201d) to return dishonored checks or send notices of dishonor. (The UCC and other laws and regulations governing the check-collection processes are described below.) Banks use this period to decide whether or not to pay checks. Dishonored checks are returned for several reasons, such as insufficient funds in the check writer\u2019s account, issuance of a stop-payment order on the check, or because the check was written on a closed account. Banks vary considerably in their policies for making pay/no pay decisions and may view these decisions as a matter of customer service. Thus, even if banks have earlier information indicating that some checks may have to be returned, using the entire period permitted by the UCC may enable the bank to honor the check. The paying banks may return dishonored checks, commonly referred to as return items, directly to the depositary banks, through clearing house associations, or to any returning bank (a bank handling a returned check), including the Federal Reserve Banks.", "Although most paper checks are physically presented to the paying banks, checks can be presented electronically by agreement with paying banks. When checks are electronically presented, the MICR data are electronically transmitted by the presenting bank to the paying banks and the receipt of these data constitutes presentment, rather than the paying banks\u2019 receipt of the paper checks. The paper checks may be sent to the paying banks at a later time or may be \u201ctruncated\u201d or held, at some point in the collection process, depending upon the terms of the applicable electronic presentment agreement. When checks are truncated, the check writers do not receive the cancelled checks. Checks can be truncated at depositary banks or at intermediary banks, such as Federal Reserve Banks or correspondent banks.", "The check-collection process is regulated by a complex system of laws and regulations. The primary laws affecting checks are Articles 3 and 4 of the UCC, as adopted in each state; EFAA; and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulations CC and J. The UCC is a set of model laws that govern commercial and financial activities. Efforts have been made to encourage each of the 50 states to enact UCC articles in a uniform manner. The UCC\u2019s Articles 3 and 4 govern negotiable instruments, including checks and bank deposits, and collections, respectively. Article 4 was revised in 1990, in part, to promote the efficiency of the check-collection process by making the provisions of Article 4 more compatible with the needs of an automated system and to facilitate the adoption of programs allowing for the presentment of checks by electronic transmission of information. Although the UCC allows for the use of electronic check presentment, paying banks still have the legal right to insist on paper presentment. EFAA, which is implemented through Regulation CC, limits the time that banks can hold funds deposited into customer accounts before these funds must be made available for withdrawal. Regulation CC, which preempts the UCC or other state law to the extent that either is inconsistent with Regulation CC, also governs the collection and return of checks. Regulation J governs checks collected through the Federal Reserve System.", "EFAA and Regulation CC establish the specific funds availability schedules for checks. Generally, funds are to be made available for withdrawal within 2 business days after the day of deposit for local checks and within 5 business days for nonlocal checks. Local checks, in general, are those for which the depositary bank and the paying bank are located in the same Federal Reserve check-processing region. Nonlocal checks, in general, are those for which the depositary bank and the paying bank are located in different Federal Reserve check-processing regions.", "EFAA and Regulation CC also require that the first $100 of a depositor\u2019s aggregated checks and certain other types of checks, such as Treasury, state and local government, or cashier\u2019s checks, are to be made available for withdrawal by the next business day after the day of deposit. Under EFAA and Regulation CC, banks are permitted to hold checks longer for, among other things, checks over $5,000 or suspicious checks. In certain circumstances, such as when banks have reasonable cause to believe that certain checks are uncollectible or when an account is new, the banks may delay the availability of funds. In such a case, the banks must notify the customers, explain the delay, and indicate when the funds will be available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify and describe the ECP services offered to U.S. banks, we interviewed officials from the Federal Reserve Board and FRBM and reviewed Federal Reserve Board documents that described the Federal Reserve\u2019s ECP services. We also interviewed officials at the New York Clearing House Association (NYCHA), the Electronic Check Clearing House Organization (ECCHO), and the American Bankers Association (ABA).", "To determine the volume of checks that were electronically presented in the United States from 1995 to 1997, we collected data from the Federal Reserve Banks on their ECP services. To calculate the percentage of the ECP volume in the U.S. interbank check-collection market, we used the number of interbank checks cited in the January 1998 report by the Committee on the Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism. The number of interbank checks is an estimate because the actual number of checks that are cleared through clearing houses and correspondent banks, and by direct presentment, as well as the number of on-us checks, is unknown.", "To determine how ECP affects the length of time it takes for a dishonored check to be returned to a depositary bank, we used data from a survey coordinated by the Federal Reserve Board and conducted by four Federal Reserve offices. At our request, the Federal Reserve collected information on the return cycle time for a small sample of items that were initially presented by either paper check or electronic transmission and that were returned as dishonored through four Federal Reserve check offices. This information was collected for a sample of 2,258 return items, primarily during the week of January 12 through 16, 1998. The four check offices were selected because they had higher-than-average ECP volumes. Also, the Federal Reserve Board applied the same ECP return item survey to FRBM\u2019s additional ECP service, ECCS, which is offered only to banks located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. For comparison purposes, we also collected comparable check-return data from 10 judgmentally selected banks in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that do not participate in ECCS.", "Because the sizes of the samples were small and not selected on a random basis, we could not make any statistical generalizations regarding the entire banking industry or the Federal Reserve\u2019s ECP services on the basis of these surveys. Since the samples were selected during an 1-week period at 4 Federal Reserve check offices, we could not ascertain whether our results would differ if the samples were taken over a longer period of time or collected at more of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 45 check offices. Furthermore, our results may not fully reflect differences among paper presentment and ECP services because the checks are not assigned to these processes on a random basis, but rather on the basis of each paying bank\u2019s decisions. It is reasonable to expect that paying banks make decisions to accept electronic presentment based on a number of criteria, such as price and availability of services. Thus, the returned checks collected from the different presentment methods may well have different characteristics; these could, in turn, affect the time required for their return if they are dishonored by the paying bank. This nonrandom selection process limited our ability to determine whether ECP services available nationwide had any effect on check return cycles.", "To determine potential legal and operational impediments to ECP, we interviewed officials at several large banks, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis and Boston, and NYCHA. We asked these officials how certain provisions of the UCC\u2019s Articles 3 and 4, EFAA, and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation CC and other issues may impede increased ECP use.", "To determine how ECP may affect a bank\u2019s risk of check fraud, we interviewed officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), NYCHA, and three large commercial banks in New York City. In addition, we sent a survey of written questions regarding ECP and check fraud risk to six large commercial banks that are members of ECCHO. Five of the six banks responded to our survey questions.", "We obtained written comments on a draft of this report from the Federal Reserve Board. Their comments are discussed near the end of this report and are reprinted in appendix II.

In addition, FRBM offers ECCS to banks located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. For all four ECP services, Federal Reserve check offices transmit the electronic data to the paying banks and receipt of these data constitutes presentment. Under the three nationally available ECP services, the collecting banks deposit checks with the Federal Reserve check offices, but the three ECP services differ in how the Federal Reserve check offices handle the paper checks after they have been electronically presented to paying banks. The return process for Basic items is the same process used to return checks that were physically presented. The other two nationally available ECP services, MICR Plus and Truncation, use different processes to return checks than those used to return physically presented checks.", "The fundamental characteristic of ECCS, which distinguishes it from other Federal Reserve ECP services, is that banks using the service do not deliver paper checks to FRBM; instead, they electronically transmit the checks\u2019 MICR data to FRBM. Since depositary banks keep the deposited checks until the checks are finally paid, they can pull any paper checks that are dishonored by the paying banks. Under ECCS, depositary banks receive notices of dishonored checks from paying banks through FRBM.", "Table 1 lists the four Federal Reserve ECP services and explains (1) how collecting banks deposit checks with the Federal Reserve check offices and (2) how paper checks and return items are handled after electronic presentment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Check Clearing Houses\u2019 Electronic Services Do Not Constitute Presentment", "paragraphs": ["Private clearing houses offer electronic check information services to banks. These services transmit the MICR data to the paying banks, but they do not constitute electronic presentment of checks. Industry officials we interviewed noted that, while agreements between or among banks that would enable them to present checks directly and electronically are possible under the UCC, few such agreements exist. NYCHA offers electronic check informational services to banks in which the MICR data are transmitted to paying banks with the paper presentment to follow. Banks perceive some advantages to receiving MICR data before the paper checks are physically presented. One banking official told us that electronic transmission of MICR data, used as an informational service, may assist a paying bank with its cash management services or allow the bank to debit a customer\u2019s account earlier than it otherwise could. Such information may also provide for earlier identification of checks that cannot be paid. For instance, checks written on closed accounts cannot be paid and thus are returned to the depositary bank. NYCHA estimated that in 1997 its members electronically transmitted data on 53 million checks, or approximately 19 percent of the total volume of checks exchanged at NYCHA. Additionally, several commercial banks formed ECCHO in 1989 to coordinate the use of electronic check information among banks and to design standards for the use of electronic check information.

This check-return performance is low compared with the bank average reported by the Board in the same survey.

The Federal Reserve Board said that checks returned through one or more intermediary banks, such as Federal Reserve Banks, were not received by depositary banks as quickly as checks returned directly to depositary banks by paying banks. Federal Reserve Board officials said that the Federal Reserve\u2019s lower percentage of returned checks delivered within the 2-day hold period reflects, in part, the Federal Reserve\u2019s obligation to provide services to handle checks that cannot be easily processed by direct presentment or through a clearing house."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results Showed Banks Using ECCS Had a Better Check-Return Performance Than Banks Presenting Paper Checks", "paragraphs": ["We found that ECCS, the ECP service available only to banks in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, provided a better check-return performance than the paper-check presentment method used by banks in the same area.

As a result, it is not likely that the savings in the time between ECCS and paper presentment may be achieved in the banking industry as a whole. First, several regional conditions complicated the return of dishonored checks within the 2-day hold period for local checks using the paper presentment process. These conditions included severe winter weather conditions, the distances between the banks and the most commonly used private check clearing house and the Federal Reserve check office in Minneapolis, and the two time zones dividing the banks in the Upper Peninsula area.", "In addition, the composition of ECCS participating banks and the low volume of checks electronically presented through ECCS may have contributed to its better performance. Banks participating in ECCS had to store a fairly limited number of checks and retrieve a small number of return items. All of the ECCS participating banks were small, with assets ranging from $52 million to $350 million. In 1997, ECCS volume was nearly 1.9 million checks.

According to these banking officials, perpetrators of fraud are becoming more sophisticated in committing check fraud. A banking official told us that large banks in New York City and San Francisco face a greater potential for check fraud than small banks located in rural areas. Of the five commercial banks that responded to our written survey questions, four listed forgeries of either signatures or endorsements as the type of check fraud that has caused them their highest dollar losses since 1995.

According to one banking official, banks need access to the paper checks to detect potential forged signatures or counterfeit checks. Because the receipt of the MICR data does not provide paying banks with information viewed as adequate for identifying forged signatures, these banking officials said they have continued to insist on paper presentment. As previously noted, although the UCC permits the use of electronic presentment agreements between the presenting bank and the paying bank, very few agreements have been negotiated.", "A potential alternative to paper checks is a digitized image of checks.

First, according to one banking official, banks are unlikely to invest their financial resources in check imaging technology because customers expect to have their cancelled paper checks returned. Second, check images cannot currently be economically transmitted. One check image consists of a massive amount of digital information\u2014that is, about 50,000 bytes of information, compared with 94 bytes of information for a MICR data transmission. The Committee on the Federal Reserve in the Payment Mechanism, in its January 1998 report, stated that imaging technology would require both additional investment and ongoing costs for banks. The committee also noted in the report that \u201cthere is some risk that changes in technology and the evolution of the retail payments system will overtake the cost and benefit issues\u201d associated with check imaging. For example, while \u201cthere is little evidence to suggest that the volume of checks is likely to drop substantially over the next several years,\u201d check imaging could become obsolete if other electronic payment methods emerge and lead to a decreased use of checks.", "ECP use may enhance a bank\u2019s ability to identify checks that cannot be paid, such as checks written on closed accounts, and potentially deter some types of check fraud.

If the MICR data were presented faster to the paying banks than paper checks are, this action might facilitate the identification of a check written on a closed account or a check written on an account with insufficient funds.", "However, a Federal Reserve official and a banking official noted that both ECP and paper presentment methods have some limits in detecting some types of check fraud, particularly forged endorsements, and that it would be difficult to judge which method is superior.
