In September 2007, USAID and Pakistan signed an agreement regarding development activities in the FATA including the creation of joint strategic implementation plans for the seven FATA geographic areas. We found, however, that the U.S. and Pakistan have not yet completed such plans. The U.S. government has implemented two efforts to track its $750 million pledge in accordance with good management practices. State is tallying allocations of U.S. programs in Pakistan's western frontier region (which includes the FATA), and the USAID controller in Islamabad has undertaken an effort to track most, but not all, U.S. development-related obligations and expenditures in the FATA. As of the end of fiscal year 2009, the U.S. government has reportedly allocated over $728 million toward the pledge. USAID and State collect reports on the performance of their FATA-specific programs. However, key elements, such as identification of evaluation efforts and a timeline for reviewing implementing partner reports required by USAID's regulations are missing in its performance management plan for the FATA. Also, State did not collect all the required project performance documentation. Long-term development programs for which performance could be measured against annual targets generally did not achieve targets. Although hampered by security challenges that prevent direct monitoring called for in its guidance, USAID has taken steps to apply a set of indirect monitoring procedures. This includes collecting information from implementing partners and locally employed staff, and the use of a geographic information system. While USAID officials told GAO they use these methods, GAO found that USAID did not always document the use of these monitoring procedures. GAO also found that State has several monitoring procedures, but had not fully documented their use of these procedures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Pakistan is a key U.S. ally in the fight against terrorism and violent  extremism.

For this objective, we limited  our focus to the reporting on U.S. activities in the FATA, rather than the  broader western frontier region and compared performance planning and  reporting documentation required against that which was provided. In  addition, we reviewed the ADS Chapter 203 to determine the requirements  for the assistance objective performance management plan. We also  reviewed the most recent annual performance reporting instruments for  each USAID program and INL and F Bureau performance reports to  determine the progress of programs against targets in the programs\u2019 most  recent year of operation. Specifically, in reviewing the long-term USAID  programs we compared performance indicator annual targets against  actual progress made in their most recent year of operation, using their  most recent annual reporting instruments. Indicators were placed in the  following categories based on their level of actual progress: Indicator met  or exceeded target (100% or above); Progress made, more than 50% of  target achieved (51%-99%); Progress made, 50% or less achieved (1%-50%);  Indicator made no progress (0%). In appendix III indicators were further  broken out into quartiles (1%-25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75% and 76%-99%) and  indicators for which progress could not be determined were included (i.e.  indicators such as those for which no target was set or long-term targets  were set, but no annual targets were set). In categorizing the progress  made by performance indicators against targets, the indicators were  weighted equally (whether output, intermediate result or outcome). There  are limitations to this approach, since some indicators may be much more  important than others, and there are likely large qualitative differences  between them. USAID\u2019s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) program does  not use program-level performance indicators or set annual targets and  INL sets out many technical specifications for their construction activities  in cost estimate documents, but INL did not provide information on  performance indicators. We therefore modified our approach to report on  performance of their programs, studying planning and reporting  documentation on an activity level for OTI and INL, rather than program- wide. In designing the analysis for the OTI and INL activities, we wanted to  ensure that we reviewed a range of programs reflecting differences that  could affect program implementation and results. However, we were not  able to clearly identify a population, which led us to select a judgmental  rather than a random sample. Our judgmental sample consisted of 48 out  of 437 USAID OTI activities and 42 out of 426 INL activities in the FATA  for further analysis based on the following criteria:    geographical location\u2014we ensured each FATA agency in which activities  were taking place was represented in the samples;  type of activity\u2014we included examples of each type of activity including  education, health, road construction, and border outpost construction;    budgeted cost of the activity\u2014we targeted the activities with higher costs;    status of the project\u2014we ensured that both ongoing and completed  activities were represented.", "For our analysis of USAID\u2019s OTI program results, we focused on those  activities that had reached the most advanced stage of completion. USAID  defines closed activities as those reported to have finished all work. There  were 17 closed activities in our sample of 48. We eliminated 2 activities  because they were surveys, for which the very use of the monitoring  procedures would be counterproductive, as the attention would possibly  influence responses. The resulting 15 activities we analyzed further  because output targets were set for the end of each activity. We compared  the output targets set for individual activities against actual performance  and placed the output indicators in the same categories used for the long- term USAID programs. To analyze INL\u2019s performance we could not  compare performance indicators against targets as we did with USAID\u2019s  long-term and OTI efforts because INL did not provide information on  indicators. Instead, we compared documentation of activity completion  certification against the activities INL reported as completed \u2013 which were  22 of the 42 activities in our sample. For those activities reported as  completed, but not certified, we reviewed reporting documentation for  evidence of progress made. As this is a judgmental sample, we cannot  make generalizations using this analysis. However, given the care taken in  the selection of our sample, we determined that this methodology is  adequate for our purpose of providing insight into program planning and  performance.", "To assess U.S. monitoring efforts, we focused on the monitoring of U.S.  activities in the FATA, rather than the broader western frontier region.

Foreign assistance is vital to help the Government of Pakistan (GOP) overcome the  political, economic, and security challenges that threaten Pakistan\u2019s long-term  stability.  For this reason and in light of the significant increase in foreign  assistance funding for Pakistan, we welcome the GAO review of our programs and  the opportunity to improve upon our efforts.", "The Department of State concurs with the overarching recommendation of  the GAO report that assistance programs should align with U.S. national security  objectives and the Government of Pakistan\u2019s requirements and that efforts to  monitor and report on programs, performance, and spending should be robust and  transparent.  The Department of State\u2019s Bureau for International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), as the primary State Department entity providing  significant civilian assistance programming in the FATA, has been working since  the 1980s to implement development assistance programs in close coordination  with Pakistani partners.", "The Department generally concurs with GAO\u2019s recommendation to improve  INL\u2019s performance reporting and will take the recommendation under  consideration as it refines the existing process and defines new requirements for  performance measurement and reporting.  INL uses well-established procedures to  produce project-level performance documents that set out quantifiable  measurements, which are mutually agreed upon with GOP partners.  These  documents include project proposals and cost estimates (PC-1s), which outline the  project description, justification, objective(s), and target(s), and memoranda of  understanding, which provide USG-GOP agreement on implementation procedures  for specific projects.", "The Department generally concurs with GAO\u2019s recommendation that the  Department of State improve documentation of its monitoring efforts.  While the  Department acknowledges that reporting on these efforts needs improvement,  Pakistan-based INL staff conduct regular monitoring and oversight visits to project  sites throughout the FATA, NWFP, and Balochistan as well as other locations  throughout the country, as the security environment permits.  As a testament to this  personalized approach, INL provided GAO with site visit reports, drafted by INL  in-country staff, for 36, and photos taken by INL personnel for 39, of the 42  projects for which GAO requested data.  Three of the six projects lacking site visit  reports and two of the three projects lacking photos are located in North and South  Waziristan, where militant activities and military operations have created a security situation where site visits could not be safely conducted in recent years.", "The GAO report did not reference INL\u2019s rigorous End Use Monitoring  (EUM) program, which is a year-round effort overseen by the INL Director and  Management Officer in Pakistan and executed by four locally-employed staff, to  track and monitor all INL assistance provided to Government of Pakistan entities. INL EUM staff members conduct scheduled and unscheduled on-site inspections at  locations throughout Pakistan, process quarterly reports on assistance from  Government of Pakistan partners, and maintain day-to-day contact with relevant  GOP officials.  In recent years, the EUM reports for Pakistan have found that the  vast majority of INL assistance to Pakistani partners is being used as intended and  that recipients\u2019 procedures for tracking locations and use of resources has been  excellent. Given the tenuous security situation, this is an impressive record of  USG employees conducting hands-on field monitoring in a highly difficult  operating environment.  The GAO audit prompted INL to initiate new efforts to  improve its monitoring documentation and organization systems, including  labeling all monitoring photos, improving electronic and physical filing systems,  and producing electronic minutes of all meetings with GOP counterparts.  INL is  also planning regional training for monitoring staff this calendar year.", "Finally, the Department of State believes that, as drafted, the GAO report  underestimates the impact of the security environment on the implementation and  monitoring of U.S. Government programs in the FATA and western frontier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Hynek P.
