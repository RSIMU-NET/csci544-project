However, they do so in different ways in the absence of a DOD-wide strategy for what information should be collected. For example, the Air Force measures the time to award beginning with solicitation issuance, while the other components use a different starting point. As a result, information the components collect is not comparable and is of limited use for understanding contract award time frames department-wide. Determining what information is needed to monitor time taken to award contracts consistently across components should help DOD assess its progress toward reducing the time.", "GAO analyzed the time from solicitation issuance to award for 129 weapon systems-related contracts and found it ranged from less than a month to over 4 years.

One of the offerors protested the  evaluation of its proposal, which was found technically unacceptable.  The offeror\u2019s protest was denied because it was found that the  evaluation of the proposal was reasonable and consistent with the  terms of the solicitation. In addition, the offeror initially selected for  award of the approximately $17 million contract was the lowest priced  proposal that was found technically acceptable. However, the  contracting officer subsequently found the offeror nonresponsive due  to several challenges. These challenges and the pre-award bid  protest resulted in a longer than anticipated discussion phase, and the  award was made to the next lowest priced offeror.", "Contracting officials for 2 contracts awarded using other than full and  open competition cited obtaining agreement on profit or fee as a factor  that lengthened the negotiation phase. For example, in an Army  contract for spares, maintenance, and overhaul of an airframe, the  government and the contractor disagreed over the profit margin.  Negotiations for the approximately $54 million contract stalled until the  issue was elevated to higher levels at both the contractor and the  government.

DOD does not have a  comprehensive strategy to use the component information already  available or to collect other information that may be needed to assess  contract award time frames. Having a DOD-wide strategy could enable  DOD to consistently and comprehensively track contract award time,  assess the factors contributing to this time, leverage the various efforts  that the components have taken, identify any best practices, and measure  progress toward any goals for reducing the time to award contracts.  Currently, DOD does not define the events that should be measured  occurring prior to solicitation or those that occur between solicitation  issuance and contract award. While the military components collect  various information about the length of time to award contracts based on  their specific needs and organizational structures, at a minimum, DOD  should have relevant information for its own management purposes. As  DOD implements provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018, the department has an opportunity to identify what  data, if any, beyond just the overall procurement administrative lead time  should be collected and reported.
