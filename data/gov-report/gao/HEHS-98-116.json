Over a third of the 3.4 million veterans served by these facilities each year must travel long or time-consuming distances to receive care.", "In 1995, VHA announced plans to transition from a hospital-based system of care to a health-care system rooted in primary and ambulatory care. VHA restructured its facilities into 22 service delivery networks and encouraged network directors to establish community-based outpatient clinics. These clinics differ from traditional free-standing VHA outpatient facilities in that they basically provide primary care to veterans and frequently use non-VHA providers. The type of care veterans receive at these new clinics is comparable to that available during visits to a private physician\u2019s general practice office.", "In an April 1996 hearing, we discussed the networks\u2019 first 12 operating community-based clinics and planning efforts for additional clinics. We concluded that community-based clinics could be a cost-effective way to enhance veterans\u2019 access to VHA primary care. We expressed concern, however, that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to assess VHA\u2019s progress because networks had not developed comprehensive plans to guide the development of new clinics. In a subsequent report, we recommended that VHA require networks to develop such plans and, in doing so, focus first on improving access for current users, with a goal of equalizing access systemwide on the basis of a consistent travel standard and in accordance with veterans\u2019 statutory priorities for care. In response, VHA agreed to improve the process that networks use when planning and operating new community-based clinics and to provide more detailed guidelines.", "This report responds to your request for information on VHA\u2019s use of community-based clinics to improve veterans\u2019 access to primary care.

In addition, we interviewed VHA officials responsible for developing planning guidance for networks and for reviewing network activities. We also visited VHA\u2019s New York/New Jersey Network headquartered in Bronx, New York; Southwest Healthcare Network in Phoenix, Arizona; and Desert Pacific Healthcare Network in Long Beach, California. We selected these networks because they had widely varying service areas, financial resources, and experiences in operating community-based clinics. For example, the New York/New Jersey Network covers the smallest geographic area compared with the Southwest Healthcare Network, which covers one of the largest areas. At each network, we interviewed staff, reviewed planning documents and clinic evaluations, and toured hospitals and clinics. At the networks based in New York and California, we interviewed individual veterans and conducted group discussions with approximately 40 veterans who had received care from their respective networks\u2019 community-based clinics.

However, of the 26 million veterans who are eligible for care, about half live more than 25 miles from a VHA hospital and about one-third live more than 25 miles from a VHA clinic. Of the approximately 3.4 million veterans VHA currently serves, we estimate that about 1 million travel more than 25 miles to access VHA primary care from a VHA hospital or clinic. In addition, many eligible veterans who are not currently receiving care say that they do not use VHA primary care services because they live too far from a VHA facility.", "In the early 1990s, VHA began developing a strategy to expand its ability to provide primary care, especially for veterans who had to travel many miles to receive care from existing facilities. In January 1994, the VHA hospital in Amarillo, Texas\u2014now a part of the Southwest Network\u2014established what is commonly recognized as the first VHA community-based clinic.", "Until the establishment of the Amarillo clinic, VHA had required its hospitals to meet rigid criteria to establish separate outpatient facilities apart from hospitals. These criteria included that clinics had to serve a projected workload of 3,000 visits or more per year and be located at least 100 miles or 3 hours travel time away from the nearest VHA facility.", "Subsequently, VHA encouraged its hospitals to consider establishing community-based clinics similar to Amarillo\u2019s. In doing this, VHA eliminated its restrictions concerning workload and location. It also encouraged hospitals to consider contracting with other providers when it was in the interest of the veteran and the hospital.", "In late 1995, VHA reorganized its field operations into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN). (See fig. 1.) These networks are the basic budgetary and decisionmaking units of VHA\u2019s health care system. Networks have responsibility for making a wide range of decisions about care delivery options, including planning and establishing community-based outpatient clinics.", "In January and February 1995, VHA approved 15 proposals for new community-based clinics. Although networks submitted many more proposals, VHA did not approve any additional clinics until October 1996.

These summaries were to describe certain key operational elements, such as target population, service availability, and cost.", "VHA revised its guidelines in August 1996 to require networks to establish clinics primarily for current users who live more than 30 minutes from an existing VHA clinic. VHA separately required networks to develop annual business plans that, among other things, are to include information on the number of community-based clinics to be established and projected time frames. In addition, VHA provided guidance to networks for developing proposals\u2014which were to provide more details than the original white papers\u2014and implemented a process to help networks develop more consistent and thorough proposals, in accordance with VHA\u2019s guidelines."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Planning Criteria Clarify Target Veteran Population", "paragraphs": ["In our 1996 testimony and report, we concluded that VHA had not adequately defined target veteran populations for new community-based clinics or reasonable travel goals for use in locating new clinics.

We recommended that VHA state which veterans were to be the primary group to be served by these new clinics and that they establish a travel time or distance standard when planning for new clinics.", "In response, VHA instructed networks to establish clinics primarily to provide more convenient access to care for current users. Toward this end, VHA stated that it is desirable that a community-based clinic be located generally within 30 minutes\u2019 travel time from a veteran\u2019s home. VHA noted, however, that differences in veterans\u2019 medical conditions and other regional factors may affect veterans\u2019 access to VHA care.

We expressed concern that this approach would make it difficult, if not impossible, to assess networks\u2019 planning efforts individually or systemwide.", "As part of its overall restructuring efforts, VHA requires networks to develop annual business plans that are to show how a network intends to spend its resources. In response to our concern, VHA instructed networks to include, as part of their business plans, the number of clinics to be established, time frames for establishing clinics, and locations of planned clinics. VHA stated its intent to consolidate the 22 network plans into a national business plan, which would permit an assessment of network activities from a systemwide perspective.", "With the networks\u2019 1997 and 1998 business plans completed\u2014and their 1999 business plans to be completed over the next 3 months\u2014the evolving nature of clinic planning activities can be seen. In their 1997 business plans, the 22 networks reported their intent to establish 211 clinics by the year 2001. As networks gained experience in planning and operating clinics, the number of clinics to be established grew significantly. Networks\u2019 1998 business plans show that 402 additional clinics are to be established by 2002, although a target year had not been selected for 93 of these clinics. (See table 1.) We surveyed networks about 2 months after their business plans were submitted and found that they had since decided to establish most of the 93 clinics in years 1999 through 2002.", "The 22 business plans are intended to provide estimates of the number of clinics networks plan to propose and projected time frames for when the clinics will become operational. Collectively, the estimates and projections have been fairly reliable. For example, of the 124 clinics total planned for in the networks\u2019 1997 business plans, 122 were actually proposed. However, only four networks proposed the same number of clinics as they had indicated in their business plans. Of the remaining 18 networks, 10 proposed a total of 29 more clinics than they had planned and 8 proposed 31 fewer. Still, the majority of networks that proposed more or less than they had stated in their business plans were within three clinics of their estimates.", "In April 1997, VHA consolidated the 22 network plans into its national business plan. The consolidated plan summarizes the number of community-based clinics that networks have established and plan to establish. However, the plan does not provide sufficient information to assess the impact of community-based clinics on veterans\u2019 access to care on a systemwide basis. In July 1997, VHA was directed by the Senate Appropriations Committee to address the need for a national plan and to respond to the findings and recommendations in our October 1996 report.In its report to the Committee, submitted in April 1998, VHA stated that its response to our October 1996 report remained essentially unchanged from its original comments summarized in our report. In other words, VHA believes that its April 1997 national plan\u2014based on the total number of clinics contained in the 22 individual business plans\u2014is responsive to our concerns.", "At the time of our earlier report, we did agree that VHA\u2019s intended national business plan could provide a means to achieve the intent of our recommendations. However, it was not known at the time whether the plan would ultimately provide sufficient detail to afford the Congress enough information to determine the overall extent and cost of establishing community-based clinics. Now that we have had the opportunity to review networks\u2019 1997 and 1998 business plans, VHA\u2019s national plan, and VHA\u2019s report to the Senate, our concerns remain.", "In contradiction to VHA\u2019s contention that the sum of clinics contained in 22 individual network business plans can serve as an adequate national plan for establishing community-based clinics, we believe it contains less information than do the individual business plans upon which it is based.

To obtain greater consistency among proposals for community-based clinics, VHA provided in August 1996 additional guidance on determining how key elements apply to the needs of the veterans who would be served by the proposed clinics and the network\u2019s ability to fund such clinics. The guidance also provided a standard format for presenting their planning assessment results.", "Along with the new proposal guidelines, VHA also implemented a new management process to help ensure more thorough and consistent oversight of network proposals. VHA established a task force to assist networks in developing their proposals and to serve as a resource to both network and VHA management. The task force was responsible for ensuring that the information contained in the proposals was complete, accurate, and met VHA requirements. In doing its work, the task force also trained and developed network staff in the skills of preparing clinic proposals. As part of its work, it prepared and distributed guidelines that contained a standardized proposal format with examples and sample wording network planners could use to develop their own proposals.", "The task force reviewed proposals for 178 clinics and determined that each met VHA\u2019s guidelines.

The 14 networks estimate that 63 percent of users resided within 30 minutes in 1997, with this increase attributable primarily to the new clinics. Despite these improvements, the variability in the percentage of veterans having reasonable access in the 14 networks remains large.

Evaluations should be ongoing in order to provide managers with information they can use to adjust or fundamentally change the structure and processes of a program to improve its outcomes.

Neither VHA nor network officials are able to adequately answer basic questions such as the following:", "How many VHA primary care facilities in each network meet VHA\u2019s travel standard by providing veterans reasonable access to health care (within 30 minutes of their homes)?", "How many current users in each network do not have reasonable access to VHA primary care?", "Of those veterans, how many have service-connected disabilities (highest priority for care)?", "How many current users will obtain reasonable access through the establishment of new clinics in the next 5 years?", "Of those veterans, how many have service-connected disabilities?", "How many newly established clinics meet VHA\u2019s performance goals and objectives?", "Network business plans, proposals, and responses to our surveys failed to provide adequate information to answer these key questions. Information available suggests considerable variation among networks, which raises concerns about the equity of veterans\u2019 access to care even though networks have improved access for thousands of current users. This is because networks started at different access levels and have established clinics at widely varying rates. Moreover, networks appear to be planning without regard to the priorities. As a result, they will spend limited resources on lower priority new users in 1997 and 1998, while improved access for thousands of higher priority current users will not be available until 2000 and beyond.", "In order to avoid such potential undesirable situations, and consistent with GPRA, VHA would need to establish results-oriented goals to ensure that each network affords reasonable access to VHA primary care for a minimum percentage of current users by 2002 with the intent of equalizing access systemwide to the maximum extent practical, establishes clinics so as to provide veterans improved access consistent with statutory priorities for care, and evaluates its clinics\u2019 performance using a consistent set of minimal criteria.", "VHA appears to have a timely opportunity to improve network planning activities, given the networks plan to complete their 1999 business plans within the next 3 months. Additional VHA guidance and other VHA assistance in developing networks\u2019 1999 business plans could result in a more consistent and thorough strategy for using clinics to equalize veterans\u2019 geographic access to VHA primary care systemwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to take the following actions:", "Set a national target level of performance that focuses each network on a goal of providing reasonable geographic access to VHA primary care for the highest percentage of current users practical by 2002.", "Require networks to include in their business plans the percentage of (1) current users, by priority status, who have reasonable access; (2) the remaining current users (without reasonable access), by priority status, who are targeted to receive improved access through the establishment of community clinics by 2002; and (3) current users, by priority status, who will not have reasonable access by 2002.", "Require networks to plan and propose new community-based clinics in a manner that ensures that veterans with highest statutory priorities achieve reasonable access as quickly as possible, consistent with the requirements of the Veteran Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-292).", "Establish minimum criteria that all networks are to use annually for evaluating new clinics\u2019 performance.", "Require networks to annually report their evaluation results to the Capital Budgeting and Oversight Service, a unit within VA, and to others for their use in reviewing proposals for new clinics and other purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on our draft report, VHA officials generally agreed with our findings and recommendations. To improve planning, actions are being taken to incorporate in networks\u2019 business plans information on current users\u2019 access to care now and by 2002. While agreeing that there is variation in access, VHA pointed out that it was not clear that a national target for access is required to focus networks. VHA bases this response on its preliminary analysis of clinic data, which indicates that by 2002, 80 percent of high-priority veterans will, on average, have improved access to care. We agree that networks seem focused on improving access for current users by 2002, but we remain concerned about the potentially large variability among networks, which could be between 70 and 95 percent based on estimates provided to us. As such, we believe that establishment of a national target or goal could help ensure that networks remain focused on achieving reasonable access for the highest percentage of veterans practical, while reducing the variations among networks to the greatest extent practical.", "VHA also agreed that minimum criteria should be established to evaluate clinic performance; VHA said it will identify a minimum criteria set for all networks that will focus on evaluation of outcomes. While noting that annual reporting seems excessive, VHA said it will perform annual evaluations until it can determine what a more reasonable time frame would be. VA also said it will report the results to the Capital Budgeting and Oversight Service, as recommended. Thereafter, VA suggested, and we agreed, that it seems reasonable to review and adjust clinic performance as part of the networks\u2019 planning processes.", "VHA officials agreed with the spirit of our recommendation requiring networks to plan and propose clinics to ensure that the highest statutory priority veterans (those with service-connected disabilities) achieve access as quickly as possible. VHA explained, however, that the Veteran Health Care Reform Act of 1996 will change veterans\u2019 eligibility for medical services beginning October 1, 1998, by requiring veterans to enroll for care. Service-connected veterans are in the higher enrollment priorities, but once veterans are enrolled, it will no longer differentiate among enrolled veterans by priority status. In other words, all enrolled veterans\u2014not just those with the highest priorities\u2014are to have equal access to needed services, and networks will necessarily need to address access for all enrolled veterans when planning community-based clinics. VHA suggested, and we agreed, that our recommendation require networks to plan clinics for veterans with the highest priorities in a manner consistent with the act.", "Please call me at (202) 512-7101 if you have any questions or need additional assistance.
