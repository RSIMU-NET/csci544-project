Since 1972, when over 130 nations took part in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the number of such agreements in which the United States participates or in which it has a significant interest has grown from fewer than 50 to more than 170. The parties to an international agreement implement the agreement domestically by establishing the necessary legislation, regulations, and administrative systems and by providing the requisite funding. In addition, to administer the agreement and to monitor results, the parties establish a secretariat, which they support financially and report to periodically. With the increase in the number of international environmental agreements has come a corresponding increase in spending by the world community to address specific transboundary environmental concerns. The U.S. government\u2019s expenditures to address these concerns have also increased in this period.", "You expressed concern about the absence of consolidated budget information on the funding of international environmental activities by the federal government and asked that we determine the overall level of federal funding for international environmental activities, including specific programs, treaty negotiations, information exchanges, conferences, and research.

These agencies are the Departments of State, Commerce, and Energy; the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It also was agreed that we would obtain spending information\u2014exclusive of assessed and voluntary contributions\u2014related to 12 prominent international environmental agreements (rather than the entire universe of such agreements) and for the 3 most recent fiscal years for which spending data are generally available (fiscal years 1993 through 1995).

In large part, this is due to the fact that the United States has long been a leader in identifying and attempting to deal with environmental problems that have national, regional, and global significance. Often the United States has taken action in the absence of international accords, while at the same time seeking to mobilize other members of the world community to address such problems in a concerted manner. As a result, many federal agencies established and administer environmental programs under legislative mandates and presidential directives that predate or have no direct connection with particular international agreements. Because spending on these programs would likely occur even in the absence of international environmental accords, agency officials and others tend to view these programs as being related to and supporting these international agreements only indirectly and incidentally.", "One result of this view is that there is generally no mechanism within these agencies or elsewhere in the federal government for systematically tracking agencies\u2019 spending\u2014other than voluntary or assessed contributions\u2014that relates to and supports the objectives of particular international environmental agreements. Consequently, there is no body of readily available statistical information concerning such spending, either on an agency-by-agency or on a governmentwide basis. Such statistics must be generated, instead, on an ad hoc basis, relying on historical program spending data and the judgment of officials with knowledge of the ways in which their agencies\u2019 program activities relate to and support the objectives of particular international environmental accords."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Total Spending for Five Agencies and 12 International Agreements", "paragraphs": ["The total spending, exclusive of salaries and overhead, for the five agencies and 12 international environmental agreements covered by our survey amounted to $975.2 million during fiscal years 1993-95. The largest share of the funding support for the 12 agreements covered was related directly or indirectly to the objectives and concerns of the United Nations (U.N.) Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Framework Convention). This share accounted for approximately 71 percent of the total spending. The Framework Convention was followed by the Convention on Biological Diversity, which represented approximately 20 percent of the total spending, and by the International Tropical Timber Agreement, which represented approximately 5 percent of the total. The remaining nine agreements together accounted for only about 4 percent of the total spending. (App. III shows the spending on the 12 agreements covered by our review and describes the general problem addressed by each agreement.)", "The great majority of the five agencies\u2019 spending in connection with these agreements was devoted to the agencies\u2019 specific programs and projects, which accounted for about 98 percent of the spending. These include scientific research programs and projects that only indirectly and incidentally support one or more of the agreements. Information exchanges and training, the second largest purpose category, accounted for about 2 percent of the total spending. All other purpose categories combined\u2014including sponsorship of conferences, travel to attend meetings and conferences, environmental research not included in specific programs and projects, and other nonspecified uses\u2014accounted for less than 1 percent of the total spending. (App. IV gives a complete breakdown of the total spending by purpose.)", "The five federal agencies covered by our review exhibited significant differences in spending, both in the total amounts and in the purposes for which the money was spent. They also differed with regard to the agreements the spending supported or to which it related in some way. In large measure, these differences are explained by the differing roles, missions, and activities of the agencies, including whether their spending was primarily for activities carried out within the agency itself or in the form of grants and contracts for activities largely performed outside the agency.

The State Department expended these funds principally for specific projects and programs, which accounted for about 45 percent of the reported expenditures.", "USAID is the principal foreign development assistance agency of the U.S. government. In fiscal years 1993-95, USAID obligated a total of $593.54 million in support of the objectives of the agreements covered by our review. The largest portion of this amount, about 56 percent, directly or indirectly supported the objectives of the Framework Convention. USAID reported that the predominant share of its spending, about 99 percent, went for specific projects and programs.", "DOE is a major participant in the multiagency U.S. Global Change Research Program, the objective of which is the improved prediction of global change, including climate change, as a basis for sustainable development. DOE reported that it obligated a total of $300.12 million in fiscal years 1993-95 in connection with the agreements covered by our review. Nearly all of this amount, approximately 98 percent, was for scientific research programs and projects that in indirect ways relate to the concerns and objectives addressed by the Framework Convention. DOE\u2019s documents show that most of these research activities were carried out by the universities, research institutes, and national laboratories that are the primary recipients of DOE\u2019s grants and contracts.", "EPA is the federal government\u2019s chief technical and regulatory agency for environmental matters. Its expertise causes it to play an important role in international, as well as domestic, environmental activities and programs. In the 3-year period covered by our review, EPA reported that it spent a total of $77.7 million in direct or indirect support of the objectives and concerns of the environmental agreements that were our focus. The largest portion of this spending, 80 percent, was most closely related to the concerns and objectives of the Framework Convention. With respect to the general purposes for which EPA spent these funds, the largest single share, about 85 percent, went for specific projects and programs.", "The Department of Commerce, largely through its National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, conducts a variety of research and data-gathering activities aimed at providing policymakers with the environmental information needed to make decisions.
