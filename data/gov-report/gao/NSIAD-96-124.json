In addition, some countries\u2019 carriers serve the United States on the basis of comity and reciprocity without any written agreement. Transportation provides technical expertise and does the substantive work in negotiating agreements, and State chairs aviation negotiations. On international shipping policy, however, the U.S. Maritime Administration takes the lead and chairs U.S. delegations, negotiating with the five countries that have bilateral maritime agreements with the United States. State is an active participant in these negotiations and is consulted on matters affecting U.S. foreign relations and economic interests.

Rather, State\u2019s office represents the Department\u2019s interests and articulates State\u2019s positions on delegations or interagency groups. Furthermore, the official said such duplication was necessary because each agency has different goals, perspectives, and agendas. The official added that without State\u2019s involvement, needed political and diplomatic input would be lost, and overall policy and diplomacy efforts could become imbalanced.

However, such actions are likely to face continued resistance both from within State and externally. According to a 1992 State management study, some State officials favor multiple country accreditation in some regions, where an ambassador operating from a regional post would \u201ccircuit ride\u201d to several small, neighboring countries. Regional posts would allow consolidation of staff and other resources in one central location, although cost reductions would be offset to some degree by travel and other related expenses. The study stated that dual or triple accreditation can work if there is reasonable geographic proximity or if convenient air routes are available; no or very small other-agency representation is in the country or countries concerned; and only occasional \u201ctending\u201d for diplomatic reasons is needed. State favorably cited British representation in Africa, where ambassadors are accredited to three or four countries each. The U.S. Embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados, has full diplomatic responsibilities for 7 countries and partial diplomatic responsibility for 14 others in the eastern Caribbean. If the foreign affairs budget declines, Embassy Bridgetown could serve as a model for regionalizing American diplomatic presence. To reduce costs, the State Department could expand multiple country accreditation to other regions, such as the Baltic States, Africa, and countries in South America such as Guyana and Suriname.", "A second option would be to reevaluate the need for consulates. One Deputy Chief of Mission suggested that while consulates served a variety of purposes during the Cold War, expanded media coverage and improved information and telecommunications technology have lessened the need for them. The Deputy Chief of Mission posed an option to eliminate all consulates to avoid political pressures when closures of specific consulates are debated. Although many consulates are small or moderately sized, some are bigger and more expensive to operate than major embassies. For example, in fiscal year 1995, the consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, cost about $18.8 million\u2014substantially more than the cost of operating the embassy in Ottawa, Canada ($5.9 million), and almost as much as the combined total for the embassy and all six consulates in Canada ($19.6 million).", "To critically review these and other options, one strategy would be to establish an independent post closure panel like the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission\u2014an approach that resulted in decisions to close, realign, or otherwise downsize hundreds of military bases and installations. Although the criteria involved in closing and downsizing overseas diplomatic posts are different, a panel much like the Commission may be useful. A panel could review the needed governmentwide presence at overseas posts as they relate to planned funding priorities. Since many other agencies depend on State\u2019s overseas presence, we believe that such an approach would allow for decision-making based on the need to support both State and non-State activities, consistent with overall U.S. policy interests and priorities as well as available resources.", "We believe that establishing such a commission would also have the added advantage of mitigating at least some of the pressures and parochial interests that have historically operated to maintain a U.S. overseas presence. The State Department\u2019s traditional policy of maintaining a diplomatic presence in nearly every country\u2014the policy of \u201cuniversality\u201d\u2014is the primary reason that there are 252 overseas posts, even where U.S. interests are now minimal.", "Universality is a principle rooted in the Cold War. According to the National Performance Review, during the Cold War, the United States obligated itself to maintain a presence around the world at least equal to that of the Soviet Union. However, despite the end of the Cold War, State remains reluctant to close embassies. In 1992, State decided to help finance new posts in the former Soviet Union by closing posts in other geographic regions, but some of State\u2019s geographic bureaus resisted proposing posts for closure. One bureau argued that it had been established in response to congressional interest in the region and that closing posts would be contrary to congressional intent. Another bureau initially refused to propose that any post be closed because it wanted to retain at least some presence in all countries.", "Despite the expense, the concept of universality remains firmly rooted in State\u2019s policy. State officials say that even in countries with minimal U.S. interests, a U.S. presence is important to provide international leadership, for example, to influence votes in the United Nations. In September 1995, the Secretary of State reaffirmed his commitment to universal representation, noting that it had been invaluable in extending the nuclear nonproliferation treaty earlier in the year and that it was essential when crises erupt in unexpected places like Burundi and Belarus and when American citizens experience trouble abroad.", "In addition to internal resistance, the State Department has faced outside resistance to closing posts. In December 1992, for example, State reported that congressional scrutiny, special interests, ethnic groups, and other domestic U.S. political constituencies often emerge to oppose the closing of posts. In its 1992 post closing exercise, State originally proposed closing 20 posts in fiscal years 1993 and 1994. After consultation with congressional members on these closures, State announced that 19 of the 20 would close and then later reduced that number to 17.", "In July 1995, in its latest attempt to close posts, State notified the Congress that it intended to close 19 posts. It later withdrew six of the posts from the list due to external pressures. For example, as a result of pressure from a member of Congress and the Drug Enforcement Agency, State removed the consulate in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, from the list. Some of the other five withdrawn posts\u2014in Apia, Western Samoa; Edinburgh, Scotland; Florence, Italy; and Hermosillo and Matamoros, Mexico\u2014have repeatedly appeared on lists of proposed closures. State had expected to reduce its costs by about $12 million a year beginning in fiscal year 1997, the year following the 19 closures.

The prospect of further reductions in overseas staffing means that an effective system for allocating overseas staff based on agency goals and objectives is essential.", "In December 1992, State reported that there had long been concerns that the overseas staffing process was not directly linked with the goals and objectives at specific posts. In 1993, among a number of other organizational changes, the Secretary approved a plan to restructure the overseas diplomatic presence. As part of this effort, State was to implement a new overseas staffing model, under development since 1990, to provide a rational basis for allocating personnel to overseas posts. However, as of January 1996, State had still not implemented the model. In commenting on a draft of this report, State noted that its Overseas Staffing Board met in June 1996 to begin implementation of a model to rationalize overseas staffing.", "State\u2019s costs would be much less if State made large-scale reductions in overseas staffing. For example, the cost reductions from eliminating only 10 positions from overseas posts could total at least $1.5 million. State\u2019s Office of Budget and Planning estimates the cost of positions overseas from two different perspectives: (1) the costs of adding a new American position and associated start-up expenses and (2) cost reductions from eliminating a position. To estimate the costs of adding a new U.S. direct-hire position to an existing overseas post, the Office uses a figure of $214,400 for the first full year\u2014an amount that includes the average salary, compensatory and incentive allowances and benefits, and other operating expenses. The Office uses a figure of $156,500 to estimate cost reductions from cutting a U.S. direct-hire position overseas. This amount is $57,900 less than the costs of adding a position because it does not include certain operating costs, such as security, which may not decrease when a position is cut. These figures vary by region and by post. For example, the cost reductions from eliminating half of the 67 U.S. direct-hire employees in India and half of the 100 in France could amount to about $5.2 million and $7.8 million, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Option for Controlling Post Costs", "paragraphs": ["Chiefs of mission (generally ambassadors) currently control only a small portion of the total resources devoted to their posts\u2019 operations; headquarters offices control the larger share.

For example, some embassy managers told us that they were reluctant to hire FSNs or spouses to serve as secretaries because their salaries and benefits would come from the posts\u2019 budgets. On the other hand, the salaries and benefits of U.S. direct-hire secretaries, which are substantially more, are paid by headquarters offices.", "Posts have tried to cut costs that are within their control, but cost reductions have been small.

Similarly, in Malaysia, the post\u2019s air conditioning is turned off at 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and all day on Saturday\u2014a measure estimated to reduce costs between $35,000 and $40,000 a year. The post in The Hague is considering requiring staff to bring their own furniture overseas, initially reducing the post\u2019s costs by an estimated $10,000 a year, with further cost reductions over time. The post now pays to operate a furniture warehouse, but the cost of shipping household goods overseas is paid by headquarters.", "According to some embassy managers, regulations and long-standing State practices leave little room for innovative approaches to cutting costs. For example, the managers at one post said that current prohibitions governing lease/purchase arrangements do not allow for entrepreneurial approaches to obtaining U.S. government real property.", "State officials also argue that they lack sufficient authority over other agencies\u2019 resources at posts. A variety of laws, State Department directives, and presidential letters of instruction give chiefs of mission the authority over State\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 staffing decisions. Nevertheless, the National Performance Review noted that National Security Decision Directive-38 (NSDD-38), issued June 2, 1982, makes the authority of the chief of mission more theoretical than real in many cases. NSDD-38 allows other agencies to challenge a decision made by the chief of mission. According to State officials, headquarters management often does not support chiefs of mission in bureaucratic battles with agencies that resist their attempts to limit or reduce their staffs. Moreover, when a chief of mission successfully limits an agency\u2019s staff growth at one post, the agency sometimes manages to increase its presence in a nearby country instead. For example, although the Ambassador in Brazil negotiated with the Internal Revenue Service to close its office in Sao Paulo because he, along with Inter-American Affairs Bureau management, agreed that Internal Revenue Service operations could be effectively managed in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service opened a new office in Chile. Our prior work has shown that other agencies\u2019 staffs have increased steadily, while State\u2019s has decreased slightly.", "Even if chiefs of mission successfully exercise authority over staff levels, they do not have practical day-to-day control over their personnel and fiscal resources. According to the National Performance Review, because of the diffusion of responsibility, authority, and operational prerogatives among the various overseas agencies, chiefs of mission lack the flexibility to shift resources to respond to changing requirements or evolving foreign policy objectives. The Ambassador in Senegal managed to cut 14 positions in Dakar, 13 of which were from other agencies, with estimated overall cost reductions of about $3 million. He believes, nevertheless, that he could achieve greater cost reductions if he had day-to-day operational control over total U.S. government funding and resources at his post. A review of the post\u2019s mission and structure, led by the Ambassador, concluded that the explosion of different administrative, financial, and information systems among the various agencies overseas calls for consolidation of support functions, privatization, and other changes that can come about only with expanded chief of mission authority. For example, the agencies in Dakar have four different communication systems. Also, 7 independent financial operations and 38 staff positions are devoted to financial management functions there. The study indicated that there are similar redundancies elsewhere and that streamlining and cost reductions could be achieved in areas such as real estate and facilities management, security, and quality-of-life benefits. (Options for cost reductions in some of these areas are explored in more detail in ch. 5.)", "To strengthen the ability of chiefs of mission to achieve significant cost reductions, in September 1993 the National Performance Review recommended a pilot project giving U.S. ambassadors at selected posts more authority over all U.S. government resources at their posts, including staff. There may be some potential negative consequences to expanding ambassador authority. For example, a chief of mission and a federal agency may have differences of opinion concerning the types and levels of resources needed to sustain agency activities.", "State has not initiated action on this recommendation. State officials told us the Department cannot move on this recommendation until the National Performance Review/Vice President\u2019s staff propose the needed legislation to the Congress. However, National Performance Review staff told us that proposing legislation is the agency\u2019s responsibility. State does not want to initiate action because it believes the pilot program should be viewed as an administration initiative to gain the interagency support such a project would require. State has also told us that anticipated congressional opposition to such a project has inhibited their submission of a legislative proposal.", "Consistent with the recommendation, in November 1995, the U.S. Ambassador to Senegal submitted a study concluding that the chiefs of mission need more authority and control over U.S. government programs, personnel, and resources under their management.

State estimates that in terms of cost recovery alone, implementing ICASS would allow the Department to spend $108 million less per year for support to other agencies. Redistribution of costs currently covered under FAAS would reduce costs to State by $15 million, and billings for new cost items not currently covered under FAAS would reduce cost to State by an additional $93 million.

FSNs do not have access to the separate classified system.", "The Inspector General\u2019s procedures for periodic inspections could be modified to provide additional oversight of FSNs that handle U.S. funds. Also, the use of standard internal control procedures, such as the division of duties and mandatory vacations, could help to ensure that funds are managed responsibly.", "Nonetheless, we agree that certain Foreign Service specialist positions would not be appropriate for an FSN, given the classified or highly sensitive nature of the position. These positions include communications specialists, regional security officers, regional medical officers, foreign building operations officers, technical staff working with classified communications systems, and Foreign Service secretaries assigned to work with classified information.", "FSNs could replace the more costly existing staff as budget and fiscal officers, general services officers, information management specialists working with unclassified computer systems, personnel officers, regional medical technologists, and Foreign Service nurses. We estimate that State currently has about 500 Foreign Service specialists in these six job categories in its overseas posts. This figure does not include rotational positions in Washington.

Moreover, as we have reported, State also has millions of dollars in potentially excess real estate at closed posts that are not included in this amount and could be sold. The Inspector General, individual embassies, and State\u2019s Office of Foreign Building Operations have also identified some of these excess properties. However, because of internal and external pressures, State has been slow in disposing of these properties. Selling these properties would not only generate revenues but could also significantly reduce maintenance costs.", "In our most recent report, we recommended improvements in the State Department\u2019s procedures to identify and sell excess real estate.

Examples of such efforts include State\u2019s attempts to reengineer the Foreign Service transfer process, major personnel management reforms in such areas as pay broadbanding for FSNs, and an ongoing reengineering of the logistics function. Under State\u2019s Strategic Management Initiative, the Department attempted to gauge the advisability of outsourcing a limited number of support functions.

Information management resource problems have made it difficult to effectively reengineer processes. For example, State selected the Foreign Service\u2019s transfer process as a reengineering test case because the process had 117 steps, 23 forms, and a number of dispersed operations. Over 2 months, steps in the process were charted and brainstormed, and best practices in the private and public sectors were reviewed. The final report recommended a streamlined system that would enhance customer satisfaction and reduce costs. The team concluded that by improving computer interconnectivity and empowering employees, the number of full-time employees involved in the transfer process could be reduced from 24 to perhaps 4 to 5 permanent positions, supplemented by private contractor assistance. However, a year after completing the work, two team members told us that none of these positions had been eliminated because State does not have the information management tools to make the system work as designed.", "In a December 1994 report, we compared several private and public leading organizations\u2019 best practices in applying information technology to improve performance to State\u2019s practices and found that the Department was deficient in several areas.

In May 1995, the Under Secretary for Management established an acting chief information officer position. In May 1996, State appointed a permanent chief information officer to comply with the mandate of the 1996 Information Technology Reform Act.

An official from the Diplomatic Telecommunications Service Program Office told us that the office was never formally tasked with conducting this study and thus did not respond to the recommendation. The Office of Medical Services also did not prepare an outsourcing study, although an official from that office said a study will soon be initiated. Outsourcing studies of State\u2019s payroll operations and vendor and pension payments processes were contracted to an outside consulting firm.
