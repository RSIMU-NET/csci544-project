Officials from VA medical centers manage more than 260 VJO Program specialists who identify veterans in jails and local courts, assess their health and social needs, and link them to supports and services. VJO specialists monitor veterans' services and treatment in courts dedicated to veteran offenders. According to VA data, the number of veterans served by the program increased 72 percent from fiscal years 2012 - 2015. In addition, many veterans involved in the program were Post-9/11 veterans; about two-thirds were diagnosed with one or more mental health problems.", "VA has taken some steps to incorporate a performance assessment system into the VJO Program, one component of effective program management (see figure). Specifically, VA developed strategic goals and plans to conduct evaluations. However, VA has not established performance goals with related targets, timeframes, and performance measures for any of the program's five broad strategic goals. VA officials told GAO they have not taken this step, in part, because VA medical centers have flexibility in determining the activities of VJO specialists. GAO's past work has highlighted strategies that agencies can use in this situation, such as developing measures based on common activities. Best practices call for agencies to establish performance goals and associated performance measures. Until VA incorporates performance goals and measures, it will lack a systematic way to obtain ongoing information to identify possible underperforming areas for improvements.", "VA identified several key challenges\u2014most of which were related to the demand for services outpacing the program's resources\u2014but has not fully developed appropriate mitigation strategies. One key challenge, for example, is addressing increased program demand as jail administrators more widely use VA's online system that better identifies incarcerated veterans. In addition, a major reason for the demand-resource imbalance is the heavier workload of VJO specialists serving veterans in an expanding number of courts dedicated to veterans, according to VA officials and stakeholders that GAO interviewed. However, GAO found that VA did not comprehensively identify and assess risks posed by each of the key challenges it identified, contrary to federal internal control standards. Absent a comprehensive risk assessment, VA is not well-positioned to develop appropriate strategies to mitigate the greatest risks, which may limit its ability to help justice-involved veterans receive assistance and avoid re-incarceration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve program management, VA should establish performance goals and measures and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment.

For some veterans, these  issues may go unaddressed and may lead them to commit crimes and  other offenses. To help veterans who become involved with their local  criminal justice systems (referred to as \u201cjustice-involved veterans\u201d), the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Veterans Justice  Outreach (VJO) Program in 2009. The VJO Program is designed to  connect veterans to supports and services to reduce and prevent re- incarceration and homelessness. The program relies on VJO specialists  across the United States to forge and maintain relationships with jails and  municipal courts at the local level (i.e., local criminal justice systems).", "Given the importance of helping veterans readjust to civilian life, you  asked us to examine the management of the VJO Program. This report  provides information on the following questions:  1.  How does the Veterans Justice Outreach Program deliver services,  and what are the number and characteristics of veterans served by  the program?  2.  To what extent has VA used performance assessment to help  manage the Veterans Justice Outreach Program?  3.

We  did not independently verify the actions described in such documents. We  obtained data about the number and characteristics of veterans served by  the VJO Program from VA for fiscal years 2012 through 2015 (the most  recent data available). We determined that VA\u2019s compilation of data about  veterans served by the VJO Program were sufficiently reliable to include  in our report. Specifically, we obtained and assessed official  documentation such as user guides, frequently asked questions, and  disclaimers; and we discussed our planned use of the data and any  limitations with VA officials. To assess the degree to which VA uses  program performance assessment\u2014setting program goals, using  performance measures, and evaluating programs\u2014to manage the VJO  Program, we compared VA\u2019s use of performance assessment against  best practices for assessing program performance and federal standards  for internal control. We compared VA\u2019s efforts to identify challenges and  respective mitigation strategies with criteria established in the federal  standards for internal control.

According to VA, military experience (particularly combat) has  been an underlying factor in behavior that prompts a response from law  enforcement, such as domestic conflicts. During the last 14 years of U.S.  military operations, many servicemembers have experienced numerous  deployments, which can increase the risk of developing post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury. According to VA, a  strong relationship exists between PTSD and substance abuse.  Research has demonstrated that justice-involved veterans have high  rates of mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness, and other health  issues. At the same time, some veterans may be unwilling or unable to  access the supports and services they need. For example, we have  previously reported that some veterans do not seek mental health  treatment due to concerns about negative career outcomes, lack of  understanding or awareness of treatment, and logistical challenges to  accessing care.

This information is useful for some  aspects of program management. For example, VA central office officials  told us that supervisors need information about the clinical and  administrative workloads of VJO specialists to assess the need for  additional staff and to monitor productivity. However, VA does not have a  way to use the information it currently collects to compare actual program  performance against expected results, or to analyze significant  differences, contrary to federal standards for internal control. We have  previously reported that performance measurement gives managers  crucial information to identify gaps in program performance and plan any  needed improvements. The information that VA currently collects does  not allow VA to fully answer key questions, such as the reasons for  observed performance, what are effective approaches to program  implementation, and how to improve program performance.", "VA central office officials cited the need to be responsive to local  conditions as the main reason why they have not set or used  performance goals and measures for the VJO Program. Specifically, the  areas served by each VA medical center have their own unique  circumstances, they said, such as having or not having a veterans  treatment court, being located in an urban or rural area, or being located  in an area with a large or small population of veterans. Due to these  unique local conditions, the officials stated, the program needs to be  flexible. VA medical centers have discretion in determining the activities  of VJO specialists. VA central office officials added that a broad measure,  such as the number of veterans served by each VJO specialist per  month, would not be appropriate because it could be misleading to  compare VJO specialists since their work circumstances vary. For  example, officials said that given VJO specialists work in different criminal  justice systems, it would not be reasonable to set a national goal for the  number of veterans they reach out to each month. While some VJO  specialists conduct outreach to a large number of veterans in jails, others  may focus their attention on a smaller number of veterans in veterans  treatment courts. Similarly, they pointed out that while some VJO  specialists in VA medical centers in large urban areas may be able to  serve a large number of veterans, others in rural areas may need to drive  several hours to see a veteran and can only see a few in any given day.", "We recognize that measuring progress toward goals within the VJO  Program\u2019s decentralized service delivery model poses challenges in  designing performance goals and measures. Our past work has also  acknowledged the challenges in developing national performance  measures when flexible programs vary in their activities so as to meet  local needs. Nonetheless, we have found one approach agencies used to  successfully overcome this challenge was to develop common national  measures. For example, our past work found that to assess the  performance of the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program\u2014a  program that assists low-income families in acquiring skills to improve  their family diet\u2014the U.S. Department of Agriculture assessed local  offices on common activities used by all offices. Another approach used  by agencies with flexible programs was to encourage local projects to  evaluate progress toward their own performance goals. For example, the  National Tobacco Control Program\u2014a program operated by the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014has four goals connected to its  mission to reduce tobacco-related diseases and death, including reducing  youth\u2019s tobacco use. To accomplish its goals, the agency allows states to  direct their own activities. The agency provided states with guidance  about identifying short term, intermediate, and long term outcomes, and  encouraged states to assess their own individual efforts.", "VA central office officials we interviewed also said that they have not  established performance goals or measures because some of the  outcomes that veterans experience are influenced by factors outside the  program\u2019s control. For example, VJO Program-related outcomes\u2014such  as mental health recovery or criminal recidivism\u2014can often depend on  factors such as whether a community has a veterans treatment court or if  a veteran is willing to adhere to his treatment plan, according to VA  central office officials.", "We have highlighted strategies in our past work that agencies can use  when faced with the challenge of having limited control over external  factors that can affect a program\u2019s outcomes. These strategies include:  selecting a mix of outcome goals over which the agency has varying  levels of control; using data on external factors to statistically adjust for  their effect on the desired outcome; and disaggregating goals for distinct  target populations for which the agency has different expectations. For  example, our past work found that to measure progress toward its  strategic goal to eliminate transportation related deaths, injuries, and  property damage, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  measured an intermediate outcome\u2014the rate of front-seat safety belt  use\u2014and an end outcome\u2014the rate of transportation related injuries. The  agency also statistically adjusted the results of its performance measures  by using the ratio of fatalities per vehicle mile driven to control for the  simple fact that if more miles are driven, then more crashes are likely to  result. Our past work also found that the Natural Resources Conservation  Service created separate performance goals for each type of habitat (e.g.,  croplands, watersheds, wetlands, and grazing lands) so it could measure  progress toward its strategic goal of maintaining healthy and productive  land. Additionally, to help interpret the results of performance measures,  we have also emphasized in our past work the importance of  communicating adequate contextual information, such as factors inside or  outside the agency\u2019s control that might affect performance.", "VA central office officials said they plan to update the VJO Program\u2019s  strategic plan, which contains the program\u2019s broad strategic goals, by the  end of fiscal year 2016, but they do not intend to include performance  measures. Leading practices demonstrate that developing ways to  measure VJO Program efforts could help VJO specialists, VA central  office officials, and Congress measure and monitor the extent to which  program efforts are achieving their intended results, make needed  improvements, and make funding decisions. Further, a fundamental  element in an organization\u2019s efforts to manage for results is its ability to  set performance goals with specific targets and time frames that reflect  strategic goals and to measure progress toward them as part of its  strategic-planning efforts. Our previous work has highlighted  characteristics of successful performance measures that could be  helpful. Without a robust performance assessment system\u2014which  includes both performance measures and evaluations\u2014officials  managing the VJO Program lack a full picture of its success and of  potentially underperforming areas for improvements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Identified Capacity Challenges but Has Not Comprehensively Assessed Related Risks or Developed Mitigation Strategies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Identified Key Challenges Related to Justice-involved Veterans\u2019 Demand for Services Outpacing VJO Program Resources", "paragraphs": ["VA identified several key challenges related to the demand for services  outpacing the VJO Program\u2019s resources, which could limit the program\u2019s  capacity to serve all justice-involved veterans. These demand-resource  imbalances were identified through VA\u2019s strategic planning process and in  consultation with VJO specialists and VISN officials. In developing its list  of five challenges, which it reported out in 2012, VA assumed that  demands on the VJO Program would continue to increase. Specifically,  two of the five challenges VA identified relate to demand for services: (1)  demand may increase due to greater use of VA\u2019s Veterans Re-entry  Search Service system and result in the program not being able to  properly serve all eligible veterans; and, (2) demand from homeless  veterans may increase if economic conditions worsen. The remaining  three challenges VA identified relate to resources; (3) the program may  not be able to link veterans to treatment due to shortages in VA clinical  programs; (4) the program lacks direct control over information  technology on which it is highly dependent; and, (5) the program may  face funding cuts.", "The range of stakeholders we interviewed\u2014VISN officials, VJO  specialists, justice-involved veterans, and local criminal justice system  officials\u2014affirmed many of the challenges identified in the VJO Program  strategic plan. In general, many stakeholders said that demand for VJO  specialist assistance is outpacing the program\u2019s ability to serve all  potentially eligible veterans, and the gap may worsen over time. For  example, VJO specialists and VISN officials we spoke with in five of the  nine areas we selected for interviews told us workload challenges have  intensified in recent years.", "In addition to the high demand for the program cited by program  stakeholders, the increase in veterans treatment courts is further  increasing demand for program services, according to stakeholders and  VA internal documents. In particular:", "The number of veterans treatment courts is growing. While these  courts can help improve veterans\u2019 mental health and sobriety, the  increase in the number of these courts is a major reason for the VJO  Program\u2019s workload challenges, according to VJO specialists, VISN  officials, VA central office officials, and justice system partners we  interviewed. According to these stakeholders, VJO specialists had  already been working in many local jails and traditional courts across  the country, and the expansion of veterans treatment courts added to  their existing workload. Specifically, the number of veterans treatment  courts nationwide grew from 65 in fiscal year 2010 to 360 in fiscal  year 2015, according to VA data. Moreover, hundreds of additional  veterans treatment courts are in the planning stages, according to an  organization that advocates on behalf of veterans treatment courts.  During fiscal years 2012 through 2015, justice-involved veterans  served by the VJO Program and who participated in veterans  treatment courts increased from about 1,900 to about 3,900.", "Working with veterans in veterans treatment courts is more time  consuming than working with veterans in jails. According to VA  central office officials, working with individual veterans participating in  veterans treatment courts typically requires more of VJO specialists\u2019  time than working with veterans in jail. VJO specialists we interviewed  in seven of our nine selected areas also said working with veterans  treatment courts is more time consuming than working in jails. For  example, VJO specialists meet regularly with veterans and their  treatment providers and apprise other members of the court team of a  veteran\u2019s adherence to court-ordered treatment. A veteran in a  veterans treatment court generally participates in the VJO Program for  12 to 24 months. In contrast, VJO specialists we interviewed in seven  of the nine areas said they generally work with veterans in jails for  much shorter durations.", "According to VA central office officials, VA attempts to ease workload  demands by hiring additional VJO specialists, as funds allow, but this has  not fully addressed demand for program services. VA increased staffing  for the VJO Program from 43 specialists in fiscal year 2010 to 261 in  fiscal year 2015, according to VA data. VA central office officials said they  have used an annual hiring process to allocate new VJO specialist  positions. Through this process they added 13 VJO specialists in 13  locations in fiscal year 2015. VA central office officials said that the  process for hiring additional VJO specialists consists of collecting  information from VA medical centers about the current clinical and  administrative activities of VJO specialists, and about any imminent  workload demands, including those attributable to a new veterans  treatment court, to determine which VA medical centers receive additional  specialist positions. In fiscal year 2015, 54 of the 167 VA medical centers  requested 1 or more of the 13 new VJO specialist positions. However, VA  central office officials, VJO specialists, and VISN officials acknowledged  that despite additional positions, VJO specialists are at capacity and are  not able to fully address the demand for VJO Program services.", "VA central office officials also told us that they try to address the  challenge of limited existing workload capacity by advising VJO  specialists and VA medical center officials to avoid overcommitting  program resources. For example, VA central office officials told us they  advised VJO specialists that they should consider their existing workload  and commitments before deciding to work with new veterans treatment  courts or visit additional jails. Some VJO specialists we spoke with chose  to focus on serving veterans in jails while others decided that serving  those in veterans treatment courts was more effective. For example, VJO  specialists and two criminal justice system officials in one area expressed  concerns about the workload and resources associated with serving  veterans treatment courts. In their view, a more cost-effective approach is  to focus the program\u2019s efforts on providing case management to justice- involved veterans on probation. However, VA central office officials  acknowledge that without VA involvement, these courts likely would not  function and proliferate. VJO specialists in five areas with veterans  treatment courts told us they decided to prioritize working with veterans in  treatment courts over incarcerated veterans given their workloads and  because veterans participating in these courts are mandated to seek  treatment. Specifically, veterans in these courts are generally held  accountable for remaining in treatment for longer periods of time than  those released from jails, which tends to produce more stable behavioral  changes, according to these VJO specialists. A consequence, however, is  that the specialists may see fewer veterans in veterans treatment courts  or have less time to spend serving those in jails and other criminal justice  settings, according to these VJO specialists we interviewed. In addition,  almost every justice-involved veteran (13 of 14) we interviewed said that  although they have benefitted from the program, VJO specialists do not  frequent the jails enough to fully meet veterans\u2019 needs.", "VA central office officials we interviewed also said they recognize that  demand for the VJO Program could increase beyond existing capacity if  its Veterans Re-entry Search Service becomes more widely used by jail  administrators. VA developed the Veterans Re-entry Search Service in  2013 to meet a key strategic goal to identify justice-involved veterans  more effectively. This online system improves the jails\u2019 identification  process compared with the self-identifying process currently used by  most jail administrators. According to VA central office officials, jail  administrators who are using the self-identification process are reporting  a much smaller percentage of veterans. For example, an administrator in  one local jail reported that 23 inmates self-identified as veterans, but the  Veterans Re-entry Search Service revealed that there were 64  incarcerated veterans in the jail during the same time-period. In another  jail system, the administrator reported that 220 inmates self-identified as  veterans, but the online search revealed there were 400 incarcerated  veterans.", "VA central office officials we interviewed recognize the risk the Veterans  Re-entry Search Service poses to existing capacity. VA central office  officials told us they plan to promote the new system to jail officials in  small phases because they recognize that this system may overtax  existing program capacity. VA central office officials told us that they  decided to initially promote VA\u2019s new system to 180 of the largest jails  rather than roll it out to jail systems (over 3,000 in the United States) so  as to avoid overwhelming VJO specialists with an unmanageable influx of  new veterans. Once VA completes its outreach to these larger jail  systems, it plans to promote the service to other jail systems, and VA  central office officials expect about 1,000 jails to eventually use the  service.", "In addition to challenges related to capacity, VJO specialists and VISN  officials in several of our selected areas told us that shortages in clinical  programs\u2014especially residential drug treatment programs\u2014can be a  challenge because it limits treatment options for veterans. They also  reported challenges associated with shortages in public housing and  public transportation, the latter of which can impede veterans\u2019 ability to  readily attend court and medical appointments for treatment. These  capacity challenges include:", "Limited capacity in residential substance abuse programs. VJO  specialists and VISN officials in several of our selected areas reported  that the high demand for residential substance abuse treatment\u2014 which provide appropriate housing to facilitate sobriety\u2014limits the  extent to which these programs are a viable option for justice-involved  veterans. When openings are unavailable, VJO specialists said they  refer veterans to the next best available treatment option. However,  officials from one of the veterans treatment courts we interviewed said  the next best available treatment option may not always fully meet a  veteran\u2019s treatment needs. For example, officials we interviewed at  one veterans treatment court said that a veteran in the program has a  heroin addiction and has tested positive for drug use. Thus, they  would expect this veteran to be in a residential substance abuse  treatment program, which provides greater monitoring. In this case,  however, VA has recommended out-patient substance abuse  treatment due to limited availability of residential slots.", "Limited housing options for sex offenders. VJO specialists and  VISN officials in several of our selected areas also reported that  housing options available for individuals who are required to register  as sex offenders are limited. VA central office officials said that they  are aware of this issue, which cuts across many of VA\u2019s homeless  programs.", "Limited public transportation options. VJO specialists and VISN  officials in several of our selected areas also reported that many  justice-involved veterans\u2014some of whom have lost their driving  licenses due to their offenses\u2014rely on public transportation to take  them to court and VA- or community-provided treatment. VJO  specialists told us that the public transportation can be slow, limited,  or nonexistent. For example, VJO specialists in one area we visited  said it can take a full day for a veteran to travel to and from treatment.  VJO specialists in another rural location said they have tried to  address this challenge by hiring veterans who have received VJO  Program assistance to help drive other veterans to their medical  appointments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Not Comprehensively Assessed Program Risks, which Would Allow It to Develop Strategies to Mitigate Their Effects", "paragraphs": ["VA has not performed a comprehensive assessment of risks posed by the  challenges the VJO Program faces, which is inconsistent with federal  standards for internal control and one component of effective program  management. These standards call for agencies to both identify all  relevant risks and analyze risks that may prevent them from achieving  their goals. Further, this assessment should include an estimation of a  risk\u2019s significance, an examination of the likelihood of any risk\u2019s  occurrence, and a decision as to what actions should be taken to manage  the risk. Risk assessment is important because it also informs an entity\u2019s  policies, planning, and priorities. Without understanding risks, an agency  may not be able to set appropriate policies, plans, and priorities because  it would not be able to account for events that can adversely affect its  ability to implement its objectives.", "In 2014, VHA leadership requested that each homelessness prevention  program, including the VJO Program, identify risks that may affect  veterans\u2019 access to VA supports and services and identify possible  actions that could be taken to mitigate those risks. To identify risks, VJO  Program central office officials examined their broad strategic goals. In an  October 2014 assessment report, VJO Program officials identified six  risks. Identified risks included, for example, lack of an automated  interface between the Veterans Re-entry Search Service and correctional  facilities\u2019 information technology systems to identify incarcerated  veterans; reassignment of VJO specialists to other programs by VA  medical centers; and prioritizing clinical services for veterans already  receiving treatment over new justice-involved veterans by VA medical  centers, thus limiting timely access to appropriate services.", "VA central office officials, as part of this 2014 effort, also estimated the  significance and likelihood of the risks, consistent with federal standards  for internal control. For example, regarding the significance if VA medical  centers were to de-prioritize outreach to veterans, VA found that the  program\u2019s relationship with its criminal justice system partners could be  weakened and justice-involved veterans may suffer. In addition, the  assessment indicated actions VA would take to address each of the six  identified risks, such as collecting additional information to monitor  identified risks.", "VA did not, however, identify or analyze the risks posed by each one of  the challenges identified in its strategic plan. Notably absent were the  workload challenges facing the VJO Program. VA central office officials  we interviewed acknowledged that the challenges identified in the  strategic plan still exist and could affect the operations of the program. VA  expects the VJO Program\u2019s workloads to increase and its funding and  workforce to remain level, raising questions about how VA can best  deploy its resources and align its policies to best meet increasing  demand. Not identifying all relevant risks limits VA\u2019s ability to effectively  compare and prioritize risks faced by the program.", "In addition, VA\u2019s lack of performance goals, as previously discussed,  negatively affects its ability to effectively identify and assess risk. As  demonstrated in our previous work, federal standards for internal control  state that a precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of clear  performance goals (see fig. 7). Translating its broad strategic goals into  measurable performance goals would allow VA to target the risks that  may impede achievement of the program\u2019s objectives.", "VA plans to conduct another risk assessment as part of its upcoming  strategic planning efforts, using the same methodology it used in its risk  assessment in 2014. As VA completes future assessments, it is important  that the agency incorporates all of the elements of risk assessment  detailed in federal standards for internal control, including identifying all  relevant risks posed to achieving performance goals.

If VA intervention is  timely and targeted, then these justice-involved veterans and their  families have a better chance to avoid a detrimental future. A relatively  new VA program, the VJO Program is designed to help justice-involved  veterans\u2014who often have high rates of mental illness, substance abuse,  and other issues that may stem from their military service\u2014avoid re- incarceration and homelessness. In designing the program, VA intended  for support to respond to local conditions. While this flexibility can help the  program cater to veterans\u2019 needs in local communities, VA lacks a  complete national perspective necessary to strategically manage the  program. We are encouraged that VA has taken some initial steps toward  assessing program performance and risks. However, as VA moves  forward, it is especially important that the agency fully incorporate key  practices for assessing performance and risks to strategically guide  program decisions. Incorporating these key practices will allow VA to  compare the program\u2019s actual performance against expected results and  comprehensively assess risks to develop appropriate mitigation  strategies. More specifically, without developing a national perspective  that comprehensively considers program performance and the greatest  risks to the program\u2019s goals, VA cannot fully target its resources toward  efforts that achieve the intended results. As a result, justice-involved  veterans may not receive the proper supports and services needed to re- establish healthy lives and avoid re-incarceration.
