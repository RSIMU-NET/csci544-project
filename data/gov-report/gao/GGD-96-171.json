In 1993, NASD expanded the types of information provided, partly in response to a recommendation in our 1993 report on penny stock regulation. The NASD Regulation Public Disclosure Program now is to provide callers with information on pending and final disciplinary actions taken by SROs or federal and state securities regulators that relate to securities or commodities transactions, including censures and fines, bars, revocations, expulsions, suspensions, orders of permanent injunction, orders of preliminary injunction, orders of prohibition, some special stipulation orders, cease and desist orders, and denial of registration orders; pending NASD Regulation and other SRO complaints and dismissed NASD securities arbitration decisions involving public customers and their brokers and Commodity Futures Trading Commission reparation orders; securities-related civil judgments; and criminal convictions and indictments.", "The information disclosed by the program is derived from the Central Registration Depository (CRD). CRD is a database, which NASD Regulation maintains, that contains employment and disciplinary histories of individual brokers as well as disciplinary actions taken against member broker-dealer firms. NASD and state securities regulators established CRD as a centralized licensing and registration system. Brokers are required to report to CRD formal disciplinary actions taken against them by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), state securities regulators, SROs, or courts, including foreign entities, for violations related to the securities business and certain customer complaint and arbitration information. In addition to providing information on formal disciplinary actions, brokers are required to provide CRD with written notice of employment terminations. All required CRD information is to be reported within 30 days of the action\u2019s occurrence. Federal and state securities regulators and SROs also are to report disciplinary information to CRD and can use CRD information to determine whether a broker has violated securities laws or SRO rules.

NASD does not charge a fee when individuals request information to assist them in their personal investments. Business requests for information, such as those from attorneys or banks, must include a processing fee of $30. The hotline currently operates from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (eastern time). NASD Regulation officials said that they are considering extending the hotline\u2019s hours to 8:00 p.m. (eastern time) to better accommodate west coast callers.", "As of January 1996, one and one-half full-time equivalent staff are dedicated to answer hotline calls. However, if call volume necessitates, 12 operators who normally answer calls to NASD\u2019s general number are also available to answer hotline calls. In addition to the staff who answer calls, NASD Regulation\u2019s Public Disclosure Program also employs specialist staff to research disciplinary files and determine whether the information is either disclosable or nondisclosable. The specialists are to respond to written requests for information, which the public makes by using a NIRF. They also are to prepare written summaries of the disclosable information that is included in a computerized system called the NIRF database. As a result, the NIRF database contains disciplinary histories from CRD records that the specialists have reviewed and determined to be disclosable. As of January 1996, NASD Regulation officials said that they had two full-time specialists.", "When a call is made to the hotline, NASD Regulation staff are to ask the caller for information to identify the subject of the inquiry such as name, address, or registration number. If the staff cannot identify the subject, they are to tell the caller and terminate the call. When the staff identify the subject, an automated search of the NIRF database determines if disclosable information exists. The staff are to send any disclosable information to the caller upon request. When the subject is identified in the NIRF database, but no disclosable information exists, the staff are to tell the caller and terminate the call. In addition, if the caller requests, staff are to send a letter stating that no disclosable information exists.", "If the subject is not identified in the NIRF database, an automated search of CRD determines if a record exists on the subject. When a record exists, the staff are to tell the caller that the file has to be reviewed to determine if disclosable information exists. The specialist staff are to review the file on the subject broker to determine whether the information in the file is disclosable, create a NIRF database file on the subject, and send a copy of any disclosable information to the caller.

From this sample, we randomly selected a subsample of 100 callers for further review to determine whether the information NASD Regulation provided met its disclosure policies. We also surveyed securities regulators of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to determine what information those regulators disclosed to the public and how they informed the public of the existence of their disclosure programs.

In 1994, we recommended that SEC and NASD develop procedures to balance regulatory surveillance and public disclosure interests pertaining to disclosure of customer complaint information to regulators and investors. At that time, those organizations commented that release of unsubstantiated customer complaint information would raise due process and privacy concerns. NASD Regulation officials added later that release of the complaint information could damage a broker\u2019s reputation and result in lawsuits. NASD can be subject to lawsuits from hotline activities although it has limited protection from liability if a \u201cgood faith\u201d error is made in a disclosure.

In an October 1995 public address, the Chairman, SEC, suggested that consideration be given to making unadjudicated customer complaints public for a limited time, for example, 2 years; after which complaints that were either not pursued by regulators or deemed without merit would be removed from the reporting system.", "After our fieldwork was completed, NASAA, the states, NASD Regulation, and securities industry representatives agreed to changes in the reporting of disciplinary information to CRD which could lead to disclosure of additional disciplinary information by the NASD Regulation hotline. To lessen brokers\u2019 concerns about disclosing information that may involve unfounded allegations of wrongdoing, the changes would place limits on brokers\u2019 reporting of customer complaints and arbitration and civil case settlements. Brokers would be required to report to CRD information on (1) customer complaints less than 2 years old that allege damages of $5,000 or more and (2) arbitrations and civil suits settled for $10,000 or more.

Making more investors knowledgeable about the hotline could allow them to have better information on hand to assist them in making important investment-related decisions and also reduce the likelihood that they will become victims of unscrupulous brokers. This possibly could be done at relatively low cost by adding hotline information to already required, account-opening documents or to account statements.

Text was modified to include the percentage range of those who responded very satisfied. 3. Text was added to note the 1988 establishment of the NASD Public Disclosure Program. 4. Caption and text were modified to state that the methods used to publicize the hotline may not reach all investors. 5. NASD noted variations on the handling of formal complaints and customer complaints and suggested that were clarify what is meant by dismissed customer complaints. To eliminate the confusion about the definition of dismissed customer complaints, we have changed the example to pending customer complaints. 6. Text was revised to include NASD\u2019s recommended language regarding the absence of a systematic means in the current CRD to monitor the timeliness of filings. 7. NASD recommended that we distinguish firms from individuals throughout the report rather than use the term \u201cbroker\u201d as explained in a footnote on page 1. We have carefully reviewed every instance in which we use the term \u201cbroker\u201d to refer to both broker-dealers and their individual associated persons.
