In completing its work, GAO analyzed agency documentation and prior reports on collaboration, conducted site visits at locations where SBA and Rural Development were working together, and interviewed agency and selected economic development officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The complementary nature of some SBA loan programs and Rural Development business programs provides a rationale for the agencies to collaborate. SBA and Rural Development have similar economic development missions, and their programs provide financing for similar purposes, including start-up and expansion projects, equipment purchases, and working capital for small businesses. According to SBA and Rural Development officials currently involved in collaborative working relationships, working together allows the agencies to leverage the unique strengths of each other's programs, increase the number of financing options available to borrowers in rural areas, and ultimately better promote economic development in these areas. However, collaboration between SBA and Rural Development to date has been sporadic and mostly self-initiated by officials in field offices. GAO found that the extent of the collaborative efforts and use of formal agreements such as memorandums of understanding (MOU) varied across locations. The two agencies worked together frequently in a few locations, infrequently in others, and not at all in many locations. The SBA and Rural Development offices in North Dakota that GAO visited collaborated frequently and had formal agreements in place. Officials there established an MOU with other community development organizations to provide \"one-stop\" shopping assistance to borrowers at a single location. The SBA and Rural Development offices in Nebraska and New Mexico that GAO visited worked with each other less frequently and more informally, conducting community outreach sessions and holding periodic meetings and joint training sessions. But many other locations--about half of SBA and Rural Development's field offices--did not appear to be collaborating at all or to have an established framework to facilitate collaboration. Opportunities exist for SBA and Rural Development to improve their collaborative efforts. In an October 2005 report, GAO identified key practices that could help federal agencies enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts. In comparing SBA and Rural Development's efforts with these criteria, GAO found that the agencies could take steps to improve their efforts by implementing a more formal approach to encourage collaboration. This approach would provide the agencies with a mechanism that reflected several of GAO's key practices--to define and articulate a common outcome, agree on roles and responsibilities, monitor key progress and results, and reinforce accountability for collaborative efforts. With such an approach, SBA and Rural Development could more effectively leverage each other's unique strengths and help to improve small business opportunities in rural communities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 80 programs administered by several different federal agencies  target rural economic development. Of these agencies, the Small Business  Administration (SBA) and the Rural Development offices of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) share a mission of attending to  underserved markets, fostering economic development, and improving the  quality of life in America through the promotion of entrepreneurship and  community development. Both agencies offer business loans and grant  programs for rural development and play vital roles in spurring economic  growth in rural areas. In the past, these agencies have developed  collaborative working relationships to help manage their loan and grant  programs. They have also entered into a joint agreement under the Rural  Business Investment Program (RBIP) to create investment companies that  would provide equity for rural small businesses.", "Congress has long expressed interest in increasing collaboration among  federal agencies. Collaboration that cuts across more than one federal  agency is one way for the federal government to deliver results more  efficiently\u2014that is, in a way that utilizes limited resources to better  address multiple demands. Congress has been enacting laws for more than  a decade mandating that federal agencies coordinate their rural policies  and programs. These laws have authorized the establishment of  interagency agreements, cooperative agreements, and interagency working  groups for specific collaborative purposes. For example, a provision of the  Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 required the  Secretary of Agriculture to establish and chair a rural development  interagency working group to establish rural policy, coordinate assistance,  and evaluate the performance of federal rural assistance programs.  Additionally, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 formally  established the National Rural Development Partnership so that USDA,  other federal agencies including SBA, state and local entities, and  businesses could better collaborate in delivering services to rural  communities.", "Increasingly, Congress has also focused attention on businesses and  entrepreneurs in rural areas and small communities with underserved  financial needs that could benefit from joint efforts between SBA and  Rural Development offices. In an effort to ensure that SBA and Rural  Development programs provide maximum benefit to rural communities,  on November 14, 2007, the House Small Business Subcommittee on Rural  and Urban Entrepreneurship held a hearing on interagency collaboration  and on SBA\u2019s and Rural Development\u2019s ability to work together to better  serve small businesses in rural areas. We testified at that hearing and  provided preliminary views on collaborative efforts between these  agencies. We also were requested to review the agencies\u2019 programs to  determine whether coordination among them could be improved.", "As agreed, this report examines SBA and Rural Development\u2019s efforts to  work collaboratively and the degree to which their efforts could be  improved. Specifically, the report discusses (1) the complementary nature  of some SBA and Rural Development loan and business programs and the  extent to which it provides a rationale for collaboration, (2) past and  current efforts at collaboration between SBA and Rural Development and  between SBA and Rural Development and other agencies, and (3)  opportunities to facilitate more effective collaboration between SBA and  Rural Development.", "Although there is no commonly accepted definition for collaboration, in  this report we define collaboration as any joint activity that is intended to  produce more public value than can be produced when the agencies act  alone, including activities that others have previously defined as  cooperation, coordination, integration, or networking. To determine the  extent to which SBA and Rural Development\u2019s primary loan and business  programs are complementary and to identify the rationale for the agencies  to work together, we examined laws, regulations, and policies on each  agency\u2019s loans, grants, and other business products and services, and  interviewed officials from both agencies. We reviewed prior reports that  defined collaboration and identified key practices that could help enhance  and sustain collaboration. We also sought input from SBA resource  partners, lenders, and select nonprofit organizations involved in the rural  economic development process. To determine the types of collaborative  efforts that are currently taking place between SBA and Rural  Development, we requested that both SBA and Rural Development  conduct a query of their respective district office Directors and state office  Directors regarding all formal or informal efforts to work collaboratively  with the other agency. We received responses from about half of the SBA  district offices and all of the Rural Development state offices. We  conducted site visits at three locations where SBA and Rural Development  were working together: Lincoln, Nebraska; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and  Bismarck, North Dakota. We also reviewed internal agency documents,  interagency agreements, and training documentation and obtained  detailed information from both agencies\u2019 district and state field offices  regarding formal and informal efforts to work together. To identify past  collaborative efforts, we reviewed documentation and examined the  mechanisms (e.g., contractual work agreements, memorandums of  understanding, statutory provisions, etc.) the agencies used to collaborate.  Finally, to determine opportunities to improve collaboration between SBA  and Rural Development, we reviewed our prior work in this area and  conducted interviews with agency officials, select SBA resource partners,  and nonprofit organizations. Appendix I contains a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 to September  2008, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["SBA is charged with providing support to the nation\u2019s small businesses,  including those in urban and rural areas. Its support takes several forms.  First, it ensures access to credit, primarily by guaranteeing loans through  various loan guarantee programs. Second, it provides entrepreneurial  assistance through partnerships with private entities that offer small  business counseling and technical assistance. Third, SBA administers  various small business development and procurement programs that are  designed to assist small and disadvantaged businesses in obtaining federal  contracts. Finally, SBA makes loans to businesses as well as individuals  trying to recover from major disasters. Although most SBA disaster loans  are processed at the SBA loan processing center in Sacramento,  California, SBA has a network of 68 field offices nationwide.", "SBA administers several business loan programs, including the Basic 7(a)  Loan Guaranty Program, 504/CDC Loan Program , 7(m) Micro Loan  Program, and the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program.  Recently, it added the Small/Rural Lender Advantage Pilot Program, under  its 7(a) Program, specifically for small businesses in rural areas (see fig.  1). Appendix II provides a more detailed description of each program.", "In addition to its loan programs, SBA offers grant programs that support  nonprofit organizations. These grant programs are generally designed to  expand and enhance nonprofit organizations that provide small businesses  with management, technical, or financial assistance. For example, SBA\u2019s  Women\u2019s Business Development Center Program is an SBA grant program  available to private, nonprofit organizations to run women\u2019s business  centers. The program was established by the Women\u2019s Business  Ownership Act of 1988 after Congress found that existing assistance  programs for small business owners were not addressing women\u2019s needs.  The program, which specifically targets economically and socially  disadvantaged women, provides long-term training, counseling,  networking, and mentoring to women who own businesses or are potential  entrepreneurs. The program\u2019s ultimate goal is to add more well-trained  women entrepreneurs to the U.S. business community.", "Additionally, SBA\u2019s Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Program,  which was created by Congress in 1980, provides management and  technical assistance to individuals and small businesses. SBDC services  include, but are not limited to, assisting prospective and existing small  businesses with financial, marketing, production, organization,  engineering, and technical problems and feasibility studies. Each state and  U.S. territory has a lead organization that sponsors and manages the SBDC  program there. The lead organization coordinates program services  offered to small businesses through a network of centers and satellite  locations at colleges, universities, vocational schools, chambers of  commerce, and economic development corporations. Nationwide, 63 lead  SBDCs and more than 1,000 satellite locations have contracted to conduct  SBDC services.", "USDA\u2019s Rural Development is responsible for leading and coordinating  federal rural development assistance. Rural Development administers over  40 development programs for rural communities, most of which provide  assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, and grants, through a  network of 47 state offices and about 500 area or local field offices. Rural  Development has three agencies: Rural Housing Service (RHS), Rural  Utilities Service (RUS), and Rural Business and Cooperative Service  (RBS). RHS helps rural communities and individuals by providing loans,  grants, and technical assistance for housing and community facilities. It  provides funding for single-family homes; apartments for low-income  persons, the elderly, and farm laborers; and various community facilities  such as fire and police stations, hospitals, libraries, and schools. RUS is  responsible for administering electric, telecommunications, and water  programs that help finance the infrastructure necessary to improve the  quality of life and promote economic development in rural areas.", "RBS administers programs that provide business planning and financial  and technical assistance to rural businesses and cooperatives.  Specifically, RBS\u2019 guaranteed loans and other loan and grant programs  work in partnership with private sector and community-based  organizations to meet the business and credit needs of rural businesses.  Recipients of RBS\u2019 services include individuals, farmers, producers,  corporations, partnerships, public bodies, nonprofits, American Indian  tribes, and private companies. The primary business programs include the  Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program, Intermediary  Relending Program (IRP), Rural Business Enterprise Grant Program  (RBEG), Rural Business Opportunity Grant Program (RBOG), Rural  Economic Development Loan and Grant Program (REDLG), and the  Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements  Guaranteed Loan and Grant Program (see fig. 2). Appendix II provides a  more detailed description of each program.", "Rural Development business programs are available in areas that meet the  program\u2019s definition of rural\u2014for example, for the B&I program, any area  other than a city or town with a population of 50,000 or less and the area  contiguous and adjacent to such a city or town. As a result, in general, only  individuals and businesses in identified areas with 50,000 or fewer people  are eligible for most of these programs. One exception is the Intermediary  Relending Program, which is available only to businesses in rural areas  with 25,000 or fewer people."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Complementary Nature of Some SBA and Rural Development Programs Provides a Rationale for Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Some SBA loan programs and Rural Development business programs are  complementary, providing a rationale for the agencies to collaborate.

However, the  various programs have different and sometimes unique strengths\u2014for  example, larger loan amounts, shorter processing times, or targeting of  different market segments. According to SBA and Rural Development  officials, collaborative efforts could allow each agency to leverage the  strengths of the other. For example, Rural Development can finance larger  projects than SBA and lend to nonprofit organizations, something SBA  cannot do. However, SBA can offer entrepreneurs a faster turnaround time  in loan processing. Similarly, officials noted that certain SBA and Rural  Development loan products complemented one another and were used  jointly to finance individual projects.

The 504 and Intermediary  Relending programs both also provide financing for the acquisition and  improvement of land, buildings and equipment, particularly when such  funding will help create or retain jobs.", "According to SBA, the gency provided  504  lon to the owner of  helth cre business  to prchas new $7.2 million hedquarter  building.

For instance, SBA\u2019s  7(a) Loan Guaranty Program and Rural Development\u2019s Business and  Industry Guaranteed Loan Programs both provide financing that can be  used to establish a new business or to assist in the operation, acquisition,  or expansion of an existing business. Specifically, the 7(a) program  provides funding for business start-ups, expansion, equipment, working  capital, and real estate acquisition. Similarly, the Business and Industry  Guaranteed Loan Program provides funding for start-ups and expansion  purposes, including acquisition, inventory, real estate, working capital,  equipment, construction, and enlargement or modernization of rural  businesses. These programs are provided through loan guarantees that  limit the risk to lenders. Private lenders underwrite and service the loans  and make the decisions to approve or not approve loan requests, and SBA  and Rural Development decide whether to guarantee a portion of the  outstanding loan balance if the borrower defaults.", "According to USDA, the Stheast Iow  Regionl Plnning Commission ght  finncing for  revolving lon fnd to erve  De Moine, Henry, Lee, nd Losa contie  in Stheast Iow.

Rural Development offers grant  programs that provide management and technical assistance to rural  borrowers. The Rural Business Enterprise Grant and Rural Business  Opportunity Grant programs provide technical assistance for business  development and to conduct economic planning in rural areas.", "In addition, some of the loan and business programs have similar eligibility  requirements. For example, in administering its Renewable Energy  Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Guaranteed Loan and Grant  Program, Rural Development relies on SBA\u2019s definition of eligible small  businesses, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and  cooperatives. Borrowers must also meet SBA\u2019s small business standards  for the type of industry, number of employees, or annual revenue.  Moreover, some of SBA\u2019s and Rural Development\u2019s programs have  established comparable credit criteria for the borrower. SBA\u2019s 7(a) Loan  Guaranty, 504, and Mirco Loan programs and Rural Development\u2019s  Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program all use similar criteria  that are based on the type of project being funded and the borrower\u2019s  ability to meet normal commercial lending standards and provide a  personal guaranty, if necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA and Rural Development Programs Have Several Key Differences", "paragraphs": ["SBA and Rural Development officials we spoke to stated there was little  overlap or duplication between the two agencies\u2019 loan and business  programs, in part because of several key differences. First, Rural  Development can finance larger projects than SBA. The maximum loan  amount for SBA\u2019s 7(a) loan is $2 million, compared with a maximum loan  amount for Rural Development\u2019s Business and Industry loan of $25  million. Second, the 7(a) and Business and Industry programs also offer  different loan guaranties. The maximum guaranty for 7(a) loans is 85  percent for loans up to $150,000 and 75 percent for loans over $150,000.  The maximum guaranty percentage for Business and Industry loans is 80  percent for loans up to $5 million, 70 percent for loans between $5 million  and $10 million, and 60 percent for loans of more than $10 million. Third,  the costs, fees, and loan terms differ for the two types of loans. For  example, SBA charges a guaranty fee of 2 percent for loans up to $150,000,  3 percent for loans between $150,000 and $700,000, and 3.5 percent for  loans up to $1 million. SBA also charges an additional quarter of a percent  of the guaranteed portion over $1 million. Rural Development charges an  initial guaranty fee not to exceed 2 percent of the guaranteed portion of  the loan. The maximum loan terms for SBA 7(a) loans are determined by  the following: (1) the shortest appropriate term, depending on the  borrower\u2019s ability to repay; (2) 10 years or less, unless it finances or  refinances real estate or equipment with a useful life exceeding 10 years;  and (3) a maximum of 25 years, including extensions. However, the  maximum loan terms for Rural Development\u2019s Business and Industry loans  are 7 years for working capital, 15 years for equipment, and 30 years for  real estate loans.", "Each program also offers some unique strengths. While Rural  Development\u2019s fees tend to be lower than SBA\u2019s, SBA usually processes its  loans faster. In general, the average processing time by SBA for SBA loans  is 5 to 7 business days and for Rural Development business programs 10 to  60 days, depending on the scope of the project and completeness of the  application. SBA can offer shorter turnaround in loan processing,  particularly for its 7(a) program (which sometimes takes as little as 2  business days), because of its various express loan options, preapproved  lenders, and consolidated loan processing center. Rural Development  makes credit and underwriting decisions itself rather than relying on  preapproved lenders, and its loans can take as long as 60 days to process.  Moreover, Rural Development has certain restrictions on the maximum  dollar amount of loans that can be approved by field offices\u2014typically  varying by state based on the loan approval authority. Therefore, Business  and Industry loans above a state\u2019s loan approval limit must be approved by  Rural Development headquarters officials, resulting in additional loan  processing times.", "While both agencies serve rural areas, their programs differ in the types of  entities they serve. SBA\u2019s loan programs only serve the for-profit sector,  focusing on individual entrepreneurs and small businesses. However,  Rural Development\u2019s business programs focus on individual entrepreneurs  and small and mid-size businesses, as well as nonprofits. Appendix III  further illustrates some of the similarities and differences between SBA\u2019s  and Rural Development\u2019s loan and business programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration Allows SBA and Rural Development to Leverage Each Agency\u2019s Strengths and Increase Financing Options in Rural Areas", "paragraphs": ["According to SBA and Rural Development officials who are engaged in  collaborative relationships, collaboration allows the agencies to leverage  the unique strengths of each agency\u2019s programs and increase the number  of financing options to better promote economic development. For  instance, SBA and USDA officials in North Dakota said that SBA\u2019s 504  program and Rural Development\u2019s Intermediary Relending programs were  frequently coupled in loan packages. In those cases, the 504 program  provided funding for land and buildings, and the Intermediary Relending  program provided funding for machinery, equipment, working capital, and  other uses. The officials estimated that about one of every four 504 loans  in rural communities in North Dakota with populations of less than 25,000  residents had been used jointly with Intermediary Relending loans to  finance individual projects. Examples of businesses in North Dakota that  have received joint financing from SBA and Rural Development include an  agricultural retail service that sells chemicals and fertilizer and employs 7  workers and a manufacturer of electric thermal storage heating equipment  that employs 140 workers. In each of these examples, the businesses used  SBA\u2019s 504 program to acquire a building and used the IRP program to  acquire machinery and equipment.", "Other officials with whom we spoke cited further rationale for the  agencies to collaborate. In one instance, a Rural Development official in  New Mexico noted that collaboration with SBA allowed him to tap into  SBA\u2019s preexisting constituency of banks, expanding the number of lenders  that could help provide Rural Development loans to potential borrowers.  Similarly, SBA officials in New Mexico said that collaboration with Rural  Development allowed SBA to provide additional assistance to small  businesses after Rural Development provided initial financing for a  community\u2019s infrastructure.", "The officials involved in the limited instances of collaboration that we  identified acknowledged that working together allowed both agencies to  coordinate the delivery of their loan and business programs to solve  specific credit needs. SBA and Rural Development officials in North  Dakota also told us that by collaborating they were able to provide  borrowers with more financing options than they could by acting alone,  thereby improving service to borrowers. Moreover, according to officials  in North Dakota and New Mexico, collaboration also created a synergistic  effect to better promote economic development in rural areas.", "Finally, while some consolidation has occurred over time, both agencies  have a strong presence in rural areas. Prior to its 1994 reorganization,  USDA had field staff in almost every rural county. Consistent with its  reorganization, and as we reported in September 2000, USDA closed or  consolidated about 1,500 county offices into USDA service centers and  transferred more than 600 Rural Development field positions to the St.  Louis Centralized Servicing Center. The number of Rural Development  offices across the nation is now closer to the number of SBA offices\u201447  Rural Development state offices and 68 SBA district offices (see fig.3).", "In addition to its state offices, Rural Development also has about 500 field  offices, including area, subarea, and other local offices in rural areas. SBA  officials we spoke to in headquarters believe that SBA has a similar  presence in rural communities because of its more than 950 SBDC  locations in the 50 states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia. In  contrast to SBA\u2019s view, Rural Development officials believe that the  presence of its 500 field offices in rural areas is unique because each office  is staffed by USDA employees. Although SBA\u2019s SBDCs may provide  services that differ from services provided by Rural Development field  offices, to the extent that SBDCs are considered part of SBA\u2019s rural  presence, both agencies have a strong rural presence that provides  another rationale for the agencies to collaborate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SBA and Rural Development\u2019s Collaborative Efforts Have Been Sporadic", "paragraphs": ["Overall, in the areas where SBA and Rural Development were  collaborating, the efforts were sporadic, were initiated and administered at  local levels, and appeared to be dependent on established working  relationships among those involved. The results of a query by Rural  Development and SBA officials asking their offices whether collaborative  efforts were under way also indicated that such efforts were sporadic. We  found that the extent of the collaboration that was taking place and the  level of formality\u2014that is, the use of cooperative agreements, such as  MOUs and other mechanisms to collaborate\u2014varied across the agencies\u2019  field offices. For example, in North Dakota, SBA and Rural Development  collaborated frequently and on a relatively formal basis by communicating  at least weekly, hosting several joint lender training sessions yearly, and  establishing an MOU to deliver financing and technical assistance at one  location. In other states we visited, such as Nebraska and New Mexico,  SBA and Rural Development worked with each other less frequently and  on a more informal basis.

As a result, we found that most ongoing  collaborative efforts between the agencies had been initiated at the local  level and were based on established working relationships among the  involved individuals. For example, some SBA and Rural Development field  office officials at the three sites we visited told us that they frequently  collaborated with each other because they had held the same job  positions, within their respective agencies, and worked together for many  years and thus had established a rapport. Other officials told us that they  were involved in collaborative efforts because they had initiated the  efforts on their own or had prior experience in partnering with other  agencies and had chosen to continue similar efforts.", "SBA and Rural Development headquarters officials conducted a query of  their respective field office staff to determine the extent to which these  offices were involved in any formal or informal collaborative efforts. In  addition to information we obtained from the three locations we visited,  the query results showed that collaborative efforts developed sporadically  among a limited number of offices. For example, of SBA\u2019s 68 district  offices, only about half reported having ongoing collaborative efforts with  Rural Development. Similarly, only about half of Rural Development\u2019s 47  state offices reported having ongoing collaborative efforts. Of those Rural  Development offices that reported not having any ongoing efforts, a few  indicated that they had partnered with SBA in the past.

These  offices used formal mechanisms such as MOUs to establish a framework  for their efforts. In North Dakota, for example, SBA and Rural  Development offices offered at least eight joint lender trainings each year  and held quarterly meetings. In addition, in North Dakota the agencies had  established an MOU that created the Entrepreneur Centers of North  Dakota (ECND), a single entity involving SBA, Rural Development, and  other state and local stakeholders. According to officials at the center,  the ECND provides \u201cone-stop\u201d access to a variety of products and services,  a concept that has been widely used by USDA in its service centers for  over 10 years and that was a cornerstone of the agency\u2019s reorganization  efforts.", "Through the ECND, a prospective small business borrower in North  Dakota can work with the five ECND partners to obtain financing and  technical assistance from any of the more than 15 programs that are  offered. ECND partners work with the borrower from the initial point of  contact and continue their assistance through the process of securing the  appropriate financing and may stay involved until a project is completed.

Under the MOU, which is still used today, the offices provide  referrals, conduct periodic meetings to update program information, and  engage in forums and joint lender training sessions to educate lenders on  their programs.

The forums are 1-day events during which Rural Development, SBA, and  SBDC officials and other local economic development professionals make  presentations on the various types of loan programs that are available to  small businesses. The forums\u2019 goal is to involve local economic and  political leaders in assisting small businesses in rural areas of the state and  to obtain their buy-in and support for SBA and Rural Development  programs.", "SBA and Rural Development officials in other locations reported that they  were involved in informal collaborative efforts. In Arkansas, Missouri, and  Virginia, these activities were based on referrals. According to officials in  these areas, SBA and Rural Development field personnel often refer  applicants in need of financing to each other\u2019s agency if the other agency\u2019s  programs seem better suited to the applicants\u2019 needs. SBA and Rural  Development offices in Massachusetts also reported that they had recently  sponsored a joint educational event on renewable energy and energy  efficiency grants and loans and had held meetings to exchange program  information. Additionally, in New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont,  the offices reported that they had informal relationships and generally  kept each other up to date on their respective programs.", "In many states, however, SBA and Rural Development do not appear to be  collaborating at all or to have formal or informal mechanisms to facilitate  collaboration. These states include, among others, Arizona, Colorado,  Georgia, Maine, North Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia. Because of this  lack of collaboration, SBA and Rural Development offices in these states  may be missing out on opportunities to work together to better serve  entrepreneurs and small businesses in their local communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA and Rural Development have Collaborated with Each Other and Other Agencies in the Past", "paragraphs": ["SBA and Rural Development have collaborated in the past with each other  and with other agencies. Generally speaking, these efforts enabled the  agencies to achieve results that they could not have achieved acting alone.  For example, SBA and Rural Development collaborated with each other  under the RBIP. Section 6029 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment  Act of 2002 required USDA to establish the RBIP. The purpose of the  program was twofold: first, to promote economic development and create  jobs in rural areas by encouraging investments of venture capital to help  develop small rural businesses; and second, to establish a developmental  venture capital program to address the unmet equity investment needs of  small rural businesses.", "RBIP was modeled after SBA\u2019s Small Business Investment Company  program and its New Markets Venture Capital program, and Rural  Development was expected to draw upon the experience that SBA had  gained in administering these programs. Under an interagency agreement  required by the act, Rural Development had oversight responsibility for  RBIP, and SBA had the day-to-day responsibility for managing and  operating the program using its own staff, procedures, and forms.  According to both SBA and Rural Development officials, the success of  RBIP was limited due to a lack of funding, in part because the Deficit  Reduction Act of 2005 rescinded fiscal year 2007 and subsequent funding  for the program. Both agencies also encountered challenges during  planning and implementation. For instance, it took about 2 years from the  time that the law was enacted in 2002 to finalize and sign the operating  agreements, establish interim final rules, and announce funding  availability in 2004. Prior to the loss of funding in 2006, only one company  was able to raise the necessary capital (i.e., private equity matching  dollars) for full approval to become licensed as a rural business  investment company under RBIP.", "According to SBA and Rural Development officials, the agencies have also  collaborated with other agencies, and the results have reportedly been  beneficial for both SBA and USDA. For instance, both SBA and Rural  Development each collaborated with FCA to examine specialized lending  institutions. Specifically, SBA oversees small business lending companies  (SBLC), which are nondepository lending institutions licensed by SBA that  play a significant role in SBA\u2019s 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program. However,  SBLCs are not generally regulated or examined by financial institution  regulators. SBA entered into a contractual agreement with FCA in 1999  that tasked FCA with conducting safety and soundness examinations of  the SBLCs. Under the agreement, FCA would conduct examinations of  SBLCs on a full cost-recovery basis, and the agencies would have the  option to terminate or extend the agreement after 1 year. Rural  Development also collaborated with FCA under an Economy Act  agreement to conduct examinations of its nontraditional lenders (i.e.,  lenders that provide loans to borrowers that do not meet the traditional  credit criteria) that participate in Rural Development\u2019s B&I, Renewable  Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements, and Community  Facilities Guaranteed Loan Programs. Under the agreement, FCA  conducts, on a full cost-recovery basis, examinations of the lending  institutions\u2019 safety and soundness, lending practices, and regulatory  compliance. These agreements have allowed both SBA and Rural  Development to take advantage of FCA\u2019s expertise in examining  specialized financial institutions and offered FCA the opportunity to  broaden its experience through exposure to different lending  environments.", "Additionally, Rural Development and FEMA collaborated in providing  disaster assistance to Hurricane Katrina victims. Through this  collaborative effort, Rural Development assisted victims of Katrina by (1)  making multifamily rental units available nationwide; (2) providing grants  and loans for home repair and replacement; and (3) providing mortgage  relief through a foreclosure moratorium and mortgage payment  forbearance. Over the years, Rural Development\u2019s Housing and  Community Facilities Program and HUD have routinely collaborated with  each other to provide affordable housing assistance in rural communities,  and the working relationship still exists today. Rural Development and  HUD have together created a voucher program, modeled after HUD\u2019s  Housing Choice Voucher program that provides rental assistance to  families in rural areas. They have also developed cooperative agreements  for their multifamily housing assistance programs that allow tenants to use  HUD vouchers in USDA subsidized multifamily housing units. We were  told that each of the collaborative efforts allowed the agencies to establish  common approaches to working together, clarify priorities as well as roles  and responsibilities, and align their resources to accomplish common  outcomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SBA and Rural Development Could Take Steps to Establish a Formal Approach to Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["SBA and Rural Development have not had a lasting approach to guide  them in collaborating with one another more effectively.

In December 2000, SBA and Rural  Development entered into an MOU that provided an approach to  collaboration. The MOU incorporated three of the key practices we have  identified. The MOU expired in 2003 and SBA and Rural Development do  not appear to have implemented the MOU when it was active. The  ineffective implementation of the MOU has likely contributed to the  sporadic and limited amount of collaboration that is taking place between  the two agencies. SBA and Rural Development also do not have formal  incentives focused on collaboration and do not track the results or impact  of collaborative efforts. As a result, the agencies are unable to share  information on the benefits of working together and encourage additional  efforts to do so.

In particular, the agencies  entered into a cooperative agreement\u2014an MOU\u2014in December 2000 that  (1) defined and articulated a common outcome; (2) reached agreement on  roles and responsibilities; and (3) established a mechanism to monitor,  evaluate, and report on results.", "Specifically, the MOU defined and articulated a common purpose,  including to better serve rural areas by coordinating the delivery of  programs; increase the number of small business loans guaranteed by both  agencies; and develop relationships with federal, state, county, and local  agencies, private organizations, and commercial and financial institutions  to facilitate and support the development of strong rural businesses. In  addition, the MOU described the respective roles and responsibilities each  agency would maintain in providing training on their programs, credit  analysis techniques, and processing and servicing policies. Finally, the  MOU stated that, at least annually, SBA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Field  Operations, SBA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Financial Assistance, and  Rural Development\u2019s Deputy Administrator for Business Programs, or  their designees, would monitor and evaluate the previous year\u2019s joint  activities and plan any future work.", "The MOU, signed in December 2000, was to become active on the date of  execution and remain in effect for 3 calendar years at which time the two  agencies had the option to extend it for an additional 2 years by written  agreement.

Based on our analysis, there are two potential reasons for this  lack of implementation.", "First, SBA and Rural Development may not have implemented the 2000  MOU when it was active because of a lack of direction and focus from high  levels of each agency emphasizing the need for and importance of  collaboration. Rural Development officials confirmed that a change in  USDA administration occurred after the 2000 MOU was signed, and the  officials who signed the MOU were no longer in the positions they  occupied at the time of the signing. This explanation is consistent with  what others told us about barriers to more effective collaboration between  federal agencies. For example, a representative of a rural community  development organization with whom we spoke stated that the initial  momentum for some collaborative efforts may come from officials in  management level positions of a federal agency, but after the responsible  officials leave the agency, or a change in administration occurs, the  momentum for a collaborative effort may drop off and not be resumed by  the officials\u2019 successors.", "Second, the 2000 MOU may not have been fully implemented because  neither agency appeared to be actively monitoring the extent to which  collaboration was ongoing. For instance, when we began our work for this  review, we asked SBA and Rural Development officials in headquarters to  provide examples of formal or informal efforts the agencies have  undertaken to work together. The officials were not able to provide any  descriptions of such efforts and told us that ongoing collaborative efforts  were likely to be sporadic and occurred only as needed in the agencies\u2019  field offices. Because we could not obtain information on the extent and  nature of SBA and Rural Development\u2019s collaborative efforts, we asked  each agency to query its field offices to provide us with this information.  As discussed previously, based on the results of each agency\u2019s query, we  found a few locations where SBA and Rural Development are involved in  frequent and formal collaborative efforts, some locations where the  agencies are involved in informal efforts, and many locations where the  agencies appear not to be working together at all.", "SBA and Rural Development officials did not cite the December 2000 MOU  when we began work for this review and, for a period of months, the  agencies did not appear to be in agreement as to whether the MOU was  active. In March 2008, Rural Development officials informed us that they  were operating as though the MOU was active, even though it had expired.  However, when we asked about the December 2000 MOU during some of  our visits to locations where SBA and Rural Development were  collaborating, some officials in the locations were unfamiliar with it.  During the course of our review, neither SBA nor Rural Development  officials cited actions taken, past or present, in response to the provisions  contained in the MOU.

As mentioned, as we reported in our  2005 report, one of the key practices that can help agencies to enhance  and sustain their collaborative efforts involved ensuring that the agencies\u2019  goals are consistent and that their program efforts are mutually reinforced  through strategic and annual performance plans. Specifically, federal  programs contributing to the same or similar results should collaborate  and use their strategic and annual performance plans as tools to drive  their efforts to work together. Such plans can reinforce accountability for  the collaboration by establishing complementary goals and measures for  achieving results and aligning them with the goals and measures of the  collaborative efforts. SBA and Rural Development\u2019s performance goals  and measures do not focus on their efforts to work together  collaboratively. Specifically, in describing their performance goals for  district offices, SBA officials stated that each office has goals for technical  assistance, including activities such as training, marketing, and outreach.  The officials noted that each SBA district office also has goals and  measures for the number of loans to be made in underserved markets,  which may include rural areas. While these goals and measures focus on  participation in SBA\u2019s programs and may encourage offices to partner with  others, they do not focus specifically on collaboration with Rural  Development. Similarly, Rural Development\u2019s program performance  measures, particularly for the B&I program, do not focus on collaboration  with another agency. Rural Development\u2019s goals and measures focus on  employment opportunities (i.e., jobs created or saved) and community  economic benefits (i.e., value added to a community as a result of the  economic impact of Rural Development\u2019s programs). Both SBA and Rural  Development officials stated that performance goals and measures  focused on collaboration could provide an incentive to collaborate. Once  established, such goals and measures could provide both agencies a  mechanism to encourage interagency working relationships and reward  those efforts already occurring.", "Additionally, SBA and Rural Development officials at the three locations  we visited said that they are not currently tracking the results of some  collaborative efforts, such as the joint training of lenders and community  outreach sessions.

Rural Development  officials in Nebraska said that they have received phone calls from some  lenders after the lenders have attended a joint training session. In these  cases, according to the officials, Rural Development has been active in  meeting with lenders one-on-one to provide assistance. However, the  officials said that they could do a better job of proactively contacting the  lenders after the training to solicit feedback and determine if the lender  has initiated any new loans as a result of having attended the training  session.", "SBA and Rural Development officials stated that one way to document the  benefits of collaboration would be to prepare \u201csuccess stories\u201d of ventures  that SBA and Rural Development had jointly undertaken. The officials  further stated that because each agency already prepared success stories  that are based upon participation in their individual programs, this  practice could be used to document positive benefits stemming from  collaborative efforts between the two agencies.

Both  agencies entered into earlier cooperative agreements to work  collaboratively.

Such an approach could help SBA and  Rural Development establish the guidance, direction, and incentive  structure needed to bring about a productive working relationship on a  more systematic basis. Our previous work in this area shows that adopting  key practices\u2014such as defining and articulating a common outcome;  specifying roles and responsibilities; establishing a mechanism to monitor,  evaluate, and report on results; and reinforcing agency accountability for  collaborative efforts\u2014can help federal agencies enhance and sustain their  collaborative efforts. One way SBA and Rural Development can adopt  these key practices is to enter into a written cooperative agreement and,  just as important, implement that agreement and take appropriate steps to  monitor and report on results. Moreover, by creating formal incentives,  such as performance goals and measures specifically focused on  collaboration or, similarly, preparing success stories to document the  benefits of their collaborative efforts, SBA and Rural Development can  share and publicize information that would help encourage the two  agencies to work together.

We reviewed our prior work on interagency collaboration  and key practices that can help enhance and sustain collaborative efforts.  We obtained input from SBA and USDA agency officials, SBA resource  partners, lenders, and nonprofit organizations involved in the rural  economic development process on the goals and common outcomes they  envision from increased collaboration between the SBA and Rural  Development. Also, using information collected on the mission and  structure of SBA and Rural Development offices, and the purpose, eligible  use, and terms/conditions of their primary business programs, we assessed  whether factors such as complementary mission or task, compatible  geographic location and organizational structure, common client base,  program overlap and duplication, or similarities and differences in  statutory authority, provide a rationale for the two agencies to work  together.

Of those SBA and Rural Development district and state offices  that reported they were working together, we selected three locations and  conducted site visits and interviews with knowledgeable staff at each  location to obtain a thorough understanding of ongoing collaborative  efforts. We selected the sites to visit based on the reported amount of  collaboration and degree of formality of the effort. We defined formality  by the presence of a written document, such as an MOU, that served as a  guide for collaborative efforts. The goal of our selection approach was to  obtain information on a range of collaborative efforts, from frequent and  formal to infrequent and informal.

It can be used  for a variety of general business purposes including, working capital,  machinery and equipment, land and building (including purchase,  renovation, and new construction), leasehold improvements, and certain  debt refinancing. SBA sets the guidelines for the loans and backs the loan  with a guaranty, while lenders make the loans to the small businesses. SBA  offers multiple variations of the Basic 7(a) Loan Program to accommodate  targeted needs. For example, the Patriot Express Loan Program, which is  specifically geared toward veterans, members of the military community  and their spouses, and the Community Express Loan Program, which is  aimed at women, minorities, and veterans in underserved communities  who want to start or expand a small business, are both expedited versions  of the Basic 7(a) Loan Program.  504/Certified Development Company (CDC) Loan Program provides  long-term, fixed-rate financing to small businesses to acquire real estate,  machinery, or equipment for expansion or modernization. The 504/CDC  Loan Program cannot be used for working capital or inventory,  consolidating or repaying debt, or refinancing. Typically a 504/CDC project  includes a loan secured by a lien from a private-sector lender, a loan  secured by an additional lien from a certified development company  (CDC) (covering up to 40 percent of the total cost) and a contribution of at  least 10 percent equity from the borrower. CDCs are private, nonprofit  corporations set up to contribute to the economic development of their  communities or regions. The program is designed to enable small  businesses to create and retain jobs\u2014the CDC\u2019s portfolio must create or  retain one job for every $35,000 provided by the SBA.  7(m) Micro Loan Program provides short-term loans of up to $35,000 to  small businesses and not-for-profit child-care centers for working capital  or the purchase of inventory, supplies, furniture, fixtures, machinery, or  equipment. The average loan size is about $13,000, and proceeds can be  used for typical business purposes such as working capital, machinery and  equipment, inventory, and leasehold improvements. The proceeds cannot  be used to pay existing debts or to purchase real estate. Under this  program, SBA makes funds available to intermediaries (nonprofit  community-based organizations with experience in lending) that, in turn,  make the loan directly to the entrepreneur. The intermediary lenders also  provide entrepreneurs with management and technical assistance.", "SBIC Program provides venture capital to small independent businesses,  both new and already established. The structure of the program is unique  in that SBICs are privately owned and managed investment funds, licensed  and regulated by SBA, that use their own capital plus funds borrowed with  an SBA guarantee to make equity capital and long-term loans to qualifying  small businesses.
