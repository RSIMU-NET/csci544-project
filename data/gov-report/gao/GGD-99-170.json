For example, before purchasing computer or electrical equipment, an agency may require that prospective sellers obtain a certification from Underwriters Laboratories or another organization that the product is safe. An agency may also require that individuals in certain professions meet specific educational standards or be approved as competent by a particular organization before providing a service. There is no official definition of \u201ccertification\u201d that is applicable to the activities of all federal agencies. However, the term generally refers to a process of providing written assurance that a product, process, service, organization, or individual conforms to specified requirements or standards for product quality, process reliability, or professional competence.", "Although certification requirements are intended to provide a measure of quality assurance, they can also engender concern on the part of affected parties. For example, businesses or individuals that wish to provide products or services to the government might need to obtain more than one certification to meet the requirements of different agencies. Also, an agency might select a particular certification organization while not accepting certifications in the same subject area from other organizations with similar qualifications.", "Because of these kinds of concerns regarding the potential effects of federal certification requirements on small businesses, you asked us to describe (1) the extent and variety of certification activities in the federal government; (2) the extent to which there are policies, procedures, or guidance governing those activities, either governmentwide or within selected agencies; and (3) an agency certification procedure that could serve as an example or \u201cbest practice\u201d for other agencies. We defined certification broadly in this review to include those activities, methods, and programs that agencies use to ensure conformance to standards, even if the agencies did not use the term certification. Therefore, this report also includes certification-related activities, such as accreditation, recognition, and conformity assessment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A fundamental difficulty in discussing federal agencies\u2019 certification requirements is that there is no official definition of the term in the federal government. In fact, a NIST official told us that there are almost as many definitions of a federal certification program as there are federal agencies. Different organizations may also use other terms to refer to the concept of certification, such as accreditation, registration, approval, or listing. These terms have specific and different meanings in some contexts but are used interchangeably in others. In any case, the nomenclature can be confusing. For example, in 1989 we reviewed laboratory accreditation requirements for 20 different programs and found that these programs used 10 different terms for accreditation, with at least 18 different meanings.", "Certification, accreditation, recognition, conformity assessment, and related terms all refer to types of standards-related activities, so a definition of \u201cstandards\u201d can serve as a useful starting place. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines standards as documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes, and services are fit for their purpose. ISO defines certification as the procedure by which a third party gives written assurance that a product, process, or service conforms to specified requirements or standards. Accreditation, according to ISO, refers to the procedure by which an authoritative body gives formal recognition that a body or person is competent to carry out specific tasks. In the context of certification, an accreditation body might accredit a certification body, such as a testing laboratory, as competent to carry out certification activities\u2014in a sense, certifying the certifiers. Recognition is a term that is relatively new to conformity assessment activities in the United States, and it refers to designation by a government entity that an accreditation program is competent. Conformity assessment is the broadest term for these types of activities. According to the National Academy of Sciences, conformity assessment is the determination of whether a product or process conforms to particular standards or specifications. It may include such activities as sampling, testing, inspection, certification, registration, accreditation, and recognition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Numerous Standards Underlie Certifications", "paragraphs": ["There are a great many standards or criteria for product quality, process reliability, or professional competence. NIST estimated that in the United States alone, approximately 49,000 voluntary standards have been developed by more than 620 organizations. The agency said this estimate does not include \u201ca much greater number of procurement specifications. . . as well as mandatory codes, rules, and regulations containing standards developed and adopted at federal, state, and local levels.\u201d NIST also pointed out that numerous foreign, regional, and international organizations produce standards of interest and importance to American businesses. For example, ISO has issued more than 10,000 international standards. Agency officials told us that use of these and other international standards has become increasingly common in the United States.", "The standards underlying certifications cover a wide range of products, processes, and professions. Some are product quality or safety standards, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for manually operated gas valves or the UL standard for communications cables. There are also standards for the performance and reliability of particular processes, as in ISO standards for quality management systems. Professional standards, such as the American Medical Association\u2019s standards in medical practice, research, and education, are used to assure the qualifications and competence of individuals in specific disciplines or fields. The preceding examples also illustrate that standards can come from many sources. They can be established by industry or professional consensus standard-setting bodies, by governments through statutes or regulations, or by international standard-setting bodies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certifications Reflect Diversity of Standards", "paragraphs": ["Certifications of products, processes, and services provide information on whether they can meet certain levels of quality, safety, or performance. However, certifications of people or organizations focus on an evaluation and designation of competence and qualifications. In professional and technical fields, certifications confirm the skills and knowledge of individuals who meet specific requirements (e.g., a certified public accountant). The professional certification process typically involves passing examinations and meeting other educational and/or experiential requirements. The choice of standards, the type of certification program, and the certification methodology used to assess conformity all have a significant impact on the validity and value of the information provided by a given certification.", "The total number of certification programs in the United States is unknown, but NIST has identified at least 178 private sector organizations that have product certification programs. In addition, the National Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA) has identified at least 1,700 organizations based in the United States with programs for the certification or accreditation of individuals. The National Academy of Sciences and NIST have each noted that there is no central coordination of conformity assessment and related activities in the United States. Perhaps as a result, certification requirements can be duplicative and costly for those who must be certified or accredited. The fees for each certification exam can range from a few hundred dollars to over a thousand dollars, and the associated costs for annual fees and recertification in future years may be substantial. NIST officials told us that some laboratories must obtain multiple different accreditations\u2014which often evaluate many of the same common elements in their evaluation processes\u2014in order to provide testing services. NIST had found that laboratories desiring to be accredited or designated nationwide to conduct electrical safety-related testing of construction materials had to gain the acceptance of at least 43 states, over 100 local jurisdictions, the International Conference of Building Officials, the Building Officials and Code Administrators, the Southern Building Code Congress International, a number of federal agencies, and several large corporations.", "Congress has attempted to address some of the concerns about redundant certification requirements. For example, the Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 requires greater coordination of conformity assessment activities and attempts to facilitate mutual recognition among conformity assessment programs. Also, in June 1999 Congress amended the Fastener Quality Act in part to address concerns about potentially burdensome, costly, and duplicative testing and certification procedures that would have been imposed on industry. The amended law no longer requires NIST to approve organizations that accredit fastener testing laboratories. The amendments also exempt those fasteners already subject to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) regulation.", "However, despite such concerns, it also should be recognized that some certification programs and requirements foster opportunities for small businesses.  For example, the Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) Program implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recognizes private sector laboratories that meet the necessary qualifications specified in program regulations.  OSHA officials pointed out that this program has given a number of small testing laboratories in the United States the opportunity to provide types of services that only a few organizations provided before the program went into effect."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives in this review were to describe (1) the extent and variety of certification activities in the federal government; (2) the extent to which there are policies, procedures, or guidance governing those activities, either governmentwide or within selected agencies; and (3) an agency certification procedure that could serve as an example or \u201cbest practice\u201d for other agencies. To address these objectives, we interviewed officials and obtained documentation from five federal agencies in which the Committee had expressed an interest: the Departments of Transportation (DOT) and Veterans Affairs (VA); and, within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FDA, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We also contacted officials in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NIST, and the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) because of their responsibilities related to the issue of certification. We also interviewed and obtained documents from officials of NOCA and its related accreditation body, the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).", "There are some important scope limitations to our review. Although we defined the term certification broadly to include such issues as accreditation, recognition, and conformity assessment, the report does not cover those Federal Acquisition Regulation certifications (e.g., the Certification of Final Indirect Costs and the Certification of Nonsegregated Facilities) that might be included as standard solicitation provisions and contract clauses but are not related to conformity with technical or professional standards. The scope of our first objective was governmentwide. However, as agreed with the Committee, it was not our intention to develop a comprehensive listing of every possible certification-related activity and requirement of federal agencies. Our intent was to illustrate the extent and variety of such activities in the federal government. As agreed with the Committee, our review of agency- specific policies, procedures, or guidance under the second objective was limited to selected agencies, including CDC, DOT, FDA, NIH, and VA. To address our third objective, we again focused primarily on specific certification examples from the five selected agencies. The examples cited in agencies other than the five selected for more in-depth review were limited to ones cited in published reports or suggested by persons we interviewed. We obtained only limited information on the certification requirements in agency procurement actions. Our choices of examples to highlight as best practices represent subjective decisions based on our observations and work in the regulatory arena.", "We conducted this review between November 1998 and August 1999 at the headquarters offices of the above-mentioned agencies in the Washington, D.C., area in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs and the Director of OMB for their review and comment. Their responses are presented at the end of this letter, along with our evaluation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Engage in a Wide Variety of Certification-Related Activities", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies engage in both a large number and a wide variety of certification-related activities. The certifications differ across several dimensions, including the origins of the requirements, their targets, which entity or entities do the certifying, whether the certifications are mandatory or voluntary, and the extent to which there is reciprocity with or recognition of other certifications or other organizations\u2019 requirements. The extent of agency involvement in the process can also vary, ranging from instances in which an agency might simply apply a certification requirement established by other entities to cases in which the agency is actively involved in developing and enforcing a specific requirement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Certification Activities Are Numerous and Diverse", "paragraphs": ["We did not attempt to develop a compendium of every federal agency certification or certification-related activity and requirement, and it would be difficult to do so given the absence of a common understanding and definition of the term \u201ccertification requirement\u201d in the federal government. However, it is clear that federal agencies engage in a large number of certification-related activities. For example, NIST publishes directories that list more than 200 federal procurement and regulatory programs in which agencies provide or require some form of certification. The NIST directories provide only a partial inventory of agencies\u2019 activities, though, because they primarily focus on certification of products and services. Also, the directories do not cover individual procurement opportunities in which agencies require a vendor or contractor to have a particular certification, accreditation, or registration in order to participate.", "Agencies\u2019 certification requirements also vary in a number of ways, reflecting the variety of the underlying standards. One such dimension is the scope of the certification programs and requirements. For example, FAA\u2019s comprehensive system of certifications for the civil aviation system is quite broad, covering numerous categories of equipment, personnel, and facilities. On the other hand, one of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) requirements (pursuant to section 609 of the Clean Air Act) is very specific, focused solely on operators who service motor vehicle air conditioners and requiring them to be certified under an EPA-approved program before offering their services. Another narrowly focused certification requirement is in FDA regulations that are designed to prevent botulism. The regulations require that a \u201cprocessing authority\u201d must certify the competency of \u201clow-acid canned food retort operators\u201d (i.e., the operators of heating and pressure cookers).", "Federal agencies\u2019 certification-related activities also vary with regard to the extent of agency involvement in the certification process. For example, an agency might be deeply involved in developing and/or enforcing a specific certification requirement. On the other hand, the agency might simply apply a requirement established by other entities, such as when an agency incorporates technical or professional certification requirements by reference in solicitations for specific products or services.", "Other ways that certification requirements vary include the following.", "The target of certification.", "Product", "Profession", "Process", "Facility or organization", "Who does the certification.", "Federal government", "State or local governments", "Joint commissions", "Private sector, professional, or trade organizations", "Self-certification", "The origin or basis of the certification requirement.", "Statutory requirements", "Agency regulatory actions", "International agreements", "Industry consensus or nonconsensus requirements", "Procurement actions", "The degree of compulsion on those being certified.", "Voluntary", "Mandatory", "Required for program participation", "Whether other certifications are accepted or recognized.", "Only the specified certification is accepted", "Other certifications accepted or recognized According to NIST officials, the risk associated with a particular regulatory action or procurement can be an important factor influencing choices within these various dimensions. If the perceived risk is low, for instance, an agency might determine that certification is voluntary and accept a manufacturer\u2019s self-certification. However, if the risk associated with failure to meet standards is serious, the agency might choose to make certification mandatory and accept certification from only a federally recognized laboratory.", "Appendix I describes a number of specific agency certification programs and requirements that illustrate these kinds of differences. Some of the requirements differ on multiple dimensions. For example, the National Marine Fisheries Service within the Department of Commerce has a program for the inspection and certification of seafood products and processing operations. The Seafood Inspection Program is a voluntary program carried out pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended; involves inspection by licensed federal and state agents; and provides certification recognized by other federal, state, and foreign government agencies as well as some private and international organizations. In contrast, a provision in an NIH procurement solicitation stated that a prospective contractor\u2019s supervisors responsible for inspection of the agency\u2019s biohazard cabinets \u201cmust be NSF accredited biohazard cabinet field certifiers.\u201d This provision is based on an industry consensus standard, targets professional competence, involves accreditation by a private sector third party, represents a mandatory requirement for prospective contractors, and recognizes only one source for the certification."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Little Guidance Exists on Agency Certification Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Federal procurement law establishes some legal boundaries on the certification requirements used in federal procurement.

Consequently, the agencies\u2019 selection of specific certification requirements or certifying organizations were driven more by the particular profession, industry, or market sector involved than by federal considerations. For example, officials from VA and NIH said that their agencies commonly rely on national consensus bodies and their \u201cnationally recognized\u201d or \u201cindustry standard\u201d certifications for a given sector.

In addition to suggesting common terminology and definitions for agencies to use, NIST expects the guidance to define agency responsibilities in a number of areas, including the following: identifying private sector conformity assessment practices and programs and considering use of the results of such practices or programs in new or existing regulatory and procurement actions, using relevant guides or recommendations for conformity assessment practices published by domestic and international standardizing bodies, and working with other agencies to avoid unnecessary duplication and complexity in federal conformity assessment activities.", "However, NIST officials also pointed out that the guidance would not preempt the agencies\u2019 authority and responsibility to make regulatory or procurement decisions authorized by statute or required to meet programmatic objectives and requirements. They also said the guidance would not suggest that agencies explain why they selected one certification requirement or organization over other possible candidates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related Policies and Procedures Also Affect Certification Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Although there is currently no governmentwide guidance specifically on certification requirements, agency officials noted several related policies and procedures that can affect those requirements. Those policies and procedures include OMB Circular A-119, federal ethics and conflict-of- interest laws, and agencies\u2019 rulemaking and procurement procedures and regulations.", "OMB Circular A-119 says that all federal agencies must use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards in their procurement and regulatory activities, except where inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical. If an agency uses government-unique standards, it must explain why it did so in a report to OMB through NIST. The circular also says that agencies must consult with voluntary consensus standards bodies, both domestic and international, and must participate with such bodies in the development of voluntary consensus standards \u201cwhen consultation and participation is in the public interest and is compatible with their missions, authorities, priorities, and budget resources.\u201d", "Agency officials from each of the selected agencies we reviewed noted that employees of their agencies commonly participate in such consensus bodies, including ones that help to establish certification requirements. Agency employees who, at government expense, participate in such activities on behalf of the agency must do so as specifically authorized agency representatives and are subject to ethics laws regarding participation by federal employees in activities of outside organizations. However, according to the Office of Government Ethics, there is no conflict of interest if an authorized agency representative participated in developing a voluntary consensus standard and the agency subsequently selected that standard as a requirement. Circular A-119 does caution, however, that agency participation in voluntary consensus bodies does not necessarily connote agency agreement with, or endorsement of, decisions reached by such organizations.", "The circular does not apply to conformity assessment activities carried out pursuant to treaties, which may impose their own obligations on federal agencies. NIST officials pointed out that the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, in particular, includes conformity assessment obligations that apply to federal agencies. According to WTO, the intent of this agreement is to ensure that regulations, standards, testing, and certification procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. The agreement includes articles regarding procedures for assessment of conformity and recognition of conformity assessment by central government bodies. For example, the agreement encourages countries to recognize each other\u2019s testing procedures. Members of WTO are also encouraged to permit conformity assessment bodies located in the territories of other members to participate in their conformity assessment procedures under conditions no less favorable than those accorded to bodies within their own territories or the territories of any other countries.", "Agency officials also said that their general procedures and regulations governing rulemaking and procurement play an important role in certification activities. In particular, they noted that such procedures and regulations provide valuable opportunities for an agency to inform the public and solicit feedback on proposed certification requirements. FDA officials said their agency\u2019s procedural rules and regulations require them to use rulemaking in order to establish an enforceable certification requirement.", "DOT and FDA used the rulemaking process in developing or implementing several of the agencies\u2019 certification requirements. Although DOT and FDA officials acknowledged that rulemaking procedures take considerable time and effort, they noted that those procedures could also help the agencies obtain informed comments and document certification decisions. DOT officials said the use of the rulemaking process was particularly valuable in the establishment of certification requirements for subjects that are new to the department or in which DOT has little expertise. For example, proposed departmental regulations intended to reduce alcohol misuse by employees in DOT-regulated transportation industries included important roles for substance abuse professionals (SAPs). In response to public comments on the proposed rule, DOT refined and expanded its definition of SAPs in the final regulations and said alcohol and drug abuse counselors certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors (NAADAC) Certification Commission could serve as SAPs.", "However, agency officials also emphasized that rulemaking may not always be a necessary or appropriate procedure for making certification decisions. In particular, NIH and CDC officials distinguished their research-oriented agencies from regulatory agencies, noting that they tend to act through nonmandatory guidance or recommendations, not through rulemaking. DOT officials said that they generally do not use rulemaking procedures if certification requirements are part of a one-time procurement or contract.  However, they said rulemaking might be the appropriate approach if the requirements are part of a recurring procurement.", "Agency officials also noted that procurement procedures can play a role in their agencies\u2019 choice of certification requirements and certifying organizations. Contracting officials emphasized the opportunities provided throughout the procurement process for prospective bidders to question proposed certification requirements and to suggest changes or other equivalent certifications that might meet the agency\u2019s needs. NIH officials noted that in addition to responding to the solicitation itself, bidders can comment on the draft request for proposal (published to see if there are enough sources) and the announcement of forthcoming solicitations to the market that appears in the Commerce Business Daily. Officials from CDC, FDA, and NIH pointed out that any solicitation could be the subject of bid protests if their agencies used procurement provisions that some entities believed were too restrictive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transparency of Certification Decisionmaking Is a \u201cBest Practice\u201d", "paragraphs": ["As noted previously, agency certification actions are numerous and vary substantially.

The program\u2019s regulations published in the Federal Register provide detailed procedures and criteria for certification of personnel and facilities providing mammography services, as well as the procedures and criteria that FDA uses to approve accreditation bodies. FDA has developed and publicized the regulations through a series of public rulemaking notices, building on procedures and criteria promulgated in earlier regulations issued by the Department of Education and the Health Care Financing Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency also provides ongoing guidance on the implementation of this program and its requirements, notifying the public of any updates in the guidance through quarterly Federal Register notices that announce the availability of and changes in FDA guidance documents.", "DOT has also clearly explained in several of its rulemaking documents how it made or planned to make decisions on the selection of particular certifying organizations. For example, in a 1997 final rule, the Coast Guard allowed an alternative inspection compliance method to fulfill requirements for vessel inspection and certification. Previously, these inspections and certifications had to be performed by the Coast Guard. Under the alternative, the Coast Guard can issue a certificate of inspection based upon reports by a \u201crecognized, authorized classification society\u201d that a vessel complies with United States and international safety rules, conventions, or other specified requirements. In order to receive recognition from the Coast Guard, the regulation requires a classification society to meet 23 specific criteria.", "In DOT\u2019s previously mentioned substance abuse-prevention program, the department\u2019s rulemaking notices clearly documented the department\u2019s reasons for selecting or rejecting particular certifying bodies. Although DOT did not describe the specific criteria it would use to accept or reject professional certifications at the time it issued the proposed rule, the department\u2019s response to public comments in the final rule clearly described why it accepted certification by NAADAC and rejected state certifications. DOT noted that NAADAC was a national organization and that commenters provided information showing that the training and experience needed to meet NAADAC standards and certification requirements were sufficient for participation as a SAP in DOT\u2019s alcohol misuse prevention programs. DOT said it rejected suggestions that the SAP definition include state-certified counselors because qualification standards varied dramatically by state and did not always result in state- certified counselors having the experience or training DOT deemed necessary to implement the objectives of its rules.", "However, the reasoning behind some other agency certification requirements that we examined was not as clearly documented or otherwise explained. These specific cases involved the selection of particular certification bodies, and organizations that were not selected raised questions about the criteria that the agencies used. One such example was VA\u2019s implementation of new procedures, effective July 1, 1997, generally requiring that newly hired physicians be board-certified in the clinical specialty in which they will practice. The VA Undersecretary for Health later specified that the only certifying bodies recognized by VA for this purpose would be the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) for allopathic physicians and the Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (BOS) for osteopathic specialists. Although the subsequent announcement indicated that the two organizations were \u201cumbrella organizations for approving medical specialty boards in the United States\u201d and described the importance of board certification, the announcement did not indicate why these organizations were selected. Another certifying organization (the American Association of Physician Specialists, Incorporated) and the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs then questioned why VA recognized only ABMS and BOS certifications. The Committee requested that VA provide the criteria used to evaluate and select those two organizations. In its response to the Committee, VA stated that certifying groups vary widely in their requirements and that ABMS and BOS are \u201cthe standard certifying organizations recognized throughout American medicine.\u201d However, VA did not further describe why it selected these two certifying organizations.", "VA officials told us during this review that they rely on consensus practices and standards of the health care profession in establishing certification requirements. They said VA\u2019s use of ABMS and BOS certifications can be traced back to a 1980 decision by the Chief Medical Director to accept ABMS and BOS physician board certifications for Incentive Special Pay purposes. In 1997, VA extended those same certifications that were required for special pay purposes to employment, \u201cgrandfathering\u201d currently employed physicians. VA officials also noted that they had canvassed other federal agencies involved in health care issues\u2014including the Department of Defense, the Public Health Service, NIH, CDC, and the Bureau of Prisons\u2014and found that essentially all recognized ABMS and BOS as the two accepted organizations for board certification purposes. The officials also described to us some of their expectations of a health professional certification program\u2014in essence, informal selection criteria. These included (1) accreditation for educational requirements (undergraduate, medical school, and residency program); (2) accreditation for post-residency experience; and (3) certifying exams in the area of specialty. Finally, they pointed out that by law, the Secretary for Veterans Affairs has special authority to make personnel decisions. Although the description that VA officials provided explains how ABMS and BOS were selected, it was not contained in any published document and did not explain what criteria other organizations would need to meet to be accepted by VA.", "Another agency certification decision that was not transparent to affected entities involved a 1996 NIH solicitation for the maintenance, certification, and decontamination of certain types of facilities and equipment, including biological safety cabinets. NIH implicitly designated NSF International as the sole certifying organization by including a requirement in the solicitation that the full-time on-site supervisor for specific locations be an NSF-accredited biohazard cabinet field certifier. NIH did not explain why only NSF accreditation was acceptable. As in the VA example, other certifying organizations that were not designated raised questions about the restriction to NSF\u2019s program. NIH officials told us during our review that NSF had the only accreditation program that was nationally recognized. The officials also pointed out that they applied the restrictive provision as narrowly as possible\u2014requiring accreditation only for supervisors\u2014while still addressing the agency\u2019s primary need to protect the safety of NIH personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Common Criteria Used to Select Certifying Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Agencies can make clear the criteria they used or plan to use to select a particular certification requirement or certifying organization in any number of ways.

For example, in most of these cases the agencies included discussions of elements such as the following: the structure, purpose, and other characteristics of the organization (e.g., its legal status and composition of the governing board); the resources and qualifications of the organization (e.g., technical competence of the staff, adequacy of management and quality control systems, and appropriate experience); the certification procedures or mechanisms used by the organization (e.g., public documentation, use of valid test or evaluation methods, enforcement of certification requirements, and appeals or due process procedures regarding certification decisions); and other factors (e.g., compatibility with or recognition of related certifications and the costs and fees associated with certification)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transparency Is Not Free or a Panacea", "paragraphs": ["However, transparency is not free.

He also noted that mechanisms are already in place to address concerns about restrictive solicitation provisions and said that agencies will probably hear from affected entities if the requirements are considered unreasonable and/or restrictive of competition. Finally, both he and DOT officials emphasized that no one uniform approach is appropriate in the varied conditions in which certifications are used.", "Also, transparency in an agency\u2019s certification requirements does not guarantee that the process will result in the best (or even a good) decision. Conversely, lack of transparency does not necessarily mean that an agency\u2019s certification decision will not be good or appropriate.

Without those requirements, federal agencies would have to independently evaluate the safety of products, whether certain procedures will yield the desired results, and whether individual workers possess the skills required to perform a given task.", "Federal agencies have broad latitude in the selection of certification requirements and certifying organizations, which can result in what appear to be inconsistencies of application. For example, five agencies might each require a different certification for the same type of product or service. Businesses that want to provide that product or service to each of the agencies would therefore have to incur the expense associated with obtaining five certifications. Also, an agency can accept certifications from one certifying organization while not accepting certifications in the same subject area from other organizations with what appear to be similar qualifications. Organizations that are not selected would then have to forgo any income associated with providing certifications for that agency.", "These apparent inconsistencies are exacerbated when the reasons behind the agencies\u2019 certification decisions are unclear. Transparency of these decisions could improve their perceived legitimacy, particularly when more than one certification option is available to an agency. The means by which agencies\u2019 certification decisions can be made transparent will depend on the context in which the requirements are imposed. For example, if an agency\u2019s certification requirement is part of a procurement action, the agency can make clear the basis of that requirement in the request for proposals. Some agencies have also used the rulemaking process to delineate the rationale behind their certification requirement decisions. However, although contracting and rulemaking processes are convenient mechanisms for certification transparency, they are not always available because some certification requirements do not arise in either environment.", "The extent to which agencies\u2019 certification requirements need to be explained will also depend on the circumstances surrounding the certification requirement. For example, only a brief explanation should be necessary when an agency picks a certifying organization that is generally acknowledged to be the only such organization available. On the other hand, a more elaborate explanation may be necessary when an agency selects one organization over others with what appear to be similar qualifications. In that case, transparency can also help organizations not selected to understand what they must do to meet the agency\u2019s requirements.", "The forthcoming guidance being developed by NIST for the Secretary of Commerce may help bring more uniformity to the certification process, thereby making that process more intelligible to contractors, regulated parties, and other entities affected by the requirements. However, NIST officials said that the draft guidance does not directly address the issue of certification transparency.
