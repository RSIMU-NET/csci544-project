Concerns have been raised about the challenges VA may face in maintaining its VA CRNA workforce. GAO (1) identified VA CRNA workforce challenges that VA medical facilities may experience related to VA CRNAs, (2) identified the key mechanisms that VA medical facilities can use to recruit and retain VA CRNAs, and (3) determined the extent to which facilities use the key mechanisms. To identify VA CRNA workforce challenges, GAO analyzed Web-based surveys it sent to VA chief anesthesiologists, VA human resources officers, and VA CRNAs, with survey response rates of 92, 85, and 76 percent, respectively. GAO also identified the key mechanisms VA medical facilities can use to recruit and retain VA CRNAs and the extent that these mechanisms are used."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities have challenges in recruiting and retaining VA CRNAs for their workforce. About three-fourths of all VA medical facility chief anesthesiologists responding to GAO's survey reported that they had difficulty recruiting VA CRNAs. The challenge recruiting VA CRNAs has made it difficult to fill existing VA CRNA vacancies at VA medical facilities. Overall, 54 percent of VA medical facility chief anesthesiologists reported temporarily closing some operating rooms and 72 percent reported delaying some elective surgeries. VA's retention challenge comes from a projected substantial attrition rate. Based on the results of its survey, GAO projects that 26 percent of VA's CRNAs will either retire from or leave VA in the next 5 years. VA medical facility officials reported in GAO's survey that the recruitment and retention challenges are caused primarily by the low level of VA CRNA salaries when compared with CRNA salaries in local market areas. VA has three key mechanisms its medical facilities can use to recruit and retain VA CRNAs. VA medical facilities can give bonuses to VA CRNAs--recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses. In addition, VA has education payment programs that provide funding to cover CRNA education costs. Finally, medical facilities can also use VA's locality pay system (LPS) to determine whether to adjust VA CRNA salaries to help the facilities remain competitive with CRNA salaries in local market areas. Each of the three key recruitment and retention mechanisms--bonuses, education payment programs, and VA's LPS--are used by some VA medical facilities. GAO found that in fiscal years 2005 or 2006, just over one-third of VA medical facilities that hired VA CRNAs gave recruitment bonuses. For VA medical facilities that have VA CRNAs, less than one-third gave retention bonuses in fiscal years 2005 or 2006. In addition, all VA CRNAs that applied for funds to attend a CRNA school or to offset their educational debt and were eligible received these funds in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. GAO also found that more than half of VA medical facilities used VA's LPS to determine whether to adjust VA CRNA salaries in 2005 and in 2006. However, in the eight VA medical facilities visited, GAO found that although the facilities used VA's LPS, the majority of them did not fully follow VA's LPS policy correctly in either 2005 or 2006. Officials at these facilities did not always know or were not aware of certain aspects of the LPS policy, and VA has not provided training on the LPS to VA medical facility officials since the policy was changed in 2001. As a result, VA medical facility officials have not received LPS training that reflects VA's current LPS policy, and accordingly, cannot ensure that VA CRNA salaries have been adjusted as needed to be competitive. Although VA is in the process of developing a Web-based training course for the LPS, the department has not established a time frame for finalizing the development and implementation of this training course."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) provide the majority of  anesthesia care veterans receive in medical facilities operated by the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). CRNAs are registered nurses who  have completed a 2 to 3 year master\u2019s degree program in nurse anesthesia  and who typically provide anesthesia care in health care settings with  anesthesiologists and surgeons. There are approximately 500 VA-employed  CRNAs (VA CRNA) who provide anesthesia care to veterans in VA medical  facilities. The demand for CRNAs in VA medical facilities has continued to  increase because CRNAs are no longer used only in the operating room,  but are used in other areas of a medical facility, such as administering  anesthesia to patients who are undergoing cardiac catheterization and  providing airway management to patients during cardiac emergencies.", "While the demand for CRNAs is anticipated to increase, many VA CRNAs  are nearing retirement eligibility age. According to VA officials, more than  half of VA CRNAs are over the age of 51, and the average VA CRNA is   7 years closer to retirement eligibility than the average CRNA nationally.  Because CRNAs provide the majority of anesthesia services in VA medical  facilities and facility officials have reported problems with recruiting and  retaining VA CRNAs, concerns have been raised about the challenges VA  may face in maintaining its VA CRNA workforce, particularly in some local  market areas where the labor market for CRNAs can be highly  competitive.", "You asked that we review VA\u2019s efforts to recruit and retain VA CRNAs.

The first survey, administered to VA CRNAs, obtained a  response rate of 76 percent and allowed us to determine whether these VA  CRNAs plan to retire or leave VA\u2019s health care system within the next   5 years. The second survey was administered to VA medical facilities\u2019 chief  anesthesiologists and obtained a 92 percent response rate, and the third  survey was administered to VA human resources (HR) officers and  obtained an 85 percent response rate. We used the second and third  surveys to identify the issues VA medical facilities face when recruiting  and retaining VA CRNAs. We also analyzed data on VA CRNA vacancies\u2014 the number of unfilled VA CRNA positions at VA medical facilities\u2014 obtained from VA headquarters. These data were from 2005, the most  recent year for which vacancy data were available. Additionally, we  obtained data on VA CRNAs\u2019 salaries for 2005, 2006, and 2007 and  compared these to salary data we obtained from the American Association  of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA), a professional organization for CRNAs, to  determine whether VA medical facilities\u2019 salaries for VA CRNAs are  competitive with CRNA salaries in local market areas. We interviewed a  representative from Kaiser Permanente, a large health care plan that  primarily uses CRNAs to deliver anesthesia services, to identify what steps  this health plan takes to ensure it has a sufficient number of CRNAs and to  determine the indicators this plan uses to identify a CRNA shortage or  potential future CRNA shortage.", "To ensure the reliability of the data we used, we interviewed VA and  AANA officials about the quality checks and edits they performed on their  data. In addition, we assessed the data obtained from our three Web-based  surveys by performing a systematic review of the returned questionnaires.", "On the basis of our assessment we determined these data were adequate  for our purposes.", "To determine the key mechanisms that VA medical facilities use to recruit  and retain VA CRNAs, we reviewed VA\u2019s policies and directives related to  VA CRNAs and obtained reports on VA CRNAs\u2019 salaries, bonuses,  education programs, and qualification standards. We interviewed officials  at VA headquarters and selected VA medical facilities. To determine the  extent to which VA medical facilities use key mechanisms to recruit and  retain VA CRNAs, we visited eight VA medical facilities located in Denver,  Colorado; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York;  Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Tampa, Florida; and Togus, Maine.  We selected these facilities because they are geographically dispersed  across the country and employ VA CRNAs. At each VA medical facility we  visited, we interviewed chief anesthesiologists, VA CRNAs, HR officers,  and other facility officials and asked them about their efforts to recruit and  retain VA CRNAs. We also analyzed data obtained from our three Web- based surveys to determine the extent to which VA medical facilities use  the key mechanisms to recruit and retain VA CRNAs.

Anesthesiologists are physicians who have  completed medical school and typically a 4-year anesthesiology residency.  Both anesthesiologists and CRNAs administer anesthesia for all types of  surgical procedures, working either as single providers or together.  Anesthesia services can be provided by anesthesiologists alone, by  anesthesiologists working with CRNAs, by CRNAs alone, or by  anesthesiologist assistants (AA), working under the supervision of an  anesthesiologist. AAs are graduates of a medical-school-based AA  education program. (See app. V for the education and training  requirements for anesthesiologists, CRNAs, and AAs.)", "The nurse anesthetist profession has made efforts to meet the demand for  CRNA services in the public and private health care sectors. The  profession has increased the number of accredited CRNA training  programs, and as a result the number of CRNA graduates has increased\u2014 over 2,000 graduates in 2007, 57 percent more than in the year 2000. The  growth in the demand for CRNAs is expected to continue.", "A joint Department of Defense (DOD)/VA program in nurse anesthesia  education was established in 2004 at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio,  Texas. This 30-month program, run by the United States Army, educates  military personnel and VA registered nurses to become CRNAs. New VA  CRNAs who complete this program have a 3-year service obligation to VA  upon graduation.", "When hiring VA CRNAs, VA places them in one of five pay grades, based  on the CRNA\u2019s education and experience. VA\u2019s qualification standards for  VA CRNAs establish the five grades with grade I being the lowest. The  grades ultimately determine the salary for each VA CRNA working in a VA  medical facility. Within each grade, there are a number of steps\u2014generally  12\u2014that represent progressive increments of a 3 percent increase in salary  within the grade. For example, the salary of a VA CRNA that is at grade II,  step 2, is 3 percent more than a VA CRNA\u2019s salary at grade II, step 1. VA  CRNA qualification standards indicate that new graduate VA CRNAs  usually begin at grade I, receiving a lower salary because of the lack of  work experience, whereas experienced VA CRNAs might start at grade II  or III receiving a higher salary. VA medical facilities\u2019 salaries for a VA  CRNA at a grade I, step 1, range from a low of $37,432 to a high of $104,575  in market areas where salaries are higher.", "VA CRNAs typically work under the medical direction of a chief  anesthesiologist, who is responsible for supervising anesthesia clinical  staff, such as other anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists. Chief  anesthesiologists are responsible for the quality and safety of anesthesia  services provided in the medical facility. VA CRNA benefits and other  personnel issues, such as hiring and setting base salaries, are managed by  VA medical facilities\u2019 HR officers. HR officers are also responsible for  issues related to compensation, employee and labor relations, recruitment,  and performance management.", "VA medical facilities have clinical staff that are trained to provide different  types of health care services. In many cases, the ability to provide health  care services to veterans is dependent on the availability of numerous  types of clinical staff that work in concert with one another to provide  these services. If one of these types of staff is not available, the health care  service may be delayed or not provided. For example, even though a  CRNA is available to provide anesthesia services, if other personnel, such  as operating room nurses or nurses that staff the post-anesthesia recovery  unit, are not available, the surgical procedure may be delayed or cancelled.  Likewise, if a CRNA, or other professional anesthesia staff, are not  available, the surgical procedure may have to be delayed or cancelled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Medical Facilities Have VA CRNA Recruitment and Retention Challenges Partly Because of Noncompetitive Salaries", "paragraphs": ["VA medical facilities have challenges recruiting and retaining VA CRNAs.

Each of the  three surveys contained questions that helped us identify current and  future challenges that VA medical facilities will experience in recruiting  and retaining VA CRNAs. The first survey was administered in December  2006 to 474 VA CRNAs. We contacted officials at all VA medical facilities  to determine whether they employed VA CRNAs both on a full-time or  part-time basis, and for those that did, obtained e-mail addresses for the  VA CRNAs. We verified our list of VA CRNAs with a list obtained from  VA\u2019s Personnel Accounting Integrated Data system, which houses VA\u2019s  payroll and human resources (HR) information. This survey of VA CRNAs  covered various workforce issues, including their plans to retire or leave  VA\u2019s health care system, the use of contract CRNAs to supplement VA  CRNAs, and recruitment and retention of VA CRNAs. The survey had an  overall response rate of 76 percent, which allowed us to generalize to the  VA CRNA population.

These salary  schedules contained the VA CRNA salary rates for grades I through V and  steps 1 to 12 for each of the grades. Using these salary schedules, we  compared VA CRNA salaries with CRNA salary data we obtained from the  American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA), a professional  organization for CRNAs. AANA\u2019s salary data for CRNAs was compiled in  its 2006 Practice Profile Survey\u2014a national survey of AANA\u2019s  membership\u2014and included self-reported 2005 salary information that was  reported by state.

We used the 90th percentile  AANA CRNA salary in each state for this comparison because this  percentile represents the higher end of the salary range for the local  market area. In addition, we compared VA CRNA qualification standards  to VA\u2019s proposed revision, which would increase starting salaries for new  graduate VA CRNAs from grade I to grade II. We compared 2007 VA CRNA  salary schedules at the grade II level for each facility to AANA\u2019s CRNA  salary data for each state in which a VA medical facility is located to  determine whether grade II salaries would be competitive with local  market area salaries.
