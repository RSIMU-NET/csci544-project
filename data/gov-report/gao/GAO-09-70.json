In February 2007, USCIS completed a study to determine the full costs of its operations and the level at which application fees should be set to recover those costs. USCIS's new fee schedule increased application fees by a weighted average of 86 percent. Almost 96 percent of USCIS's fiscal year 2008 budget of $2.6 billion was expected to have come from fees.

The methodology USCIS used in its review, however, did not consistently adhere to federal accounting standards and principles and other guidance. While federal accounting standards allow flexibility for agencies to develop managerial cost accounting practices that are suited to their needs, they also provide certain specific guidance based on sound cost accounting concepts. USCIS's methodology, for example, did not include the costs paid by other federal entities on behalf of USCIS. Federal standards and guidance also call for documentation that is sufficient to allow an understanding of and provide justification for the cost assignment processes and data used. USCIS did not adequately document the detailed processes used or sufficiently justify assumptions used in allocating costs to various activities on a prorated basis. As a result, USCIS could not show that its methods provided a reasonable distribution of the costs to the various types of applications. For instance, USCIS allocated $732 million of overhead costs (or 31 percent of total costs)--including information technology operations and maintenance--to offices based on the number of staff full-time equivalents (FTE) in each office. However, USCIS's documentation did not sufficiently justify (1) why cost allocation was used instead of other possible methods or (2) why it did not include about 6,100 contract workers and used only approximately 7,900 FTEs of the total federal FTEs of about 10,400 as the basis for allocation. USCIS also did not adequately justify the equal assignment of activity costs representing 51 percent of total costs to each application type. While such pro rata assignment of costs may be a reasonable method in some circumstances, USCIS did not document its justification for the assumptions made when deciding which costs to allocate on a prorated basis and how those costs should be allocated. Because of these inconsistencies with federal accounting standards and principles and other guidance, USCIS cannot support the reasonableness of cost assignments to the various application types. USCIS has implemented accountability mechanisms to track the use of both regular application fees as well as premium processing fees intended for specific projects. USCIS plans to use its premium processing fee collections to fund its transformation program to make long-term improvements to its business processes and technology. Through its monitoring of fee collection procedures, USCIS has identified some weaknesses at one of its service centers. It has taken actions to strengthen service center controls in the short term, and it is moving all fee receipt functions and the application processing done in preparation for adjudication to lockbox facilities to further strengthen control over collections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for granting or  denying immigration benefits to individuals seeking to become citizens of  the United States or to study, work, or live in this country.

About 6 million  applications and petitions for immigration and naturalization benefits,  along with applicable fee payments, are submitted to USCIS annually.  USCIS adjudicators process applications and petitions in four general  categories:family-based petitions\u2014for close relatives to immigrate, gain permanent  residence, or work in the United States;   employment-based petitions\u2014for current and prospective employees to  immigrate to or stay in the United States temporarily;   asylum and refugee applications\u2014for those seeking asylum or refugee    naturalization applications\u2014for those who wish to become United States  citizens.", "USCIS is authorized to collect fees for providing adjudication and  naturalization services at a level that will (1) ensure recovery of the full  costs of providing all such services, including the costs of similar services  provided without charge to asylum applicants, and (2) recover any  additional costs associated with the administration of the fees collected.  In 1968, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), USCIS\u2019s  predecessor agency, began charging fees for immigration and  naturalization services, depositing the fee collections into the General  Fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. In 1988, Congress  established the IEFA. Since 1989, application fees have been deposited in  the IEFA, which is currently USCIS\u2019s primary source of funding. Once  deposited in the IEFA, the fees remain available to USCIS until expended.  In fiscal year 1991, Congress directed that the IEFA also be used to fund  the cost of asylum and refugee services and adjudication services provided  to some immigrants at no charge, and thus, the charges for fee-paying  applicants were increased to recover these costs.", "In December 2000, Congress authorized the establishment of a premium  processing program for employment-based applications. INS proposed the  establishment of a premium processing service to provide businesses with  a high level of customer service and improved processing because it could  not otherwise meet the demand for expeditious service to the business  community without an adverse impact on other applications. According to  the INS Commissioner, an optional additional fee of $1,000 for business  customers would also make capital available for infrastructure  improvements. In response, Congress authorized the premium processing  service; set the fee at $1,000, which is to be paid in addition to the regular  application fee; and specified that it be used to provide accelerated  processing services to business customers and to make infrastructure  improvements in the adjudications and customer service processes. The  premium processing service is to provide processing of certain  employment-based petitions and applications within 15 calendar days of  receipt of the request for premium processing service form. Premium  processing fees also are deposited in the IEFA to be available until  expended.", "Currently, funding for USCIS comes from three fee accounts, direct  appropriations, and reimbursements from other federal agencies.

Lockbox facilities are responsible for  mail room operations, data entry, fee collection, setting up files, and  sending the files to a service center or the National Benefits Center for  adjudication. In 2007, in consultation with USCIS, FMS designated the  bank that operates the Chicago lockbox as the financial agent responsible  for all USCIS fee collections.

These additional requirements include    service enhancements ($134.8 million), such as staff and training, which  according to USCIS, would provide a small surge production capacity to  give it the flexibility to adapt to temporary increases in filings and the  ability to incrementally work to marginally shorten processing times and  improve service delivery over time;   security and integrity enhancements ($152 million), such as establishing a  second card production facility to support day-to-day production and to  comply with federal standards for contingency planning to ensure that  critical systems remain available in the event of catastrophic failure;    humanitarian program enhancements ($14 million) to fully fund the Cuban  Haitian Entrant Program; and infrastructure enhancements ($223.4 million), such as strengthening  administrative support activities and upgrading and maintaining the  information technology environment to sustain current operations.", "As discussed in the next section (see also fig. 1), USCIS classified its total  estimated costs as either direct or overhead. According to USCIS, direct  costs were assigned to field offices or activities based on an identified  relationship between the cost component and the field office or activity.  Overhead costs were allocated to field offices primarily based on the  number of FTEs assigned to each field office.

These costs were allocated to the  applications separately as described below. USCIS assigned the remaining  $1.814 billion of activity costs to the expected 4.742 million fee-paying  applications, resulting in a processing cost for each application type.  USCIS then allocated the costs of asylum and refugee services and fee  waiver and exemptions in equal dollar amounts as surcharges to each  application\u2019s processing cost to arrive at a total cost for each application  type. USCIS set each application fee based on this total cost. The   $174 million of \u201ccapture biometrics\u201d activity costs were allocated evenly to  the estimated 2.196 million fee-paying applications, resulting in a separate  and equal biometrics fee for each application that would require biometric  services.

USCIS  officials told us that they only included costs that the agency paid directly,  which met management\u2019s objective to set fees that recover funds sufficient  to cover USCIS\u2019s costs. However according to federal accounting  standards, each entity\u2019s full cost also should incorporate the cost of goods  and services that it receives from other entities free of charge. This is  especially important for executive agencies when the costs constitute  inputs to government goods or services provided to nonfederal entities for  a fee or user charge because executive agencies should recover the full  costs. OMB Circular No. A-25, which provides guidance for executive  agencies on assessment of user charges, states that when not in conflict  with the fee-authorizing statutes, and unless the agency has been granted  an exception to the general policy, fees should be sufficient to recover the  full cost of providing a service, which includes all costs to any part of the  federal government, including accrued retirement costs not covered by  employee contributions and the costs of collection. In other words, costs  should be included regardless of which agency pays them. Congress  authorized, but did not require, USCIS to recover full costs. The document  USCIS prepared to describe its methodology stated that it adhered to the  principles in OMB Circular No. A-25, but in the final rule for the fee  adjustment, USCIS also made clear that its fees would recover only the  costs of USCIS\u2019 operations. Although not inconsistent with the legislation  authorizing the fees, the scope of the costs to be recovered by USCIS, as  announced in USCIS\u2019s final rule, is inconsistent with the general guidance  in OMB Circular No. A-25. USCIS did not document in its final rule, which  it indicated OMB had reviewed, or elsewhere the rationale for excluding  non-USCIS costs from its fee review, including whether or how it  considered the executive branch policy in OMB Circular No. A-25 on  recovering full costs and other factors.", "At the time of the fee review, USCIS had not estimated the cost of lockbox  services provided by Treasury\u2019s FMS. At our request, FMS provided  information showing that it compensated two lockbox providers   $20 million for services provided to USCIS in fiscal year 2007. USCIS  included $2 million of these lockbox costs in the estimate of its costs of  immigration application processing and adjudication services. According  to a USCIS official, these costs were related to changes the lockbox  facility had to make to its systems controls, for example, to accommodate  additional data elements required by USCIS in application forms. Although  the $18 million lockbox costs excluded is not a material amount in relation  to the current $2.329 billion total costs estimated by USCIS, this lockbox  cost is expected to grow significantly in the future as USCIS executes its  plan to move the preadjudication processing activities, including fee  collection, from service centers and field offices to lockbox facilities by  March 2011. In fiscal year 2007, approximately 23 percent of fee  collections were at the lockbox facilities, while almost 68 percent were at  service centers.", "Legislative authority exists for FMS payment for lockbox services. FMS  pays lockbox costs pursuant to its responsibility for collecting revenues  coming into the federal government and for providing specialized receipt  and disbursement services for federal agencies. FMS officials told us that  federal agencies do not pay for receipting, custody, and disbursement of  federal funds by FMS on the agencies\u2019 behalf because these services are  FMS\u2019s responsibility. According to FMS officials, agencies are to  reimburse FMS only for the costs of services that are considered unique to  that particular agency. USCIS and FMS signed an interagency agreement  in September 2008 that establishes reimbursement levels for onetime and  annual costs that USCIS will pay to FMS. These costs represent the  portion of FMS\u2019s lockbox costs that are unique to USCIS.", "In addition, USCIS did not include in its estimated costs of immigration  application processing and adjudication services some of the costs of  retirement benefits\u2014pensions and health and life insurance\u2014to be paid  by OPM on behalf of USCIS. Based on its fiscal year 2007 costs, USCIS  estimated that the average annual projected cost for these benefits for  fiscal years 2008 and 2009 is $47 million before taking into consideration  the agency\u2019s 14 percent increase in the number of employees from May  2007 to May 2008 and 16 percent increase in related payroll costs.", "Together, the estimated more than $65 million of FMS and OPM costs  excluded each year represents approximately $14 per fee-paying  application for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. This estimate could differ  among application types if these costs were analyzed more precisely.", "Without consideration of these costs paid by other federal entities, USCIS  is not accounting for the full costs to the federal government of USCIS\u2019s  immigration application processing and adjudication services, and USCIS\u2019s  cost data used for setting fees are incomplete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Did Not Sufficiently Justify the Use of Less Precise Cost Assignment Methods", "paragraphs": ["The methodology USCIS used to determine the cost and develop the fees  for each application type involved various assumptions and cost  assignment methods. In large part, it consisted of allocating costs on a  prorated basis. USCIS did not prepare and document analyses to justify its  assumptions that prorated allocations provided a reasonable distribution  of those costs. While federal accounting standards do not prohibit  allocating costs on a prorated basis, they list an order of preference for  three cost assignment methods that should be used: (1) direct tracing of  costs wherever economically feasible, in this case, to an identifiable  office, activity, or application type; (2) assigning costs on a cause-and- effect basis; or (3) allocating costs on a reasonable and consistent basis  when not economically feasible to assign costs directly or on a cause-and- effect basis. The standards also state that the third preference, allocation,  tends to be arbitrary because there may be little correlation between the  costs and the allocation base, and costing distortions often result from  arbitrary allocations. Minimizing arbitrary cost allocations will improve  cost information. Nevertheless, the standards allow flexibility so that  management can select methods that are best suited to the organization\u2019s  needs. The standards also state that when making the selection,  management should evaluate alternative costing methods and select those  that provide the best results under its operating environment.", "In the first stage of assigning the estimated $2.329 billion annual  application processing and adjudication services costs for fiscal years 2008  and 2009 (see fig. 1), USCIS officials identified $1.405 billion of direct costs  and $924 million in overhead costs. USCIS considered as overhead the  majority of costs of headquarters functions and some field office functions  and centrally managed costs such as rent and information technology  operations and maintenance. Of the $924 million of overhead costs,   $732 million\u201431 percent of the total $2.329 billion cost\u2014was allocated to  field offices based on the number of FTEs assigned to each field office.  This approach did not consider USCIS\u2019s approximately 6,100 contract  workers and used only approximately 7,900 FTEs of the total federal FTEs  of about 10,400 as the basis for distributing overhead costs. Excluding the  contract workers from the base could have changed the proportion of  overhead costs assigned to the various field offices which introduces the  potential for an additional significant effect on the allocation of those  costs to activities and application types.", "Minimizing arbitrary cost allocations will improve cost information.  Alternatives to USCIS\u2019s FTE-based allocation of overhead to field offices  might have included direct or cause-and-effect assignment. For example,  software licenses for applications used by only a specific office or activity  and training for specific employee groups might have been assigned  directly to offices or activities causing, or driving, each of those costs  rather than allocating all of them in the aggregate with other overhead  costs to all field offices on the basis of FTEs. In addition, other costs, such  as information technology operations, that were attributable to a  particular field office or activity might have been assigned using a cause- and-effect analysis, such as consumption of services, rather than a pro rata  FTE-based allocation.", "Federal accounting standards state that allocation should have a  reasonable basis, usually a relevant common denominator. USCIS costs  that cannot be assigned directly or on a cause-and-effect basis to specific  field offices or activities in an economically feasible manner might have an  alternative allocation basis that is more closely related to the attributes of  those specific costs than to FTEs. For example, using payroll for certain  employee benefits or usage for certain information technology costs might  have provided a more accurate or reasonable basis for cost distribution  than an FTE-based allocation. Without performing and documenting  analyses to evaluate such alternatives, USCIS management cannot assure  itself or others that it is using the optimal cost allocation method.", "Field office overhead and direct costs were assigned to eight discrete  activities (see table 5) related to processing and adjudicating applications.  (See fig. 1.) The activity costs were then assigned to types of applications.  As part of this process, USCIS assigned 49 percent (or about   $1.143 billion) of total costs to total fee-paying applications based on the  amount of time it took to adjudicate an application, resulting in varying  costs per application type for the adjudication activity. The adjudication  time used as the basis for assigning these activity costs to types of  applications was based on historical data on adjudication time from PAS,  which measures the average time to complete adjudication of each  application based on daily production information input by adjudicators.  Thus, for the \u201cmake determination\u201d activity, the more complex types of  applications that take more time to adjudicate were assigned a higher cost,  which resulted in a higher fee. This is consistent with the methodology\u2019s  general premise, which according to USCIS is that the more time spent  adjudicating an application, the higher the fee.
