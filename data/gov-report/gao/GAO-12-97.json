The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) sought to strengthen the connection between workforce programs and employers, but GAO's prior work has found that collaboration remains a challenge. With WIA currently awaiting reauthorization, GAO reviewed (1) factors that facilitated innovative collaborations among workforce boards, employers, and others; (2) major challenges to collaboration; and (3) actions the Department of Labor (Labor) has taken to support local collaborative efforts. GAO examined 14 local initiatives identified by experts as among the most promising or innovative efforts in which local workforce boards collaborated effectively with employers and other partners to achieve positive results. GAO interviewed representatives of the 14 initiatives and officials from five federal agencies. GAO also reviewed reports on the initiatives and relevant federal laws, regulations, and other documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Workforce board officials and their partners in the 14 initiatives cited a range of factors that facilitated building innovative collaborations. Almost all of the collaborations grew out of efforts to address urgent workforce needs of multiple employers in a specific sector, such as health care, manufacturing, or agriculture, rather than focusing on individual employers. Additionally, the partners in these initiatives made extra effort to understand and work with employers so they could tailor services such as jobseeker assessment, screening, and training to address specific employer needs. For example, in Greensboro, North Carolina, board staff provided expedited services for an aircraft company that just moved to the area by designing a web-based recruitment tool and customized assessment process within 48 hours and screening over 2,400 initial applicants. In all the initiatives, partners remained engaged in these collaborative efforts because they continued to produce a wide range of reported results, such as an increased supply of skilled labor, job placements, reduced employer recruitment and turnover costs, and averted layoffs. For example, in Cincinnati, Ohio, employers who participated in the health care initiative realized almost $5,000 in estimated cost savings per worker hired, mainly due to lower turnover and recruitment costs, according to an independent study.", "While these boards were successful in their efforts, they cited some challenges to collaboration that they needed to overcome. Some boards were challenged to develop comprehensive strategies to address diverse employer needs with WIA funds. For example, some boards' staff said that while their initiatives sought to meet employer needs for higher-skilled workers through skill upgrades, WIA funds can be used to train current workers only in limited circumstances, and the boards used other funding sources to do so. Staff from most, but not all, boards also said that WIA performance measures do not reflect their efforts to engage employers. Many of these boards used their own measures to assess their services to employers, such as the number of new employers served each year or the hiring rate for jobseekers they refer to employers.", "Labor has taken various steps to support local collaborations, such as conducting webinars and issuing guidance on pertinent topics, and contributing to a new $37 million grant program to facilitate innovative regional collaborations. Many of the boards we reviewed cited leveraging resources as a key to facilitating collaboration. However, while Labor has collected information on effective practices for leveraging resources, it has not compiled this information and made it easy to access."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To better support the capacity of the local workforce investment system to collaborate with employers and other partners, Labor should compile information on workforce boards that effectively leverage WIA funds with other funding sources and disseminate this information in a readily accessible manner.

Yet the nation continues to face challenges in closing the gap  between the skills present in the workforce and the skills needed for  available jobs. While federally funded workforce programs are designed  to cultivate a stronger workforce, there is growing recognition that these  programs need to better collaborate with employers to align services and  training with employers\u2019 needs. In overhauling the nation\u2019s fragmented  employment and training programs, the Workforce Investment Act of  1998 (WIA) envisioned such collaboration by focusing on employers as  well as jobseekers, establishing a \u201cdual customer\u201d approach. To create a  single, comprehensive workforce system, WIA required that four federal  agencies\u2014the Departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human  Services, and Housing and Urban Development\u2014provide access to 16 of  their programs through local one-stop centers across the country. To  align federally supported training and employment programs more closely  with local labor market needs, WIA established a system through which  local workforce investment boards develop policy and oversee service  delivery for local areas within a state, and required that local business  representatives constitute the majority membership on these boards.", "Despite the vision of collaboration between local employers and the  workforce investment system, however, we and others have found that it  can be challenging. For example, in previous reports, we found that some  employers have limited interaction with or knowledge of this system\u2014the  approximately 1,800 local one-stop centers that provide access to all  required programs and the local workforce boards that oversee these  centers\u2014and that employers who do use the one-stop centers mainly do  so to fill their needs for low-skilled workers. Others have found that  collaboration is challenging because it requires staff time and resources  to build credibility with employers.", "With WIA currently awaiting reauthorization, you requested that we  identify and describe promising practices for collaboration between  workforce investment boards, employers, education providers, and others  that have demonstrated positive results. Specifically, we examined (1) the  factors that facilitated innovative collaborations among workforce boards,  employers, and others; (2) the major challenges to collaboration; and (3)  what actions the Department of Labor (Labor) has taken to support local  workforce boards in their collaborative efforts.", "To conduct this work, we asked officials from five federal agencies and  national experts on workforce and economic development issues  representing 20 organizations to nominate what they viewed as the most  promising or innovative initiatives in which local workforce boards  collaborated effectively with employers and other partners to achieve  positive results. In addition to the Departments of Labor, Education,  Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development,  which administer one-stop programs, we also requested nominations  from the Department of Commerce (Commerce), which administers key  economic development programs. We selected the experts from the 20  organizations for their knowledge of workforce development or economic  development activities at the local level.", "More than 89 initiatives or sponsoring organizations from 28 states were  nominated, and we selected 14 initiatives in 13 local areas for in-depth  review. The criteria for our selection included the number of nominations  for each initiative, diversity of federal funding sources, variety of local  unemployment rates, evidence of replicability, and geographical diversity,  among others. We conducted semi-structured interviews with local and  state workforce officials, representatives of educational institutions,  training providers, economic development officials, employers, and  others. We conducted in-person interviews in seven local areas and  conducted interviews in the other areas by phone or video  teleconference. In some cases, we also toured training facilities and  workplaces. Our findings regarding the 14 initiatives are not generalizable  to other local workforce boards. In addition, we conducted interviews with  officials of Labor and Commerce, as well as representatives of workforce  associations such as the National Association of Workforce Boards. We  also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and other documents  pertaining to the key federal programs. See appendix I for more  information on our scope and methodology. We conducted our work  between November 2010 and January 2012 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

One-stop centers serve two customers\u2014job seekers and  employers\u2014and WIA provided flexibility to states and local areas to  develop approaches that best meet local needs.", "In its redesign of the system, WIA created three new programs\u2014Adult,  Dislocated Workers, and Youth\u2014that provide a broad range of services  including job search assistance, assessment, and training for eligible  individuals. The WIA programs provide for three levels of service for  adults and dislocated workers\u2014core, intensive, and training. Core  services include basic services such as job search and labor market  information; intensive services include activities such as comprehensive  assessments and case management.

Labor is responsible for providing  guidance to states and localities on delivering services through the one- stop system, and states, through state workforce boards, have a number  of responsibilities for the workforce system statewide, such as developing  state plans.", "WIA requires that each state have one or more local workforce  investment areas (designated by state governors), each governed by a  local workforce investment board. To help align employment and training  programs with the needs of employers, WIA requires that local boards  include representatives from one-stop partner programs, local educational  entities, labor organizations, community-based organizations, and  economic development agencies. It also requires that a majority of the  members be representatives of local businesses and that the local board  chairman be a representative of a local business. Through these  requirements, WIA gave business representatives a key role in deciding  how services should be provided and overseeing operations at one-stop  centers.", "Local workforce boards are also responsible for coordinating workforce  investment activities with economic development strategies, and  developing relationships with employers. The local workforce boards  also select the entities to operate one-stop centers and conduct oversight  of the one-stop system. In addition to the mandatory programs, local  workforce boards have the flexibility to include other programs in the one- stop system.

For  example, virtually all of these collaborations grew out of efforts to address  critical workforce needs of multiple employers, typically in a specific  sector, rather than focusing on individual employers. Additionally, the  partners in these initiatives made extra effort to understand and work with  employers so they could tailor services such as jobseeker assessment,  screening, and training to address specific employer needs. In all cases,  the partnerships included workforce boards, employers, and education  and training providers, and in some cases, they also included local school  districts, regional organizations that promoted economic development,  state agencies, or labor unions. Partners remained engaged in these  collaborative efforts because they continued to produce a range of results  for employers, jobseekers and workers, and the workforce system and  other partners.", "Workforce boards, employers, education and training providers, and other  partners in the 14 initiatives focused on urgent and commonly shared  employer needs that served as a catalyst for collaboration. Virtually all of the  initiatives focused on ways to supply workforce skills that were commonly  needed by multiple employers in a specific sector. The urgency of their  needs ranged from a shortage of critical skills in health care and  manufacturing to the threat of layoffs and business closures (see table 2). In  San Bernardino, California, for example, some companies were at risk of  layoffs and closures because of declining sales and other conditions, unless  they received services that included retraining for their workers. Also, in  Rochester, Minnesota, the turnover rates at long-term care facilities  threatened their ability to comply with state regulations and remain open. In  one case, in Gainesville, Florida, employers joined with the board and others  to tackle the need to create additional jobs by embarking on an initiative to  develop entrepreneurial skills. See appendix II for a profile of each initiative.", "In most cases, workforce boards worked with employers and other  partners to determine the scope of the problem, which galvanized the  partners\u2019 commitment to collaborate. In Northern Virginia, for example,  officials told us that, individually, local hospitals were experiencing  difficulties recruiting skilled workers and anticipated that their needs  would become more acute due to pending retirements among their  existing workers. However, until the initiative, there had been no attempt  to quantify the staffing needs overall among the hospitals. The partners  commissioned a study which projected a shortage of 17,000 nurses and  other health care workers in 23 occupations\u2014a finding that reinforced the  partners\u2019 commitment to collaborate on a common strategy, according to  local officials. In some initiatives, the partners obtained information about  employers\u2019 needs through studies or a focus group. In a few cases,  boards used previously developed state models to engage employers in  specific industries and regions and identify information about their critical  workforce needs. For example, in both Seattle and southeast Michigan,  employers participated in models\u2014known as \u201cSkill Panels\u201d or \u201cSkills  Alliances\u201d\u2014that Washington State and Michigan had developed for this  purpose.", "By focusing on common employer needs across a sector, the boards and  their partners also produced innovative labor force solutions that, in  several cases, had evaded employers who were trying to address their  needs individually, according to those we interviewed. In several cases,  employers cited the recruitment costs they incurred by competing against  each other for the same workers. By working together to develop the local  labor pool they needed, the employers were able to reduce recruitment  costs in some cases. Describing the competitive approach to labor supply  that had prevailed before collaboration, one employer said, \u201cWhen we  steal staff , we don\u2019t add people to the workforce, and it  increases the cost of doing business.\u201d", "In addition to finding common ground among employers, some initiatives  also forged greater collaboration among education and training providers.  As with the employers, the focus on common needs galvanized support,  leading the educational institutions in some cases to share curricula or  agree to recognize courses offered by other participating institutions. For  example, in southeast Michigan\u2019s initiative in automotive manufacturing,  education partners agreed to grant credit for courses offered by other  participating institutions. In Seattle\u2019s health care initiative, a community  college official said that area colleges had competed against each other  and worked with employers independently, but collaboration helped them  think more in terms of scale and as a system.", "In several cases, the initiatives involved multiple workforce boards as  partners to address issues on a regional basis. For example, the health  care initiative in Cincinnati involved the efforts of four boards across three  states\u2014Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana\u2014because board officials recognized  that the local labor market includes communities in each state. In Wichita,  Kansas, the aircraft manufacturing initiative included two boards\u2014one  serving the six counties around Wichita, and the other serving 63 rural  counties in the western half of the state. To address initial concerns that  the larger Wichita-based board might benefit disproportionately, both  boards took steps to ensure that they would each benefit from and have  access to resources. In doing so, according to board staff, they were able  to expand the recruitment pool and promote job openings in a wider area.  Their collaboration also fostered communications about new market  opportunities for companies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Leadership Was Critical in Spurring Action and Building Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["Officials from many boards emphasized the importance of securing  leaders who had the authority or the ability, or both, to persuade others of  the merits of a particular initiative. In some cases, workforce board or  one-stop staff took the lead. In San Bernardino, California, for example, a  leader from the one-stop\u2019s Business Services unit used feedback from  local employers to persuade the board of the need for layoff aversion  services, such as training manufacturers\u2019 incumbent workers in more  efficient production techniques. In Lancaster, Pennsylvania, workforce  staff helped public school teachers gain state approval for an agricultural  curriculum by obtaining the state\u2019s designation of agricultural careers as  \u201chigh priority occupations,\u201d and as a result, convinced previously wary  partners that collaborating with the workforce system would be beneficial.  In some cases, other partners led efforts to launch the initiative. For  example, to address a critical need for health care workers in Northern  Virginia, a community college president personally marshaled support  from area hospital chief executive officers and other local leaders to  address common needs for health care workers. Employers also provided  leadership that was instrumental in persuading other employers and  partners to join the initiatives. In Greensboro, North Carolina, officials  reported that many employers joined round-table discussions after their  competitors encouraged them to participate.", "Many partners also emphasized the value of having a leader whose  perceived neutrality could help build trust among parties who were  otherwise competitors. Officials from several initiatives also said that  neutral leaders helped different partners understand how their mutual  interests could be served through collaboration. In Seattle, for example,  officials said that having such a neutral convener helped to both manage  partners\u2019 relationships and focus on opportunities for systematic change,  and that without such leadership, their efforts would have likely produced  smaller, more isolated projects. The leaders who served as neutral  conveners varied among the initiatives. For several initiatives, including  Seattle, the local boards served this purpose. In southeast Michigan, the  state workforce agency was viewed as a neutral convener."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leveraging Resources Supported Collaborative Efforts", "paragraphs": ["All of the boards and their partners leveraged resources in addition to or  in lieu of WIA formula funds to launch or sustain their initiatives. In some  cases, partners were able to use initial support, such as discretionary  grants, to attract additional resources. For example, in Golden, Colorado,  the board leveraged a Labor WIRED grant of slightly more than $285,000  to generate an additional $441,000 from other partners. WIA formula  funds were typically used to support some training, as well as pre- employment assessment and screening. According to several workforce  board directors, however, WIA funds were not sufficient to meet the  training needs of employers and jobseekers in their areas. Various  partners contributed resources to meet these training needs and sustain  their collaboration. For example, projects that stemmed from Seattle\u2019s  Health Care Sector Panel have had a wide variety of support, including  WIA formula funds, Governor\u2019s set-aside funds, and federal H-1B monies  and state funds, among others.", "In addition to public funds, in all cases that we reviewed, employers  demonstrated their support by contributing as well. For example, in  Northern Virginia, health care employers offered matching funds to help  persuade the state legislature to provide financial support, according to  local officials. In Cincinnati, Ohio, all participating employers committed  tuition reimbursement dollars for workers\u2019 course costs, including  remedial education, and in Greensboro, North Carolina, employer  matching funds supported a sector-specific training center. In addition,  employers also provided in-kind support, such as equipment, use of  facilities, and providing training during working hours. Table 3 lists the  most frequently used resources to build and sustain initiatives.", "In all cases, the initiatives of the boards and their partners provided  employer-responsive services to actively involve employers and keep  them engaged in the collaborative process. Some boards and their  partners employed staff with industry-specific knowledge to better  understand and communicate with employers. In Madison, Wisconsin, for  example, the board designated some one-stop staff as industry  specialists. According to officials, these specialists better served  employers because they understood what the available jobs entailed,  what training was required, and what to look for on a resume for specific  occupations when screening jobseekers. Similarly, in Chicago, to help  meet the needs of manufacturers, staff of a sector-based center  specialized in certain kinds of manufacturing, such as food processing,  plastics and paper, and metal. These examples are consistent with the  finding of a prior GAO report that one-stop staffs were better able to  respond to labor shortages when they had a strong understanding of the  employment and training needs in specific industries.", "In other initiatives, boards and partners gained employers\u2019 confidence in  the collaboration by tailoring services such as jobseeker assessment and  screening services to address specific employers\u2019 needs. For example, in  Greensboro, North Carolina, the board staff provided expedited services  for an aircraft company by designing a web-based recruitment tool and  customized assessment process within 48 hours and quickly screening  over 2,400 initial applicants, according to a board official. Similarly, to  better match jobseekers with specific job openings, the sector-based  center in Chicago worked closely with employers to review and validate  employers\u2019 own assessment tools, or develop new ones, and administer  them on behalf of the employers. Center staff said they could screen 50  candidates and winnow them to the top 5, which saved employers time in  the hiring process. One employer noted that without the center\u2019s help,  they would have needed at least two human resource specialists to do  this job.", "Boards and their partners also strengthened collaborative ties with  employers by making training services more relevant and useful to them.  In some cases, employers provided direct input into training curricula. For  example, in Wichita, employers from the aviation industry worked closely  with education partners to develop a training curriculum that met industry  needs and integrated new research findings on composite materials. In  southeast Michigan, education partners adjusted the course content\u2014 while the training was under way\u2014in response to shifting industry needs.  Another way that some initiatives met employers\u2019 training needs was to  provide instruction that led to industry-recognized credentials. For  example, in San Bernardino, a training provider integrated an industry- recognized credential in metalworking into training to make it more  relevant for employers. To address employers\u2019 long-term training needs,  some initiatives incorporated career pathways, in which training is  sequenced and linked to additional training in a way that supports career  advancement. In Seattle, employers reported that this approach to  training could play an important role in reducing employer turnover costs  associated with certain workers such as medical assistants, who formerly  had few options for career advancement.", "In addition, some boards engaged employers in collaborative efforts by  ensuring that certain jobseekers had adequate basic skills to meet  employers\u2019 needs. In some cases, this entailed working closely with the  adult education system.boards adapted existing state approaches to help jobseekers improve  both basic and occupational skills simultaneously, by including a basic  skills instructor in training at least part of the time or by using curricula  that basic skills and occupational instructors had developed together. In  San Bernardino, where employers had been struggling to find skilled  machinists, the training provider incorporated basic math and basic  blueprint reading in the 630 hours of training that it provided to  jobseekers. To address employers\u2019 need for a long-term supply of  workers, some boards and their partners also included youth in their  initiatives. For example, in Gainesville, Florida, the TechQuest initiative  enrolled WIA youth participants in 8 weeks of business-oriented learning  to introduce them to technology-oriented businesses while improving their  reading and writing skills.", "In Seattle and Madison, for example, the  Another way that boards and their partners facilitated collaboration with  employers was by reaching beyond WIA\u2019s primary mission of serving the  unemployed and including employed workers or jobseekers not receiving   Several officials described this broad approach as services under WIA. driven by the employer\u2019s need for certain skills, irrespective of a  jobseeker\u2019s status under WIA. In Northern Virginia, for example, the  partners first identified employers\u2019 needs\u2014in this case, a projected local  shortage of health care workers\u2014and then developed a broad,  responsive strategy that incorporated WIA as a key but not the sole  element. As a result, the partners\u2019 efforts to increase the supply of skilled  workers extended beyond WIA to the general population, while including  some workers who had individual training accounts under WIA. Similarly,  staff of the sector-based center in Chicago explained that their practice of  screening and referring qualified jobseekers\u2014both those who received  services under WIA and those who did not\u2014was responsive to  manufacturers\u2019 need for specific skills. In other cases, boards and their  partners focused largely on employers\u2019 current workers to meet specific  employer needs while also serving some workers receiving services  under WIA. The manufacturing initiatives in Golden, Colorado, and  southeast Michigan, for example, focused on upgrading the skills of  incumbent workers while at the same time retooling the skills of some  dislocated workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minimizing Administrative Burden for All Partners Facilitated Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Boards also facilitated collaboration by minimizing administrative burden  for employers and other partners. Board staff with several initiatives said  that complex administrative processes would have discouraged  employers from collaborating in the initiatives. In some cases, boards and  their partners streamlined data collection or developed shared data  systems to enhance efficiency. For example, in Cincinnati, the partners  developed a shared data system to more efficiently track participants,  services received, and outcomes achieved across multiple workforce  providers in the region. Additionally, in southeast Michigan, an industry  official reported that the administrative burden would have been \u201calmost  insurmountable\u201d for employers if they had not collaborated with the  workforce system and received administrative support. For several  initiatives, one-stop staff or board members said they managed  administrative processes because the level of documentation could be  intimidating and discourage collaboration.", "Another way many initiatives minimized administrative burden was by  designating a single point of contact or having a program manager to  streamline communication channels, which facilitated collaboration  among disparate partners. For example, in Golden, Colorado, a partner  reported that having a program manager who was focused and  responsive to employers\u2019 concerns improved stakeholder relations and  helped employers understand the benefits of collaboration. In other  cases, some partners limited the frequency, length, and focus of meetings  to use partners\u2019 time most effectively.

In some cases,  employers cited an increased supply of skilled labor. In Northern Virginia,  for example, the partners said that the initiative produced an increased  supply of nurses and other health care workers. In other cases, employers  said the initiatives helped reduce their recruitment and retention costs. For  example, in Rochester, Minnesota, one employer, a long-term care facility,  reported a reduction in turnover from 60 percent to 6 percent in 1 year. In  Cincinnati, Ohio, according to an independent study, employers who  participated in the health care initiative realized about $4,900 in cost  savings per worker hired. Other employers cited less quantifiable benefits.  For example, in Gainesville, Florida, one employer said that participants in  the entrepreneurship training initiative had acquired the specialized skills  needed for new ventures that were otherwise difficult for them to find. In a  few cases, employers credited the initiative with helping to increase their  competitiveness. In the Wichita, Kansas, area and southeast Michigan,  where employers focused on upgrading skills to keep pace with changes in  technology, officials told us that the initiatives had helped them develop a  talent base that could help them compete internationally.", "For jobseekers and workers, the partnerships produced results that mainly  reflected job placement and skill attainment. For example, in Wichita, of the  1,195 workers who were trained in the use of composite materials in  aircraft manufacturing, 1,008 had found jobs in this field. In some cases  where incumbent workers were promoted after having received services to  support their career progression, as in Seattle\u2019s health care initiative, new  openings were created for entry-level jobseekers. In Gainesville, Florida,  some participants who had completed the initiative\u2019s entrepreneurship  training had started seven new companies. Elsewhere, such as in San  Bernardino\u2019s layoff aversion initiative, workers retained jobs when 426 jobs  were saved. In addition, some of those who attained new skills included  jobseekers with barriers to employment. For example, in San Bernardino,  officials reported that 32 percent of the trainees who had completed the  Technical Employment Training for machinists faced barriers to  employment, such as a disability or criminal record.", "For the workforce system, the partnerships led to results such as  increased participation by employers in the workforce system, greater  efficiencies, and models of collaboration that could be replicated. Officials  with several initiatives said they had generated repeat employer business  or that the number and quality of employers\u2019 job listings had increased,  allowing the workforce system to better serve jobseekers. In some cases,  officials also cited efficiency improvements.

For example, staff  from some boards said it was challenging to collaborate with employers  using WIA formula funds because they could generally only use these  funds to train eligible jobseekers. Furthermore, WIA prioritizes funding for  intensive services and training for low-income individuals when funding  for adult employment and training activities is limited. The director of  one board said that pursuing comprehensive strategies for an entire  economic sector can be challenging, because WIA funds are typically  used for lower-skilled workers, and employers in the region wanted to  attract a mix of lower- and higher-skilled workers. To address this  challenge, the director noted that the board used a combination of WIA  and other funds to address employers\u2019 needs for a range of workers.", "In at least five of the initiatives, board officials described services to  incumbent workers as a major part of their successful collaboration with  employers, yet some boards were challenged to piece together funds to  do this. WIA formula funds generally cannot be used to train incumbent  workers, with certain exceptions. For instance, employed workers who  need training to reach self-sufficiency may be served with WIA formula  funds. In addition, WIA Governor\u2019s set-aside funds may be used for  innovative programs for incumbent workers. Among the initiatives that  served incumbent workers, the most common funding sources were  employer contributions and state funds. In addition, states may apply to  Labor for waivers to provide layoff aversion services to incumbent  workers with both WIA formula and reserve rapid response funds. One  board used WIA rapid response funds for layoff aversion services  because the state had a waiver for this purpose. Even in cases where  boards used some WIA funds to serve incumbent workers, most boards  had to find other funds to address this employer need.", "Because WIA formula funds for training are primarily designed to pay for  services for individual jobseekers through individual training accounts,  some boards found it challenging to fund other training-related activities. For example, some board staff said they needed to use other funding to  develop new curriculum for their initiatives. Boards can use WIA funds to  develop curriculum as part of \u201ccustomized\u201d training for employers.  However, this type of training has some restrictions, such as requiring  employers to pay for 50 percent of the training, which could be a deterrent  for some employers. In other cases, board staff reported that they  wanted to provide training for an entire cohort, but boards usually cannot  use WIA funds to contract for training services.", "WIA requires training to be provided through individual training accounts with limited  exceptions, such as when the services include on-the-job training provided by an  employer or when the local board determines there is an insufficient number of training  providers in the area.

The current WIA performance measures primarily focus on  local-level outcomes for jobseekers, except for a required measure of  employer satisfaction which may be measured by a survey of a sample of  employers for this purpose. While this survey provides a high-level  indicator of employer satisfaction with WIA-funded programs, the  statewide sample that is reported to Labor does not provide information  on each local area\u2019s performance. Thus, board staff explained, the sole  employer measure does little to acknowledge or reward local boards that  successfully engage employers. For example, one board\u2019s staff said that  although they prioritize working with employers, they do not get credit for  this under WIA. On the other hand, the executive director of one board  noted that their successful efforts to engage employers were reflected in  improved outcomes for jobseekers.", "However, WIA does not preclude local efforts to develop measures of  employer engagement, and we found that many of the boards track a  variety of their own employer measures. In Chicago, staff track measures  such as the number of new employers served every year and the hiring  rate among jobseekers that they had referred to employers. In two  initiatives where the boards collaborated with Commerce\u2019s MEP program,  the boards collected data on measures such as increased employer sales  and employers\u2019 satisfaction with initiative services. Furthermore, one  board\u2019s executive director expressed appreciation for the flexibility to adopt  measures of employer engagement that best align with local needs. Other  examples of the types of measures boards reported that they used to  gauge employer engagement or satisfaction include  interview-to-hire ratio from initiative jobseeker referrals,  retention rate of initiative-referred hires, number of businesses returning for services, number of new business contacts, employers\u2019 willingness to invest time or funding in initiatives, employer satisfaction with initiative, and  increased or retained employer sales.", "These examples are consistent with prior GAO work.

In addition, Labor  has recently worked with Commerce and the Small Business  Administration to fund a new discretionary $37 million grant program  called the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge to encourage  collaboration and leveraging funds. This program encourages the  development of industry clusters, which are networks of interconnected  firms and supporting institutions that can help a region create jobs. These  grants are also intended to help local boards and others leverage existing  federal resources by, for example, encouraging boards to develop  collaborative relationships with career and technical education providers  that receive federal funds. A total of 16 federal agencies will provide  technical resources to help leverage existing agency funding, including  the 3 funding agencies listed above. In September 2011, Labor  announced the 20 regions that will receive grant funds.

For example, Labor maintains a website for sharing  innovative state and local workforce practices called Workforce3One,  which has some examples of leveraging funding at the local level.  However, the website does not group these examples together in an easy  to find location, as it does for other categories such as examples of  innovative employer services or sector-based strategies. In addition,  Labor funded evaluations of two of its grant programs and identified how  local grantees leveraged funding from educational institutions, businesses  and employers, and industry associations, among other sources, as well  as the levels of funding that grantees leveraged and planned to  leverage. Other research, such as reviews of boards\u2019 coordination with  faith-based community organizations, has also addressed how local  workforce initiatives can leverage resources through outside  organizations to help jobseekers obtain and retain employment.

The 14 local initiatives profiled in this report  illustrate how workforce boards collaborated with partners to develop  innovative and employer-driven services that helped address urgent local  workforce needs. The variety of ways in which they helped employers  meet their needs and yielded results may be testimony to the viability and  potential of WIA\u2019s vision for local partnership: critical skill needs were met,  individuals obtained or upgraded their skills, and the local system of  workforce programs was reinvigorated by increased employer  participation. Furthermore, the common factors that facilitated these  collaborations, as well as the key challenges they encountered, can be  instructive for future collaborations and efforts to enhance the workforce  investment system.", "Labor has taken several important steps that support local initiatives like  these through guidance and technical assistance, and its collaborative  efforts with other federal agencies such as the new grant program with  Commerce and the Small Business Administration.
