GAO was asked to identify (1) funding trends for Park Service operations and visitor fees for fiscal years 2001-2005; (2) specific funding trends for 12 selected high visitation park units and how, if at all, the funding trends have affected operations; and (3) recent management initiatives the Park Service has undertaken to address fiscal performance and accountability of park units."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall, amounts appropriated to the National Park Service (Park Service) in the Operation of the National Park System account increased from 2001 to 2005. In inflation-adjusted terms, amounts allocated by the Park Service to park units from this appropriation for daily operations declined while project-related allocations increased. Project-related allocations increased primarily in (1) cyclic maintenance and repair and rehabilitation programs to reflect an emphasis on reducing the estimated $5 billion maintenance backlog and (2) the inventory and monitoring program to protect natural resources through the Natural Resource Challenge initiative. Also, on an average annual basis, visitor fees collected increased about 1 percent, a 2 percent decline when adjusted for inflation. All park units we visited received project-related allocations but most of the park units experienced declines in inflation-adjusted terms in their allocations for daily operations. Each of the 12 park units reported their daily operations allocations were not sufficient to address increases in operating costs, such as salaries and new Park Service requirements. In response, officials reported that they either eliminated or reduced services, or relied on other authorized sources to pay operating expenses that have historically been paid with allocations for daily operations. Also, implementing important Park Service policies, without additional allocations, has placed additional demands on the park units and reduced their flexibility. For example, the Park Service has directed its park units to spend most of their visitor fees on deferred maintenance projects. While the Park Service may use visitor fees to pay salaries for permanent staff that administer projects funded with these fees, it has a policy prohibiting such use. To alleviate the pressure on daily operations allocations, we believe it would be appropriate to use visitor fees to pay the salaries of employees working on visitor fee-funded projects. Interior believes that while employment levels at individual park units may have fluctuated for many reasons, employment servicewide was stable, including both seasonal and permanent employees. GAO identified three initiatives--Business Plan, Core Operations Analysis, and Park Scorecard--to address park units' fiscal performance and operational condition. Of the park units we visited with a business plan, officials stated that the plans, among other things, have helped them better identify future budget needs. Due to its early development stage, only a few park units have participated in the Core Operations Analysis; for those we visited who have, officials said that they are better able to determine where operational efficiencies might accrue. Park Service headquarters used the Scorecard to validate and approve increases in funding for daily operations for fiscal year 2005."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Park Service (Park Service) manages 390 park units covering  over 84 million acres that provide recreational and educational  opportunities\u2014and numerous other benefits\u2014to millions of visitors each  year. From 2001 to 2005, park units averaged a total of about 274 million  recreation visits per year. Visitors come to the park units to experience  such features as grand waterfalls, mountain vistas, canyons and gorges,  giant redwood trees, wildlife, historical landmarks such as Revolutionary  and Civil War battlefields, Native American dwellings and artifacts, and  memorials honoring veterans. Within its mandate to conserve park  resources and to provide for their enjoyment in a manner that leaves them  unimpaired for future generations, the Park Service provides a variety of  visitor services such as interpretative education films, guided tours, and  information centers where visitors can learn about the unique features of  the park units.", "Congress provides funding for the Park Service through a number of  appropriations accounts; the largest is the Operation of the National Park  System (ONPS), which funds the management, operations, and  maintenance of park areas and facilities and the general administration of  the Park Service. Congress has made additional funding available by  permitting the Park Service to charge and retain recreation fees, referred to  in this report as \u201cvisitor fees.\u201d The Park Service also has, among other  things, authority to charge and retain concessions fees and to accept  donations and voluntary services. As with any federal program, the Park  Service is expected to manage within whatever level of funding is provided  and to allocate resources to its park units in a way that is both efficient and  effective in delivering services. The Park Service has chosen to allocate  funds to its park units in two categories\u2014for daily operations, and for  specific, non-recurring projects. Park managers use funding for daily  operations to pay for visitor and resource protection, interpretation and  education, and facilities operations, among other things. About eighty  percent or more of the park units\u2019 daily operations funds pay for salaries  and benefits for staff to carry out these mission components, while the  remainder is used for overhead expenses such as utilities, supplies, and  training. The project-related portion provides funds for non-recurring  projects such as replacing roofs on park facilities or rehabilitating  campgrounds. Park managers generally use these project funds to pay  temporary employees or contractors to complete these projects.", "In addition to providing the funding for daily operations and projects, the  Congress has enacted legislation authorizing park units to collect visitor  fees to provide additional funds to use for specified park operations. Visitor  fees have been used, for example, to construct roadside exhibits and to  rehabilitate boat launch facilities. The Park Service has recently set a goal  to spend the majority of its visitor fees on reducing its estimated $5 billion  deferred maintenance backlog. The Congress also authorizes the Park  Service to receive revenues from other sources to assist it in performing its  mission. These can include fees from concessionaires under contract to  perform services at park units, such as operating a lodge, and cash or non- monetary donations from non-profit organizations or individuals, among  others.", "In recent years, concerns over the deteriorating condition of the national  parks have received increasing attention. Some reports prepared by  advocacy groups cite a lack of sufficient staff and financial resources  necessary to effectively operate park units. They report problems such as  dwindling visitor services, crumbling buildings, and threatened resources  at many park units including the Everglades, Gettysburg, Great Smoky  Mountains, Olympic, Yellowstone, and others. Some of these reports argue  that the purchasing power of the park units\u2019 funding has been weakened  due to inflation and required employee pay and benefit increases that were  not accounted for in their daily operations funding. Some contend that  other funds, such as donations, are being used to fund operational activities  that they believe should be paid with funding for daily operations.", "However, the Department of the Interior stated that the Park Service\u2019s  operating funds have increased significantly from 1980 through 2005,  particularly when compared to other domestic federal agencies.", "To gain a better understanding of funding issues and their effects on the  park units, you asked us to identify (1) funding trends for Park Service  operations and visitor fees for fiscal years 2001 through 2005; (2) specific  funding trends for several high-visitation park units and how, if at all, these  funding trends have affected operations, including the park units\u2019 ability to  provide services, for fiscal years 2001 through 2005; and (3) recent  management initiatives the Park Service has undertaken to address the  fiscal performance and accountability of park units.", "To identify funding trends for Park Service operations and visitor fees from  fiscal years 2001 through 2005, we obtained and analyzed appropriations  legislation, data on the Park Service\u2019s allocation of funds from the ONPS  Account, and data on visitor fees. We analyzed the data in both nominal  (actual) and real (adjusted for inflation) terms. A \u201cnominal dollar\u201d is the  value of a dollar in the prices of the current year, or for purposes of this  analysis, the year in which a dollar is appropriated. A \u201creal dollar\u201d is a  dollar that has been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation by dividing  the nominal dollar by a price index. Appropriations are made in nominal, or  current-year, dollars. The purpose of showing dollars in inflation-adjusted  terms is to permit comparisons of purchasing power. To determine funding  trends for selected individual park units and how these trends affected the  park units\u2019 ability to provide services to visitors, we selected 12 park units  based on visitation, regional diversity, and preliminary data on allocations  for daily operations. We visited the 12 park units, gathered and analyzed  nominal and real funding and cost data and interviewed park officials to  determine allocation trends and their impact on operations (including  visitor services). Our analysis represents our findings at these 12 parks  units and the results may or may not be representative of the individual  experiences of other park units or the experience of the National Park  System as a whole. To identify recent management initiatives the Park  Service has under way to address fiscal performance and accountability for  fiscal years 2001 to 2005, we gathered and reviewed documentation on  several management initiatives and interviewed Park Service headquarters,  regional office, and individual park unit officials. We assessed the reliability  of the data by reviewing the methods of data collection for relevant Park  Service databases. We also sent uniform data requests to the 12 park units,  provided uniform guidance, and interactively worked with park officials to  compile the data. We determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report. A more detailed description of our scope and  methodology is presented in appendix I. We performed our work from  January 2005 to March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service is the caretaker of many of the nation\u2019s most precious  natural and cultural resources. Today, more than 130 years after the first  national park was created, the National Park System has grown to include  390 units covering over 84 million acres in 49 states, the District of  Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Saipan, and the Virgin  Islands. The Park Service manages its responsibilities through  headquarters, seven regional offices, and its individual park units. These  units include a diverse mix of sites\u2014now in more than 20 different  categories. These include (1) national parks, such as Yellowstone in Idaho,  Montana, and Wyoming; Yosemite in California; and Grand Canyon in  Arizona; (2) national historical parks, such as Harper\u2019s Ferry in Maryland,  Virginia, and West Virginia; and Valley Forge in Pennsylvania; (3) national  battlefields, such as Antietam in Maryland; (4) national historic sites such  as Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington, D.C.; and Carl Sandburg\u2019s home in North  Carolina; (5) national monuments, such as Fort Sumter in South Carolina;  and the Statue of Liberty in New York and New Jersey; (6) national  preserves, such as Yukon-Charley Rivers in Alaska; and (7) national  recreation areas, such as Lake Mead in Arizona and Nevada. Some of these  park units, such as Yellowstone, cover millions of acres and employ  hundreds of employees. Other units, such as Ford\u2019s Theatre which  encompasses two historic structures, are small and have few employees.", "The Park Service\u2019s mission is to preserve unimpaired the natural and  cultural resources of the National Park System for the enjoyment of this  and future generations. Its objectives include providing for the use of the  park units by supplying appropriate visitor services and infrastructure (e.g.,  roads and facilities) to support these services. In addition, the Park Service  protects its natural and cultural resources (e.g., preserving wildlife habitat  and Native American sites) so that they will be unimpaired for the  enjoyment of future generations. Due to the complexity of its mission, large  land area, and the number and diversity of its park units, the Park Service  faces many challenges\u2014including a deteriorating infrastructure (due in  part to an estimated $5 billion maintenance backlog), threats to preserving  natural and cultural resources, and challenges to maintaining visitor  services. Moreover, despite fiscal constraints facing all federal agencies,  the number of park units continues to expand\u201412 units, mostly small  units, have been authorized since fiscal year 2001.", "The Park Service receives its main source of funds to operate park units  through appropriations from the ONPS account. The Park Service chooses  to allocate funds to its park units in two categories\u2014allocations for daily  operations, and allocations for specific, non-recurring projects. Daily  operations allocation levels for individual park units are built on park units\u2019  allocation level for the prior year. Park units receive an increased  allocation for required pay increases and request specific increases for new  or higher levels of ongoing operating responsibilities, such as adding  additional law enforcement rangers for increased homeland security  protection. Park Service headquarters takes the initiative in requesting the  funding for all required employee pay increases on a service wide basis.  However, for park-specific increases, once funding is appropriated, park  units compete against one another through their regional office and  headquarters for the available funds.", "As is true for other government operations, the cost of operating park units  will increase each year due to required pay increases, the rising costs of  benefits for federal employees, and rising overhead expenses such as  utilities. The Park Service may provide additional allocations for daily  operations to cover all or part of these cost increases. If the continuation of  operations at the previous year\u2019s level would require more funds than are  available, park units must adjust either by identifying efficiencies within  the park unit, use other authorized funding sources such as fees or  donations to fund the activity, or reduce services. Upon receiving their  allocations for daily operations each year, park unit managers exercise a  great deal of discretion in setting operational priorities. Typically, these  decisions involve trade-offs among four categories of spending: (1) visitor  services (e.g., opening a campground or adding law enforcement staff), (2)  resource management (e.g., monitoring the condition of threatened species  or water quality), (3) maintenance needs (e.g., repairing a trail), and (4)  park administration and support (e.g., updating computer systems or  attending training). Generally, about 80 percent of each park unit\u2019s  allocation for daily operations is used to pay the salaries and benefits of  permanent employees (personnel costs). Park units use the remainder of  their allocations for daily operations for overhead expenses such as  utilities, supplies, and training, among other things.", "In addition to daily operations funding, the Park Service also allocates  project-related funding to park units for specific purposes to support its  mission. For example, activities completed with Cyclic Maintenance and  Repair and Rehabilitation funds include re-roofing or re-painting buildings,  overhauling engines, refinishing hardwood floors, replacing sewer lines,  repairing building foundations, and rehabilitating campgrounds and trails.  Park units compete for project allocations by submitting requests to their  respective regional office and headquarters. Regional and headquarters  officials determine which projects to fund. While an individual park unit  may receive funding for several projects in one year, it may receive none  the next.", "Park units may also receive revenue from outside sources such as visitor  fees and donations\u2014although there are often limitations on how these  revenues may be used. Since 1996, the Congress has provided the park  units with authority to collect fees from visitors and retain these funds for  use on projects to enhance recreation and visitor enjoyment, among other  things.  Since 2002, the Park Service has required park units to spend the  majority of their visitor fees on deferred maintenance projects, such as  road or building repair. The Park Service also receives revenue from  concessionaires under contract to perform services at park units\u2014such as  operating a lodge\u2014and cash or non-monetary donations from non-profit  organizations or individuals, among others. For example, as we reported in  July 2003, about 200 cooperating associations and \u201cfriends groups\u201d helped  support 347 park units, contributing over $200 million from 1997 to 2001.

Park Service  headquarters officials reported that from 2001 through 2005, the Park  Service paid personnel cost increases enacted by the Congress. For  example, from fiscal years 2001 through 2005, Congress enacted salary  increases of about 4 percent per year for federal employees. Park Service  officials reported that the Park Service covered these salary increases with  appropriations provided in the ONPS account. The Park Service allocated  amounts to cover about half of the required increases and park units had to  reduce spending to compensate for the difference. The consequence of the  increases was that park units had to eliminate or defer spending in order to  accommodate the increases. For example, officials at Gettysburg National  Military Park stated that they achieved personnel cost savings by taking a  number of actions to reduce spending, including refraining from filling\u2014 and delaying filling\u2014several permanent and seasonal vacancies. Park  officials said they estimate the personnel cost savings from 2002 through  2005 was about $1,434,781, in inflation-adjusted terms. Total personnel  expenditures at the park unit declined from $4,460,000 in 2001 to $4,143,000  in 2005\u2014an average annual decline of about 2 percent, in inflation-adjusted  terms. In contrast, at Mount Rushmore National Memorial, total personnel  expenditures increased from $2,014,000 in 2001 to $2,552,000 in 2005\u2014or  an average of about 6 percent per year. Officials said that the increase was  due to required salary increases for permanent staff and expenditures on  new personnel hired for homeland security measures. As shown in table 6,  expenditures for personnel from 2001 through 2005 increased for seven  park units, and declined for the other five units, after adjusting for inflation.", "Personnel costs (salaries and benefits) comprised an average of 74 to 89  percent of the total operating expenses at these 12 park units; therefore  officials said that it is difficult to offset increases in personnel costs  without reducing personnel. Officials at several park units told us that  since 2001, they have refrained from filling vacant positions or have filled  them with lower-graded or seasonal employees. For example, in an effort to  continue to perform activities that directly impact visitors\u2014such as  cleaning restrooms and answering visitor questions\u2014officials at Sequoia  and Kings Canyon National Parks stated that they left several high-graded  positions unfilled in order to hire a lower graded workforce to perform  these basic operational duties. Officials at most park units also told us that  when positions were left vacant, the responsibilities of the remaining staff  generally increased in order to fulfill park obligations.", "Park Service budget officials told us that they expect personnel costs to  continue to grow faster than any increases in allocations for personnel in  fiscal years 2006 and 2007. As a result, they said that in some cases the  parks may choose to hire seasonal employees or contract out more duties  than fill vacant positions. Table 7 shows the average annual percentage of  daily operations funding that the 12 park units we visited spent on  personnel costs.", "In addition, Park Service budget officials said that park units\u2019 personnel  costs have also increased because they pay more of the costs of benefits for  employees under the newer Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS)  than they do for employees under the older Civil Service Retirement  System (CSRS). As a result, the officials said that total compensation  (salary and benefits) is higher for a FERS employee at the same salary level  as a CSRS employee. Unlike CSRS, for example, FERS requires federal  agencies to match up to 5 percent of employees\u2019 contributions to their  retirement account. In addition, as CSRS employees retire and are replaced  by FERS employees, the officials said that the Park Service\u2019s personnel  costs will increase, when all else remains the same.", "At the park units we visited, benefits paid to FERS employees rose at a  faster rate and were generally higher on average than those for CSRS  employees. At almost all the park units, average total compensation for a CSRS employee exceeded that for a FERS employee. For instance, at  Shenandoah National Park, average benefits for a FERS employee  increased at an annual rate of about 3 percent from 2001 through 2005  compared with about 2 percent per year for a CSRS employee (adjusted for  inflation). In 2005, the average FERS total compensation was $44,242,  including $11,713 for benefits, compared to an average CSRS total of about  $54,134, including $9,401 for benefits. Tables 16 and 17 in appendix III show  nominal and inflation-adjusted personnel costs per retirement system at  the 12 park units we visited.", "In addition to increasing personnel costs, officials at many of the park units  we visited explained that rising utility costs caused parks to reduce  spending in other areas. For example, at Grand Teton National Park, park  officials told us that to operate the same number of facilities and assets,  costs for fuel, electricity, and solid waste removal increased from $435,010  in 2003 to $633,201 in 2005\u2014an increase of 46 percent, when adjusted for  inflation. Officials told us that, as a result, their utility budget for fiscal year  2005 was spent by June 2005\u2014three months early. In August, the park  accepted the transfer requests of two division chiefs and used the salaries  from these vacancies to pay for utility costs for the remaining portion of the  year.", "Officials at some parks attributed increased utility costs to new  construction that was generally not accompanied with a corresponding  increase to their allocation for daily operations. In 2003, Yellowstone  National Park constructed The Heritage Center with line item construction  appropriations to house 5.3 million artifacts of natural and cultural  significance. In 2001, the park officials requested but did not receive an  additional $250,000 that they estimated was required to pay for the center\u2019s  costs for power, water, sewer, and information technology. A Park Service  headquarters official told us that while there is a need to replace old  facilities with new construction, it is unlikely\u2014given the overall fiscal  demands on the federal government\u2014that park units will receive  corresponding increases in funding for daily operations necessary to  operate new facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Park Responsibilities Affected Management Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["Officials at most of the park units we visited also told us that their units  generally did not receive additional allocations for administering new Park  Service policies directed at reducing its maintenance backlog,  implementing a new asset management strategy, or maintaining specified  levels of law enforcement personnel (referred to as its no-net-loss policy)  which has reduced their flexibility in addressing other park priorities.  While officials stated that these policies were important, implementing  them without additional allocations reduced their management flexibility.  Over the years, the estimates of the amount of the agency\u2019s deferred  maintenance backlog have varied widely\u2014sometimes by billions of dollars.  Since 1998, we have issued several reports on the agency\u2019s efforts to reduce  its backlog. Since 2001, the Park Service has placed a high priority on  reducing its currently estimated $5 billion maintenance backlog. In  response, the Park Service, among other things, set a goal to spend the  majority of its visitor fees on deferred maintenance projects\u2014$75 million  in 2002 increasing to $95 million in 2005. Officials at several park units  report that they have used daily operations allocations to absorb the cost of  salaries for permanent staff needed to oversee the increasing number of  visitor fee-funded projects. Park officials reported that the additional  administrative and supervisory tasks associated with these projects add to  the workload of an already-reduced permanent staff. For example, at  Acadia National Park, officials told us that although visitor fee-funded  projects have benefited the park, supervisors have reduced the extent to  which they supervise their existing daily operating staff in order to manage  temporary staff working on visitor fee-funded projects.", "While the Park Service may use visitor fees to pay salaries for permanent  staff that manage and administer projects funded with visitor fees, it has a  policy prohibiting such use. Instead, these salaries are paid using  allocations for daily operations which reduce the amount of the allocation  available for visitor services and other activities and limit the park units\u2019  ability to maintain these services and activities. Park Service headquarters  officials recognize the strain that its policy has had on allocations for daily  operations. Park Service headquarters officials said that its policy was first  established under the original Recreational Fee Demonstration Program  and provided several reasons for doing so. First, it did not want park units  to use the revenue to hire more permanent staff than the park units needed.  In addition, the Park Service wanted the revenue to be used for projects  that provided visible results, such as rehabilitating a visitor facility, rather  than on salaries for permanent employees. It also did not want to use  visitor fee revenue to hire permanent staff because the recreational fee  demonstration authority was temporary, therefore forcing park units to  find another funding source to pay permanent employee salaries if the  authority was discontinued. However, due to the strain this policy has had  on allocations for daily operations combined with the recent passage of the  Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, which provides longer-term  authority (10 years) for collecting visitor fees, Park Service headquarters  officials stated that they are considering changing this policy. To alleviate  the pressure on funds for daily operations, we believe it would be  appropriate for the Park Service to follow through with revising this policy.", "In an effort to better manage its maintenance backlog and improve asset  management, the Park Service implemented a new asset management  initiative in 1998. As a part of this initiative, park units are required to  complete condition assessments and maintain this data in the Facility  Maintenance Software System (FMSS), a system-wide, integrated software  management tool to track parks\u2019 assets, their condition, and the costs  needed to keep each asset in a good operating condition. Overall, park  managers viewed this new system as a worthwhile endeavor. However,  park officials explained that their units were not provided additional funds  needed to implement this new responsibility. As a result, most of the parks  used existing staff to inventory assets and enter the data into the software  system at the expense of their primary duties. According to officials at  many of the park units we visited, staff no longer had sufficient time to  perform primary duties and responsibilities, such as regularly scheduled  preventative maintenance or bathroom cleaning. The effect of  implementing FMSS was particularly problematic for park units whose  maintenance divisions were already operating with a reduced staff. For  example, Badlands National Park, which has lost seven maintenance  division employees since 2001, used the equivalent of two full time  employees and two seasonal employees to enter data and work on other  duties related to FMSS. Because the park had to use existing staff to  comply with new asset-management requirements, regularly scheduled  activities such as painting buildings and other structures were deferred,  thus adding to its maintenance backlog.", "Another new Park Service policy impacting park units relates to its law  enforcement personnel. In response to studies that described the level of  law enforcement personnel as approaching a level for which basic resource  and visitor protection may be in jeopardy, the Park Service, in 2002,  implemented a no-net-loss policy for law enforcement personnel.  Accordingly, Park Service headquarters directed the park units to not fall  below 2002 law enforcement employee levels. Thus, unlike other divisions,  when law enforcement positions become vacant, officials are required to  fill the vacancy or request a waiver of the policy. For those park units that  have adhered to the policy, officials told us that they have had to forgo  hiring what they consider other priority vacant positions in other divisions  in order to comply with the no-net-loss policy. Officials at other park units  have been unable to maintain 2002 levels, either because they were unable  to afford to re-hire vacant positions or because other vacant positions were  deemed by park management to also be a priority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Park Units Have Taken Various Actions to Address Trends in Allocations for Daily Operations", "paragraphs": ["In response to allocations for daily operations trends, increased costs, and  new policy requirements, park officials at the 12 park units we visited said  that activities funded with daily operations have been reduced or  eliminated, delayed until other authorized funding sources became  available, or performed with the use of other authorized funding sources.

However, most park units reported that they did reduce  services that directly affect the visitor including reducing visitor center  hours, educational programs, basic custodial duties, and law enforcement  operations, such as backcountry patrolling. To illustrate:  Shenandoah National Park reduced the number of days the Loft  Mountain Visitor Contact Station operated in 2004 and then closed it  entirely in 2005. This station offered the only interpretive services at the  south end of the park; thus, visitors entering the park at the south end  have to drive 50 miles to reach another contact station. In addition,  because the park was not able to afford to fill vacancies in 2002, the  park had to close all ranger programs at Mathews Arm campground in  the north district (which contains 179 campsites) beginning in 2003. A  park official said that as of the beginning of 2006, there continues to be  no ranger programs offered at the Mathews Arm campground.", "Grand Teton National Park reduced the interpretive division\u2019s staffing  level that was paid out of daily operations funding, from 17 FTEs in 2001  to 12 FTEs in 2005.

According to park  officials, the lack of daily operations funds to hire a replacement has  impaired the park's cannon carriage restoration project as the first  attempt to restore carriages dating from the 1890s. The inability to fill  this position has limited the restoration effort, requiring the storage of  previously stripped and primed carriages in inadequate storage areas  throughout the park. Most carriages will require efforts to reverse the  rust damage while in storage. As a result, the estimated completion of  the project increased to 15 years from 10 years. The personnel costs  required for this extended time period plus the need to re-work the  previously readied carriages is estimated to increase the overall costs of  the project by approximately $260,000.", "At Yellowstone National Park, the permanent law enforcement staffing  level that was paid from daily operations funding was reduced from 51  FTEs in 2001 to 45 FTEs in 2005.

In order to fill the key deputy chief  ranger and fire chief vacancies, park officials have had to forgo re-filling  several law and non-law enforcement positions. As a result, remaining  staff worked overtime to perform the added responsibilities. With  expected retirements, officials said that a critical branch chief position  will be unfilled, as will several patrol positions and positions to staff the  jail.

Park officials explained that, when  preventative maintenance is deferred, the integrity of an asset is reduced\u2014 which can lead to replacing the asset at a greater cost than repairing it.  Park Service headquarters officials told us that they are concerned about  this decreased capacity and have reacted to the problem by requesting  increases in project funding, such as cyclic maintenance, over the past few  years. The following examples illustrate delayed activities that occurred at  the park units we visited.", "Shenandoah National Park reduced maintenance staffing levels paid  from daily operations funding from 67 FTEs in 2001 to 44 FTEs in 2005,  which decreased the park\u2019s ability to perform routine maintenance of  trails and scenic overlooks. This work was traditionally considered a  recurring operational activity paid for on an annual basis through  funding for daily operations. In 2002, as a result of limited funding for  daily operations, the park did not have the staff or resources to do this  work annually and instead began performing the tasks once every 2 or 3  years. The park currently uses cyclic maintenance project funding to  carry out this work and plans to use visitor fees to pay for this activity in  the future.", "At Grand Teton National Park, officials told us that the road striping and  chip sealing process\u2014which should be performed annually to extend  the life of a road 10 to 15 years\u2014can no longer be paid with funding for  daily operations. Consequently, officials told us that they have had to  delay the maintenance activity and rely on less frequently available  project funds.", "Rather than eliminating or not performing daily operational activities, some  park units used volunteers and funding from authorized sources such as  donations from non-profit partners and concessionaires\u2019 fees to  accomplish activities that were formerly paid with daily operations funds.   Officials at several park units said that they increasingly depend on  donations from cooperating associations to pay for training and equipment  and rely on their staff and volunteers to provide information and  educational programs to visitors that were traditionally offered by park  rangers. Funds from these sources can be significant, but they are subject  to change from year to year. For example, park officials explained that  donations at Grand Teton fluctuated from about $188,000 in 2001 to over  $400,000 in 2004, and then increased to over $8 million in 2005 when the  park received a substantial gift for a new visitor center from their non- profit park partners. For the most part, funding from these sources is  intended to supplement, rather than replace, daily operations funds.  However, officials told us that these funds are being used to pay for  activities that were formerly paid with funding for daily operations.

As a  result, relying on these sources for programs that require a long-term  funding commitment could be problematic. For example, until 2004 the  Natural Resources Division at Badlands National Park used visitor fees to  pay for natural resource programs (e.g., bighorn sheep restoration and non- native plant control). However, to meet deferred maintenance spending  goals, the park could no longer submit projects for approval to use visitor  fee revenue to support natural resource programs.

Since then, about 25 percent of all park units have participated in the  process. Most of the participation has come from smaller park units\u2014those  with a budget for daily operations under $2 million per year. The Park  Service selects about 12 park units per year to participate in the BPI  process, but their participation is voluntary. Park units are selected based  on a number of factors including (1) geographic diversity, (2) unit types  (e.g., national park, national historic site, national recreation area, national  monument), (3) whether the park units have sufficient staffing and funding  resources to conduct the BPI process, and (4) whether the timing for the  park unit to conduct a BPI is appropriate. For instance, in some cases, park  units selected for the BPI are subsequently unable to participate because  they are undergoing major management initiatives or changes (e.g.,  preparing a general management plan or changing park superintendents); a  park unit may also hold an event that represents an anomaly and may skew  the financial condition of the park unit .

The result of the analysis using these indicators is a numerical  value that is assigned to each measure leading to an assessment of being in  poor, fair, good, or excellent operational condition.", "Although the Park Scorecard is still under development, the Park Service\u2019s  headquarters budget office used it to validate and approve requests for  increases in daily operations allocations for the highest priorities among  park units to be funded out of a total of $12.5 million that was provided in  2005 for daily operations directed at visitor service programs. The Park  Service approved requests for funding at three out of the twelve parks we  visited (Badlands National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and  Yellowstone National Park). Park Service officials explained that while  Park Scorecard figures can generate useful park unit comparisons, regional  policies can also influence the indicators; while these numbers provide a  good starting point for analysis, park unit staff input must be a  consideration in determining park priorities. Park officials further  explained that it is difficult to develop a set of common indicators that can  be used for parks units with different characteristics, such as Yellowstone  National Park and Carl Sandburg Home National Historic site. Park Service  headquarters officials, with the assistance and input of park unit managers,  plan on refining the Park Scorecard to more accurately capture all  appropriate park measurements and to identify, evaluate, and support  future budget increases for park units. The Park Service also intends for  park managers to use the Park Scorecard to facilitate discussions about  their needs and priorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["From 2001 through 2004, the Park Service increased allocations for support  programs and project funding while placing less of an emphasis on  allocations for daily operations.  In 2005, however, the agency emphasis  shifted toward an increase in allocations for daily operations. As evidenced  by our visits to 12 park units, this later shift appears to be going in the  direction needed to help the park units overcome some of the difficulties  they have recently experienced in meeting operational needs\u2014particularly  as they relate to maintaining visitor services and protecting resources. In  responding to these trends, park unit officials found ways to reduce  spending on their allocations for daily operations and identify and use  authorized sources other than these allocations to minimize some impacts  on park operations and visitor services. While park units are relying more  on other authorized sources to perform operations, using such funds has its  drawbacks because it usually takes park units longer, with more effort  from park employees, to obtain and use these sources. In the case of  donations, for example, park officials spend more time grooming  relationships with donors to obtain the funds. Visitor fees have been an  important and significant source of funds for park units to address high- priority needs, such as reducing its maintenance backlog. However, Park  Service policy prohibiting the use of visitor fees to pay salaries of  permanent employees managing projects may reduce the flexibility in  managing the use of funding for daily operations. While Park Service  officials stated that they are embarking upon three management initiatives  to improve park performance and accountability\u2014and to better manage  within available resources\u2014it is too early to assess the effectiveness of  these initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To reduce some of the pressure on funding for daily operations, we are  recommending that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Park Service  Director to follow through in revising Park Service policy to allow park  units to use visitor fee revenues to pay the costs of permanent employees  administering projects funded by visitor fees to the extent authorized by  law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Department of the Interior with a draft of this report for  review and comment. The department provided written comments that are  included in appendix V. The following represents a summary of the major  comments made by the department and our response. Additional  comments and our response are also provided in appendix V. With regard  to our recommendation, the department stated that we should clearly state  that visitor fee revenue (and not other sources) be used to fund only a  limited number of permanent employees and be specifically defined for the  sole purpose of executing projects funded from fee revenue. Our  recommendation was specifically directed at using visitor fee revenues for  paying the salaries of permanent employees who administer projects  funded with such revenues and provides the Park Service with the  flexibility to define how the visitor fee revenues should be applied.", "Accordingly, we have not modified our recommendation in response to the  department\u2019s comment.", "The department appreciated the diligent work of the team that prepared  the report and the large amount of data collected, but had concerns that the  presentation of the data in the report creates a misleading impression  concerning the state of park operations for several reasons. The  department said our report provided an incomplete analysis of the financial  status of the park units and left the impression that park budgets have not  been emphasized. We disagree with this view. We conducted a detailed  analysis of the major funding trends for park operations. For example, we  reported the overall funding trends for operations, including  appropriations from the ONPS account, in relation to the Park Service\u2019s  total budget authority. As the report indicates, this trend showed that  appropriations to the ONPS account increased overall during our study  time frame at a higher rate than the Park Service\u2019s total budget authority.  We also analyzed the trends in both allocations for daily operations and  projects for the park service as a whole and for each of the 12 high- visitation park units we visited. Moreover, the report showed that the fiscal  year 2005 appropriation for the ONPS account included an additional $37.5  million over the amounts proposed by the House and Senate for the  Operation of the National Park System account, to be used for daily  operations. Furthermore, the report discusses the impacts that these trends  have had on operations at the 12 parks we visited. In response to the  department\u2019s comments, we have included more examples in the report  showing where project funds have been used by park units.", "The department also commented that within a constrained fiscal  environment, park operations have been a high priority for both the  Administration and the Congress. Such an analysis would require a much  broader review comparing the Park Service\u2019s budget with budgets of other  federal agencies, which was beyond the scope of our review. The  department commented that the report draws a \u201cfalse dichotomy\u201d between  operations and project funding. Specifically, it said that the visitor  experience at national parks is shaped not only by direct visitor services  activities such as ranger interpretive programs, but also by the condition of  park facilities and the natural resources. We agree that daily operations  allocations\u2014which funds activities such as ranger interpretive programs\u2014 and project allocations\u2014which funds facility improvements\u2014are both  important to park operations and visitor experiences. Furthermore, we  believe there is an important distinction between how park units can use  daily operations allocations as opposed to allocations for projects. In fact,  the Park Service itself allocates ONPS appropriations in these distinct  categories. Daily operations allocations are used to pay for operating  expenses such as permanent and temporary employees to perform day to  day activities such as interpretive programs and cleaning restrooms. In  contrast, Park Service procedures require that project-related allocations  are to be used only for projects and not for day to day activities. The report  recognizes this distinction by presenting these trends separately and by  providing examples of how park units are using these two sources of  allocations to conduct operations.", "The department also stated that the report\u2019s use of several park anecdotes  concerning reduced allocations for daily operations is misleading.   Specifically, the department stated that the anecdotes within the report  highlight only certain divisions or programs in which a park significantly  reduced staffing in isolation from the park unit\u2019s overall staffing,  allocations for daily operations, and allocations for projects, as well as the  overall employment levels at the Park Service as a whole.   While the  department noted in its comments that overall the balance of seasonal and  permanent employees remained stable in 2005 compared to 2001, we found  that for most of the 12 high-visitation park units we visited, that ratio of  seasonals to permanent employees increased.  We believe that these park  specific FTE trends are better indicators of an individual park unit\u2019s ability  to maintain services at the park units than servicewide FTE trends.   Analysis of activities at 12 specific park units was one of our report  objectives and we continue to believe that the specific park examples adds  to the report by illuminating the issues identified at the 12 park units that  we visited\u2014namely that officials at the park units reported that their daily  operations allocations have not kept pace with increasing personnel costs,  rising utility costs, and increased responsibilities.  We provided examples  of the tradeoffs park managers made to manage within their available  resources that illustrate what park managers consistently told us about  their ability to maintain park operations such as visitor service levels.  In  addition, we provided overall FTE trends for the park units we visited,  including those FTEs paid with allocations for daily operations and those  paid with other authorized sources.  These trends show that most of the  park units are increasingly relying on sources other than daily operations  allocations to maintain FTE levels.", "In addition, the department said that the report relies on the use of budget  and financial data but does not examine performance information, the  trends in accomplishments, or efforts to improve service delivery over the  time period of our study. Specifically, it mentioned the Park Service\u2019s and  the administration\u2019s measurement of performance and related cost  information, the analysis of allocations for daily operations through the  PART process, and efforts in management excellence. It said that all of  these efforts, including Park Service-specific tools such as the Core  Operations Analysis are yielding results in achieving more effective  programs and more efficient operations. In addition, the department states  that the Park Service has adopted new ways of doing business including  centralizing some services and systems under the department. Specifically,  the comments describe a department-wide effort to purchase information  technology hardware and software and other consumables, as well as Park  Service efforts to limit travel, provide more efficient training, and use  volunteers. We added additional information to the report to reflect these  efforts. As recognized by the department, the report provides information  on the major management initiatives that the Park Service has undertaken,  such as COA, BPI, and the Park Scorecard, which are designed to assist  managers to develop fully informed decisions which direct park resources  toward functions that are essential to achieving mission goals and also  serve as a part of management planning efforts.", "With regard to the department\u2019s comment regarding accomplishments, we  point out that for the most part, the initiatives underway were in their early  stages of development and it was too soon to determine results. We did  however, identify several examples of how park managers at the parks we  visited reported that they are increasingly relying on volunteers to perform  activities that were previously funded through allocations for daily  operations and their efforts to limit travel and training, among other  expenses, to reduce impacts on visitor services.", "Finally, the department commented that, although there is not a perfect  inflation adjustment index available to accurately determine an index of  Park Service operating costs, the specific price index we used for deflating  Park Service funding and operating costs\u2014Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  Price Index for Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross  Investment (federal nondefense sector)\u2014measures changes in the value of  government output using the cost of inputs such as compensation of  employees. The department said that it believes it might be more  appropriate to use the GDP (Chained) Price Index because it is based upon  costs of goods and services in the marketplace and it therefore considers  productivity and other management enhancements; the department also  said that this broader price index is not a perfect index either. The  department added that using the broader index would provide significantly  different results; that is, the inflation-adjusted trends in funding for daily  operations would generally be more positive. We agree that there is not a  perfect index available to accurately determine an index of Park Service  operating costs, and we agree that using a broader index would yield  different results. Nonetheless, we believe that using the GDP Price Index  for Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment (federal  nondefense sector) better represents the real quantity of services that the  agency\u2019s budget provides over time. In general, when removing the effects  of price changes, it is preferable to use a specific price index that matches  the composition of the nominal dollar amounts under consideration. As we  noted in the report, this price index reflects changes in the value of  government output, as measured by the cost of inputs such as  compensation of employees and purchases of goods and services. Input  costs are used in constructing the index because most government output  is not sold in the market place. For the Park Service, most of the operating  costs consist of employee compensation. As a result, the specific price  index we used assigns greater weight to changes in federal workers\u2019  compensation than does the more general GDP (Chained) Price Index.  While the GDP (Chained) Price Index reflects productivity improvements  in the overall economy, it is partly based on input costs and a large portion  of the basket of goods it represents reflects personal consumption,  including  food, clothing, and housing, which are less relevant for assessing  real trends in the Park Service\u2019s operating costs.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretary  of the Interior and other interested parties. We will also make copies  available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at  no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have questions about this report, please contact me at  (202) 512-3841 or nazzaror@gao.gov.

We analyzed the data in both  nominal (actual) and real (adjusted for inflation) terms.  To remove the  effects of inflation, we adjusted nominal dollars using the Gross Domestic  Product (GDP) Price Index for Government Consumption Expenditures  and Gross Investment (federal nondefense sector), with 2001 as the base  year. The price index reflects changes in the value of government output,  measured by the cost of inputs, including compensation of employees and  purchases of goods and services. Consistent with the proportion of the  Park Service\u2019s operating expenditures on personnel, this price index is  more heavily weighted by changes in federal workers\u2019 compensation than  the overall GDP price index. We gathered funding data from the Park  Service Budget Office on allocations from the ONPS account for daily  operations, projects, and other support programs. In addition to obtaining  data on allocations for daily operations on a servicewide level, we also  gathered data on the allocations for daily operations for individual park  units to determine how many have received operating increases or  decreases, and how many have remained relatively constant. We also  obtained data on recreation visits from the Park Service\u2019s Public Use  Statistics Office for park units to analyze allocations for daily operations in  relation to visitation rates. We also interviewed agency officials at Park  Service Headquarters, the Pacific West Region, the Intermountain Region,  and individual park units in addition to those listed below, including Mount  Rainier National Park, Olympic National Park, Point Reyes National  Seashore, and the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. We  assessed the reliability of the data by reviewing the methods of data  collection for relevant Park Service databases. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the uses in this report.", "To determine the funding trends for certain individual park units and how  the trends affected their ability to provide services to visitors, we collected  and analyzed data and reviewed operational impacts at the nonprobability  sample of 12 park units visited; we also interviewed park unit officials  about their funding trends, operational impacts, and policy requirements.  The 12 park units represent a cross-section of high-visitation parks (greater  than 500,000 visits per year) with potentially a large number of visitor  services, regional diversity, and a range of allocations for daily operations.  In addition, based on preliminary figures, we sought a cross-section of  parks that had sustained varying levels of growth in their allocations for  daily operations. Table 10 lists the 12 parks we visited, their primary  features, and their location.", "For each of the 12 park units, we collected data on funding trends, and park  operations including visitor services. We collected park data on budget  formulation, budget allocation, expenditures, and staffing trends. We sent  uniform data requests to the 12 park units, provided uniform guidance and  interactively worked with park officials to compile the data. We also  obtained information on operations such as (1) visitor and resource  protection (e.g. law enforcement rangers), (2) facilities operation and  maintenance (e.g. opening a campground or a visitor center and  maintaining a building or trail), (3) resource management (e.g. monitoring  the condition of threatened species or water quality), (4) interpretation and  education (e.g. interpretive rangers to provide educational programs), and  (5) park administration and support (e.g. updating computer systems or  attending training). Each of these operational areas has some role in  providing visitor services. We assessed the reliability of the data by  reviewing the methods of data collection for relevant Park Service  databases. We determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To identify recent management initiatives the Park Service has under way  to address fiscal performance and accountability for fiscal years 2001 to  2005, we gathered and reviewed documentation on several management  initiatives including the Business Plan Initiative, the Core Operations  Analysis, and the Park Scorecard.

We agree that the overall 2005 ONPS account was $1.7 billion\u2014an  increase of about 21 percent higher than in 2001.  We reported this  increase on an average annual basis of about 4.9 percent per year from  2001 through 2005, which is equivalent to about 21 percent from 2001 to  2005 in nominal terms.  In addition, we added information on the  department\u2019s comment that the Park Service has received significant  operating increases since 1980, particularly compared to other  domestic agencies. 2. For the park units we visited, we provided data and analysis on the  major funding trends for the park units, namely, allocations for daily  operations, project related allocations, visitor fees, concessions fees  and others.  We added examples of specific project allocations to the  park units we visited and how they were used as reported by the park  units.   3. On page 12 of the report, we provided information on the park service\u2019s  overall budget authority.  In addition, we agree that the allocations for  daily operations increased by about 14 percent from 2001 through 2005.   However, we believe it is also important to look at the change in  inflation-adjusted terms.  We believe the information we provided in the  report fairly describes the emphasis placed by the Congress and the  Administration on Park Service operations over our 5-year study time  frame.   4. According to the Department of the Interior, the allocation for daily  operations increased more in dollar terms than any other Park Service  program between 2001 and 2005.  However, on an average annual basis,  the percentage increase over this period was less than for other  programs.  In addition, after adjusting for inflation, the allocation for  daily operations fell slightly from about $903 million in 2001 to about  $893 million in 2005\u2014an average annual decline of about $2.5 million,  or 0.3 percent.   5. We disagree with the assertion that our analysis presents a \u201cfalse  dichotomy between operations and project funding.\u201d  This is addressed  more fully on pages 46 and 47. 6. On page 19 of the report, we include allocations for cyclic maintenance,  repair and rehabilitation, and the inventory and monitoring programs  from fiscal years 2001 through 2005.  We believe this reflects the Park  Service\u2019s continued emphasis on efforts to reduce its deferred  maintenance backlog and the monitoring and protection of the natural  resources in its charge.   7. The report provides the allocation trends for existing programs such as  the Inventory and Monitoring program, which is a large component of  the Natural Resource Challenge.  To provide additional information on  this effort, we added information in the report on the total allocations  from fiscal years 2001 through 2005\u2014$62 million in nominal dollars.   We also added examples of specific projects at park units we visited,  some of which were funded through project allocations under the  Natural Resource Challenge.  8. See comment 1 above and the table attached to the department\u2019s  comments.   9. Although analyzing Park Service spending per visit is an indicator, we  believe such analysis is of limited use because it does not indicate how  the expenditures are used.  10. See page 47 for our response.  In addition, we used examples from park  unit divisions that we visited in an effort to illustrate specific impacts  on park operations. As the department pointed out, Grand Teton  National Park\u2019s, overall FTE data indicates that seasonal employees  increased from 54 to 73 from 2001 through 2005. However, this increase  was mostly due to additional seasonal employees that were hired with  other authorized funding sources\u2014from 17 to 46.  The seasonal FTEs  paid for through daily operations allocations, in fact, decreased from 37  to 28.  Employees paid for through project-related allocations are hired  to conduct work on specific projects, while those funded through daily  operations allocations can be used more flexibly within a division to  carry out operational activities such as cleaning restrooms and picking- up litter. 11. We agree that operational funding is one of several factors that  contribute to employment levels at individual park units. Because  management at the park unit level has discretion to manage within  available resources, we asked park unit officials to report the level of  FTEs funded per division, per funding source, and per employee type.", "In this way, we were better able to substantiate the anecdotes we chose  to use in the report and to determine the parks\u2019 staffing composition.  For example, at Grand Teton National Park, the number of permanent  FTEs funded through daily operations allocations, from 2001 through  2005 decreased by 2, while those funded through project allocations  and other authorized funding sources increased by 16.  12. See page 47 which discusses our response to this comment.   13. We noted these additional non-park specific efforts on page 40 of the  report.   14. We agree that management decisions are made within a dynamic  environment of shifting priorities and resources. The specific examples  we provide highlight projects and activities that were accomplished, or  were not accomplished given the resources available to individual park  units. We agree that the Park Service has worked to accommodate the  impact of pay increases and across-the-board reductions; however, we  did not study the level of visitor satisfaction throughout this time frame.  Many of the park unit officials we spoke with explained that in an effort  to manage within available resources, certain activities that directly  affect the visitor can no longer be provided for with daily operation  allocations. The activities must then either be reduced, eliminated or  paid for using other authorized funding sources. For instance, we found  that some activities traditionally provided by a Park Service employee,  were now being provided by volunteers. 15. See page 48, which discusses our response to this comment. 16. At the time we visited Zion National Park, it had not yet completed it\u2019s  COA.  Since they completed their analysis, we have not had the  opportunity to validate the department\u2019s claim that Zion National Park  achieved an overtime and premium pay for savings of $30,000 as a  result of the COA.   17. We added additional information on page 40 of the report to reflect  these efforts.   18. See pages 48 and 49, which discuss our response to this comment. 19.
