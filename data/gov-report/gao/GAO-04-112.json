To address these questions, we selected 25 major equipment items, and determined (1) their current condition, (2) whether the services have mapped out a program strategy for these items, (3) whether current and projected funding is consistent with these strategies, and (4) whether these equipment items are capable of fulfilling their wartime missions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many of our assessments of 25 judgmentally selected critical equipment items indicated that the problems or issues we identified were not severe enough to warrant action by the Department of Defense, military services, and/or the Congress within the next 5 years. The condition of the items we reviewed varies widely from very poor for some of the older equipment items like the Marine Corps CH-46E Sea Knight Helicopter to very good for some of the newer equipment items like the Army Stryker vehicle. The problems we identified were largely due to (1) maintenance problems caused by equipment age and a lack of trained and experienced technicians, and (2) spare parts shortages. Although the services have mapped out program strategies for sustaining, modernizing, or replacing most of the equipment items we reviewed, some gaps exist. In some cases, such as the KC-135 Stratotanker and the Tomahawk missile, the services have not fully developed or validated their plans for the sustainment, modernization, or replacement of the items. In other cases, the services' program strategies for sustaining the equipment are hampered by problems or delays in the fielding of replacement equipment or in the vulnerability of the programs to budget cuts. For 15 of the 25 equipment items we reviewed, there appears to be a disconnect between the funding requested by the Department of Defense or projected in the Future Years Defense Program and the services' program strategies to sustain or replace the equipment items. For example, we identified fiscal year 2003 unfunded requirements, as reported by the services, totaling $372.9 million for four major aircraft--the CH-47D helicopter, F-16 fighter aircraft, C-5 transport aircraft, and CH-46E transport helicopter. The 25 equipment items we reviewed appear to be capable of fulfilling their wartime missions. While we were unable to obtain sufficient data to definitively assess wartime capability because of ongoing operations in Iraq, the services, in general, will always ensure equipment is ready to go to war, often through surging their maintenance operations and overcoming other obstacles. Some of the equipment items we reviewed, however, have capability deficiencies that could degrade their wartime performance in the near term."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many of the weapons and support equipment items in the Department of  Defense\u2019s inventory were purchased in the 1970s and 1980s, and are likely  to reach the end of their expected useful lives in this decade unless major  modernizations are made. Equipment age as well as delays in fielding  replacement systems can adversely affect maintenance costs, and  ultimately, equipment readiness and wartime capabilities. The added  effects of simultaneous military deployments and recent increases in  operating tempo place additional stress on equipment that is, in some  cases, more than 30 years old.", "The department is faced with the challenges of both sustaining and  transforming the current military force structure, including replacing aging  equipment. The costs associated with meeting these challenges are likely to  be significant. For example, a 2001 Joint Chiefs of Staff analysis of the  funding needed to sustain the current force structure concluded that a  procurement budget of $100 billion to $110 billion would be required  annually. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget request included a total of  about $72.7 billion for Defense procurement, an amount significantly less  than that identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition, the  Congressional Budget Office estimated that the investment needed to  develop and purchase new Defense equipment would likely increase from  $137 billion in fiscal year 2004 to a peak of about $223 billion in fiscal year  2013 if cost risk is considered. The impending reconstitution of equipment  resulting from Operation Iraqi Freedom will also require billions of dollars.  Competing for these funds for sustainment and modernization are the  Department of Defense\u2019s efforts to transform its current force structure  into a force that maintains or improves its lethality but deploys faster, is  lighter, and relies on information rather than brute force to defeat its  adversary.", "You asked us to assess the condition of key equipment items and to  determine if the services had adequate plans to address identified  deficiencies. Specifically, you asked that we determine which items  warranted immediate attention by the department and/or the Congress. You  also asked us to identify whether the department\u2019s procurement plans and  projected budgets are sufficient to sustain or improve these equipment  items. To address these objectives, we determined:  the current condition of key military equipment items;  whether the services have mapped out a long-range program strategy for  sustaining, modernizing, or replacing these equipment items consistent  with the current condition and expected service life;  whether current and projected funding for these equipment items  through fiscal year 2009 is consistent with the services\u2019 program  strategies for sustaining, modernizing, or replacing the equipment; and  whether these equipment items are generally capable of fulfilling their  wartime missions.", "As agreed with your offices, we worked with the military services to  judgmentally select 25 equipment items that are key in terms of meeting the  strategy outlined in the September 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review. We  selected approximately two weapons equipment items, two support  equipment items, and two munitions from the Army, Air Force, Navy, and  Marine Corps. We relied extensively on input from the military services  and prior GAO work to select equipment items that have been in use for a  number of years and are critical to supporting the services\u2019 missions. The  25 equipment items we selected were those that the military services  agreed were critical to meeting current capability requirements and defined  as essential to meet the strategy laid out under the Quadrennial Defense  Review. Our assessments apply only to the 25 equipment items we  reviewed. Consequently, the results of our assessments cannot be  projected to the entire inventory of Department of Defense equipment.", "Our analysis of the condition of these 25 equipment items focused on a  number of key metrics, including equipment age, performance, and use  from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2002. To assess condition, we obtained  data on equipment age and expected service life and other specific service  performance indicators such as mission capable rates, utilization rates,  and various other metrics. While we limited our observations and  assessments to equipment in the active duty inventory, the readiness data  and other metrics we collected from the military services also includes  equipment in the guard and reserve forces. Our review of the program  strategy for these equipment items focused on the extent to which the  services have developed or updated their plans for the sustainment,  modernization, or recapitalization of the equipment items to the end of the  items\u2019 useful service lives in order to meet mission requirements. Our  review of the funding for these equipment items focused on the extent to  which the services\u2019 requests for sustainment, modernization, and  recapitalization funds in the current and historical defense budgets and the  projected funding envisioned in the Future Years Defense Program reflect  their long-range program strategies. The Future Years Defense Program  reflects the department\u2019s official projection of the forces and resources  needed to support the programs approved by the Secretary of Defense for  the prior year, current year, biennial budget years, and the following  four years. According to Department of Defense officials, the Future Years  Defense Program takes the services\u2019 priorities into consideration,  balancing future investment and risk. Our review of the wartime capability  of the selected equipment items focused on the extent to which each of the  equipment items is capable of fulfilling its wartime mission. Because of  ongoing operations in Iraq and our limited access to the deployed units and  equipment performance indicators during these operations, we were  unable to obtain sufficient data to definitively assess wartime capability for  all of the 25 equipment items we reviewed. Therefore, our assessments of  wartime capability are limited to anecdotal evidence obtained primarily  through discussions with military service officials, program managers, and  equipment operators and maintainers. In some cases we were able to  obtain specific data regarding wartime capability for specific equipment  items; however, data availability was not consistent across all of the  military services.", "We met with officials from all four of the military services, one selected  combatant command, and several major commands. We also visited  selected units and maintenance facilities to observe the equipment items  during operation or under maintenance, and discussed condition and  wartime capability issues with program managers and equipment operators  and maintainers.", "To determine which equipment items require immediate attention by the  department, the military services, and/or the Congress, we developed an  assessment framework based on three criteria: (1) the extent of the  existence of a problem or issue, (2) the severity of the problem or issue,  and (3) the estimated time frame within which the problem or issue needs  to be addressed. To assess the relative ranking of the 25 equipment items,  we used a traffic light approach\u2014red, yellow, or green\u2014to indicate the  existence, severity, and urgency of the problem as follows:  indicates a problem or issue that is severe enough to warrant  action by the Department of Defense, the military services, and/or the  Congress within the next 1-3 years;  indicates a problem or issue that is severe enough to  warrant action by the Department of Defense, the military services  and/or the Congress within the next 3-5 years; and  indicates that we did not identify any specific problems or  issues at the time of our review, or that any existing problems or issues  we identified are not of a severe enough nature that we believe warrant  action by the Department of Defense, the military services and/or the  Congress within the next 5 years.", "While we attempted to obtain consistent metrics for each of the other three  categories across all four of the military services, data availability varied  significantly by service and type of equipment. Our assessments, therefore,  are based on the data available to us from multiple sources.  Our assessments represent the problems and issues we identified at the  specific point in time that we conducted our work, and can change quickly  given current events. Although our assessments for each of the  four categories\u2014condition, program strategy, funding, and wartime  capability\u2014are largely qualitative in nature, our analyses are based on data  and information provided by the military services and discussions with  military service officials and program managers for the individual  equipment items. We do not provide color-coded assessments for the  wartime capability of each equipment item in this report because, as  previously mentioned, we were unable to obtain adequate data to perform  a definitive assessment of wartime capabilities.", "For a complete description of our methodology, see appendix I.  Appendix II contains our detailed assessments for each of the  25 equipment items. We performed our review from September 2002  through October 2003 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The September 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) outlined a  strategy to sustain and transform the military force structure that has been  in place since the mid-1990s. In this review, the Department of Defense  (DOD) committed to selectively recapitalize older equipment items to meet  near-term challenges and to provide near-term readiness. DOD recognized  that the older equipment items critical to DOD\u2019s ability to defeat current  threats must be sustained as transformation occurs. DOD also recognizes  that recapitalization of all elements of U.S. forces since the end of the Cold  War has been delayed for too long. DOD procured few replacement  equipment items as the force aged throughout the 1990s, but it recognizes  that the force structure will eventually become operationally and  technologically obsolete without a significant increase in resources that are  devoted to the recapitalization of weapons systems.", "The annual Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) contains DOD\u2019s plans for  future programs and priorities. It presents DOD estimates of future funding  needs based on specific programs. Through the FYDP, DOD projects costs  for each element of those programs through a period of either 5 or 6 years  on the basis of proposals made by each of the military services and the  policy choices made by the current administration. The 2003 FYDP extends  from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2007, and the 2004 FYDP extends from  fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2009. Congress has expressed concerns that  the military modernization budget and funding levels envisioned in the  FYDP appear to be inadequate to replace aging equipment and incorporate  cutting-edge technologies into the force at the pace required by the QDR  and its underlying military strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Condition of Selected Equipment Items Varies Widely", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 1, of the 25 equipment items we reviewed, we assessed  the current condition of 3 of these equipment items as red, 11 as yellow,  and 10 as green. We were not able to obtain adequate data to assess the  condition for the Marine Corps Maverick Missile because the Marine Corps  does not track readiness trend data, such as mission capable or operational  readiness rates, for munitions as they do for aircraft or other equipment.", "Rotary wing lift helicopters, specifically the CH-46E and the CH-47D  helicopters, had the lowest condition rating among the equipment items we  reviewed, followed by fixed wing aircraft. Although we assessed the  condition as green for several equipment items such as the Army\u2019s Abrams  tank and the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck, and the Marine  Corps Light Armored Vehicle-Command and Control Variant, we identified  various problems and issues that could potentially worsen the condition of  some equipment items in the near future if not attended to. Specifically, for  the Abrams tank, and similarly for the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical  Truck, Army officials cited supply and maintenance challenges at the unit  level such as repair parts shortages, inadequate test equipment, and lack of  trained technicians that could impact the tank\u2019s condition in the near  future. While the Marine Corps has a Light Armored Vehicle-Command and  Control Variant upgrade program under way, Marine Corps officials caution  that any delays in the upgrade program could affect future readiness.  According to service officials and prior GAO reports, the services are  currently able to alleviate the effects of these problems, in many cases,  through increased maintenance hours and cannibalization of parts from  other equipment.", "The military services use a number of metrics to measure equipment  condition. Examples include mission capable rates for aircraft, operational  readiness rates for equipment other than aircraft, average age, and  utilization rates (e.g., flying hours). The equipment items we assessed as  red did not meet mission capable or operational readiness goals for  sustained periods, were older equipment items, and/or had high utilization  rates. For example, 10 of 16 equipment items for which readiness data were  available did not meet mission capable or operational readiness goals for  extended periods from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002. The  average age of 21 of the equipment items ranged from about 1 year to  43 years.", "Some equipment items for which we assessed the condition as yellow  also failed to meet mission capable or operational readiness goals and were  more than 10 years old. However, offsetting factors, such as how frequently  the equipment items did not meet readiness goals or by what percentage  they missed the goals, indicated less severe and urgent problems than  items we assessed as red. Other equipment items may have had high  mission capable rates, but because of overall age and related corrosion  problems, we assessed these equipment items as yellow to highlight the  fact that these items could potentially present problems if not attended to  within the next 3-5 years.", "The equipment items for which we assessed the condition as green  generally met mission capable and operational readiness goals. While three  of these equipment items\u2014the Army Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical  Truck, the Air Force F-16, and the Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicle- Command and Control Variant\u2014did not meet mission capable or  operational readiness goals, we assessed the condition as green because  the condition problems identified were less severe than the items we  assessed as red or yellow. For example, an equipment item may have been  slightly below the goal but only for non-deployed units, or the fleet-wide  goals may have been met for the equipment item overall, although the  specific model we reviewed did not meet the goals. In addition, although  the rates for an equipment item may be slightly below its goal, it may be  able to meet operational requirements. We also considered any upgrades  that were underway at the time of our review that would extend the service  life of the equipment.", "Maintenance problems were most often cited by the Army and Marine  Corps officials we met with as the cause for equipment condition  deficiencies for the equipment items we reviewed. Equipment operators  and maintainers that we met with believed equipment degradation was the  result of maintenance problems in one of two categories\u2014parts or  personnel. The parts problems include availability of parts or logistics and  supply system problems. Availability problems occur when there are parts  shortages, unreliable parts, or obsolete parts due to the advanced age of the  equipment items. Logistics and supply system problems occur when it  takes a long time to order parts or the unit requesting the parts has a low  priority. In June, July, and August of 2003, we issued six reports  highlighting deficiencies in DOD\u2019s and the services\u2019 management of critical  spare parts. We also issued a report on problems DOD and the services  are having dealing with corrosion for military equipment and that they had  not taken advantage of opportunities to mitigate the impact of corrosion on  equipment. Maintenance problems due to personnel include (1) lack of  trained and experienced technicians and (2) increases in maintenance  man-hours required to repair some of these aging equipment items. We  reported in April 2003, for example, that DOD has not adequately  positioned or trained its civilian workforce at its industrial activities to  meet future requirements. Consequently, the Department may continue to  have difficulty maintaining adequate skills at its depots to meet  maintenance requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Have Mapped Out Long-Range Program Strategies for Sustaining and Modernizing Most Equipment Items but Some Gaps Exist", "paragraphs": ["In most cases, the services have developed long-range program strategies  for sustaining and modernizing the 25 equipment items that we reviewed.  However, some gaps exist because the services either have not validated  their plans for the sustainment, modernization, or replacement of the  equipment items, or the services\u2019 program strategies for sustaining the  equipment are hampered by problems or delays in the fielding of  replacement equipment or in the vulnerability of the programs to  budget cuts.", "The two equipment items for which we assessed the program strategy as  red are the KC-135 Stratotanker and the Tomahawk Cruise Missile because,  although the services may have developed long-range program strategies  for these equipment items, they have not validated or updated their plans  for sustaining, modernizing, or replacing these items. In the case of the  KC-135 Stratotanker, the Air Force has embarked on a controversial,  expensive program to replace the tanker fleet, but as we have reported, it  has not demonstrated the urgency of acquiring replacement aircraft and it  has not defined the requirements for the number of aircraft that will be  needed. Similarly, for the Tomahawk missile, the Navy has not identified  how many of these missiles it will need in the future, thereby significantly  delaying the acquisition process.", "We assessed the program strategy for eight of the services\u2019 program  strategies as yellow, some of them because they will be affected by delays  in the fielding of equipment to replace the items in our review. According to  service officials, as the delivery of new replacement equipment items is  delayed, the services must continue using the older equipment items to  meet mission requirements. Consequently, the services may incur  increased costs due to maintenance that was not programmed for  equipment retained in inventory beyond the estimated service life. For  example, the planned replacement equipment for the Marine Corps CH-46E  helicopter (i.e., the MV-22 Osprey) has been delayed by about 3 years and is  not scheduled to be fielded until 2007. DOD has also reportedly cut the  number of replacement aircraft it plans to purchase by about 8 to 10 over  the next few years, thus the Marine Corps will have to retain more CH-46E  helicopters in its inventory. Program management officials have requested  additional funds to repair airframe cracks, replace seats, and move to light- weight armor to reduce aircraft weight, engine overhauls, and avionics  upgrades to keep the aircraft safe and reliable until fielding of the  replacement equipment. According to Marine Corps officials, the CH-46E  program strategy has also been hampered by the 5-year rule, which limits  installation of new modifications other than safety modifications into the  aircraft unless 5 years of service are left on the aircraft. Procurement of the  replacement equipment for the Marine Corps\u2019 Assault Amphibian Vehicle  has also been delayed (by 2 years), and it is not scheduled for full fielding  until 2012. The program strategy for the Assault Amphibian Vehicle  includes upgrades, but for only 680 of the 1,057 vehicles in the inventory.", "We also assessed the program strategy for some equipment items as yellow  if they were vulnerable to budget cuts. For example, according to Navy  officials, the Navy frigates\u2019 modernization program is susceptible to budget  cuts because the frigates\u2019 future role is uncertain as the Littoral Combat  ship is developed. In addition, the program strategy for the frigates is  questionable because of the uncertainty about the role frigates will play.  Specifically, Navy frigates are increasingly used for homeland defense  missions, and their program strategy has not been updated to reflect that  they will be used more often and in different ways. The Army\u2019s CH-47D  helicopter is also vulnerable to budget cuts. The Army plans to upgrade 279  CH-47D helicopters to F models under its recapitalization program; the  upgrade includes a purchase of CH-47F model helicopters planned in fiscal  year 2004. The fiscal year 2004 budget for this purchase has already been  reduced. Program managers had also planned to purchase 16 engines, but  funding was transferred to requests for higher priority programs.", "We assessed the program strategy for the remaining 15 equipment items as  green because the services have developed long-range program strategies  for sustaining, modernizing, or replacing these items consistent with their  estimated remaining service life. For example, the Army has developed  program strategies for all tracked and wheeled vehicles in our sample.  Likewise, the Air Force has developed program strategies for most fixed  wing aircraft in our sample throughout the FYDP. In the case of munitions,  with the exception of the Navy Tomahawk Cruise Missile and Standard  Missile-2, the services have developed program strategies for sustaining  and modernizing the current missile inventory in our sample."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requested Funding Does Not Reflect the Services\u2019 Long-Range Program Strategies", "paragraphs": ["In many cases, the funding DOD has requested or is projecting for  future years in the FYDP for the equipment items we reviewed does not  reflect the military services\u2019 long-range program strategies for equipment  sustainment, modernization, or recapitalization. According to service  officials, the services submit their budgets to DOD and the Department  has the authority to increase or decrease the service budgets based upon  the perceived highest priority needs. According to DOD officials, for  future years\u2019 funding, the FYDP strikes a balance between future  investment and program risk, taking into consideration the services\u2019 stated  requirements as approved by DOD. As shown in table 1, we assessed the  funding for 15 of the 25 equipment items as red or yellow because the  department\u2019s requested funding did not adequately reflect its long-range  program strategies for modernization, maintenance, and spare parts. For  example, as shown in table 2, we identified fiscal year 2003 unfunded  requirements totaling $372.9 million for four major aircraft equipment  items we reviewed.", "The most significant funding shortfalls occurred when parts, equipment  upgrades, and maintenance were not fully funded or when replacement  equipment items were not fielded as scheduled. The equipment items for  which we assessed the funding as yellow had funding shortfalls of a lesser  extent than the red items. Although we assessed the funding as green for  the remaining nine equipment items, program managers raised concerns  about the availability of operation and maintenance funds in future years,  and stated that insufficient operation and maintenance funds could  potentially result in more severe condition problems and increased future  maintenance costs.", "According to service officials, funding shortfalls occurred when parts,  equipment upgrades, or maintenance were not fully funded or funds were  reduced to support higher priority service needs. As we have previously  reported, DOD increases or decreases funds appropriated by Congress as  funding priorities change. Other shortfalls occur when units subsequently  identify maintenance requirements that were not programmed into the  original budget requests. In addition, when replacement equipment items  are not fielded as scheduled, the services must continue to maintain these  aging equipment items for longer than anticipated. Equipment items  considered legacy systems such as the Marine Corps CH-46E helicopter  may not receive funding on the basis of anticipated fielding of replacement  equipment in the near future. The gaps between funding for legacy systems  (which are heavily used and critical to the services\u2019 mission) and funding  for future replacement equipment result when fielding of the new  equipment has been delayed and budgets have been reduced for  maintenance of legacy systems. Funding for these legacy systems may also  be a target for funding reductions to support higher service priority items.", "According to the program managers for some of the equipment items we  reviewed (including the Army Abrams tank, Heavy Expanded Mobility  Tactical Truck, and Navy EA-6B Prowler), as the services retain aging  equipment in their inventories longer than expected, maintenance  requirements increase, thus increasing operation and maintenance costs.  Program managers raised concerns about the availability of sufficient  operation and maintenance funding to sustain these aging equipment items  in the future. Also, program managers stated that present sustainment  funds (i.e., operation and maintenance funds) may only cover a  small percentage of the equipment\u2019s requirements, and they frequently rely  on procurement funds to subsidize equipment improvements common to  multiple equipment items. However, once production of the equipment  item has been completed and procurement funds are no longer available  for use, program managers must compete with the rest of the service for  limited operation and maintenance funds. Program managers expressed  concerns that operation and maintenance funds are not currently available  to fund equipment improvements and noted operation and maintenance  funds may not be available in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equipment Is Generally Capable of Fulfilling Wartime Missions despite Some Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of equipment condition, the performance of the  equipment items in recent military conflicts, and discussions with service  officials, program managers, and equipment operators and maintainers, we  found that most of the equipment items we reviewed are capable of  fulfilling their wartime missions despite some limitations.

Some  of these equipment items (such as the Marine Corps CH-46E helicopter and  all Air Force aircraft except the B-2) were used in Operation Desert Storm  and have been used in other diverse operations such as those in Kosovo  and Afghanistan. With the exception of the Army Stryker and GMLRS, all of  the equipment items we reviewed were used recently in Operation Iraqi  Freedom.", "The services, in general, ensure that equipment is ready for deployment by  surging maintenance operations when necessary. Only one equipment item,  the Marine Corps CH-46E helicopter, could not accomplish its intended  wartime mission due to lift limitations.

However, these officials  identified a number of specific concerns for some of these equipment items  that limit their wartime capabilities to varying degrees. For example, only  26 out of 213 Marine Corps Assault Amphibian Vehicles at Camp Lejeune  had been provided enhanced protective armor kits prior to Operation Iraqi  Freedom. According to Marine Corps officials at Camp Lejeune, lack of the  enhanced protective armor left the vehicles vulnerable to the large caliber  ammunition used by the Iraqi forces. According to Navy officials,  warfighting capabilities of the Navy EA-6B Prowler aircraft will be  degraded if their capabilities are not upgraded and the outer wing panels  are not replaced.

The department stated,  however, that through its past Planning, Programming, and Budgeting  System and the more current Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and  Execution processes, the department had and continues to have an annual  procedure to reassess program strategies to ensure equipment  maintenance, modernization, and recapitalization funding supports the  most recent Defense strategy. While we acknowledge that these budget  processes may provide a corporate, department-level review of what is  needed to accomplish the national defense mission, the department\u2019s  budget and the information it provides to the Congress do not clearly  identify the funding priorities for individual equipment items.  For example,  although the funding to sustain the department\u2019s major equipment items is  included in its Operation and Maintenance budget accounts, these budget  accounts do not specifically identify funding for individual equipment  items.  We continue to believe that the department, in conjunction with the  military services, needs to develop a more comprehensive and transparent  approach for assessing the condition of key legacy equipment items,  developing program strategies to address critical equipment condition  deficiencies, and prioritizing the required funding.", "The department did not concur with our second recommendation that, in  reconciling the program strategies to funding requests, it should highlight  for the Congress, in conjunction with its fiscal year 2005 budget  submissions, the risks involved in sustaining key equipment items if  adequate funding support is not requested and the steps the department is  taking to address those risks. Specifically, the department stated that its  budget processes and the annual Defense budget provide the Congress a  balanced program with all requirements \u201cadequately\u201d funded and that the  unfunded requirements identified by the program managers or the services  may not be validated at the department level. While we agree that the  department\u2019s budget may identify its highest funding priorities at the  department wide level, it does not provide the Congress with an  assessment of equipment condition deficiencies, unfunded requirements  identified by the services, and the potential risks associated with not fully  funding the services\u2019 program strategies.  In this report, we identify a  number of examples of equipment condition deficiencies and  inconsistencies between the program strategies and the funding requests to  address those deficiencies that were not fully addressed in the  department\u2019s budget documents. We believe that the Congress, in its  oversight of the department\u2019s major equipment programs, needs to be  better informed of specific equipment condition deficiencies, the long- range strategies and required funding to address those deficiencies, and the  risks associated with not adequately funding specific equipment  modernization and recapitalization requirements.", "The department also did not concur with our recommendation that it  should identify for the Congress the key equipment items that, because of  impaired condition and their importance to meeting the department\u2019s  military strategies, should be given the highest priority for sustainment,  recapitalization, modernization, or replacement. In its comments, the  department stated that, in developing the annual Defense budget, it has  already allocated resources according to its highest priorities. The  department further stated that key items that are vital to accomplishing the  department\u2019s mission are allocated funding in order to meet the  requirements of the most current Defense strategy, and that there is no  need to restate these priorities with a list. Similar to our rebuttal to the  department\u2019s response to our second recommendation as discussed above,  we do not believe that the department\u2019s annual budget provides the  Congress with sufficient information on the most severe equipment  condition deficiencies and the funding priorities for addressing those  deficiencies. We believe that a separate analysis, in conjunction with the  department\u2019s budget submissions, that highlights the most critical  equipment condition deficiencies, the planned program strategies for  addressing those deficiencies, and the related funding priorities is needed  to provide the Congress with the information it needs to make informed  budget decisions.", "The department also noted in its written comments that our report  identifies the CH-47D, CH-46E, KC-135, EA-6B, Standard Missile-2, and the  Tomahawk missile as equipment items with problems and issues that  warrant action within the next 1 to 3 years.  The department stated that it  would continue to reassess these equipment items as it goes through its  resource allocation process.", "Lastly, the department provided technical comments concerning our  assessments of specific equipment items in appendix II, including the   KC-135 Stratotanker, Assault Amphibian Vehicle, MV-22, Tomahawk Cruise  Missile, and the CH-46E Sea Knight Helicopter.  We reviewed and  incorporated these technical comments, as appropriate.  The revisions that  we made based on these technical comments did not change our  assessments for the individual equipment items.  In some cases, the data  and information the department provided in its technical comments  resulted from program and funding decisions that were made subsequent  to our review.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of  the Marine Corps; and other interested parties.
