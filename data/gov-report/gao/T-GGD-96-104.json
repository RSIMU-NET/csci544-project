First, in January 1993, ATF initiated a National Firearms Program, which consisted of several regulatory enforcement strategies, including a strategy to closely scrutinize applicants for federal firearms dealer licenses and the operations of licensees to ensure strict compliance with the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended. Under this program, the number of ATF full field inspections of firearms dealers and licensees increased. According to ATF, several factors led to this increased enforcement strategy. These factors included rising violence associated with the illegal use and sale of firearms, national media attention on the ease of obtaining a firearms dealer license, and ATF data that indicated that many licensees may not have been engaged in a firearms business.", "As a result, the number of ATF full field inspections of all applicants for federal firearms licenses and the operations of all such licensees increased from about 19,900 in fiscal year 1992 to a high of about 27,000 in fiscal year 1993\u2014the period during which the National Firearms Program was initiated. Furthermore, from 1993 to 1995, the number of ATF inspections generally averaged about 9 percent of the total licensees, compared to 7 percent and lower before fiscal year 1993.", "As a result of its increased inspections, according to ATF, about 7,600 firearms dealer licensees voluntarily surrendered their licenses in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, the only 2 years for which ATF collected such data.", "Under ATF\u2019s National Firearms Program, when an inspection showed that a dealer was not \u201cengaged in a firearms business\u201d at the location shown on the license, ATF inspectors were to advise the dealer to voluntarily surrender the license before implementing a formal revocation action.", "In addition, ATF used telephone interviews, called preliminary inspections, in fiscal years 1993 through 1995 as a means of scrutinizing federal firearms dealer applicants. According to ATF, a substantial portion of the approximately 2,500 applications abandoned and 7,200 applications withdrawn by applicants during fiscal year 1993 was directly attributable to ATF\u2019s preliminary inspections.", "A second factor contributing to the declines was an August 1993 memorandum from the President directing Treasury and ATF to take actions to ensure compliance with federal firearms license requirements. The President pointed out that there were over 287,000 federal firearms licensees (all categories), many of which he stated probably should not have been licensed because they were not engaged in a legitimate firearms business.", "A third contributing factor was the Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993, passed by Congress in late November 1993. This act increased the licensing fees for obtaining and renewing a federal firearms dealer license.", "A fourth contributing factor was ATF\u2019s revisions to the licensing application process that were done in late 1993 and early 1994 in response to the President\u2019s August 1993 memorandum. ATF significantly revised the application form by adding a number of questions and requirements for supporting information to help it determine whether applicants intended to engage in the firearms business. For example, ATF required applicants to (1) submit fingerprints and photographs of themselves, (2) furnish a diagram of the business premises where their firearms inventories were located, and (3) provide a description of their security system for safeguarding firearms inventories.
