Progress was made in developing data systems, selection processes, and program rules, but allocations were delayed because of the various start-up tasks associated with a new program, especially in establishing the rules on using the allocated credits. CDEs that received NMTC allocations (allocatees) proposed projects to serve urban, rural, and mixed areas, as well as local, state, multiple-local, multistate, and national areas. The distribution of state and local allocations was not concentrated in any one state or in a few states. All allocatees reported at least some prior experience in low-income communities, particularly in providing capital to low-income communities. The CDFI Fund and IRS have identified data with which to monitor compliance with allocation agreements and tax laws, and are developing systems to collect the data. However, many details remain to be settled on how the data will actually be used to monitor compliance. Agency officials believe they have time to devise their compliance monitoring processes. However, they do not have schedules or documented plans for ensuring that compliance monitoring processes will be in place when needed, and they have other tasks to complete.

The darkened areas of figure 1 illustrate that census  tracts qualifying for NMTCs are widely distributed across the nation.   Specifically, about 39 percent of all census tracts qualify for NMTCs and 36  percent of the nation\u2019s population lives in these census tracts (see app. I for  a table of NMTC eligibility as a percentage of state population and of state  census tracts)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Certification and Allocation Process", "paragraphs": ["The CDFI Fund has the authority to allocate NMTCs under the direction of  the Secretary of the Treasury. The legislation limits the allocation of equity  eligible for tax credits from 2001 through 2007 from $1 billion to $3.5 billion  per year, totaling $15 billion over the 7 years.", "The first step in the NMTC program is to apply to the CDFI Fund for  certification as a CDE, which is an entity that manages investments for  community development.  Nonprofit entities and for-profit entities may be  certified as CDEs.  To be certified, the CDE must be a domestic corporation  or partnership, for federal tax purposes, and be duly organized under the  laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or established. A CDE  must have a primary mission of serving or providing investment capital for  low-income communities or low-income persons, and must maintain  accountability to residents of these low-income communities by filling at  least 20 percent of the CDE governing or advisory board positions with  low-income community representatives.", "The second step for a CDE is to apply for an allocation of tax credits from  the CDFI Fund.  CDEs are to use the tax credits allocated to attract  investors.  Both for-profit and nonprofit CDEs can apply for allocations of  NMTCs.  However, only a for-profit CDE may offer NMTCs to its investors  while a nonprofit CDE must intend to transfer the allocation to one or more  for-profit subsidiaries.  The application asks a series of questions about the  CDE, its track record, the dollar amount of allocated tax credits being  requested, and the plans for using the credits to support activities in low- income communities.", "Applications are then reviewed and scored by a mix of CDFI Fund staff and  external reviewers who have experience in business, real estate, or  community development finance.  The CDFI Fund considers reviewers\u2019  scores, reviews applications, and awards an amount of allocated tax credits  to those applicants judged to be the most highly qualified.  These decisions  on scoring applications and awarding allocations are to be based on a range  of criteria under which applicants can receive scores of up to 25 points in  each of the four following areas:    community impact, which is the extent to which the applicant targets  particularly economically distressed communities, has the active  participation of community representatives in designing and  implementing its business plan, and can demonstrate community  development and economic impacts;   business strategy, which is having prior performance providing similar  kinds of products and services\u2014applicants can score an additional 5  points by demonstrating a record of successful investment in  disadvantaged communities or businesses and another 5 points by  investing in businesses unrelated to the applicant;  capitalization strategy, which is securing investor commitments; and   management capacity, which is experience investing in low-income  communities.", "Figure 2 shows what happens after the allocations are made to CDEs  (i.e.,  CDE allocatees).  The basic process is that investors acquire stock or  capital interest in CDEs in order to receive the tax credits.  In turn, these  CDEs must use \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the proceeds in making qualified low- income community investments (QLICI).  Eligible QLICIs might include  loans or investments to businesses; development of commercial, industrial,  and retail real estate projects; and development of for-sale housing in low- income areas.", "Beginning with the first year of the investment in a CDE, investors are  entitled to claim the tax credit over a 7-year period with 5 percent of the  initial investment claimed for each of the first 3 years and 6 percent for  each of the final 4 years, or a total of 39 percent over the 7 years. During the  7-year period, NMTCs could be subject to a recapture event if the CDE  allocatee (1) ceases to be a CDE, (2) does not satisfy the \u201csubstantially all\u201d  requirement, or (3) redeems the investment.  In general, a recapture event  means that investors in that CDE are required to increase their income tax  liability by the credits previously used plus interest for each resulting  underpayment of tax.  The recapture of credits affects the investor who  originally purchased the equity investment and subsequent holders.    Investors cannot continue to claim the tax credit if their equity investment  is returned to them before the end of the 7-year period.  A CDE is required  to provide notice, within a certain period, to (1) any investor who acquires  a qualified equity investment (QEI) in the CDE that entitles the investor to  claim the NMTC and (2) each current and prior holder of a QEI if a  recapture event has occurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NMTC Allocation Agreements", "paragraphs": ["After being selected to receive an allocation, each CDE allocatee must sign  an allocation agreement with the CDFI Fund before officially designating  QEIs and offering tax credits to its investors.

While most sections of the agreement are the same for every  allocatee, other sections, such as the authorized uses of an allocation (e.g.,  loans to businesses and equity investments in other CDEs), are tailored to  each CDE allocatee.", "As specified in the IRS regulations, CDE allocatees must issue the NMTCs  to investors within 5 years of receiving an allocation.  CDEs that receive  returns of capital from investing in QLICIs have 12 months to reinvest those  funds in QLICIs; reinvestment is not required in the final year of the 7-year  credit allowance period.  CDEs also must agree to periodically report data  on investors and project activities.", "The rules also govern the types of businesses that can participate in NMTC  projects.  In general, a qualified active low-income community business  (QALICB) is a corporation (including nonprofit corporations) or  partnership that satisfies certain requirements, including the following:   Gross income. Generally, at least 50 percent of the total gross income  must be derived from the active conduct of a qualified business within  any low-income community.", "Tangible property. At least 40 percent of the use of tangible property  must be within a low-income community.", "Services performed.

In general, for a business to be treated as a QALICB, the CDE  must have \u201creasonably expected\u201d at the time of the investment that the  business would remain in compliance with the QALICB requirements for  the term of the investment.  Except for those requirements that affect a  QALICB, the CDE is not required to monitor whether a business continues  to comply with requirements after the initial investment is made.", "As investors provide equity to CDEs and CDEs invest in low-income  communities, the CDFI Fund is to monitor compliance with the allocation  agreements.  IRS is to monitor compliance with the tax consequences of  NMTC allocations, focusing on whether CDEs met the \u201csubstantially all\u201d  requirement.

We identified the issues and counted their frequency based on interviews  with majority and minority staff at seven congressional committees and  subcommittees as we prepared our 2002 report (see app. II).  We could  not analyze one of the issues on the size of the CDEs because of concerns  about the data reported.  The identified issues that we could analyze were  as follows:  geographic distribution of the community development projects  proposed by CDE allocatees, including the scope of the area to be  served ranging from local to national, the type of community served  such as urban or rural, and the specific states to be served;  experience in serving low-income communities; and  type of service activity proposed for the community development  project.", "Because the data on these issues came from proposals made in  applications filed by the 66 CDE allocatees rather than the signed  allocation agreements, we cannot say that the CDEs will actually serve the  geographic areas or provide the types of service proposed.   Much of the  data on actual investments and projects will not be known until later in  2004.

Officials have taken  steps, like combining the allocation limitations for the first 4 years into 2,  which they believe will mitigate any adverse effects of the delays.", "To prepare to make the allocations and negotiate the allocation  agreements, the CDFI Fund used a three-phased approach that started after  Congress authorized the NMTC program in December 2000.    These phases  implemented a variety of tasks, as follows:  Phase 1 on Initial Policy and Regulatory Development (January 2001 to  December 2001):  The CDFI Fund developed program guidance,  certification applications, and other documents; assisted IRS in  developing regulations; and reached out to CDEs and other  stakeholders.", "Phase 2 on Policy Refinement and Award Implementation (January 2002  to March 2003):  The CDFI Fund certified 1,021 CDEs, developed  applicant selection policies, reviewed 345 allocation applications, and  announced the allocations in March 2003.", "Phase 3 on Ongoing Allocations, Post-Award Activities, and Compliance  Monitoring (March 2003 projected through July 2004):  The CDFI Fund  negotiated allocation agreements and debriefed the 279 applicants that  did not receive allocations in round one.

For example, CDFI Fund officials  noted that they had hoped to make the allocation decisions for 2001 and  2002 during 2002 rather than in March 2003, but they experienced delays in  publishing the application announcement, developing the application  review system, and dealing with a larger pool of applicants than  anticipated.  Similarly, CDFI Fund officials said they had hoped to have  allocation agreements ready about the same time as the allocation  announcement in March 2003 rather than in September 2003 but were  delayed due to the longer than anticipated time to publish the initial  document; delays in developing and clearing the document; and handling  comments from allocatees, investors, and attorneys on the program\u2019s rules  and processes.", "It is not clear whether the 3-year period between program authorization  and the first potential NMTC investments had any effects beyond delaying  the projects to assist low-income communities and persons.  CDFI Fund  officials believe that delays have not hurt the program and that they took  some steps to minimize any effects.  For example, the CDFI Fund released  multiple draft versions of the allocation agreement template, in part so that  investors wishing to make investments into CDEs in advance of the  allocation agreements being finalized would better understand the terms  and conditions of those aggreements.  Also, the first four annual rounds  were aggregated into two multiyear rounds\u2014$2.5 billion for 2001 and 2002  and $3.5 billion for 2003 and 2004.  The CDFI Fund has legislative authority  to carry over unused limitations on annual allocations.

For example,  question 67 of the application for the first round of allocations asked if an  applicant\u2019s investments or activities would be targeted principally to  communities with higher levels of distress than the minimum poverty and  income criteria required by the NMTC program.  Section 3.2 is to include  related information from those CDEs that checked \u201cYes\u201d to question 67.", "Web-based systems designed by the CDFI Fund are expected to be the  primary sources of the data that the CDFI Fund and IRS plan to use to  monitor compliance.  CDFI Fund officials said that all the systems and  processes for capturing and using the data from all CDE allocatees should  be ready by August 2004.  Figure 3 shows the planned integration of the  data systems.", "A fuller description of the purposes and time frames for these systems  follows.", "Allocation Agreement System (AAS):  AAS populates fields in the  allocation agreements with certain allocatee information and sends an  uneditable electronic copy of the allocation agreement to the CDE.   CDFI Fund officials told us that AAS was functional in August 2003.", "Allocation Tracking System (ATS):  ATS allows reporting by CDEs of  specific data about the use of approved allocations, such as the type,  amount, and timing of investments.  It will also track various self- reported data on investors in the CDEs.  IRS may use the data to track  compliance with timing requirements in the IRS regulations.  ATS was  on-line in November 2003, according to CDFI Fund officials.", "Community Investment Impact System (CIIS):  CIIS is an annual  reporting system that collects various data about the CDEs as  institutions and about their transactions.  These data are to be used to  analyze what is happening with CDEs and investment projects as well as  to monitor compliance.

Officials believe they will  have sufficient time to develop their compliance monitoring plans more  fully.", "A number of details remain to be settled in determining how the actual  monitoring of compliance will occur and how the CDFI Fund and IRS will  share data.  For example, the CM Tool is to include various \u201cred flags\u201d on  noncompliance by CDEs related to their adherence to IRS regulations and  CDFI Fund compliance concerns.  Presumably, the flags would trigger  follow-up to determine whether CDEs actually have been noncompliant.   According to officials at both agencies, neither the CDFI Fund nor IRS has  yet developed its \u201cred flags.\u201d  Furthermore, whether, when, and how follow- up would occur has not been determined by either agency.  The CDFI Fund  also expects that audits will be used to help determine CDEs\u2019 compliance  with recapture events and allocation agreements.

Similarly, processes beyond audits for  following up on potential noncompliance have not been defined.", "IRS expects to monitor CDEs\u2019 adherence to the \u201csubstantially all\u201d test in  part by accessing the CDFI Fund\u2019s data.  IRS also expects that audits will be  a tool for determining CDEs\u2019 compliance and is considering options for  selecting CDEs for audit.  IRS has told us that it may conduct 5 to 10  random audits of CDEs to help gather baseline data on CDEs.  Other audit  selection options include use of the CDFI Fund\u2019s data to trigger an audit or  as an adjunct to other IRS audit work that may relate to an investor or CDE.", "CDFI Fund and IRS officials have been developing a memorandum of  understanding that would define the relationship between the agencies and  their respective roles in monitoring aspects of CDEs\u2019 compliance.  For  example, both agencies have an interest in monitoring whether an  investment has been redeemed.  The memorandum is expected to, for  example, define how IRS would access the CDFI Fund\u2019s data and how and  when the CDFI Fund should alert IRS to CDEs that no longer qualify due to  violations of the primary mission and accountability tests.  As of   January 15, 2004, the memorandum had not been finalized.", "CDFI Fund and IRS officials believe that they have time to finalize their  processes for ensuring NMTC compliance.  According to a CDFI Fund  official, due to the timing of the allocation agreements, very few CDE  allocatees are likely to receive QEIs and make QLICIs in 2003.  Thus the  first significant data available to be used for aspects of compliance  regarding QLICIs will not be available until CDEs file CIIS reports at the  conclusion of their fiscal year 2004; some data will not be available to IRS  until 2005, after CDEs and investors file tax returns for tax year 2004.   Additionally, CDFI Fund and IRS officials note that the potential for  recapture of tax credits also provides an incentive to investors to help  ensure that CDEs comply with the NMTC program.  Finally, allocatees will  be required to supply the CDFI Fund with copies of their audited financial  statements, with which the CDFI Fund plans to verify some data reported  by allocatees.", "Although the CDFI Fund and IRS have some time to complete their  processes for monitoring compliance, officials do not have schedules or  documented plans for ensuring that compliance monitoring processes will  be in place when needed.  To date, some CDFI Fund self-imposed deadlines  for making allocations and finalizing allocation agreements have been  missed.  CDFI Fund officials also face a continuing workload apart from  finalizing and implementing these monitoring plans.  Officials are currently  managing the second round of allocations and, as discussed below,  considering how to evaluate the outcomes of the NMTC program.  Further,  although much of the activity that will need to be monitored may not occur  until well into 2004, some parts of the compliance monitoring may need to  be developed before others.  The \u201cred flags\u201d that are intended to surface  potential noncompliance could be needed during 2004 to alert the CDFI  Fund and IRS to possible recapture events.

For example, officials sought the advice of  experts in March 2002 on the types of data that would be useful for  evaluating the program.  However, there was no consensus on the specific  data required to evaluate the NMTC program.  CDFI Fund officials also  drafted a document in May 2002 outlining a broad preliminary framework  for evaluating the NMTC program.  The preliminary evaluation proposal  outlines topics to consider in measuring NMTC program impacts.  The  topics proposed for assessment are the (1) flow of private capital to CDEs,  (2) CDE performance, and (3) outcomes at the community level.", "However, evaluating the success of economic development programs like  the NMTC program is challenging.  Our 2002 report detailed some of those  challenges, all of which apply in the case of the NMTC program.  For  example, program impact is usually difficult to determine because it is hard  to know what participants and others who invest in low-income  communities would have done absent the program.  If a program did not  exist, what would investors have done with their capital?  Would the low- income communities have had more or less economic development due to  business growth?  Further, program effectiveness is difficult to measure  when the program is small relative to total economic activity within the  geographic area of interest.  These challenges will be particularly  problematic for the NMTC program because 36 percent of the U.S.  population and 39 percent of the census tracts are eligible.  Many of the  eligible communities would already have significant business activities that  could mask the NMTC impacts.", "In part due to these challenges and the amount of expertise needed to deal  with them, CDFI Fund officials have decided to contract for evaluation  services.  CDFI Fund officials expect to have a contractor design and  implement an NMTC program evaluation.  Officials plan to issue a request  for proposals in summer 2004 and hire a contractor in early fiscal year  2005.  CDFI Fund officials have not yet developed the statement of work  for the contract and do not have an expected completion date for the  evaluation design or the study itself.  CDFI Fund officials note that since  initial investments under the program will not likely begin until 2004 (as  described above), program results will not be available for evaluation until  enough time elapses for the investments to generate an effect.", "To assist the contractor, the CDFI Fund is collecting significant amounts of  data that officials believe may be useful for the evaluation.  Additionally,  the CDFI Fund requires CDEs to maintain additional records.  According to  CDFI Fund officials, data on whether an investment recipient (a QALICB)  is minority- or woman-owned are to be captured by the CDFI Fund data  systems for all CDE allocatees specifically for evaluation purposes.  In  addition, CDFI Fund officials said that some of the other data collected  from CDE allocatees through these data systems could be useful to future  evaluators, for example, the location and type of investments made, the  type of business receiving the investment, and the gross revenues of the  business.  Also, officials noted that section 6.4 of the allocation agreement  provides that CDEs \u201cshall retain all financial records, supporting  documents, and any other records pertinent to the NMTC Allocation.\u201d   Officials expect that the data maintained under section 6.4 may also be  used for the evaluation.

Although we did not have evidence that investor  confidence was built, we agree that both agencies took steps to offset the  delays in finalizing allocation agreements.  Although the look back  provision may have helped offset delays, we did not change our report  because we had already mentioned the release of the draft templates as  well as other steps.", "Third, the CDFI Fund said that although data about any investments being  made in CDEs are already being collected through ATS, data on the use of  those investments in actual projects are not yet being collected.
