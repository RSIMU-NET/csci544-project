The Congress enacted provisions in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) to delay the termination. The BIPA provisions directed GAO to report on the number of outsourcing hospitals and their service volumes and the effect of the termination of direct laboratory payments on hospitals and laboratories, as well as on access to technical pathology services by Medicare beneficiaries. GAO analyzed Medicare inpatient and outpatient hospital and laboratory claims data from 2001 to develop its estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2001, approximately 95 percent of all Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) hospitals--hospitals that are paid predetermined fixed amounts for services--and critical access hospitals (CAH), which receive reimbursement from Medicare based on their reasonable costs, outsourced some technical pathology services to laboratories that received direct payment for those services. However, the median number of outsourced services per hospital was small--81. If laboratories had not received direct payments for services for hospital patients, GAO estimates that Medicare spending would have been $42 million less in 2001, and beneficiary cost sharing obligations for inpatient and outpatient services would have been reduced by $2 million. Most hospitals are unlikely to experience a financial burden from paying laboratories to provide technical pathology services. If payment to the laboratory is made at the current rate, a PPS hospital outsourcing the median number of technical pathology services outsourced by PPS hospitals, 94, would incur an additional annual cost of approximately $2,900. There would be no financial impact for the 31 percent of rural hospitals that are CAHs, as they would receive Medicare reimbursement for their additional costs. Medicare beneficiaries' access to pathology services would likely be unaffected if direct laboratory payments are terminated. Hospital officials stated they were unlikely to limit surgical services, including those requiring pathology services, because limiting these services would result in a loss of revenue and could restrict access to services for their communities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Hospitals receive fixed, predetermined amounts under Medicare\u2019s hospital  inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems (PPS) for providing  necessary services to Medicare beneficiaries. By paying hospitals fixed  amounts under a PPS, Medicare seeks to encourage them to operate  efficiently, as hospitals retain the difference if their payments exceed their  costs of providing necessary services. Hospitals that outsource services  for their patients generally pay suppliers of those services directly, and the  suppliers do not receive payment from Medicare.", "In 2000, the Congress enacted provisions in the Medicare, Medicaid, and  SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) to delay  for 2 years application of a rule issued by the Health Care Financing  Administration (HCFA), the agency responsible for administering  Medicare. The rule terminated an exception to the inpatient and outpatient  PPS that permitted one type of supplier\u2014laboratories\u2014to receive  payment directly from Medicare when providing technical pathology  services to beneficiaries who are hospital patients. The BIPA provisions  applied only to \u201ccovered hospitals,\u201d those hospitals that had agreements  with laboratories in effect as of July 22, 1999, the date HCFA proposed the  rule, under which the hospitals outsourced technical pathology services to  laboratories, and the laboratories received payment from Medicare for  these services. Under these agreements, some hospitals may outsource all  of their technical pathology services to laboratories, while others may  outsource only some of their services, such as complex procedures that  are rarely performed or overflow services at times of full capacity.", "Numerous issues were raised when HCFA issued its rule in 1999 to  terminate direct Medicare payment to laboratories for technical pathology  services. At the time, HCFA stated that Medicare was paying twice for  those services provided to hospital inpatients, once to the hospital through  the inpatient PPS payment and once to the laboratory through a separate  payment. In addition, outsourcing hospitals had an advantage because  they did not pay the cost of technical pathology services outsourced to  laboratories, while other hospitals had to pay for the cost of these services  from their inpatient PPS payments. Furthermore, application of Medicare  cost-sharing rules resulted in added costs to inpatient beneficiaries  admitted to outsourcing hospitals, compared to those for inpatients at  other hospitals. Some hospitals and laboratories and their affiliated  pathologists voiced concern, however, that termination of the laboratories\u2019  direct payments would increase hospitals\u2019 costs, decrease laboratories\u2019  revenues, and cause hospitals to stop performing surgical services,  particularly in rural areas, reducing beneficiaries\u2019 access to services.", "Although the BIPA provisions expired at the end of 2002, the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) made an administrative decision to  continue directly paying laboratories for technical pathology services  provided to hospital patients. In recent bills, both the House of  Representatives and the Senate have included language to further delay  application of the CMS rule.", "In BIPA, the Congress directed that we report on how terminating direct  laboratory payments would affect hospitals, laboratories, and access to  technical pathology services by Medicare beneficiaries. As agreed with  the committees of jurisdiction, we (1) describe the number and type of  hospitals outsourcing technical pathology services and their service  volumes, (2) estimate how termination of direct laboratory payments  would affect Medicare expenditures, beneficiary cost-sharing obligations,  and hospital costs, and (3) examine how terminating direct laboratory  payments would affect beneficiaries\u2019 access to technical pathology  services in hospitals.", "We used Medicare claims and provider data to identify Medicare  beneficiaries receiving technical pathology laboratory services  concurrently with hospital services.

Included in the costs of each DRG are  nonphysician services provided to inpatients by the hospital and its  outside suppliers. A hospital receives a DRG payment from Medicare and a  deductible amount from a beneficiary for each inpatient benefit period.Each year, the DRG weights are recalibrated to account for changes in  resource use, and the payment rate is adjusted by an update factor to  account for changes in market conditions, practice patterns, and  technology. Medicare separately pays physicians, including pathologists,  and certain other professionals for the direct services they provide to  inpatients.", "When developing the inpatient PPS in the early 1980s, HCFA determined  that technical pathology services outsourced to laboratories were an  integral part of the professional services provided by the laboratories\u2019  pathologists, not separate nonphysician services.

Although the MPFS included a distinct  payment to laboratories for technical pathology services, HCFA did not  revise its policy to prohibit laboratories from continuing to receive the  separate Medicare payment for outsourced technical pathology services  provided to inpatients. Under the MPFS, beneficiaries are responsible for a  copayment equal to 20 percent of the payment for physician services,  including technical pathology services. Thus, inpatient beneficiaries whose  technical pathology services were outsourced by a hospital to a laboratory  that received direct payment from Medicare were responsible for a  copayment, while other inpatients were not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Termination of MPFS Payments to Laboratories for Technical Pathology Services", "paragraphs": ["On July 22, 1999, HCFA proposed ending Medicare payments under the  MPFS to laboratories for technical pathology services provided to hospital  inpatients on or after January 1, 2000. Under the proposal, laboratories,  like suppliers of other nonphysician services, would have to seek payment  from hospitals for technical pathology services provided to hospital  inpatients.", "HCFA\u2019s rationale for its proposed rule was that payment for technical  pathology services provided to beneficiaries was already included in the  inpatient PPS. When implementing the inpatient PPS, HCFA established  separate payment rates for rural and urban hospitals based on data from  hospitals\u2019 cost reports submitted to the agency. Hospitals that performed  their own technical pathology services included such costs in their cost  reports, while hospitals outsourcing these services did not. According to  HCFA, urban hospitals generally performed such services, and in part,  their higher rates reflected that. Consequently, in HCFA\u2019s view, when the  separate rural rate was eliminated in 1995 and rural hospitals began  receiving the higher rate paid to most urban hospitals, the cost of technical  pathology services was included in that payment. Thus, HCFA concluded  that when a laboratory received payment from Medicare for technical  pathology services provided to a hospital inpatient, Medicare was paying  twice for the same service\u2014once to the hospital as part of the PPS  payment and once to the laboratory through the MPFS. A second reason  HCFA cited to support its proposed rule was concern that hospital  outsourcing arrangements with laboratories to provide technical  pathology services would proliferate if hospitals realized these  arrangements would reduce their costs without any reduction in their  inpatient PPS payments.", "After considering comments from the hospital industry and laboratories,  which stated, in part, that they would need additional time to renegotiate  their agreements, in the final rule, HCFA delayed implementation of the  policy until January 1, 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Temporary Continuation of Laboratories Receiving MPFS Payments", "paragraphs": ["In December 2000, the Congress enacted provisions in BIPA that stated  that laboratories furnishing technical pathology services to hospital  patients under agreements with hospitals as of the publication date of the  HCFA proposed rule could continue to receive payment directly from  Medicare for these services until January 1, 2003.

All services paid under the outpatient PPS,  including technical pathology services, are classified into groups called  ambulatory payment classifications (APC). Like inpatient DRGs, the  relative weights of the APCs are adjusted annually by recalibration and the  payment rates by an update factor to account for changes in resource use,  technology, practice cost, and service delivery. When the outpatient PPS  was implemented, beneficiary copayments for a service were generally 20  percent of the hospitals\u2019 median charges for that service in 1996, updated  to 1999. Therefore, the beneficiary cost-sharing obligation as a percentage  of APC payment rates varies by service. Because the median charges were  often higher than the APC payment rates implemented with the outpatient  PPS, beneficiary copayments were frequently as high or higher than 50  percent of the total APC payment amount. The Balanced Budget Act of  1997 established a mechanism to gradually decrease the cost-sharing  percentages for all APCs to 20 percent over time.", "The copayments that beneficiaries are responsible for paying under the  outpatient PPS for technical pathology services that are furnished directly  by hospitals are roughly comparable to the copayments that beneficiaries  are responsible for paying laboratories under the MPFS when services are  outsourced.

For services delivered to outpatients,  hospitals would bill Medicare under the outpatient PPS for technical  pathology services and, therefore, would recover additional revenue even  if they continued to outsource these services to laboratories. Inpatient  beneficiaries of hospitals that outsource technical pathology services  would no longer be responsible for additional copayments to the  laboratories.
