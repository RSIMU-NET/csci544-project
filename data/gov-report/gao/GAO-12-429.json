These efforts resulted in a portfolio of nine data systems. In 2008, GSA began consolidating its portfolio of systems into one integrated system called the System for Award Management (SAM). In developing the system, GSA hoped to eliminate redundancy, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. Unlike the existing systems that were each designed, developed, and operated by a single contractor, IAE relies on multiple vendors to perform these same tasks for SAM. The intent of this approach is to enhance competition and innovation and for the government to own the software associated with the system. SAM will be developed in phases. In each phase, capabilities from selected IAE systems will be added to SAM and those legacy systems will be shut down.", "GSA has made progress in developing SAM and phase 1, consisting of three systems, is scheduled to be completed in May 2012. GSA also has established a computing center to host SAM and a help desk to support users. Since 2009, however, IAE costs have increased by $85 million, from about $96 to $181 million. Most of the cost growth is due to GSA omitting hardware and other key components in acquiring a hosting infrastructure for SAM. External factors, including recent statutory requirements and policy changes, also have contributed to higher costs by increasing the use of the IAE systems beyond what was anticipated. Higher costs led to the need to supplement existing funding, but the program did not receive all of the additional funding it requested. In response to rising costs and limited funding, GSA officials have delayed SAM\u0092s development schedule by almost 2 years, and taken other actions to reduce or defer costs where possible.", "Higher costs and constrained resources pose a risk to IAE going forward. GSA will need to continue operating the legacy IAE systems and contend with higher SAM development costs for several more years. While GSA has taken some steps to reduce costs, it has not reevaluated the business case for SAM or determined whether it is the most cost effective alternative. Such a reevaluation is particularly important in light of the increased infrastructure costs, which are now a major impediment to completing SAM. In addition, although the SAM development phases have been pushed out several years, GSA has not modified its primary development contract to align the payment schedule with the delays. The program has continued to pay the same fixed price amount to the contractor for SAM development, operation, and maintenance even though there was little to operate and maintain for nearly 2 years. Aligning contract payments with schedule milestones will ensure that the government is not paying for work that has not yet been accomplished."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA reassess the IAE business case to determine whether the current acquisition strategy is the most cost effective alternative and if so, reevaluate the current hosting strategy and align contract payments with the program schedule.

These systems served specific roles in the  acquisition process, such as contractor registration or performance  tracking. There was little coordination in data systems across the  government. Agencies created their own systems based on different  standards which meant that information could not be readily shared.  These stove-piped systems resulted in higher costs to the government;  created inefficiencies; and made it confusing for government workers,  vendors, and the public to use the systems.", "IAE was initiated to integrate, standardize, and streamline some of the  many different acquisition data systems used throughout the government.  The program was charged with identifying how information systems could  be used to integrate the acquisition functions common to different  agencies and to implement governmentwide data systems. Common  acquisition functions include, for example, posting contract opportunities,  registering contractors who are interested in doing business with the  government, assessing contractor past performance, and tracking and  reporting contract actions. Bringing disparate data systems together and  providing a shared services resource to enter and retrieve acquisition  information should help to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive steps in  the acquisition process and reduce information technology costs.", "When IAE began, OMB directed GSA to execute and manage the  initiative.

The Acquisition Committee for E-Gov (ACE), a  subcommittee of the Chief Acquisition Officer\u2019s Council, provides overall  governance for IAE. The ACE has several responsibilities, including  providing strategic direction for IAE, approving IAE\u2019s annual budget and  work plan, and ensuring IAE investments align with E-Gov business  goals.

Using this information, the ACE directed GSA to adopt or adapt existing  agency-specific systems for governmentwide use. For example, the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, where contractors  register certain business information prior to being considered for contract  awards, was a Department of Defense (DOD) system that IAE adopted  for governmentwide use in 2003. GSA officials believed DOD\u2019s system  met the government\u2019s requirements, and adopting it was a better  alternative than developing a new system. The Federal Procurement Data  System \u2013 Next Generation (FPDS-NG) is an example of a system that  IAE adapted. FPDS, the FPDS-NG predecessor, was initially  implemented in 1978 and in 2003 GSA hired a vendor to modernize the  system.", "When no existing systems could be adopted or adapted for  governmentwide use, IAE\u2019s strategy was to acquire new systems from  software developers. For example, GSA contracted with IBM in 2004 to  develop and operate the Online Representations and Certifications  Application (ORCA) database, for firms to submit certifications on matters  such as firm size and ownership status. Table 1 identifies the portfolio of  systems that were included in the first stage of IAE up through 2008 and  whether each system was adopted, adapted, or acquired.", "Shortly after IAE was established, GSA and the ACE created a funding  structure in which agencies contribute to the program based on their level  of contracting activity. GSA negotiated memorandums of understanding  (MOU) with the 24 departments and agencies covered by the Chief  Financial Officers Act to collect funding contributions, which pay for the  development, operations, and maintenance of IAE\u2019s portfolio. When  developing its annual budget, GSA estimates what the cost of operating  IAE will be and then determines each agency\u2019s contribution based on its  contracting activity (number and value of contracts) the prior year. For  example, DOD is the largest agency in terms of the number and value of  contracts awarded and therefore contributes the most, 65 percent of the  total. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006  (Transparency Act) created new reporting requirements for federal loan  and grant recipients that increased the use of certain IAE systems. For  example, to comply with the Transparency Act, OMB required grant  recipients to register in CCR. In 2008, GSA negotiated separate MOUs  with 22 departments and agencies for additional contributions to fund the  higher costs associated with providing greater support to grant and loan  recipients. Overall, since 2002, about $396 million has been allocated to  IAE, as shown in table 2.", "Another key component that supports the IAE systems is GSA\u2019s contract  with Dun & Bradstreet for the use of the Data Universal Numbering  System (DUNS) and other services to verify and standardize information  on contract, grant, and loan recipients. GSA uses the DUNS numbers as  unique identifiers for organizing and tracking these entities, including  making linkages between parent and subsidiary businesses, within and  across the IAE systems. The federal government has used DUNS  numbers since 1978, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) has  required all prospective government contractors to obtain DUNS numbers  since 1998. Since 2003, OMB has also required prospective grant  recipients to obtain DUNS numbers. IAE\u2019s contract with Dun &  Bradstreet also supports the use of DUNS numbers for other government- wide information systems, such as USASpending.gov.

SAM will be split into  multiple components with separate contractors responsible for (1) system  design and operations, (2) software development, (3) hosting services,  and (4) help desk support (see table 3). The new approach to developing  SAM is intended to address lessons learned from past IAE systems.  Unlike the legacy systems, the government will own the SAM software as  open-source code, the system architecture, and all supporting hardware.  IAE officials believe that an open-source approach to software and  development will result in lower costs to the government because IAE will  be able to avoid sole-source modifications to the system and  competitively award future enhancement contracts. GSA officials said that  in the past, system enhancements were expensive, in part because the  incumbent contractors knew that GSA\u2019s only alternative to a sole-source  enhancement contract was to develop a new system. Also, GSA officials  said the plan to consolidate help desk services into one single contractor  is an effective way to control cost and service levels.", "With SAM, the system design contractor (IBM) will be responsible for  developing the system architecture, defining technical requirements,  specifying data migration procedures for each of the legacy systems, and  operating and maintaining SAM. Once IBM has specified the technical  requirements and data migration procedures for the legacy systems, a  second contractor will be responsible for writing the software code that  will make up SAM. GCE will write the code for the first phase and GSA  will competitively award software contracts for the subsequent phases.  IBM will then test and validate the software, implement the system  migration, and begin operating and maintaining the new SAM system. A  third contractor (Qwest) will provide hosting services, which involves  providing a secure facility to physically house SAM and power and  Internet connectivity.

The timing of  each phase was generally established to coincide with expiring legacy  system contracts. As each phase is completed, the capabilities of the  systems in that phase will be added to SAM and the legacy systems will  be shut down. As discussed above, each development phase requires  contributions from the four SAM contractors, with GSA managing the  various contracts. GSA officials anticipate that additional systems may be  added to SAM in the future. For example, the contract with IBM includes  an option to migrate the Past Performance Information Retrieval System  (PPIRS), which provides access to past performance information on  contractors, to SAM.

GSA did not develop a formal cost baseline when SAM  development was started, so we compared the initial contract value for   GSA  each of the SAM components to the current contract estimates.currently estimates that the various SAM-related contracts will cost  $181.1 million. This represents an increase of $85 million, nearly 90  percent, over the initial contract award amounts which totaled about $96  million (see fig. 1).", "Most of the cost growth, about $65 million, is due to higher than expected  hosting costs. Hosting consists of a secure facility with Internet  connectivity; the hardware on which the system will be installed; the  operating system and other software necessary to operate the code that  will make up SAM; and the operation and maintenance of the hosting  environment. GSA estimated in 2008 that hosting costs for the IAE  systems were $2.8 million and that annual costs would be much less than  that after moving to a single hosting environment. However, we estimate  that SAM hosting costs will average $8 million to $9 million per year. The  higher costs are largely due to GSA omitting key components from its  contracting strategy for acquiring hosting services. GSA\u2019s initial strategy  was to contract with a single company for all of these hosting services.  However, shortly after beginning SAM development, IAE awarded a  contract (to Qwest) for a more limited set of hosting services that only  included the hosting facility and Internet connectivity.GSA did not include the hosting hardware, software, and operation and  maintenance services that were needed. Program officials told us that at  the time they believed that the multiagency telecommunications contract  used to obtain hosting services from Qwest did not offer the  comprehensive services that were needed. Officials also said they  thought IBM was responsible for providing these items, but later realized  that was not the case. GSA decided to purchase the hosting hardware  and software itself under existing GSA schedule contracts at an estimated  cost of $29 million. After negotiations with IBM, GSA modified IBM\u2019s  contract in June 2011, adding $36 million to the $74 million contract price  to have IBM install and operate and maintain the hosting hardware and  software in Qwest\u2019s facility. It took GSA more than a year to finalize its  current hosting approach and program officials said they have purchased  hosting hardware and software through 13 different contracts instead of  just 1 contract as intended under their original hosting strategy.", "It is not clear why  The help desk function, FSD, also experienced cost growth over its first  years of operation as the expected cost has nearly doubled to $33 million.  Most of this growth appears to have resulted from factors outside of  GSA\u2019s control. GSA officials told us the FSD contract price is driven by  the amount of support activity provided under the contract. The higher  costs reflect a greater than expected demand associated primarily with  one data system, CCR. This system serves as a registry for any  organization that wants to do business with the federal government.  Several events occurred that substantially increased the number of CCR  help desk calls. Both the Federal Funding Accountability and  Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act) and the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) included  provisions that increased or had the effect of increasing the number of  CCR registrants. Specifically, the Transparency Act contained  requirements for a single searchable website with data on federal loan,  grant, and contract recipients, which prompted the government to require  grant recipients to register in CCR. The Recovery Act temporarily increased the number of loan and grant recipients, which also led to  greater numbers of CCR registrants. Also, in late 2008, the CCR login  process changed in response to actions taken by DOD to improve  password security measures.

However, GSA had underestimated its funding needs and soon after the  start of SAM development, GSA officials recognized that the amount of  agency contributions was insufficient to pay to operate the existing IAE  systems and develop SAM over the next several years. GSA officials told  us they consulted with OMB and considered various funding options to  pay for the development of SAM, including increased agency  contributions, a separate appropriation request, or user fees.

IBM then would have been responsible for operating and maintaining  FPDS-NG \u201cas-is\u201d under the SAM contract and GSA could have ended the  FPDS-NG legacy contract.

Phase 2b will not be completed until mid-2014, approximately 2  years later than originally planned, in part because GSA cannot afford the  estimated $21 million necessary to complete the phase. Furthermore, the  migration of FPDS-NG is not scheduled to be completed until 20 months  later than planned, in 2015.", "In addition to delaying SAM\u2019s development schedule, GSA officials said  they have taken other steps to defer or reduce costs. In 2011, GSA  modified the payment schedule for the Dun & Bradstreet DUNS contract  to delay payments from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2012. Under the  original contract, GSA was scheduled to make an $18 million payment in  August 2011. To free up funds in fiscal year 2011, GSA negotiated a  modification with Dun & Bradstreet that allowed GSA to pay only $3.8  million in 2011 and deferred the remaining payments to later years. In  addition, GSA cut FSD costs by reducing the required level of services  stated in the contract. For instance, GSA capped the number of calls the  contractor needs to respond to every month, which program officials said  has reduced costs and made it easier to estimate future costs. However,  the cap on calls may reduce the responsiveness of the help desk to  users. GSA officials said they also stopped making investments in the  legacy systems and stopped making all but the most minor of changes to  the systems.

For example, GSA abandoned its initial hosting strategy without  evaluating the cost or schedule implications of doing so. The initial  strategy to use a single contractor to provide consolidated hosting  services was intended to achieve cost savings, but the revised approach,  which relies on multiple contractors, has proven to be much more costly  than expected and led to schedule delays. Hosting costs are now a  primary impediment to moving forward because GSA cannot afford to  purchase the hardware and software necessary to complete phases 2  and 3. In addition, according to program officials, GSA efforts to procure  hosting hardware and software have resulted in 13 different contracts, the  management of which has required additional program support  resources.", "GSA also continues to pay the SAM development contractor, IBM,  essentially the same amount called for in the original contract even  though schedule delays have pushed work out into the future. IBM\u2019s  contract includes responsibility for designing as well as operating and  maintaining SAM. According to the fixed-price contract, SAM will be  developed in phases, yet the payment schedule specified that IBM was to  be paid a set amount each month (approximately 3 percent of the total  contract price) for all activities under the 36-month base contract. This  payment schedule may have been appropriate under GSA\u2019s initial plan,  but the development schedule changed shortly after the contract was  awarded and much of the work to migrate systems into SAM will occur  much later than planned. While the SAM transition and migration  schedules have changed considerably, GSA has not adjusted IBM\u2019s  payment schedule to reflect the current development schedule. For  example, IBM was not responsible for operating any IAE systems until the  Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) was transitioned to the SAM  contract in July 2011\u201417 months into the contract. By that time, GSA had  already paid IBM $6.3 million of the $20.3 million contract price for SAM  operation and maintenance. GSA and IBM officials noted that payments  to date have been for planning and preparing to migrate the legacy  systems to SAM. However, under the original schedule, IBM would have  performed these services as well as operated FPDS-NG for the same  cost. Similarly, GSA has paid more than half of the contract price for  phase 2 migration activities even though phase 2 is not scheduled to be  completed until May 2014.", "We raised issues about the increasing cost with SAM, and the viability of  the hosting approach and the development contract structure with GSA  officials and they recently told us that GSA has initiated an internal  review, called a TechStat, of IAE. A TechStat is intended to be an evidence-based review of underperforming information technology  investment during which agency leadership reviews a program, examines  performance, and develops corrective actions as necessary. Program  officials said their current focus is on completing phase 1 of SAM, but  they may revisit their hosting strategy once the phase is completed. GSA  officials also told us that they will begin negotiating with IBM to change  the contract to reflect current schedule changes and available funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["GSA\u2019s effort to consolidate the IAE legacy systems into SAM has the  potential to reduce agency costs, eliminate redundancy, and streamline  government acquisition processes. Two years into development,  however, SAM is in trouble due to higher costs that planned funding  levels do not cover. Most of the cost growth seen to date is largely the  result of mistakes the program made. Rather than using a consolidated  hosting strategy as initially proposed, the program adopted a piecemeal  approach involving multiple sources that will cost about $65 million more  than expected. The need for additional resources to cover the increase in  hosting costs, however, coincided with significant funding shortfalls in the  past 2 years and now the program cannot afford to develop SAM as  planned.", "Despite dramatically different circumstances marked by higher costs and  constrained resources, GSA has not reassessed its business case for  SAM. Specifically, GSA has not assessed whether developing SAM is still  a better option than maintaining the status quo or whether the current  development strategy, involving multiple vendors, is more cost-effective  than using a single vendor. Ensuring there is a sound business case for  moving forward will be critical before establishing an acquisition strategy  to address the program\u2019s problems. Also, while GSA has taken steps to  reduce costs, by delaying development and deferring some costs to the  future, there may be more that can be done to stretch available  resources. For example, in light of higher hosting costs than expected,  GSA has not reevaluated whether its hosting strategy is the most cost- effective approach. In addition, GSA has not modified the primary SAM  development contract to align payments with program schedule delays.  Although GSA officials recently indicated they will begin negotiating  changes to the development contract, it continues to pay the contractor  for operation and maintenance activities even though many of the IAE  systems will not be migrated into SAM for several years. Tying contract  payments to the migration of the data systems and schedule milestones  would ensure that the government is not paying for work that has not yet  been accomplished."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that GSA has a sound approach for providing IAE services in  the future, we recommend that the Administrator of GSA take the  following two actions:", "Reassess the SAM business case to compare the costs and benefits  of various alternatives such as: terminating SAM development and continuing to operate the  legacy systems, maintaining the current acquisition approach to developing SAM, pursuing a different acquisition strategy for SAM, such as using a  single contractor to develop and operate the system.", "If the results of this assessment support continuing the current  acquisition approach, then: reevaluate the hosting strategy to ensure that it is the most cost- effective approach that can be supported with available resources,  and  take steps to ensure that the SAM development contract  payments are more closely aligned with the program schedule and  delivery of capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to GSA and OMB.
