The CSE program provides several services, including collecting child support payments from noncustodial parents--those who are not the primary caregivers--and distributing these payments to families. Generally, the federal government reimburses state agencies 66 percent of their costs for administering the CSE program. GAO determined (1) how total net federal expenditures for administrative costs changed from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004; (2) the categories of costs that contributed most to administrative costs in recent years; and (3) steps state agencies have taken to manage costs, and steps OCSE has taken to help state agencies and ensure federal funds have been used appropriately. GAO analyzed program data, surveyed all 54 state agencies and visited 6, interviewed program officials, and reviewed laws, policies, and reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004, total net federal expenditures for administrative costs (the cost after deducting child support collections for families receiving benefits from other government programs) increased by about 23 percent. After adjusting for inflation, total net federal expenditures increased from about $2.2 billion to $2.8 billion. Also, during this period, collections increased by about 12 percent from about $19 billion to $22 billion, and the program's cost effectiveness measure (the ratio of collections to total administrative expenditures) increased about 4 percent. Personnel costs were cited as a major contributor to federal expenditures for administrative costs in fiscal years 2002 to 2004 by the 49 state agencies that responded to the relevant question in our survey. Most state agencies also cited as major costs cooperative agreements under which staff from other state agencies are paid to perform CSE program duties, automated data systems, and contracts with private firms. Several of these categories involve labor costs, and from fiscal years 2000 to 2004, the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) employees funded by the CSE program increased about 2,200. Yet, OCSE has not developed guidelines to help state agencies manage their FTEs and related labor costs. State agencies reported implementing cost-saving initiatives, and while OCSE has helped state agencies manage costs, it has conducted a limited number of administrative cost audits to help ensure the appropriate use of federal funds. At least one-half of the state agencies reported implementing 7 of the 10 cost-saving initiatives listed in our survey, and many reported cost savings. To help state agencies manage their programs, OCSE issued guidance, created federal/state work groups, and sponsored conferences. OCSE is required to conduct audits of state agencies' administrative costs, and from March 2004 to March 2006, OCSE issued eight administrative cost audit reports. All of these audit reports raised questions about inappropriate expenditures. Although OCSE expects to have more resources available to conduct audits, it does not plan to use these resources to conduct more administrative cost audits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1975, Congress established federal standards for state child support  In 1975, Congress established federal standards for state child support  enforcement (CSE) programs to ensure that parents financially support  enforcement (CSE) programs to ensure that parents financially support  their children.

According  to OCSE\u2019s annual reports, from fiscal years 1995 to 2004, the net federal  share of expenditures for the CSE program increased by one-third, in  nominal dollars, and the program\u2019s critical measure of cost effectiveness\u2014 the ratio of dollars collected divided by total administrative  expenditures\u2014did not change significantly. These increased expenditures  raise questions about the factors that affect program costs and the extent  to which state agencies are effectively managing the cost of their CSE  programs. In an effort to provide information about more recent federal  expenditures and the issues associated with the cost of administering the  CSE program, this report addresses the following questions: (1) How have  total net federal expenditures for administrative costs changed from fiscal  year 2000 to fiscal year 2004? (2) What categories of costs have  contributed most to federal expenditures for administrative costs in recent  years? (3) What steps have state agencies taken to manage costs, and what  steps has OCSE taken to help state agencies and ensure federal funds have  been used appropriately?", "We obtained information from several sources in conducting this review.  To address how federal expenditures for administrative costs have  changed from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004, we obtained and  analyzed the net federal share of expenditure data for each state agency  for each of these years. We also examined collections, number of cases,  cost-effectiveness ratios, and the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE)  employees to gain some perspective about changes in expenditures. We  performed procedures to assess the reliability of the system that maintains  data related to funds administered by HHS\u2019 Administration for Children  and Families (ACF), including funds provided to state agencies for the  CSE program. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for our  review. For some analyses, we adjusted these data for inflation to get a  truer picture of changes over several years. Also, we calculated the median  amounts for expenditures and collections because of the wide variation  among state agencies. To obtain information for the other objectives, we  conducted a survey, site visits, and interviews and reviewed related  documents. We sent an e-mail survey to the 54 state agencies and received  responses from all of them. The survey asked state agencies to (1) identify  the five cost categories that contributed most to their administrative costs  during fiscal years 2002 to 2004 and estimate the percentage that each  category comprised, (2) provide information on selected cost-saving  initiatives identified by OCSE as best practices, and (3) rate the extent to  which various OCSE assistance efforts had been helpful. We did not assess  the reliability of the data state agencies reported in response to our survey,  but we reviewed their responses for completeness and reasonableness.  Also, we conducted site visits in the following six states: California,  Connecticut, Maryland, Ohio, South Carolina, and Utah. We selected these  states because they represented diversity in changes in the amounts of  federal expenditures for fiscal years 2002 to 2004; geographical location;  and operational structure, that is state- or county-operated programs. In  addition, we interviewed federal and state agency officials and child  support experts, reviewed related reports, and analyzed applicable laws  and regulations. We conducted our work between June 2005 and June  2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. See appendix I for more details on our objectives, scope, and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The CSE program makes services available to any parent or other person  with custody of a child who has a parent living outside of the home. These  services are available automatically for families receiving assistance under  the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, and  Foster Care programs. Other families seeking government child support  services can apply through their state agency or one of the tribes running  the program. For these families, there is an application fee. Figure 1  illustrates the major services provided by the CSE program.", "The CSE program is financed by federal and state funds. Federal funds  come from three funding streams\u2014the federal match, also known as the  federal financial participation; incentive payments; and grants. Generally,  federal matching funds reimburse state agencies 66 percent of the  administrative costs for their CSE programs. In addition to matching  funds, the federal government pays state agencies incentive funds to  encourage them to achieve program goals. Incentive funds are capped, and  in fiscal year 2004, $454 million were allocated for incentive payments.  State agencies must reinvest their incentive funds in the CSE program.  Federal funds also are available through grants. Grants for special  improvement projects, demonstration projects, and child access and  visitation programs are generally awarded annually. OCSE has received an  annual appropriation of $1.8 million for special improvement project  grants or demonstration projects to promote the program\u2019s overall  objectives. Additionally, since fiscal year 1997, OCSE has distributed  approximately $10 million per year to state agencies to support child  access and visitation grants for activities such as mediation, counseling,  education, development of parenting plans, noncustodial parent visitation  enforcement (including monitoring and supervision), and development of  noncustodial parent visitation and alternative custody guidelines.  According to a November 2005 report, state agencies used a number of  funding sources to finance their share of CSE program administrative  costs.  These funding sources included federal incentive payments, child  support collected for parents receiving assistance through the TANF  program, state general funds, state general funds paid as incentives,  county general funds, and fees, along with several other sources that were  mentioned less often by state agencies. While state agencies generally  used more than one revenue source, they also varied in the combination of  the revenue sources they used.", "For the CSE program, federal and state expenditures are generally offset  by certain collections as well as fees and interest payments. Child support  collections for families that receive benefits from the TANF and Foster  Care programs are deducted from the total federal and state expenditures  and paid to these programs as reimbursements. For example, in fiscal year  2004 about $2 billion in child support collections for families that received  TANF benefits were deducted from total CSE expenditures\u2014the federal  government was reimbursed $1.1 billion, and state agencies were  reimbursed about $900 million. In addition, some state agencies collect  fees from parents for their services, and such fees are also deducted from  total expenditures. Also, expenditures are reduced by interest income that  accrues to state agencies for collections deposited in interest-bearing  accounts.", "Over the years, Congress has passed numerous laws that have had an  impact on the CSE program, including the following:    The Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 included a  provision that gave state agencies 90 percent matching funds for the  cost of developing, installing, and enhancing approved automated data  systems. In 1997, we reported that state agencies had spent over   $2.6 billion since the early 1980s to develop their systems, and the  federal government had paid from 66 to 90 percent of the systems\u2019  costs, which amounted to more than $2 billion.", "The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 addressed many  aspects of the program. For example, this act required that all states  provide for the use of mandatory wage withholding procedures and  expedited processes for establishing and enforcing support orders.  The act made available federal matching funds at the 90 percent rate  for the development and installation of automated data systems to  facilitate income withholding and other procedures. The act reduced  the overall federal matching rate to 68 percent for fiscal years 1988 and  1989, and to 66 percent for fiscal year 1990 and thereafter. Also, the act  established procedures for intercepting state income tax refunds,  imposing liens against real and personal property, and reporting  delinquency information to consumer reporting agencies.", "The Family Support Act of 1988 established several requirements. For  instance, the Secretary of HHS was required to set time limits within  which collections must be distributed to families, and state agencies  were required to meet federal standards for the establishment of  paternity and to provide for wage withholding in accordance with child  support orders. Also, this act made it mandatory for states to  computerize their CSE programs and required states to have their  automated data systems certified by October 1, 1995.", "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act  of 1996 (PRWORA) included many provisions related to the CSE  program. For example, PRWORA reinstated the 90 percent matching  rate through September 30, 1997, to enable state agencies to complete  the development and implementation of their automated data systems  and extended the deadline for implementation to October 1, 1997.  PRWORA also provided a matching rate of 80 percent, capped at   $400 million for fiscal years 1996 to 2001, for system development and  implementation costs related to automated data processing  requirements. In addition, PRWORA provided state agencies with new  enforcement tools, such as suspension of licenses, denial of passports,  and financial institution data matches, and included procedures for the  periodic review and adjustment of support orders by state agencies.  Furthermore, PRWORA required audits to assess the completeness,  reliability, and security of the data used in calculating performance  indicators and audits of the financial management of states\u2019 programs,  including assessments of whether federal and other funds were being  appropriately expended and properly accounted for.", "The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act (CSPIA) of 1998  established several new procedures and changed the method for  calculating incentive payments. Since 1975, the federal government  has paid incentives to state agencies to encourage program  improvement. The new incentive system established by CSPIA links  incentive payments to performance in five areas: paternity  establishment, order establishment, collections of current child  support, collections of child support in arrears, and cost effectiveness.  CSPIA specifies the percentage of incentive funds that a state agency  can receive on the basis of the state agency\u2019s level of performance in  each of these areas. For example, the applicable percentage of  incentive funds for cost-effectiveness ratios is shown in table 1.", "The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 included provisions that will affect  CSE program funds. The act reduced the match rate for paternity  testing from 90 percent to 66 percent effective October 1, 2006;  eliminated the federal match for incentive payments effective October  1, 2007; and required states to impose an annual fee of $25 on each  family that never received TANF benefits and for which the program  collects $500 a year. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  estimated that by 2010 the federal share of administrative costs would  be reduced by $1.8 billion from eliminating the federal match for  incentive payments and by $28 million from the lower match rate for  paternity testing.  CBO also estimated that the federal government  would receive an additional $172 million from the annual fee. Further,  CBO estimated that total funding for the program could fall 15 percent  by 2010 if states did not adjust their own spending for CSE programs.  This act also included provisions that will reduce federal expenditures  for several other programs.", "We have expressed concern about the federal government\u2019s financial  condition and the nation\u2019s growing fiscal imbalance. Also, we have  reported that if the federal government is to effectively address this  concern, it cannot accept all of the existing programs, policies, and  activities as givens, and that rethinking the base of existing federal  spending is an important step.", "As the federal partner, OCSE has several responsibilities.

OCSE maintains these data in the Grants Application  Tracking and Evaluation System (GATES) operated by ACF.   Furthermore, OCSE is responsible for helping state agencies administer  their programs. Routinely OCSE has developed and disseminated to state  agencies a compendium of what it considers best practices. Each  compendium describes several best practices, provides information on the  results of implementing the practices, and identifies a contact person.

While total net federal expenditures increased each year, the largest  increase, in nominal dollars, was about 14 percent from fiscal year 2000 to  fiscal year 2001. Overall, the median net federal expenditure increased  from about $25 million to about $26 million between fiscal years 2000 and  2004.

These  increases ranged from about 1 percent to over 400 percent, and the median  for these state agencies was 14.8 percent. According to comments from  HHS on a draft of this report, many of the large increases and decreases  are a result of adjustments for under or over reporting expenditures in a  previous quarter. Total net federal expenditures increased most in Maine  and California, reflecting special circumstances in both states. According  to Maine\u2019s state agency director, the agency made adjustments over  several quarters to correct its reporting of interest income earned. In  California, state agency officials explained that most of the increase was  attributable to costs associated with developing and implementing its  statewide automated data system. Nearly all state agencies (51) had at  least 1 year when net federal expenditures decreased. For example, net  federal expenditures for Alabama\u2019s program decreased from fiscal year  2000 to fiscal year 2001 and increased in other fiscal years, while net  federal expenditures for Mississippi\u2019s program decreased in each of the  fiscal years from 2000 to 2003.

From fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year  2004, total collections increased about 12 percent from $19 billion to about  $22 billion. During the same period, collections increased for most state  agencies, but the percentage of increase varied among the state agencies  and from year to year. For example, from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year  2001, collections in Vermont increased about 5 percent and collections in  Illinois increased about 17 percent. From fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year  2004, collections in Vermont increased about 15 percent, while Illinois\u2019  collections increased about 9 percent. Appendix III provides data on  annual percentage changes in total collections for each state agency for  fiscal years 2000 to 2004.

Overall, median collections also increased, and the median collections for  state agencies with county-operated programs were higher than for state  agencies with state-operated programs. The median collection for county- operated programs was about $519 million in fiscal year 2000 and   $567 million in fiscal year 2004, while the median collection for state- operated programs increased from about $141 million to $156 million  during this period.

Officials from 38 state agencies ranked  personnel as their largest cost category and estimated that this category  represented from 30 percent to 80 percent of their total administrative  costs during fiscal years 2002 to 2004. Personnel costs include salaries and  benefits for all state agency employees. In fiscal year 2002, the CSE  program nationwide had about 43,000 FTEs, and in fiscal years 2003 and  2004, the program had about 42,000 FTEs. State agency officials with  whom we spoke said that personnel costs represent a large percentage of  the total administrative costs for several reasons. State agency officials  explained that personnel costs are affected by higher salaries for  experienced staff and increasing health benefits costs. According to a  representative of a national child support organization, for state agencies  with collective bargaining agreements, the terms of these agreements can  affect personnel costs. Also, officials from county-operated states that we  visited commented that the state agency has limited control over how the  counties compensate their personnel.", "Cooperative agreements were cited by 37 of 49 state agencies as among  their largest administrative cost categories, and the median of the  percentages state agencies provided for this category was 15 percent.  Cooperative agreements were the largest cost category for 3 state  agencies, where these costs represented 40 percent to 70 percent of total  administrative costs. Under the cooperative agreements that we reviewed,  state CSE agencies reimbursed other state or local agencies for services  critical to the CSE program. For example, in California, the CSE agency  has cooperative agreements with the state tax agency, in order to use  certain enforcement tools. Additionally, the Nebraska and South Carolina  CSE agencies have cooperative agreements with county clerks of the  court, and the Iowa agency has cooperative agreements with local sheriffs  to serve court papers to noncustodial parents. According to OCSE data,  state agencies used about 16,400 FTEs under cooperative agreements to  provide CSE program services in fiscal year 2004, an increase of about   1 percent since fiscal year 2002. According to state agency officials, it can  be challenging for CSE agencies to manage the costs charged by other  agencies under cooperative agreements. In an attempt to manage such  costs, CSE agency officials in Utah told us that after they detected  increased charges from the Attorney General\u2019s office to cover attorneys\u2019  pay increases, they capped the payments to that office.", "Automated data systems costs were included among the largest cost  categories by 35 of 49 state agencies, and the median of the percentages  these state agencies provided for this cost category was 13 percent.  Automated data systems were the largest cost category for 5 state  agencies, where these costs represented 25 percent to 65 percent of total  administrative costs. These included costs for ongoing maintenance as  well as for enhancements. According to an OCSE official, automated  systems continuously require enhancements to meet new requirements  and operational changes to keep up with technology. Moreover, according  to a state CSE agency official from Utah, the state periodically raises the  costs for processing data and accessing the mainframe for all state  agencies, and in 1 year, the cost for the state CSE agency increased by   38 percent.", "Contract costs were included by 41 of 49 state agencies among their  largest cost categories, and the median of the percentages these state  agencies provided for this cost category was 11 percent of total  administrative costs. Contracts were the largest cost category for 3 state  agencies, where these costs represented 49 percent to 68 percent of total  costs. According to several state agency officials with whom we spoke,  state agencies have contracted with private sector companies for a wide  range of services, including testing blood to establish paternity, obtaining  information from credit bureaus to help locate noncustodial parents,  operating call centers, identifying assets, and processing payments. State  agencies may combine multiple services in a single contract. For example,  state agency officials in Connecticut told us that the agency uses a single  contract to obtain many services such as processing payments, handling  clients\u2019 inquiries, providing outreach services to clients, managing a Web  site that provides information on case status, and automating certain  notices. In addition, some state agencies have hired contractors to operate  the CSE program at the local level. For example, Tennessee relies on  contractors for all local services in 24 of the state\u2019s 95 counties, and an  agency official estimated that contract costs represented about 52 percent  of the state agency\u2019s administrative costs during fiscal years 2002 to 2004.  According to OCSE data, state agencies contracted for about 2,300 FTEs in  fiscal year 2004, a decrease of about 11 percent since fiscal year 2002.  According to a state agency director, contracting can be an option for state  agencies when the state has placed a cap on personnel levels.", "Additionally, some of the 49 state agencies reported that other costs were  among their largest cost categories during fiscal years 2002 to 2004.  Twenty-four state agencies cited rent among their largest cost categories,  postage was cited by 15 state agencies, and 12 state agencies included  telecommunications costs.

For example, one state agency official noted that  automation has helped facilitate the processes of locating noncustodial  parents and enforcing child support orders. However, this official also said  that the additional information obtained through automation, such as data  to help identify assets, can involve due process considerations that give  noncustodial parents the right to a hearing. Agency staff may need to talk  to these parents about their rights and responsibilities and to attend  hearings\u2014services that cannot be automated. Additionally, this official  commented that while new program requirements established by federal  law have created new enforcement tools, they have also led to processes  that can be very labor-intensive. Another state agency official said that  even with automation, caseworkers still need to work closely with families  to ensure that data reflect families\u2019 current situations.", "Furthermore, while OCSE has issued regulations that address minimum  organizational and staffing requirements, OCSE officials said they have not  reviewed the number of FTEs per state agency or issued specific  guidelines. The OCSE regulations state the IV-D agency is to have an  organizational structure and sufficient staff to fulfill various program  functions and sufficient resources to meet performance and time  standards. Also, the regulations include a provision under which the  Secretary of HHS may set resource standards for a state if it is determined  as a result of an audit that the state is not in substantial compliance with  program performance standards and the Secretary determines that  inadequate resources were a major contributing factor. OCSE officials said  that it is more appropriate for state agencies to determine their resource  needs because of the many differences in the operations among the state  agencies, such as whether they are state- or county-operated. OCSE  officials also stated that OCSE has not reviewed state agencies\u2019 FTEs or  developed guidelines to help state agencies manage the number of FTEs  and the related costs. Furthermore, OCSE officials said that given the  demands on the program, they do not expect staffing levels to ever  decline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Agencies Reported Implementing Cost- Saving Initiatives, and While OCSE Has Helped State Agencies, It Has Not Conducted Administrative Cost Audits in Most States", "paragraphs": ["State agencies reported they had implemented cost-saving initiatives  identified in our survey, and while OCSE has provided assistance to help  state agencies, it has not conducted administrative cost audits in most  states to help ensure that federal funds have been used appropriately.  Most state agencies reported that savings from implementing cost-saving  initiatives were reinvested in the program. OCSE has provided a range of  assistance to help states manage costs, and state agencies have generally  found that assistance helpful.

Also, at least one-half of the state  agencies reported they had implemented 3 other initiatives, while fewer  than one-half of the state agencies reported implementing the remaining   3 initiatives. Of the 10 initiatives, 6 have been implemented by some state  agencies for a decade or more, while others have been implemented more  recently. For example, 9 state agencies reported having implemented voice  response systems before fiscal year 1995. By contrast, electronic  distribution of collections via debit cards did not begin to be implemented  by any state agency until fiscal year 2000, and most of the state agencies  with debit cards reported they implemented them in or after fiscal year  2004. State agencies reported several reasons for not implementing  initiatives, including lack of funds or staff to perform the work, issues  related to protecting program and client data, and the need to meet other  state or CSE program priorities. Table 6 provides more information about  the cost-saving initiatives in our survey, and appendix VI identifies the  initiatives that state agencies reported they had implemented.", "For many state agencies, participation in certain initiatives has been  voluntary, and the extent of participation has varied. According to an  OCSE November 2005 update of a survey of all state agencies conducted  by the Massachusetts state agency, most state agencies offered direct  deposit as an option, with the percentage of payments made via direct  deposit ranging from 10 percent to 73 percent. Also, according to the  results of this survey, some state agencies\u2014such as Illinois and Nebraska-- offered debit cards to custodial parents on a voluntary basis, and the  percentage of payments made via debit cards in a state ranged from about  3 percent to 70 percent. The survey data are consistent with what we  found in the states we visited. In Utah and Connecticut, for example,  direct deposit is voluntary and officials said that 41 percent and 46 percent  of payments, respectively, were made through direct deposit. Electronic  transmittal of wages withheld by employers for child support payments is  another example of an electronic payment method that is voluntary, in this  case for the employer. For example, in Alaska, a state agency official told  us that about 53 percent of payments withheld from wages are received  electronically. According to state agency officials with whom we spoke in  Utah and Connecticut, as well as an OCSE official, participation in  electronic payment initiatives has not been higher for several reasons,  such as the initial start-up costs employers incur and the clients\u2019 lack of  familiarity with these methods and preference for cash. Also, according to  an official from the Utah state agency, debit card fees, such as ATM fees  that clients may be charged to access their funds, have affected  participation. Officials in Connecticut and Utah said that their agencies  have tried to increase participation through repeated educational efforts,  such as periodically distributing brochures and letters. In Utah, officials  said these efforts typically increase participation 10 percent to 15 percent  after each campaign. Similarly, Connecticut officials also described  outreach efforts to increase participation and estimated that about   30 custodial parents had enrolled in direct deposit each week in state  fiscal year 2005. Other state agencies, such as North Dakota and Puerto  Rico, have sought to attain the maximum participation possible by  requiring clients to choose either direct deposit or debit cards.", "State agencies reported savings and other benefits after implementing the  10 initiatives listed in our survey. For example, New York reported saving  $4.5 million since fiscal year 1993 after implementing electronic transfer of  wages withheld by employers for child support payments, and Texas  estimated that by providing online training for its staff, the state agency  had saved $650,000 since fiscal year 2001. Also, officials in Connecticut  stated that direct deposit costs them 17 cents per payment, while issuing a  paper check costs about 61 cents to produce and mail. In addition to cost  savings, states can realize other benefits from implementing these  initiatives, such as time savings from quicker processes, enhanced  customer service, or the opportunity to use staff for other program needs.  Our 2004 report found that debit cards can help states avoid or minimize  the problem of undistributed collections\u2014funds that were delayed or  never reached families. Also, debit cards ensured receipt of child support  payments during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, according to agency and  federal officials. Additionally, payments that are transferred electronically  can be credited to multiple cases simultaneously, according to Utah state  agency officials.", "Most state agencies (38) reported that they reinvested the savings from  implemented initiatives in the CSE program. For example, state agency  officials we interviewed in Connecticut and Utah told us that once  resources are no longer needed for developing and implementing a new  initiative, they reallocate these resources to other tasks. In Utah, a state  agency official with whom we spoke estimated that by implementing an  automated voice response system and a customer service Web site and by  providing training on how to answer clients\u2019 inquiries efficiently, the state  agency was able to shift four full-time staff who formerly handled  customer service calls to other projects. Conversely, five state agencies  reported that they did not reinvest their savings. For example, the Nevada  state agency reported that savings were returned to the state general fund  per state requirements, and the Vermont state agency reported that in  some cases state funding for the program was reduced by the amount of  the savings.", "Additionally, state agency officials told us about other practices that they  implemented to reduce costs, beyond the initiatives specified in our  survey. For example, in Connecticut, the state agency has adopted  practices as varied as using videoconference facilities to allow  caseworkers to attend hearings that can help reduce travel costs and  printing double-sided notices to clients. In Utah, the state agency has  automated notices to noncustodial parents regarding pending wage  withholding. In Virginia, the state agency automated intercept of  unemployment insurance payments in fiscal year 2003 and reported total  costs savings of $240,000 as a result. The Georgia state agency reported  implementing Internet-enabled voice communication to reduce telephone  costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCSE Has Taken Steps to Help State Agencies Manage Costs", "paragraphs": ["OCSE issued guidance and awarded grants to state agencies to help them  manage costs. OCSE issued guidance on a wide range of topics addressing  program operations that may directly or indirectly lead to cost savings. For  example, OCSE has issued guidance on electronic disbursement of  payments, criteria for closing cases, multistate financial institution data  matches, and review and adjustment of support orders. In addition, OCSE  has awarded grants to help state agencies develop and implement certain  initiatives. For example, in fiscal year 2002, OCSE awarded Indiana a  $100,000 grant to investigate the use of debit cards to reduce undistributed  collections, Texas a $71,630 grant to develop electronic payment methods  for noncustodial parents, North Carolina a $200,000 grant for an outgoing  automated voice response system to send reminders to clients, and  Colorado a $100,000 grant for Web-site technology to increase customer  services.", "OCSE has created several work groups consisting of federal and state  agency officials to address specific issues of concern to all state agencies.  Some examples of these federal/state work groups are discussed as  follows:    Work group on a Standardized Electronic Wage Withholding Order:  OCSE convened a work group in 2004 to develop a standardized  method for the electronic transmission of wage withholding orders to  employers. The work group was composed of representatives from  state and tribal child support enforcement agencies, employers, federal  agencies (Social Security Administration, Department of Defense, and  the United States Postal Service), and a large payroll processing  company. This work group developed, among other things, a draft  electronic wage withholding order for state agencies to notify  employers of a wage withholding action. According to OCSE,  electronic transmission of wage-withholding orders will increase  processing efficiency and improve the speed with which payments are  made to families and also reduce the cost of postage and processing  paper documents.", "The National Judicial/CSE Collaboration Work Group: OCSE  convened this work group in 2004 to help improve collaboration  between child support enforcement agencies and courts. This work  group\u2019s goals include improving case processing and facilitating  electronic data and document exchange between state agencies and  courts.", "National Child Support Enforcement Training Work Group: This  work group met in 2005 to identify training needs and resources  available to address strategies in the Strategic Plan. The goal is to  develop a strategy for meeting training needs in order to improve  program results and customer services at all levels.", "Also, OCSE has facilitated information exchanges in other ways. OCSE  has sponsored conferences and invited representatives from state agencies  who have experience with specific initiatives to appear on panels to share  ideas with representatives from other state agencies. According to an  OCSE official, OCSE is working with state agencies to add information  about various initiatives to its existing automated systems certification  guide. State agencies interested in implementing certain initiatives will be  able to consult the guide to learn from what others have done. The guide  will also have information about the availability of grants to help states  implement the initiatives. According to this official, the first draft of the  amended guide will be available to the state agencies for comment in June  2006. In addition, OCSE held telephone conferences with state agencies on  specific subjects. For example, according to an OCSE official, OCSE  arranged a teleconference in February 2006 to enable state agencies that  had implemented debit cards to share their experiences and expertise with  state agencies interested in implementing them. OCSE officials noted that  they also distributed CD-ROMs to state agencies with information on the  Web-based customer service practices of 6 state agencies.", "Generally, state agencies responding to our survey viewed OCSE  assistance favorably. In particular, as shown in table 7, nearly all of the  state agencies reported that OCSE\u2019s efforts to create federal/state work  groups, hold conferences or sponsor training, issue guidance, and  facilitate information exchange were very or moderately helpful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCSE Has Conducted a Limited Number of Administrative Cost Audits", "paragraphs": ["Although OCSE is required to perform audits to determine whether federal  and other funds made available to carry out the state program are being  appropriately expended, OCSE has not conducted administrative cost  audits in most states. From March 2004 to March 2006, OCSE issued eight  administrative cost audit reports--an average of 4 per year.  The issued  reports show that all of the audits were limited in scope and all raised  questions about inappropriate expenditures. For example, one audit of  costs claimed for one quarter found that the federal government paid  approximately $670,000 for unallowable collection costs and litigation  settlements claimed by the Texas state agency. Another audit that  examined expenses claimed for one quarter recommended that the  Vermont state agency reimburse the federal government $603,057 for  failing to properly report interest income and abandoned property as  program income and claiming costs not related to the CSE program. Table  8 summarizes the administrative cost audits completed as of March 2006.", "An OCSE official explained that OCSE completed a limited number of  administrative costs audits because most of its resources were devoted to  completing data reliability audits associated with the federal incentive  payments.  In fiscal year 2004, OCSE notified state agencies that it would  not perform data reliability audits annually but would conduct audits  every 2 or 3 years, based on prior audit results. In addition, the notice  indicated that this approach would increase the resources available to  conduct other audits. According to an OCSE official, additional  administrative cost audits have not been planned and that unless OCSE  gets more audit resources, it is likely that few administrative cost audits  will be conducted.

As such, state agencies have  not used savings from implemented initiatives to reduce administrative  costs. State agencies also reported that several of the cost categories that  were major contributors to federal expenditures for administrative costs  were related, at least in part, to the number of FTEs devoted to the  program, including state and local CSE agency personnel; staff from other  state and local agencies that provide services under cooperative  agreements; and contractors. Although OCSE has established minimum  organizational and staffing requirements, OCSE has not conducted a study  to establish FTE or staffing guidelines to determine whether there are  additional opportunities to improve the efficiency of the CSE program and  reduce administrative costs.", "Furthermore, OCSE has not conducted administrative cost audits in most  states. Of the administrative cost audits recently completed by OCSE, all  have raised questions about inappropriate expenditures or unallowable  costs. Nonetheless, most of the completed and planned audits are focused  on incentive payment data and indicators, and although OCSE expects to  have more resources available to conduct audits, it does not plan to use  these resources to conduct more administrative cost audits.  The audits  related to the incentive payments are important, however many more  federal dollars have been spent for administrative costs, and the federal  expenditures for administrative costs have been increasing and are not  capped. From the federal government\u2019s perspective, more focus on  administrative cost audits would be a prudent use of resources. Also, in  developing its plans for administrative cost audits, OCSE officials did not  cite total expenditures for administrative costs as a factor in determining  which state agencies to audit.

To determine the cost per case, we used the total  number of cases at the end of each fiscal year and the nominal net  expenditures for each year. We calculated the median amounts for  expenditures and collections because of the wide variation among state  agencies.
