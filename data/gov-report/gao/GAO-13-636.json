Specifically, surveyed agencies reported operating 64 percent fewer plants than the number listed in the Congress's Joint Committee on Printing's (JCP) Government Printing and Binding Regulations, updated in 1990 (1990 JCP Regulations). The Department of Defense (DOD) accounted for the greatest decline in in-house printing plants. The 1990 JCP Regulations listed 142 DOD printing plants; however, the Defense Logistics Agency, which currently manages the majority of DOD's printing infrastructure, reported 17 in-house printing plants in GAO's survey. In addition, most agencies reported operating toner-based high-speed duplication machines, and fewer reported operating ink-based conventional printing presses. Of the 32 agencies operating in-house printing plants, 17 reported that all of their in-house printing was conducted on high-speed duplication machines; another 14 agencies reported operating some duplication equipment in addition to conventional printing presses (the remaining agency did not report its type of equipment). No agency reported having only ink-based conventional printing presses at its in-house plants. In addition, interviews with selected agencies showed declines in printing volumes and total spending, and suggested that agencies spent more on printing sent to the Government Printing Office (GPO) and its contracted private printers than on printing done at in-house printing plants.", "Agencies' printing practices have changed, but existing authorities have not been updated. For example, in 1994, Title 44 of the U.S Code was updated to include \"duplicating\" in the definition of \"printing,\" but the 1990 JCP Regulations do not include this definition. According to JCP staff, the Committee is aware that the 1990 JCP Regulations do not include duplicating in the definition of printing, and the Committee is working to revise the guidance. Also, the majority of government documents are now published digitally, but provisions in Title 44 that require agencies to submit documents to the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) do not reference digital publishing. Selected agencies GAO interviewed reported that they do not submit digital documents to FDLP. FDLP staff have taken a number of steps to address this, including educating agencies about FDLP requirements.

The oldest joint committee in Congress, the JCP was established  in 1846 and is comprised of five Representatives and five Senators.

The JCP exercises oversight over  government printing, and is authorized to \u201cuse any measure it considers  necessary to remedy neglect, delay, duplication or waste in the public  printing and binding, and the distribution of Government publications.\u201d To  assist in carrying out its responsibilities, in 1990 the JCP updated the  Government Printing and Binding Regulations, which require agencies to  report semi-annually to the JCP any in-house printing and any printing  that exceeds 5,000 production units of a single page or 25,000 production  units in the aggregate of multiple pages.", "GPO was established in 1861 to print government documents and  disseminate them to the public. Title 44 of the U.S Code, Public Printing  and Documents, provides that all printing for Congress, the executive  branch, and the judiciary (except the Supreme Court) is to be done by or  contracted by GPO, unless otherwise exempted. GPO prints at its in- house plant in Washington, D.C., and one other secure facility for  passports and smart cards only, but it contracts with private printers to  produce the majority of printing for the federal government. At its in-house  plant, GPO prints primarily congressional documents, such as the  Congressional Record. GPO offers different programs and services such  as GPO Express, which allows agencies to print directly to FedEx Office  and other private sector vendors, and the GPO Simplified Purchase  Agreement Program, which provides a list of pre-approved private  printers and stated prices for federal agencies to use when selecting a  printer. GPO receives funding through direct appropriations ($126 million  in fiscal year 2012), collection of an approved fee-for-service from other  federal agencies for print procurement, and the sale of publications to the  public.", "GPO\u2019s activities also include providing public access to official  government documents though the FDLP and GPO\u2019s Federal Digital  System (FDsys) website. The Superintendent of Documents, who heads  GPO\u2019s Information Dissemination division, is responsible for collecting  government products and disseminating them to the public through a  network of approximately 1200 depository libraries and online catalogues.  GPO evaluates documents to identify those that contain information on  U.S. government activities or are important reference publications, and  should therefore be disseminated to a depository library. Title 44 requires  that federal agencies make their publications available to the  Superintendent of Documents for cataloging and distribution though the  FDLP. With the onset of digital publishing, the FDLP has been  transformed into a primarily electronic program, obtaining and distributing  federal documents digitally. GPO\u2019s FDsys website, which offers an online  catalogue of official government digital documents, also aids in the  collection and preservation of government publications and provides  access to the public."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Printing Definitions", "paragraphs": ["Federal government printing definitions are outlined in statute and  regulation.

Prior to 1994, Title 44 did not  include duplicating in the definition of printing, but in 1994, the Title 44  definition was updated to include duplicating (i.e., printing done on high- speed duplication machines) as a printing process. However, the 1990  JCP Regulations were not updated to include duplicating.", "In our review, we identified two main categories of agency printing used  today\u2014 ink-based, and toner-based or ink-jet-based:  Ink-Based Printing (also referred to as conventional printing) is a  water and ink-based process that uses machines called printing  presses to produce material such as publications and other  documents. Presses use plates to transfer images onto a final paper  document. Conventional presses are relatively costly to set up,  making the first impression of a document expensive, but costs  decline as the volume of copies increases, which makes it cost- effective for high volume print jobs. Ink-based printing uses offset or  digital printing presses. Offset printing presses typically have many  open areas where the machinery can be manually adjusted, and can  take up a large amount of space (see fig. 1).", "A digital printing press also uses plates to transfer images and ink, but  the process is computerized and the press is mostly closed because it  does not need the same level of manual adjustments (see fig. 2).", "Toner-Based Printing (also referred to as duplication) is a process on  machines that use either heat to transfer an image on paper or toner  or ink-jet to transfer an image to paper. Toner-based printing is  typically done on one type of equipment, a high-speed duplication  machine, also referred to as a high-speed copier. This refers to a high  capacity toner-based machine, typically capable of 100 or more black  and white images per minute with some finishing capabilities (e.g.,  staples, collating, limited binding, etc.) (see fig. 3).

Printing industry and  government data suggest that the total volume of printed material has  been declining for at least the past 10 years. A major factor in this  decline is the use of electronic media options, such as digital publishing.  As such, federal agencies publish more documents directly to the Internet  where the public can access them, bypassing the need for the agency to  print hard copies. At the same time that digital publishing was increasing,  digital printer/copier technology was developing.

A decline in the number of in- house plants could be due to some agencies reducing their printing and  focusing more on digital publications. One factor that could have  influenced the increased emphasis on digital publications is a November  9, 2011, executive order promoting efficient spending.

One agency  reported an 11 percent increase in printing volumes and told us it was  due in part to opening an additional in-house plant in 2009. All six  agencies estimated a decrease in total spending on printing and  reproduction between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2011. Decreases  ranged from as little as 0.1 percent to over 90 percent.

Similarly,  HHS reported spending $0.4 million on in-house printing, and $50.2  million on printing sent to GPO or private printers in fiscal year 2011.", "Agencies told us that they use a number of factors such as sensitivity,  cost, volume, turnaround time, and in-house capabilities to determine if  they will print in-house or externally through GPO or private printers. For  example, DLA officials told us DLA produces some documents, such as  those printed for the President, at in-house facilities to accommodate the  short turnaround time and possible sensitive nature of the documents. VA  officials said they send large volume print orders or documents requiring  special finishing to private printers.

As mentioned above, to  facilitate consistent data gathering from federal agencies on their printing  activities, we worked with GPO and the Interagency Council on Printing  and Publication Services to establish working definitions that included the  Title 44 definition of printing and an updated definition of duplicating. In  our survey, three agencies told us their definition of printing differed from  ours. Two of those reported using the 1990 JCP Regulations printing  definition, which does not include \u201cduplicating\u201d. Similarly, VA officials  believed their agency operated one in-house printing plant, but in our  discussion officials noted that the facility does not typically produce work  that exceeds the volume limits of \u201cduplication\u201d and as such would not  qualify as a printing plant. Postal Service officials reported that its 67  district offices do not track printing volumes, and thus could not determine  if those offices\u2019 printing operations would qualify as printing plants. We  excluded these VA and Postal Service plants in our tally.", "Some agencies also had difficulty providing volumes and spending data  under these definitions. For instance, printing officials from Commerce\u2019s  bureaus told us that they each tracked printing differently\u2014some tracked  pages while others tracked the number of jobs. Regarding spending,  some printing officials told us they combined in-house printing and  printing through GPO and its contractors in their spending estimates while  others were able to report these amounts separately. For example, DLA  officials said that they do not typically track volumes by our duplication  volume limits, and as such would not track spending at facilities (i.e.,  printing plants) that may exceed those volumes. However, at our request,  DLA officials reviewed production at the agency\u2019s in-house facilities and  identified plants that met our definitions, and then estimated spending at  these plants. Other agencies we interviewed, such as the Postal Service  and the State Department, provided total spending for all jobs printed at  their in-house printing plants. As such, this data could include jobs printed  at volumes below those in the provided duplication definition.", "Agencies may also have had difficulty providing volumes and spending  data because of decentralized printing practices. For instance, five  agencies reported that their printing operations were dispersed across the  agency, which meant that officials responsible for printing operations did  not have readily available information on agency-wide printing operations.  One was the Department of Commerce, which houses 12 bureaus and  agencies that operate independently and differently. Commerce officials  told us that because printing is dispersed, there was not a single official  who could report on printing across the agency. Health and Human  Services\u2019 four divisions with printing operations also reported operating  with their own distinct printing officials and practices. In these cases, each  division provided its own volume and spending information, which could  lead to inconsistencies in data across bureaus or sub-agencies.", "In addition, the 1990 JCP Regulations provide that federal agencies  report on their print operations to the JCP, but the requirements do not  address duplication. The 1990 JCP Regulations state that agencies shall  report printing operations semi-annually to the JCP, on information such  as the total cost of printing and an inventory of plant equipment at in- house printing plants. Officials from four of the six agencies we  interviewed reported that they did not recently send reports on their  printing operations to the JCP, and JCP staff told us they received only a  few reports in the last 5 years. Discussions with officials from one agency  suggested a reason for this may be that some agency officials believed  they are only required to report on printing plants with offset or  conventional printing equipment, not those with duplication equipment.  Since the reporting requirements date back to 1990, before Title 44 was  updated to include duplicating in the definition of printing, neither the 1990  JCP Regulations nor the JCP report forms specify that agencies are  required to submit reports for printing plants that agencies may consider  duplication plants. Officials from one agency told us they did not report to  JCP because they did not have any in-house facilities, and officials from  another agency noted that they were exempt from the reporting  requirements. Additionally, officials from a bureau at one agency told us  they send JCP reports to an in-house printing officer, suggesting some  confusion regarding reporting requirements.", "JCP staff told us they recognize the 1990 JCP Regulations do not include  duplication in the definition of printing, and are working to revise this  guidance. Specifically, JCP staff are in the process of developing printing  definitions that more closely reflect current printing practices, particularly  for \u201cduplication\u201d activities.

GPO estimates that more than 90 percent of  all government information is published digitally. Title 44 outlines the  types of documents that are required to be submitted to the FDLP, upon  request, but does not reference digital documents explicitly.

For documents printed  through GPO, agencies are not required to make a determination about  whether a document should be submitted to FDLP, as GPO typically  identifies documents that could be of interest to the FDLP and then, if  FDLP request them, sends them directly to the FDLP.

See table below for a list  of how each printing term was defined in the 1990 JCP Regulations, Title  44, and by GAO with assistance from GPO and the Interagency Council  on Printing and Publication Services.", "To identify agencies that could be operating in-house printing plants, we  developed a universe consisting of agencies authorized in the 1990 JCP  Regulations and agencies that had obligated funds to the \u201cprinting and  reproduction\u201d object class in at least 2 years between fiscal years 2009  and 2011. Agencies report printing and related obligations in this object  class. Data in the various volumes of the President\u2019s budget request,  including object class data, undergo rigorous review by the OMB, and  accordingly, are generally considered sufficiently reliable for most of  GAO\u2019s purposes. This includes using this data to select agencies to  survey.", "For the purposes of our review we made a number of adjustments to the  1990 JCP Regulations list of 36 agencies. First, we combined the armed  forces and their plants, which were listed separately in the 1990 JCP  Regulations, under the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) since DLA took  over all printing plants for the armed forces. Second, we excluded the  Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, due to its being outside the  executive branch; GPO, as it was outside the scope of our review, and  the National Academy of Public Administration since it had ongoing  related work on GPO; and the Panama Canal Commission, as it was de- commissioned in 1999. Finally we separated the Social Security  Administration from Health and Human Services. In 1990 the Social  Security Administration was a sub-agency with an in-house printing plant  within Health and Human Services, but it became an independent agency  in 1994. With these exceptions, 31 of the agencies from the 1990 list  remained in our universe.", "Through budget obligations data we identified 16 additional agencies with  at least 2 years of printing and reproduction obligations for fiscal years  2009 through 2011. This resulted in a total universe of 47 agencies with  possible in-house printing plants.", "To describe how federal printing regulations and statutes reflect current  printing practices, we reviewed legal documents such as Title 44 of the  U.S. Code and the 1990 JCP Regulations, administered a survey to the  universe of agencies described above, and interviewed officials from the  printing industry, GPO, and other federal agencies.", "To describe agencies\u2019 printing volumes and spending, we interviewed the  six agencies from our survey universe whose printing and reproduction  obligations in fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 together constituted the  majority\u2014roughly 80 percent\u2014of total federal obligations to printing and  reproduction. Those agencies were the Department of Commerce, the  Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, Department of  State, U.S. Postal Service, and Veterans Affairs. We interviewed printing  and budget officials from these agencies, and obtained information on  their printing operations, including data on printing volumes and spending.  Findings from our interviews with selected agencies cannot be used to  generalize results to the entire population.", "To describe agencies\u2019 in-house printing spending, we relied on data  provided by selected agencies since federal printing and reproduction  obligations may not reliably describe agencies\u2019 in-house printing  spending. This is partially due to challenges with obligations data we have  previously reported, such as that obligations categories are not mutually  exclusive (e.g., it is possible for some printing and duplication obligations  to be categorized under a different object class, and vice versa). We also  found that the printing and reproduction object class includes printing  done through GPO or external private printers as well as that done at  agencies\u2019 in-house printing plants. As such, we relied on interviews with  agencies to describe their in-house printing operations and collected  spending information from agencies for analysis. We also asked agencies  to provide spending information on the printing that they sent out to GPO  and private printers. Some agencies provided printing expenses and  others provided obligations, but for the purposes of this report, we refer to  both as \u201cspending.\u201d Obligations and expenditures capture different  aspects of the budgeting process \u2013 obligations are the legal commitment  to pay for a good or service while expenditures are the actual  disbursement of money. For the purposes of this report we assume that  there is a relatively short time lag between obligation and expenditure for  printing and reproduction activities, and therefore that the difference is not  material. As such, we refer to both obligations and expenditures as a  single \u201cspending\u201d category."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Government Printing Survey", "paragraphs": ["To describe agencies\u2019 current printing practices, such as operation of in- house printing plants, we administered the survey described above to the  47 agencies in our universe from January through March 2013.

We conducted these survey pretests to  determine if the questions were understandable and measured what we  intended, and to ensure that the survey was not overly burdensome. On  the basis of feedback from the pretests we modified the questionnaire as  appropriate. In late January 2013, we sent an email alerting agency  contacts to the upcoming survey; the survey was delivered to recipients  via email message a few days later. Using the questionnaire, we  requested contact information for print officials; feedback on the  definitions used in the survey, each agency\u2019s cited authority to operate in- house printing plants, and information on in-house printing plants such as  location and equipment used. We did not independently verify if the  information in the surveys was accurate. For agencies in the JCP 1990  Regulations, we provided a list of plants that were authorized in 1990 and  asked them to verify if a listed plant was operational or not operational.  We also asked that the agencies identify any additional plants that were  not included in the 1990 list. For agencies that were not included in the  1990 list but were added to our survey population using obligations data,  we asked that they provide plant information.
