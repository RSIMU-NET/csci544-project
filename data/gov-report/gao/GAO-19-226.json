The remaining 73 districts had at least one choice, such as a Bureau of Indian Education, charter, magnet, or career and technical education school (see figure). Most of these 451 districts were in rural areas near tribal lands. Rural districts may offer few school choice options because, for example, they do not have enough students to justify additional schools or they may face difficulties recruiting and retaining teachers, among other challenges.", "Some of the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students were located in large urban areas, such as New York City, and the majority (62) offered at least one option other than a traditional public school, according to GAO's analysis. The most common option was a charter school. However, because Indian students often account for a small percentage of all students in these districts, Indian education experts GAO interviewed said that the schools are less likely to have curricula that reflect Indian students' cultural identity or provide instruction on Native languages\u2014things that tribes and experts consider crucial to strengthening, rebuilding, and sustaining Indian cultures and communities. Also, even when Indian students had more options, no consistent enrollment patterns were evident. Whether Indian students enrolled in different types of schools could be a function, in part, of differences in state school choice laws and the extent to which these schools offered curricula that reflect Indian languages, cultures, or histories, according to Indian education experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For many years, studies have shown that American Indian and Alaska  Native students (collectively referred to as Indian students) have  struggled academically, and the nation\u2019s K-12 schools have not  consistently provided these students with high-quality, culturally-relevant  educational opportunities to encourage their success. As a result, lower  academic outcomes have consequences for Indian students\u2019 future  educational and economic opportunities, and also can affect a tribe\u2019s  ability to build a competitive tribal economy.

For example, in one district near Stockton, California and another near  Minneapolis, Minnesota, Indian student enrollment in magnet schools was  higher than their peers by 17 and 9 percentage points, respectively.", "Whether Indian students enrolled in different types of schools could be a  function of local differences in school choice and could be influenced by  the extent to which these schools offered curricula that reflect Indian  languages, cultures, or histories. Experts with whom we spoke said that in  some areas, tribes have more control over education for Indian students,  which can increase the tribe\u2019s ability to influence curricula and  accountability metrics to help meet Indian students\u2019 academic and non- academic needs. Experts further noted that many districts with high  percentages of Indian students are located near tribal lands, which can  offer Indian students living there greater access to culturally-relevant  curricula and instruction in Native languages than their peers in urban  locations. In 2015, the National Indian Education Study reported that in  schools where Indian students represented at least one-quarter of the  students, a higher percentage of Indian students reported knowledge of  their heritage or reported they received instruction in Native languages  compared to peers attending schools with lower percentages of Indian  students. Several tribal leaders and experts in Indian education said that  access to culturally-relevant curricula and language instruction is crucial  to strengthening, rebuilding, and sustaining Indian cultures and  communities.", "In addition, experts noted that tribes sometimes seek to operate or  oversee schools for Indian youth. For example, Oklahoma allows  federally recognized tribes to authorize charter schools. In other states  with charter school legislation, experts told us that tribes often must work  through state charter school authorizers if they wish to open charter  schools. BIE officials and Indian education experts also said that areas  with BIE schools offer opportunities for tribes to exercise more control  over education by converting the school from BIE-operated to tribally- operated. One tribal leader said the tribe was exploring this option in  order to increase the tribe\u2019s autonomy over its students\u2019 education.  Education has federal-level program offices that provide support to states  and school districts related to school choice generally and Indian  education specifically. Education recently finalized changes to its Charter  Schools Program that will give priority to grantees seeking funding  opportunities that would specifically serve the educational needs of Indian  students.", "Finally, some urban school districts with large numbers of Indian students  have district-level offices designed to work directly with Indian students  and their families and to liaise between the school district and nearby  tribes. Access to these resources, among other things, may help Indian  students and families select a school that will best meet the student\u2019s  academic and non-academic needs, according to Indian education  experts we interviewed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education  (Education) for review and comment.

In  its written comments, Education suggested that, given the eligibility  requirements to attend BIE schools, it is possible for Indian students to  have greater access to educational choice than their non-Indian peers in  some areas. This observation is consistent with the findings of our report,  which showed that in school districts with high percentages of Indian  students and school options, the most common option was a BIE school  (see fig. 4).

We clarified our rationale in appendix I.  Specifically, according to Education\u2019s PSS survey documentation, the  PSS was based on a sample of private schools, not the universe. The  official in Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)  who is responsible for the PSS told us that the PSS sample contained  only about half of the private schools in the nation, which would not allow  for comprehensive mapping of private schools.", "We further explored using the broader list of private schools from which  Education draws the PSS sample. The PSS documentation shows that  about 30 percent of this list (more than 10,000 entities) were not private  schools. We confirmed this information with the same NCES official, who  explained that entities that are not private schools are filtered out through  NCES\u2019s survey process. Based on our review of the PSS survey  documentation and methods and our interviews with cognizant NCES  officials, we determined that it would not be possible to use PSS data to  comprehensively and accurately map the locations of these private  schools nationally or in specific areas with large Indian student  populations. However, as we indicated in the draft report on which  Education commented, the PSS contains information on a large number  of private schools and we determined that it can provide reliable data for  some variables other than the specific locations of private schools,  including the total number of students attending private schools  disaggregated by race and ethnicity.

This allowed us to account  for all public schools and BIE schools in a given area that could be an  option for Indian students. It was necessary because, for example,  charter schools or BIE schools are sometimes recorded in the CCD as  their \u201cown district,\u201d i.e., separate from the public school district for a given  area because of the local public school administrative structure.", "We further examined school choice based on a school district\u2019s location in  urban and rural areas. The CCD collects location data using  classifications ranging from large cities to remote rural areas. For  analysis, we collapsed these classifications into two categories,  consistent with Education\u2019s analyses: (1) urban areas, i.e., locations  classified as cities or suburbs, and (2) rural areas, i.e., locations classified  as towns or rural."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Additional Maps", "paragraphs": ["This appendix contains maps of selected regions of the country to provide  a more in-depth view of the school choice options available in school  districts in which American Indian and Alaska Native students accounted  for 25 percent or more of all students in the district."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Bill Keller (Assistant Director),  David Watsula (Analyst-in-Charge), Susan Aschoff, James Bennett,  Deborah Bland, Connor Kincaid, Jean McSween, John Mingus, James  Rebbe, and Leanne Violette made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Private School Choice: Requirements for Students and Donors  Participating in State Tax Credit Scholarship Programs.
