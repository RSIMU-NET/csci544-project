SBA plays a critical role in assisting the victims of natural and other declared disasters. SBA provides financial assistance through its Disaster Loan Program to help homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofits recover from disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and terrorist attacks. Since the agency's inception in 1953, SBA has approved more than $46 billion in disaster loans for homeowners, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. After the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes (Katrina, Rita, and Wilma), SBA faced an unprecedented demand for disaster loans, while also being confronted with a significant backlog of applications; therefore, hundreds of thousands of loans were not disbursed in a timely way. Many criticized SBA for what was perceived to be a slow and confusing response to the disasters and one that exposed many deficiencies in the agency's Disaster Loan Program and demonstrated the need for reform. For example, as we stated in our February 2007 report, SBA did not engage in or complete comprehensive disaster plans before the Gulf Coast hurricanes, and this limited logistical disaster planning likely contributed to the initial challenges the agency faced in responding to the 2005 hurricanes. As a result, Congress and SBA agreed that the program needed significant improvements. Since then, SBA has taken several steps to reform its Disaster Loan Program which include creating an online loan application, increasing the capacity of its Disaster Credit Management System (DCMS), and developing a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). In June 2008, Congress enacted the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act (Act) to expand steps taken by SBA and require new measures to ensure that SBA is prepared for future catastrophic disasters."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While SBA has taken some steps toward implementing the Act, the agency still needs to take additional steps to completely address 8 provisions. According to SBA officials, the agency has not yet completely addressed some provisions that require new regulations because to do so, the agency must make extensive changes to current programs or implement new programs--such as the Immediate and Expedited Disaster Assistance Programs--to satisfy requirements of the Act. These programs, which require participation of private lenders, would be designed to provide businesses with access to short-term loans while they are waiting for long-term assistance. Moreover, as required by the Act, SBA has not issued an update of its comprehensive DRP that reflects recent changes resulting from the Act's requirements, as well as SBA's own reform efforts. Delays in updates to the DRP limit the agency's ability to adequately prepare for and respond to disasters. Also, SBA has not fully addressed the requirement for providing region-specific marketing and outreach and ensuring the information is made available to Small Business Centers (SBDCs) and other local resources. We consistently heard from regional entities, such as SBDCs and emergency management groups, about the need for more up-front information on SBA's Disaster Loan Program and their expected roles and responsibilities in disaster response efforts. By taking such actions, SBA could leverage the efforts and capacity of SBDCs, as well as state and local emergency management agencies, and ensure that it and they will be better prepared for future events, especially in disaster-prone areas. Furthermore, the Act established multiple new reporting requirements and while SBA has addressed some of these, the agency has failed to comply with the Act and issue a first annual report on disaster assistance--which was due in November 2008. Specifically, the Act requires that SBA report annually on the total number of SBA disaster staff, major changes to the Disaster Loan Program (such as changes to technology or staff responsibilities), a description of the number and dollar amount of disaster loans made during the year, and SBA's plans for preparing and responding to possible future disasters. Failure to produce annual reports on schedule can lead to a lack of transparency on the agency's progress in reforming the program. Additionally, 9 provisions set forth in the Act are subject to deadlines, which the agency has had limited success in meeting. The agency also has not developed a plan with expected time frames for addressing the remaining requirements. SBA's not providing reports to Congress and not having an implementation plan in place for addressing the remaining requirements can lead to a lack of transparencyabout the agency's Disaster Loan Program, program improvement, and capacity to reform the program, as well as its ability to adequately prepare for and respond to disasters. SBA's initial response following the 2008 Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike aligned with major components of its DRP, such as infrastructure, human capital, information technology, and communications. Additionally, individuals to whom we spoke affected by both disasters considered the agency's overall performance somewhat positive, but believed the disaster loan process could be improved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on reforms made to the  Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Disaster Loan Program and the  impact those reforms had following recent disasters.

This  report focuses on (1) the extent to which SBA addressed the requirements  of the Act, and (2) how SBA\u2019s response, following the major disasters of  2008, aligned with key components of its June 2007 DRP. To do this work,  we identified and analyzed the requirements of the Act and related  statutory deadlines; obtained information about SBA\u2019s completed, current,  and planned reform efforts; reviewed documents and progress reports to  determine if requirements had been addressed and deadlines were met;  interviewed officials and obtained information on what, if any, challenges  exist that may affect SBA\u2019s ability to implement certain requirements; and  interviewed officials to obtain information about next steps and resources  that the agency identified as needed to address any remaining  requirements. We also conducted site visits in Iowa and Texas, and  obtained information on SBA\u2019s performance in the aftermath of the 2008  Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike. We interviewed SBA and Small  Business Development Center (SBDC) officials, state and local officials,  and representatives of local Chambers of Commerce, economic  development organizations, and affected small business owners about  what worked well and suggested improvements to SBA\u2019s disaster loan  processes. Finally, we reviewed results from a survey of SBA loan  applicants on their satisfaction with SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program in 2008.

SBA and SBDC officials, state and local representatives, private- entity officials, and business owners in Iowa and Texas told us that in the  days immediately following the disasters, SBA\u2019s Office of Disaster  Assistance staff reported to the affected areas and began providing needed  disaster assistance. These individuals also said that SBA staff provided  outreach and public information about its Disaster Loan Program;  distributed application information; assigned knowledgeable customer  service representatives to various Disaster and Business Recovery  Centers; and assisted in the initial application process by answering  questions, providing guidance, and offering one-on-one help\u2013\u2013as outlined  in SBA\u2019s DRP. In addition, our review of SBA\u2019s 2008 Disaster Loan  Program Customer Satisfaction Survey also showed that respondents were  somewhat satisfied with the assistance SBA provided during other recent  disasters.", "However, both the individuals we interviewed and survey results indicated  areas for improvement and opportunities to increase satisfaction with  SBA\u2019s disaster loan process. For example, individuals we interviewed and  survey responses pointed to concerns about the amount of paperwork  required to complete SBA\u2019s disaster loan application and the timeliness of  loan disbursements. Also, some business owners said they had to provide  copies of 3 years of federal income tax returns, although they had signed  an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 8821\u2014Tax Information  Authorization\u2014which allows SBA to get tax return information directly  from IRS. To address these concerns, the individuals we interviewed  suggested several changes to the program, such as eliminating the  requirement that business loan applicants provide copies of IRS tax  records; providing partial disbursements earlier in the process; using  bridge loans to help ensure disaster victims receive timely assistance; and  involving SBA, SBDCs, and state and local officials in joint pre-planning  and disaster preparedness efforts.", "Though SBA officials told us they have been taking steps to improve the  application process, these steps and improvement efforts were not  documented. In addition, we found that while SBA conducts an annual  customer satisfaction survey, the agency does not appear to incorporate  this feedback mechanism into its formal efforts to continually improve the  application process. Furthermore, SBA does not appear to have a formal  process for addressing identified problem areas and using this experience  to improve the application process for future applicants. By establishing  such a process to address identified problem areas, SBA could better  demonstrate its commitment to improving the Disaster Loan Program. As  discussed in our report, while SBA has made progress, the agency has  missed opportunities to further improve its Disaster Loan Program, and in  particular improve the application process for future applicants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions Needed To Ensure That SBA Addresses Remaining Requirements and Improves the Application Process", "paragraphs": ["In our report, we made five recommendations to facilitate SBA\u2019s progress  in meeting and complying with requirements of the Act and improve the  Disaster Loan Program. Specifically, we recommended that the  Administrator of SBA:  (1) develop procedures for regional entities that would enable SBA to  meet all region-specific requirements of the Act and ensure regional  entities, such as SBDCs, have this information and other Disaster Loan  Program information readily available prior to the likely occurrence of a  disaster;  (2) complete the first annual report to Congress on disaster assistance and  adhere to the time frame for subsequent reports;  (3) expeditiously issue an updated DRP that reflects recent changes  resulting from the Act\u2019s requirements, as well as SBA\u2019s own reform efforts;  (4) develop an implementation plan and report to Congress on the  agency\u2019s progress in addressing the requirements of the Act, including  milestone dates for completing implementation; and  (5) develop and implement a process to address identified problems in the  disaster loan application process for future applicants.", "SBA generally agreed with our recommendations and stated the agency\u2019s  plan to incorporate them into its ongoing efforts to implement the Act and  improve the application process. Specifically, SBA plans to expand its  outreach efforts to ensure the public in all regions of the country are more  aware of SBA disaster assistance programs before a disaster strikes. SBA  is also planning to submit both the required annual report, and the 2009  revision to its DRP to Congress by November 15, 2009. Additionally, SBA  officials said the agency has plans to develop an implementation plan for  completion of the remaining provisions. Finally, in response to our  recommendation on the application process, SBA cited ongoing efforts  since 2005 to improve its application process, such as the electronic loan  application, and said the agency has plans to continue its improvement  efforts and make them an ongoing priority.
