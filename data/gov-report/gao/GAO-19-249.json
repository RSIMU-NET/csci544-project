HHS and Interior had procedures for providing initial ethics training as required beginning in January 2017. Prior to February 2019 SBA did not have written procedures for initial ethics training and did not adequately document political appointees' training dates. SBA's written procedures now reflect the requirements of initial ethics training and SBA developed a tracking sheet to indicate appointees completed training. GAO will assess the implementation of the tracking sheet to confirm the process is sufficient for documenting appointees' completion of initial ethics training.", "Interior's ethics program has human capital and workforce continuity challenges. Interior reported that four out of 14 full-time positions were vacant. Interior officials attributed the vacancies to a recent transformation of the ethics program and prioritizing the staffing at individual bureaus such as the National Park Service. However, vacancies affected the ethics program's ability to properly document policies and procedures as well as file and review financial disclosure forms. According to Interior officials, steps are being taken to address vacancies and document policies and procedures.

We  selected the four agencies to provide a range in the number and type of  political appointees in each agency, a range in agency size, and a range  in the strength of their ethics programs, as determined by prior OGE  program reviews. We conducted case studies on three of the agencies we selected: the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), the  Interior (Interior), and the Small Business Administration (SBA). The  fourth agency selected was the Executive Office of the President (EOP).  We contacted the White House Counsel\u2019s Office in February 2018 to  solicit the EOP\u2019s perspective on the ethics program in place at the White  House, and oversight of ethics compliance for political appointees in the  executive branch.

These standards call for management to design  control activities, such as policies and procedures to achieve objectives.  Based on our review, analysis, and professional judgment, we selected  the internal control principles that were most relevant to effectively  executing an executive branch ethics program. We provided each agency  with an identical set of questions based on the selected internal control  principles and components.

Next, we  used a nongeneralizable random sampling method to select political  appointees at each agency. We selected 12 political appointees at both  HHS and Interior, and 10 political appointees at SBA. We reviewed  relevant documentation for these appointees to determine whether  agency internal controls were sufficient to ensure that certain ethics  program requirements, such as signing the ethics pledge, completing  initial ethics training, and submitting a financial disclosure report, were  met.

After a position was filled, the database tracked information such  as the name of the appointee, position, federal department or agency,  and start and departure dates. The primary limitation of the data was that  departure dates of political appointees were unreliable.

The Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) stated that transparency promotes accountability by providing the  public with information about what the government is doing. In a 2009  memorandum, OMB directed agencies to make information available  online and to use modern technology to disseminate useful information,  rather than waiting for specific requests under FOIA. Although some  data are publicly available on political appointees and FOIA requests can  be used to varying effect to obtain data on political appointees, neither  option results in comprehensive, timely, and publicly available data. Until  the names of political appointees and their position, position type, agency  or department name, start and end dates are publicly available at least  quarterly, it will be difficult for the public to access comprehensive and  reliable information.", "Making such information available would promote transparency. The  public, including independent researchers, the media, and  nongovernmental organizations, can use these data to perform  independent analyses to identify gaps and challenges for filling political  appointee positions or to identify potential conflicts of interest.

As the leader of human resources and  personnel policy, OPM is positioned to collect, maintain, and make  political appointee data publicly available on a frequent and recurring  basis. However, OPM is limited in its ability to provide comprehensive  data, in part because it does not regularly receive data from each agency  that has political appointees, such as the EOP, which has approximately  225 political appointee positions based on the 2016 Plum Book. PPO is  positioned to make more comprehensive data on political appointees  publicly available. However, PPO is reestablished with each new  presidential administration, which could be a barrier to establishing a  consistent process for maintaining and publishing data on a recurring  basis.

Late filing heightens the risk of  appointees performing agency work while having conflicts of interest;  however, none of the three appointees filed more than 30 days after the  due date or the last day of an extension, and therefore were not subject to  a late filing fee. For example, one Interior appointee received a 30-day  extension to file a new entrant report, but filed it 4 days late. One SBA  appointee received an extension exceeding the maximum time\u201490  days\u2014that an agency may grant to any filer and consequently filed 2  days late.

The non-PAS HHS  appointee signed the pledge 9 days after his permanent appointment  date. While the restrictions under the pledge are enforceable by civil  action, there are no legal consequences, such as fines or penalties, for  failing to timely sign the pledge. for all appointees, a 2-year ban on  involvement in \u201cparticular matters\u201d  involving former employers and  clients;  for former lobbyists, a 2-year ban on  involvement on particular matters on  which he or she lobbied; and  for appointees who leave  government service, a 5-year ban on  lobbying agencies in which they  served.", "The President or his designee may grant a waiver of any of the  restrictions contained in the executive order. As of March 2019, 32  executive branch appointees\u2014not including White House appointees\u2014 received limited waivers of the pledge. Interior\u2019s then acting solicitor and  principal deputy solicitor signed a limited waiver of certain restrictions on  lobbying activities for one appointee in our sample upon the appointee\u2019s  departure from the agency in July 2017. However, according to Interior  ethics officials, the official from the Solicitor\u2019s Office did not have authority  to grant a waiver. Furthermore, Interior\u2019s ethics office was not included in  the decision to grant the waiver, although Interior ethics officials ultimately  notified the appointee when they became aware that the waiver was  legally invalid. According to the DAEO, Interior is updating and  documenting its ethics program processes and procedures, including new  processes to sign ethics pledges and grant waivers, but did not provide a time frame for completion. We discuss Interior\u2019s efforts to document  overall ethics program processes and procedures later in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reviewed Agencies\u2019 Ethics Programs Face Human Capital and Workforce Continuity Challenges", "paragraphs": ["We found that all of the agencies we reviewed are addressing human  capital issues and workforce continuity challenges to varying extents to  achieve the goals and objectives of the ethics program. Standards for  internal control state that management can help ensure operational  success by having the right personnel for the job on board and  maintaining a continuity of needed skills and abilities. Standards for  internal control also state that management has a responsibility to obtain  the workforce necessary to achieve organizational goals. HHS and  Interior reported challenges to recruiting and retaining ethics staff with the  necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities. All of the reviewed agencies  reported varying levels of effort to address vacancies, skills gaps, and  succession planning.", "HHS reported vacancies in its ethics program as well as challenges in  recruiting and hiring; however ethics program officials took actions to  mitigate negative effects of the vacancies. As of October 1, 2018, HHS\u2019s  Ethics Division had six vacancies out of 32 full-time positions (a vacancy  rate of approximately 19 percent), including the Alternate DAEO position.  HHS officials told us that a senior attorney was assigned to assume the  duties of the Alternate DAEO position for six months in 2018. HHS ethics  officials told us that the 2017 government-wide hiring freeze and  workforce reduction plan affected their efforts to fill vacancies. However,  ethics officials also told us that, as of October 1, 2018, four people had  tentatively accepted offers to fill vacancies. HHS ethics officials told us  that applicants for ethics attorneys and specialist positions generally do  not have a background in federal government ethics laws. As a result,  Ethics Division officials said that it must invest time and resources to train  new hires, who attend and review OGE trainings, participate in monthly  interagency ethics meetings, and take HHS-specific ethics training.", "HHS ethics officials told us that new ethics program hires are assigned  work from across the spectrum of ethics subject matter and trained one- on-one by senior staff. To address staffing shortages and prepare for  potential attrition, the HHS ethics officials said they cross-train staff  members and assign back-up team members to support HHS\u2019s operating  and staff divisions. In addition, to track potential staff attrition or  retirement, the ethics officials told us that the Ethics Division uses OPM\u2019s  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey data collected from HHS  employees. However, the data only give the Ethics Division a general  sense of the number of personnel that are planning to leave or retire.  HHS Ethics Division officials said they use survey data because there is a  general sensitivity related to asking about retirement and delays in  planned retirements that could affect recruiting and hiring replacements.", "Interior\u2019s ethics office also reported vacancies and challenges in recruiting  and hiring that contributed to the issues in the ethics program. As of  November 2018, the Interior ethics office reported that out of 14 full-time  positions, four were vacant (a 29 percent vacancy rate). All vacancies  were ethics attorney positions. Interior reported an ongoing  transformation of the department\u2019s ethics program and officials said that  the vacancies resulted from prioritizing the staffing at individual bureaus\u2014 such as the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service\u2014instead  of the department-level ethics office, which is responsible for overseeing  the bureaus\u2019 ethics programs and providing ethics services to employees  at the Office of the Secretary, the Office of the Solicitor, and to all of  Interior\u2019s political appointees. Interior\u2019s ethics officials said that the high  vacancy rate in their ethics office affected its ability to properly collect and  review financial disclosure forms\u2014one of the main responsibilities of the  federal ethics program. According to Interior\u2019s new DAEO, the office  received an influx of financial disclosure reports during the presidential  transition, but was unprepared to handle them. Furthermore, during 2017  one official was responsible for reviewing and certifying more than 300  public financial disclosure forms. The official was unable to balance  proper and timely review of forms with other responsibilities that also  included reviewing and certifying more than 800 confidential disclosure  forms. In the Interior Inspector General\u2019s 2018 report on Interior\u2019s Major  Management Challenges, ethics staffing was identified as a limitation, as  staffing shortages could lead to delays in reviewing appointees\u2019 financial  disclosure documentation.", "While the single Interior official was experienced in reviewing financial  disclosure forms, Interior officials stated that there was not enough  management support, training, or resources provided to properly review  financial disclosure forms in 2017. According to the DAEO, a new  supervisory ethics official for financial disclosure forms was hired in  September 2018 as part of a proposed and ongoing organizational  restructuring of Interior\u2019s ethics office. In addition, Interior posted a job  announcement for a second ethics attorney and now has two ethics  specialists for financial disclosures. The DAEO stated that the ethics  program also plans to increase the number of ethics officials that review  and certify financial disclosures, and has established new program goals,  such as improving ethics staff competencies for technical review of  financial disclosure reports.", "Interior ethics officials also reported that the government-wide hiring  freeze affected their ability to hire staff and address ethics program staff  continuity. To build capacity within the ethics program and create a strong  ethical culture at the agency and bureau levels, the Acting Deputy  Secretary recommended in May 2017 that Interior develop a structure  and staffing plan to have a full-time ethics official for every 500  employees by fiscal year 2020. On October 26, 2018, Interior officials  stated that the ethics program was implementing the Acting Deputy  Secretary\u2019s staffing plan. However, OGE benchmarking guidance states  that there is no \u201cright\u201d ratio for the number of ethics staff per employee,  and that agencies should determine their ratio based on certain aspects  of individual ethics programs, such as the scope of potential conflicts and  the complexity of financial disclosure reports.", "Interior officials could not explain how the ratio was determined nor  provide a strategy for achieving the goal or evaluating whether the ratio is  meeting the needs of the department in the future. We have previously identified leading practices for human capital management; these  practices include that agencies should determine the workforce skills and  competencies needed to achieve current and future goals and objectives  as well as identify and develop strategies to address gaps. In addition,  agencies should continually assess and improve human capital planning  and investment, and assess the impact on accomplishing the mission.  Without having a better understanding of resource needs and  documenting how to properly allocate and determine needed resources,  Interior may not accurately estimate its needs and may not be best  positioned to assess and strengthen its ethics workforce to achieve  program goals and objectives.", "Moreover, staff turnover at the Interior ethics office also reduced  institutional knowledge. For example, Interior\u2019s ethics office could not  produce the documentation of the policies and procedures that support its  ethics program\u2014an internal control requirement\u2014such as documenting  and providing written responses to ethics queries and the tools used to  ensure short and long-term continuity of operations. However, the ethics  office previously provided documented evidence of some of these policies  and procedures in its response to OGE\u2019s 2016 program review. Interior  ethics officials stated that the OGE response was produced prior to the  DAEO retiring and drafted by staff who no longer work at Interior.", "Standards for Internal Control also require agencies to document key  processes and procedures to retain organizational knowledge and  mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel, as  well as a means to communicate that knowledge as needed to external  parties, such as external auditors. Both HHS and SBA provided  documentation of ethics program policies and procedures while Interior  did not provide documentation. Since there was no formal documentation  of the ethics program\u2019s policies and procedures, Interior ethics officials  stated that the ethics office will document them as part of its  organizational restructuring plans. As of March 2019, Interior officials had  not provided this documentation. For example, the ethics program is to  ensure that all ethics related advice, legal analyses, and conclusions are  documented. However, without Interior completing the documentation of  its policies and procedures and making them accessible to staff,  institutional knowledge may be lost, and there is greater risk of not  achieving the goals and objectives of the ethics program.", "SBA did not report challenges to recruiting or staff continuity in part  because of the small size of the ethics program. SBA\u2019s ethics program is  administered by three full-time officials and during our review, the DAEO  position was vacant for more than 3 months due to the retirement of the  previous DAEO. However, the Alternate DAEO assumed the  responsibility for managing the ethics program until a new DAEO was  hired in August 2018. Ethics officials reported that the program could  draw upon a pool of field attorneys previously designated to perform  collateral ethics duties to temporarily address disruptions in staffing. To  address continuity and succession, SBA ethics officials reported that a  headquarters staff attorney was detailed to the ethics program to prepare  for the possible retirement of its current Alternate DAEO."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Strong ethics programs are critical to ensuring public trust in government  and the integrity of actions taken on the public\u2019s behalf. The executive  branch ethics program is a shared responsibility across government.  Political appointees, in particular agency heads, have a personal  responsibility to exercise leadership in ethics. Some data are available on  political appointees serving in the Executive Branch but the data have  limitations that impede their usefulness. To facilitate independent review  and analysis related to political appointees, members of the public need  access to information on who is serving in political appointee positions.  Otherwise, they are limited in their ability to discern whether appointees  are performing their duties free of conflict. Information on the political  appointees serving in the executive branch at any point in time would also  facilitate congressional oversight. Both OPM and PPO are positioned to  report these data, but there are some benefits and drawbacks of each  agency\u2019s current capacity that will need to be considered. Ultimately, it is  a policy decision as to which agency is best positioned to report  comprehensive and timely data on political appointees.", "Further, a robust internal control system is critical for agency ethics  programs to achieve their mission of preventing conflicts of interest on the  part of their employees. Without effective internal controls, agency ethics  programs cannot reasonably assure that they are mitigating the risk\u2014or  the appearance of\u2014public servants making biased decisions when  carrying out the governmental responsibilities entrusted to them. During  the course of our review SBA took steps to establish written procedures  for initial ethics training, but still needs to complete the implementation of  procedures to track and verify that all political appointees meet ethics  training requirements.", "As Interior continues to reorganize its ethics program, improved strategic  workforce planning can help to accurately assess its needs, maintain  continuity, and achieve program goals and objectives.

We reviewed relevant laws and  standards, and the United States Government Policy and Supporting  Positions (Plum Book). We used the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  Open Government Directive (M-10-06) memorandum to develop criteria  for transparency and public availability.", "We interviewed officials from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  to understand the extent to which data they collect on current political  appointees are comprehensive, timely, and reportable. OPM provided  data on the political appointees serving in the federal government  between January 2017 and June 2018. We also requested and obtained  information from OPM on the volume of Freedom of Information Act  requests for data on political appointees to assess demand for this type of  data. To further evaluate public demand for political appointee data, we  interviewed two nongovernmental organizations that track political  appointees in the executive branch, ProPublica, and the Partnership for  Public Service. We gathered information on the public\u2019s demand for  information regarding political appointees, and the use and limitations of  data. Both organizations provided statistics quantifying public demand,  including number of unique visitors to their website and media  impressions. Media impressions are any viewing of or interaction with a  piece of content. We requested information or interviews with the Office of  Presidential Personnel (PPO) and several White House Liaisons to  understand how they track, maintain, and use data on political appointees  serving in the executive branch. A senior leader at PPO and one White  House Liaison acknowledged our request for an interview but deferred to  the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. As well, an ethics officer indicated they  would be unable to facilitate the exchange of information with the White  House Liaison Office in their agency. The White House Counsel\u2019s Office did not acknowledge requests for information or interviews. We  interviewed former senior PPO officials from the two previous  administrations to understand how they tracked, maintained and used  data on political appointees.", "To identify internal control processes and determine the extent to which  selected agencies use appropriate controls to ensure their ethics  programs are designed and implemented to meet statutory and regulatory  requirements, we first identified four case study agencies. We selected a  range of case study agencies based on the number and type of political  appointees as well as the strength of their ethics programs, as  determined by Office of Government Ethics (OGE) reviews. Using data  from the 2016 Plum Book, we identified the total number of political  appointee positions within each agency or department across the  following four categories: presidential appointees with Senate  confirmation (PAS), presidential appointees, noncareer members of the  Senior Executive Service, and Schedule C appointees. We selected the  Executive Office of the President (EOP) as a case study agency because  EOP has the largest number of presidential appointees, and because  OGE has not recently conducted a program review of EOP. According to  OGE, ethics program reviews are a primary means of conducting  systematic oversight of executive branch ethics programs. OGE  completed a review of each agency between January 2014 and January  2018. Since the White House Counsel\u2019s Office did not acknowledge  receipt of our notification letter we could not review EOP\u2019s practices.", "To allow for more comparability among case studies, we excluded  agencies and departments that did not have at least one PAS, and one  presidential appointee or noncareer member of the Senior Executive  Service. From the remaining list of departments and agencies, we  excluded those with nine or fewer total political appointee positions. We  divided the remaining agencies into two groups: large agencies with more  than 100 political appointees and small agencies with fewer than 100  political appointees. To ensure we observed a range of practices, we  selected a large agency with no recommendations in its most recent OGE  program review\u2014the Department of Health and Human Services and an  agency with multiple unaddressed recommendations from its most recent  OGE program review\u2014the Department of the Interior.", "To select our final case study, we used human resources data from  OPM\u2019s FedScope tool to determine the number of employees at each  agency as of September 2017. We limited our selection to noncabinet  agencies with between 2,000 and 10,000 employees. Out of the four  remaining agencies, we randomly selected the Small Business  Administration.", "To evaluate the extent to which the three reviewed agencies have and  use appropriate internal controls to reasonably ensure that the objectives  of their ethics programs are achieved, we reviewed selected principles  from Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government based on  our review, analysis and professional judgment as to which were relevant  to effectively execute an executive branch ethics program. Selected  internal control principles included:", "3.01: Management should establish an organizational structure,  assign responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives;", "4.01: Management should demonstrate a commitment to recruit,  develop, and retain competent individuals;", "10.01: Management should design control activities to achieve  objectives and respond to risks; and", "14.01: Management should internally communicate the necessary  quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.", "Reviewed agencies confirmed that these internal control principles were  relevant to effectively execute their ethics program. We provided each  agency with an identical set of questions based on the selected internal  control principles and components. We used agency responses to  questions and supporting documentation to evaluate whether agencies\u2019  policies and processes to oversee ethics compliance for political  appointees were consistent with the internal control principles.", "We used a nongeneralizable random sampling method to select political  appointees whose documentation we would review for compliance with  certain ethics requirements. Agencies provided data detailing the political  appointees within the agency at any point in time beginning January 20,  2017 and as of January 28, 2018. To assess the reliability of the data, we  asked each agency\u2019s officials about how the data were obtained, where  the data came from, and what steps, if any, they each took to assure the  accuracy and completeness of the data. Officials at each agency  knowledgeable about their data provided responses. Based on those  responses, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to  indicate each agency\u2019s political appointees, with start and end dates, for  use in selecting a sample of appointees at each agency. Within each  agency, we used random sampling to identify up to three PAS appointees  and up to nine non-PAS appointees, including up to three appointees that  separated from the agency during the time frame above. Each case study  agency completed a data collection instrument that identified the  applicable ethics requirements for each selected appointee. Each  agency provided documentation to communicate how those requirements  were met for each appointee. We reviewed the documentation to  determine whether agency internal controls were sufficient to ensure that  certain ethics program requirements were met. In addition, we conducted  interviews with agency ethics officials, as needed, to discuss  documentation provided. We also conducted several interviews with OGE  officials to inform how we developed the data collection instrument and  evaluate appointee compliance in alignment with OGE\u2019s principles and  practices. Our review of political appointees\u2019 documentation was limited to  testing the sufficiency of the agencies\u2019 ethics program processes and  procedures.
